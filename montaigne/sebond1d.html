<h1>Apology for Raymond Sebond</h1>
<h2>by Michel de Montaigne (1588)</h2>
<h2>translated by John Florio (1603)</h2>

<p>Presumption
is our naturall and originall infirmitie. Of all creatures man is
the most miserable and fraile, and therewithall the proudest and disdainfullest.
Who perceiveth and seeth himselfe placed here amidst the filth and mire
of the world, fast-tied and nailed to the worst, most senselesse, and drooping
part of the world, in the vilest corner of the house, and farthest from
heavens coape, with those creatures that are the worst of the three conditions;
and yet dareth imaginarily place himself above the circle of the moon,
and reduce heaven under his feet. It is through the vanitie of the
<br>-----
<hr>THE SECOND BOOKE
&lt;Mont2-159>
<p>same imagination that he dare equall himself to God, that he ascribeth
divine conditions unto himself, that he selecteth and separateth himselfe
from out the ranke of other creatures; to which his fellow-brethren and
compeers he cuts out and shareth their parts, and allotteth them what portions
of meanes or forces he thinkes good. How knoweth he by the vertue
of his understanding the inward and secret motions of beasts? By
what comparison from them to us doth he conclude the brutishnesse be ascribeth
unto them? When I am playing with my cat, who knowes whether she have more
sport in dallying with me than I have in gaming with her? We entertaine
one another with mutuall apish trickes. If I have my houre to begin
or to refuse, so hath she hers. Plato in setting forth the golden
age under Saturne, amongst the chiefe advantages that man had then, reporteth
the communication he had with beasts, of whom enquiring and taking instruction,
he knew the true qualities and differences of every one of them: by and
from whom he got an absolute understanding and perfect wisedome, whereby
he led a happier life than we can doe. Can we have a better proofe
to judge of mans impudency touching beasts? This notable author was
of opinion that in, the greatest part of the corporall forme which nature
hath bestowed on them, she hath only respected the use of the prognostications,
which in his daies were thereby gathered. The defect which hindreth
the communication betweene them and us, why may it not as well be in us
as in them? It is a matter of divination to guesse in whom the fault
is that we understand not one another. For we understand them no
more than they us. By the same reason, may they as well esteeme us
beasts as we them. It is no great marvell if we understand them not:
no more doe we the Cornish, the Welch, or Irish. Yet have some boasted
that they understood them, as Apollonius Thyaneus, Melampus, Tiresias,
Thales, and others. And if it be (as Cosmographers report that there
are nations who receive and admit a dogge

MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>to be their king, it must necessarily follow that they give a certaine
interpretation to his voice and moving. We must note the parity that
is betweene us. We have some meane understanding of their senses,
so have beasts of ours, about the same measure. They flatter and
faune upon us, they threat and entreat us, so doe we them. Touching
other matters, we manifestly perceive that there is a full and perfect
communication amongst them, and that not only those of one same kinde understand
one another, but even such as are of different kindes.
<blockquote>Et mutae pecudes, et denique secla ferarum
<br>Dissimilis fuerunt voces variasqe cluere,
<br>Cum metus aut dolor est, aut eum tam gaudia gliscunt./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>Whole heard's (though dumbe) of beasts, both wild and tame,
<br>Use divers voices, diffrent sounds to frame,
<br>As joy, or griefe, or feare,
<br>Upspringing passions beare.</blockquote>
 By one kinde of barking of a dogge, the horse
knoweth he is angrie; by another voice of his, he is nothing dismaid.
Even in beasts that have no voice at all, by the reciprocall kindnesse
which we see in them, we easily inferre there is some other meane of entercommunication:
their jestures treat, and their motions discourse.
<blockquote>Non alia longe ratione atque ipse videtur
<br>Protrahere ad gestum, pueros infantia lingua/2</blockquote>

<blockquote>No otherwise, then for they cannot speake,
<br>Children are drawne by signes their mindes to breake.</blockquote>
 And why not, as well as our dumbe men dispute,
argue, and tell histories by signes? I have some so ready and so
excellent in it, that (in good sooth) they wanted nothing to have their
meaning perfectly understood. Doe we not daily see lovers with the
lookes and rowling of their eyes, plainly show when they are angrie or
pleased, and how they entreat and thanke one another, assigne meetings,
and expresse any passion?

<blockquote>El silentio ancor suole
<br>Haver prieghi e parole.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Silence also hath a way,
<br>Words and prayers to convay.</blockquote>
 What doe we with our hands? Doe we not sue
and entreat, promise and performe, call men unto us 'and discharge them,
bid them farewell and be gone, threaten, pray, beseech, deny, refuse, demand,
admire, number, confesse, repent, feare, bee ashamed, doubt, instruct,

reconcile, recommend, exalt, shew gladnesse, rejoyce, complaine, waile,
sorrow, discomfort, dispaire, cry out, forbid, declare silence and astonishment:
and what not? with so great variation and amplifying as if they would contend
with the tongue. And with our head doe we not invite and and call
to us, discharge and send away, avow, disavow, honour, worship, disdaine,
demand, direct, rejoyce, affirme, deny, complaine, cherish, blandish, chide,
yeeld, submit, brag, boast, threaten, exhort, warrant, assure, and enquire?
What doe we with our eye- lids? and with our shoulders? To conclude,
there is no motion nor jesture that doth not speake, and speakes in a language
very easie, and without any teaching to be understood: nay, which is more,
it is a language common and publike to all: whereby it followeth (seeing
the varietie and severall use it hath from others) that this must rather
he deemed the proper and peculiar speech of humane nature. I omit
that which necessitie in time of need doth particularly instruct and suddenly
teach such as need it; and the alphabets upon fingers, and grammars by
jestures; and the sciences which are onely exercised and expressed by them:
and the nations Plinie reporeth to have no other speech. An Ambassador
of the Citie of Abdera, after he had talked a long time unto Agis, King
of Sparta, said thus unto him: 'O King, what answer wilt thou that I beare
backe unto our citizens? 'Thus (answered he) that
<hr>&lt;Mont2-162>
MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>I have suffered thee to speake all thou wouldst, and as long as thou
pleasedst, without ever speaking one word. Is not this a kind of
speaking silence, and easie to be understood? And as for other matters;
what sufficiency is there in us that we must not acknowledge from the industry
and labours of beasts? Can there be a more formall and better ordained
policie, divided into so severall charges and offices, more constantly
entertained, and better maintained, than that of Bees? Shall we imagine
their so orderly disposing of their actions, and managing of their vocations,
have so proportioned and formall a conduct without discourse, reason, and
forecast?

<br>Esse apibus partem divinae mentis, et haustus

 The Swallowes which, at the approach of springtime,
we see to pry, to search, and ferret all the corners of our houses; is
it without judgement they seeke, or without discretion they chuse from
out a thousand places, that which is fittest for them to build their nest
andlodging? And in that prety cunning contexture and admirable framing
of their houses, would birds rather fit themselves with a round than a
square figure, with an obtuse than a right angle, except they knew both
the commodities and effects of them? Would they (suppose you) first
take water and then clay, unlesse they guessed that the hardnesse of the
one is softened by the moistnesse of the other? Would they floore
their palace with mosse or downe, except they foresaw that the tender parts
of their young ones shall thereby be more soft and easie? Would they
shroud and shelter themselves from stormy weather, and build their cabbins
towards the East,

<p>unlesse they knew the different conditions of winds, and considered
that some are more healthfull and safe for them than some others?
Why doth the Spider spin her artificiall web thicke in one place and thin
in another? And now useth one, and then another knot, except she had an
imaginary kinde of deliberation, fore-thought, and conclusion? We
perceive by the greater part of their workes what excellency beasts have
over
us, and how weake our art and short our cunning is, if we goe about to
imitate them. We see, notwithstanding, even in our grosest works,
what faculties we employ in them, and how our minde employeth the uttermost
of her skill and forces in them: why should wee not thinke as much of them?
Wherefore doe we attribute the workes which excell whatever we can performe,
either by nature or by art, unto a kinde of unknowne, naturall, and servile
inclination? Wherein unawares wee give them a great advantage over
us, to infer that nature, led by a certaine loving kindnesses leadeth and
accompanieth them (as it were by the hand) unto all the actions and commodities
of their life; and that she forsaketh and leaveth us to the hazard of fortune;
and by art to quest and finde out those things that are behovefull and
necessarie for our preservation: and therewithall demeth us the meanes
to attaine by any institution and contention of spirit to the naturall
sufficiency of brute beasts: So that their brutish stupidity doth
in all commodities exceed whatsoever our divine intelligence can effect.
Verily, by this account, wee might have just cause and great reason to
terme her a most injust and partiall step-dame: But there is no such
thing, our policy is not so deformed and disordered. Nature hath
generally imbraced all her creatures: And there is not any but she
hath amply stored with all necessary meanes for the preservation of their
being. For the daily plaints, which I often heare men (when the licence
of their conceits doth sometimes raise them above the clouds, and then
headlong tumble them downe even to the Antipodes),

on the bare earth, fast bound and swathed, having nothing to cover and
arme himselfe withall but the spoile of others; whereas Nature hath clad
and mantled all other creatures, some with shels, some with huskes, with
rindes, with haire, with wooll, with stings, with bristles, with hides,
with mosse, with feathers, with skales, with fleeces, and with silke, according
as their quality might need or their condition require: And hath
fenced and armed them with clawes, with talons, with hoofes, with teeth,
with stings, and with hornes, both to assaile others and to defend themselves:
And hath moreover instructed them in everything fit and requisite for them,
as to swim, to runne, to creepe, to flie, to roare, to bellow, and to sing:
whereas man only (Oh, silly, wretched man) can neither goe, nor speake,
nor shift, nor feed himselfe, unlesse it be to whine and weepe onely, except
hee bee taught.

 Such complaints are false. There is a greater
equality and more uniforme relation in the policy of the world. Our
skin is as sufficiently provided with hardnesse against the injuries of
the weather as theirs. Witnesse divers nations which yet never knew
the use of clothes. Our ancient Gaules were but slightly apparelled,
no more are the Irish-men, our neighbours, in so cold a climate: which
we may better judge by our selves, for all those parts of our bodie we
are pleased to leave bare to winde and wether, are by experience found
able to endure it. If there were any weake part in us which in likely-hood
should seeme to feare cold, it ought to be the stomacke, where digestion
is made. Our forefathers used to have it bare, and our ladies (as
dainty-nice as they be) are many times seene to goe open-breasted, as low
as their navill. The handles and swathes about our children are no more
necessary: and the mothers of Lacedemonia brought up theirs in all liberty
and loosenesse of moving their limbs without swathing or binding.
Our whining, our puling, and our weeping is common to most creatures, and
divers of them are often seene to waile and grone a long time after their
birth, forsomuch as it is a countenance fitting the weaknesse wherein they
feele themselves. As for the use of eating and feeding, it is in
us, as in them, naturall and without teaching.
<blockquote>Sentit enim vim quisque suam quam possit abuti./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>For every one soone-understanding is
<br>Of his owne strength, which he may use amisse.</blockquote>
 Who will make question that a child having attained
the strength to feed himselfe, could not quest for his meat and shift for

<p>labour or tilling doth sufficiently produce and offer him as much as
he shall need. And if not at all times, no more doth she unto beasts;
witnesse the provision wee see the ants and other silly creatures to make
against the cold and barren seasons of the yeare. The nations that
have lately bin discovered, so plenteously stored with all manner of naturall
meat and drinke, without care or labor, teach us that bread is not our
onely food: and that without toyling our common mother nature hath with
great plentie stored us with whatsoever should be needfull for us, yea,
as it is most likely, more richly and amply than now adaies she doth, that
we have added so much art unto it.

 The gluttonous excesse and intemperate lavishnesse

We have more severall motions of limbs, and naturally without reaching:
we reape more serviceable nse of them than they doe. Those which
are trained up to fight naked, are seene head long to cast themselves into
the same hazards and dangers as we doe. If some beasts excell us
in this advantage, we exceed many others: and the industrie to enable the
skill to fortifie and the wit to shelter and cover our body by artificiall
meanes, we have it by a kinde of naturall intinct and teaching. Which
to prove, the elephant doth whet and sharpen his teeth

<p>he useth in warre (for he hath some he only useth for that purpose)
which he heedfully spareth and never puts them to other service:
When buls prepare themselves to fight, and they raise, scatter, and with
their feet cast the dust about them: the wilde boare whets his tusks; when
the Ichneumon is to grapple with the crocodile, he walloweth his body in
the mire, then lets the same drie and harden upon him, which he doth so
often that at last the same becomes as hard and tough as well as any compact
crust, which serveth him in stead of a cuirace. Why shall we not
say that it is as naturall for us to arme our selves with wood and yron?
As for speech, sure it is that if it be not naturall it is not necessary.
I beleeve, neverthelesse, that if a childe, bred in some uncouth solitarinesse,
farre from haunt of people (though it were a hard matter to make triall
of it) would no doubt have some kinde of words to expresse, and speech
to utter his conceits. And it is not to be imagined that nature hath refused
us that meane and barred us that helpe which she hath bestowed upon many
and divers other creatures: for what is that faculty we see in them when
they seeme to complaine, to rejoice, to call one unto another for helpe,
and bid one another to loving conjunction (as commonly they doe) by the
use of their voice, but a kind of speech? And shall not they speake
among themselves that speake and utter their minde unto us and we to them?
How many waies speake we unto our dogges, and they seeme to understand
and answer us? With another language and with other names speake
we unto and call them than we doe our birds, our hogges, our oxen, our
horses, and such like; and according to their different kindes we change
our idiome.

Me seemeth that Lactantius/1 doth not onely attribute speech unto
beasts, but also laughing. And the same difference of tongue, which
according to the diversitie of countries is found amongst us, is also found
amongst beasts of one same kinde. Aristotle to that purpose alleageth
the divers calles or purres of partriges, according to the situation of
their place of breeding.

 But it would be knowne what language such a child
should speake, and what some report by divination hath no great likelyhood.
And if against this opinion a man would alleage unto me that such as are
naturally deafe, speake not at all: I answer that it is not onely
because they could not receive the instruction of the world by their eares,
but rather inasmuch as the sense of hearing, whereof they are deprived,
hath some affinity with that of speaking, both which with a naturall kinde
of ligament or seame hold and are fastned together. In such sort
as what we speake we must first speake it unto our selves, and before we
utter and send the same forth to strangers we make it inwardly to sound
unto our eares. I have said all this to maintaine the coherency and
resemblance that is in all humane things, and to bring us unto the generall
throng. We are neither above nor under the rest: what ever is under the
coape of heaven (saith the wise man) runneth one law, and followeth one
fortune.

Man must be forced and marshalled within the lists of this policie.
Miserable man, with all his wit, cannot in effect goe beyond it: he is
embraced and engaged, and as other creatures of his ranke are, he is subjected

and what ever privilege he assume unto himselfe, he is of very meane condition.<a NAME="Yahoo1"></a><b><a href="#Yahoo2">{Yahoo+</a></b>}
That which is given by opinion or fantasie hath neither body nor taste.
And if it be so that he alone, above all other creatures, hath this liberty
of imagination and this licence of thoughts which represent unto him both
what:is and what is not, and what him pleaseth, falsehood and truth; it
is an advantage bought at a very high rate, and whereof he hath little
reason to glorie: for thence springs the chiefest source of all the mischiefs
that oppresse him, as sinne, sicknesse, irresolution, trouble and despaire.
But to come to my purpose, I say therefore, there is no likelyhood, we
should imagine, the beasts doe the very same things by a naturall inclination
and forced genuitie, which we doe of our freewil and industrie. Of
the very same effects we must conclude alike faculties, and by the richest
effects infer the noblest faculites, and consequently acknowledge that
the same discourse and way we hold in working, the very same, or perhaps
some other better, doe beasts hold. Wherefore shall we imagine that
naturall compulsion in them, that prove no such effect our selves?
Since it is more honourable to be addressed to act, and tyed to worke orderly,

to Divinitie, than regularly to worke and act by and through a casuall

other creatures with naturall gifts, and yeeld those unto them, that so
we may ennoble and Honour our selves with gifts purchased, as me thinketh,
by a very simple humour: for I would prize graces and value gifts that
were altogether mine owne, and naturall unto me, as much as I would those
I had begged, and, with a long prentiship, shifted for. It lyeth
not in our power to obtaine a greater commendation than to be favoured
both of God and Nature. By that reason, the fox, which the inhabitants
of Thrace use when they will attempt to march upon the yce of some frozen
river, and to that end let her go loose afore them, should we see her running
alongst the river side, approch her eare close to the yce, to listen whether
by any farre or neere distance she may heare the noyse or roaring of the
water running under the same, and according as she perceiveth the yce thereby
to be thicke or thinne, to goe either forward or backward; might not we
lawfuify judge that the same discourse possesseth her head as in like case
it would ours? And that it is a kinde of debating reason and consequence
drawen from naturall sense? Whatsoever maketh a noyse moveth, whatsoever
moveth is not frozen, whatsoever is not frozen is liquid, whatsoever is
liquid yeelds under any weight? For to impute that only to a quicknesse
of the sense of hearing, without discourse or consequence, is but a fond
conceipt, and cannot enter into my imagination. The like must be
judged of so many wiles and inventions wherewith beasts save themselves
from the snares and scape the baits we lay to entrap them. And if
we will take hold of any advantage tending to that purpose, that it is
in our power to seize upon them, to employ them to our service, and to
use them at our pleasure; it is but the same oddes we have one upon another.

and contend which of them shal be chosen to bee slaine over her husbands

And yet they have that naturall greater magnanimity, that never lyon was

<p>As that of hooke and line about our angling-rods, so have beasts amongst
themselves. Aristotle reporteth that the cuttle-fish casteth a long
gut out of her throat, which like a line she sendeth forth, and at her
pleasure pulleth it in againe, according as she perceiveth some little
fish come neere her, who being close hidden in the gravell or stronde,
letteth him nible or bite the end of it, and then by little and little
drawes it in unto her, untill the fish be so neere that, with a soudaine
leape, she may catch it. Touching strength, there is no creature
in the world open to so many wrongs and injuries as man: we need not a
whale, an elephant, nor a crocodile, nor any such other wilde beast, of
which one alone is of power to defeat a great number of men; seely lice
are able to make Silla give over his Dictatorship: the heart and life of
a mighty and triumphant emperor is but the break-fast of a seely little
worme. Why say we that skill to discerne and knowledge to make choyce
(gotten by art and acquired by discourse) of things good for this life,
and availfull against sicknesse, and to distinguish of those which are
hurtfull, and to know the vertue of reubarb, qualitie of oake ferne and
operation of polipodie, is only peculiar unto man? When we see the
Goats of Candia being shot with an arrow to choose from out a million of
simples the herb Dittany or Garden-ginger, and there-with cure themselves;
and the Tortoise having eaten of a Viper immediately to seek for Origon
or wild Marjoram to purge herselfe: the Dragon to run and cleare his eies
with Fenel: Cranes with their bils to minister glisters of sea-water
unto themselves; the Elephants to pull out, not only from themselves and
their fellowes, but also from their masters (witnesse that of King Porus,
whom Alexander defeated) such javelins or darts as in fight have beene
hurled or shot at them, so nimbly and so cunningly as ourselves could never
do it so easily and with so little paine: Why say wee not likewise
that that is science and prudence in them? For, if to depress them
some would alleage it is by the onely instruction and instinct of Nature
they

MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>know it, that will not take the name of science and title of prudence
from them; it is rather to ascribe it unto them than unto us for the honour
of so assured a schoole-mistris. Chrysippus, albeit in other things
as disdainfull a judge of the condition of beasts as any other Philosopher,
considering the earliest movings of the dog, who comming into a path that
led three severall wayes in search or quest of his Master, whom he had
lost, or in pursuit of some prey that hath escaped him, goeth senting first
one way and then another, and having assured himself of two, because he
findeth not the tracke of what he hunteth for, without more adoe furiously
betakes himselfe to the third; he is enforced to confesse that such a dog
must necessarily discourse thus with himselfe, 'I have followed my Masters
footing hitherto, hee must of necessity pass by one of these three wayes;
it is neither this nor that, then consequently hee is gone this other.
And by this conclusion or discourse assuming him selfe, comming to the
third path, hee useth his sense no more, nor sounds it any longer, but
by the power of reason suffers himselfe violently to be carried through
it. This meere logicall tricke, and this use of divided and conjoyned.
propositions, and of the sufficient numbring of parts: is it not as good
that the dog know it by him selfe, as by Trapezuntius his logicke?
Yet are not beasts altogether unapt to be instructed after our manner.
We teach Blacke-birds, Starlins, Ravens, Piots, and Parots to chat; and
that facilitie we perceive in them to lend us their voyce so supple and
their wind so tractable, that so wee may frame and bring it to a certaine
number of letters and silables, witnesseth they have a kinds of inward
reason which makes them so docile and willing to learne. I thinke
every man is cloied and wearied with seeing so many apish and mimmike trickes
that juglers teach their Dogges, as the dances, where they misse not one
cadence of the sounds or notes they heare: Marke but the divers turnings
and severall kinds of motions which by the commandement of their bare words
they make them performe: But I wonder
<hr>THE SECOND BOOKE

<p>not a little at the effect, which is ordinary amongst us; and that is,
the dogs which blind men' use, both in Citie and in Country: I have
observed how sodainly they will stop when they come before some doores
where they are wont to receive alms: how carefully they will avoyd the
shocke of Carts and Coaches, even when they have roome enough to passe
by themselves. I have seene some going along a Towne-ditch leave
a plaine and even path and take a worse, that so they might draw their
Master from the ditch. How could a man make the dog conceive his charge
was only to looke to his masters safetie, and for his service to despise
his own commoditie and good? And how should he have the knowledge
that such a path would be broade enough for him, but not for a blind man?
Can all this he conceived without reason? We must not forget what
Plutarke affirmeth to have seene a dog in Rome doe before the Emperour
Vespasian the father in the Theatre of Marcellus. This Dog served
a jugler, who was to play a fiction of many faces and sundry countenances,
where he also was to act a part. Amongst other things he was for
a long while to counterfeit and faine himself dead, because he had eaten
of a certain drugge: having swallowed a piece of bread, which was supposed
to be the drug, he began sodainly to stagger and shake as if he had beene
giddie, then stretching and laying himselfe along as stiffe as if hee were
starke dead, suffered himself to be dragged and haled from one place to
another, according to the subject and plot of the play, and when he knew
his time, first he began faire and softly to stirre as if he were roused
out of a dead slumber, then lifting up his head hee looked and stared so
gastly that all the bystanders were amazed. The Oxen, which in the
Kings gardens of Susa were taught to water them and to draw water out of
deepe wells, turned certaine great wheeles, to which were fastned great
buckets (as in many places of Languedoke is commonly seene) and being every
one appointed to draw just a hundred turnes a day, they were so accustomed
to that number as it was impossible by any
<hr>&lt;Mont2-176>
MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>compulsion to make them draw one more, which taske ended they would
suddenly stop. We are growne striplings before we can tell a hundred;
and many nations have lately beene discovered that never knew what numbers
meant. More discourse is required to teach others than to be taught.
And omitting what Democritus judged and proved, which is, that beasts have
instructed us in most of our Arts: As the Spider to weave and sew,
the Swallow to build, the Swan and the Nightingale musicke, and divers
beasts, by imitating them, the art of Physicke: Aristotle is of opinion
that Nightingales teach their young ones to sing, wherein they employ both
long time and much care: whence it followeth that those which we keepe
tame in cages and have not had leasure to go to their parents schoole,
lose much grace in their singing. Whereby we may conclude they are
much amended by discipline and study. And amongst those that run
wilde, their song is not all one nor alike. Each one hath learnt
either better or worse, according to his capacity. And so jealous
are they in their prentiseship, that to excell one another they will so
stoutly contend for the mastery that many times such as are vanquished
die; their winde and strength sooner failing than their voice. The
young ones wil very sadly sit recording their lesson, and are often seene
labouring how to imitate certaine song-notes: The Scholler listeneth
attentively to his Masters lesson, and carefully yeeldeth account of it;
now one and then another shall hold his peace: Marke but how they
endevour to amend their faults, and how the elder striveth to reprove the
youngest. Arrius protesteth to have seene an Elephant who on every
thigh had a cimball hanging and one fastned to his truncke, at the sound
of which all other Elephants danced in a round, now rising aloft, then
lowting full low at certaine cadences, even as the instrument directed
them, and was much delighted with the harmony. In the great showes
of Rome Elephants were ordinarily seene, taught to move and dance at the
sound of a voice, certaine dances, wherein
<hr>THE SECOND BOOKE
&lt;Mont2-177>
<p>were many strange shifts, enterchanges, caprings, and cadences, very
hard to be learned. Some have beene noted to konne and practise their
lessons, using much study and care, as being loath to be chidden and beaten
of their masters. But the tale of the piot is very strange, which
Plutarke confidently witnesseth to have seene: 'This jay was in a Barbers
shop of Rome, and was admirable in counterfeiting with her voice whatsoever
she heard: It fortuned one day that certaine Trumpeters staied before
this shop and there sounded a good while; and being gone, all that day
and the next after the piot began to be very sad, silent, and melancholy,
whereat all men marvelled, and surmized that the noise or clang of the
trumpets had thus affrighted and dizzied her, and that with her hearing
she had also lost her voice. But at last they found she was but in a deep
study and dumpish, retracting into herself, exercising her minde, and preparing
her voice to represent the sound, and expresse the noise of the Trumpets
she had heard. And the first voice she uttered was that wherein she
perfectly expressed their straines, their closes, and their changes: having
by her new prentiship altogether quit, and as it were scorned whatever
she could prattle before. I will not omit to alleage another example of
a Dogge, which Plutarke also saith to have seen (as for any order or method
I know very well I do but confound it, which I observe no more in ranging
these examples than I doe in all the rest of my business), who being in
a ship, noted that his Dogge was in great perplexity how to get some Oyle
out of a deepe Pitcher, which by reason of its narrow mouth he could not
reach with his tongue, got him presently some Pibble stones, and put so
many into the jarre that he made the Oyle come up so neare the brimme as
he could easily reach and licke some. And what is that but the effect
of a very subtill spirit? It is reported that the ravens of Barbary
will doe the like, when the water they would drinke is too low. This
action doth somewhat resemble that which Juba, a King of that Nation, relateth
of their elephants;
<hr>&lt;Mont2-178>
MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>that when through the wiles of those that chase them, anyone chanceth
to fall into certaine deep pits which they prepare for them, and to deceive
them they cover over with reeds, shrubs, and boughes, his fellowes will
speedily with all diligence bring great store of stones and peeces of timber
that so they may helpe to recover him out againe. But this beast
hath in many other effects such affinity with man's sufficiency, that would
I particularly trace out what experience hath taught, I should easily get
an affirmation of what I so ordinarily maintaine, which is, that there
is more difference found betweene such and such a man, than betweene such
a beast and such a man. An Elephants keeper in a private house of
Syria was wont every meale to steele away halfe of the allowance which
was allotted him; it fortuned on a day his master would needs feed him
himselfe, and having poured that just measure of barley which for his allowance
he had prescribed for him, into his manger, the elephant, sternely eying
his master, with his truncke divided the provender in two equal parts,
and laid the one aside, by which he declared the wrong his keeper did him.
Another having a keeper, who to encrease the measure of his provender was
wont to mingle stones with it, came one day to the pot which with meat
in it for his keepers dinner was seething over the fire, and filled it
up with ashes. These are but particular effects, but that which all
the world hath seene, and all men know, which is, that in all the armies
that came out of the East, their chiefest strength consisted in their elephants,
by whom they reaped, without comparison, farre greater effects than now
adaies we do by our great ordnance, which in a manner holds their place
in a ranged battel (such as have any knowledge in ancient histories may
easily guesse it to be true).
<blockquote> -----si quidem Tyrio servire

<blockquote>Their elders usde great Hannibal to steed

<br>And on their backe to beare strong guarding Knights,

 A man must needs rest assured of the confidence
they had in these beasts, and of their discourse, yeelding the front of
a battel unto them; where the least stay they could have made, by reason
of their hugenesse and weight of their bodies, and the least amazement
that might have made them turne head upon their owne men, had bin sufficient
to lose all. And few examples have been noted that ever it fortuned
they turned upon their owns troupes, whereas we head-long throng one upon
another, and so are put to rout. They had charge given them, not
onely of one simple moving, but of many and severall parts in the combat.
As the<a NAME="Spaniards1"></a><b> Spaniards+</b> did to their dogges
in their new<a NAME="conquest_of_the_Indias1"></a><b> conquest_of_the_Indias+</b>,
to whom they gave wages and imparted their booties, which beasts shewed
as much dexteritie in pursuing and judgement in staying their victorie,
in charging or retreating, and, as occasion served, in distinguishing their
friends from their enemies, as they did earnestnesse and eagerness.
We rather admire and consider strange than common things, without which
I should never so long have ammused my selfe about this tedious catalogue.
For, in my judgement, he that shall meerly check what we ordinarily see
in those beasts that live amongst us shall in them flnde as wonderful effects
as those which with so much toile are collected in far countries and passed
ages. It is one same nature which still doth keepe her course.
He that throughly should judge her present estate might safely conclude
both what shall happen and what is past. I have seen amongst us men
brought by sea from distant countries, whose language, because we could
in no wise understand, and that their fashions, their countenance, and
their clothes did altogether differ from ours, who of us did not deem them
brutish and<a NAME="savage1"></a><b> savage+</b>? Who did not impute
their mutenesse into stupiditie or beastlines, and to see them
<hr>&lt;Mont2-180>
MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>ignorant of the French tongue, of our kissing the hands, of our low-lowting
courtesies, of our behaviour and carriage, by which without contradiction,
humane nature ought to take her patterne? Whatsoever seemeth strange
unto us, and we understand not, we blame and condemne.<a NAME="otherphobia1"></a><b>{otherphobia+</b>}
The like befalleth us in our judging of beasts. They have diverse
qualities, which somewhat simbolize witih ours, from which we may comparatively
draw some conjecture, but of such as are peculiar unto them what know we
what they are? Horses, dogges, oxen, sheepe, birds, and the greater
number of sensitive creatures that live amongst us, know our voyce, and
by it suffer themselves to be directed. So did the lamprey which
Crassus had, and came to him when he called it: so do the eeles that breed
in Arethusa's fountains. And my selfe have seene some fish-ponds
where at a certaine crie of those that kept them, the fish would presently
come to shoare, where they were wont to be fed.
<blockquote> ------ nomen habent, et ad magistri
<br>Vocem quisque sui venit citatus./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>They have their proper Dames, and every one
<br>Comes at his master's voyce, as call'd upon.</blockquote>
 By which we may judge and conclude that elephants
have some apprehension of religion, forsomuch as after diverse washings
and purificttions, they are seene to lift up their truncke as we doe our
armes, and at certaine houres of the day, without any instruction, of their
owne accord, holding their eyes fixed towards the sunne-rising, fall into
a long meditating contemplation; yet, because we see no such appearance
in other beasts, may wee rightly conclude that they are altogether void
of religion, and may not take that ill payment which is hidden from us.
As we perceive something in that action which the Philosopher Cleanthes
well observed, because it somewhat draws neere unto ours. He saw
(as himselfe reporteth) a company of emmets goe from their nest, hearing
amongst them the body of a dead -----1 MART. 1. iv. Epig. XXX.
6.
<hr>THE, SECOND BOOKE
&lt;Mont2-181>
<p>ant, toward another emmets nest, from which many other ants came, as
it were to meet them by the way to parly with them, who after they had
continued together awhile, they which came last, returned backe to consult
(as you may imagine) with their fellow-citizens, and because they could
hardly come to any capitulation, they made two or three voyages to and
fro. In the end, the last come brought unto the other a worme from
their habitation, as for a ransome of the dead, which worme the first company
tooke upon their backes, and carried it home, leaving the dead body unto
the other. Loe, here the interpretation that Cleanthes gave it:
Witnessing thereby that those creatures which have no voice at all, have
neverthelesse mutual commerce and enterchangeable communication, whereof
if we be not partakers, it is onely our fault; and therefore doe we fondly
to censure it. And they yet produce divers other effects, farre surpassing
our capacity, and so farre out of the reach of our mutation that even our
thoughts are unable to conceive them. Many hold opinion that in the
last and famous sea-fight which Antonie lost against Augustus, his admiral-galley
was in her course staied by that little fish the Latines call Remora, and
the English a Suck-stone, whose property is to stay any ship he can fasten
himselfe unto. And the Emperour Caligula, sailing with a great fleet
along the coast of Romania, his owne galley was suddenly staied by such
a fish, which he caused to be taken sticking fast to the keele, moodily
raging that so little a creature had the power to force both sea and winde,
and the violence of all his oares, onely with her bil sticking to his galley
(for it is a kinde of shellfish) and was much more amazed when he perceived
the fish being brought aboord his ship to have no longer that powerfull
vertue which it had being in the sea. A certaine citizen of Cyzicum,
whilom purchased unto himselfe the reputation to be an excellent mathematician,
because he had learnt the quality of the hedge-hogge, whose property is
to build his hole or denne open diverse waies, and toward severall winds,
<hr>&lt;Mont2-182>
MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>and fore-seeing rising stormes, he presently stoppeth the holes that
way, which thing the foresad citizen heedfully observing, would in the
City foretell any future storm, and what wind should blow. The cameleon
taketh the colour of the place wherein he is. The fish called a pourcontrell,
or manie-feet, changeth him selfe into what colour he lists as occasion
offereth it selfe, that so he may hide himselfe from what he feareth, and
catch what he seeketh for. In the cameleon it is a change preceding
of passion, but in the pourcontrell a change in action; we ourselves doe
often change our colour and alter our countenance through sudden feare,
choler, shame, and such like violent passions, which are wont to alter
the hew of our faces, but it is by the effect of sufferance, as in the
cameleon. The jaundise hath power to make us yelow, but it is not in the
disposition of our wils. The effects we perceive in other creatures,
greater than ours, witnesse some more excellent faculty in them, which
is concealed from us; as it is to be supposed diverse others of their conditions
and forces are, whereof no appearance or knowledge commeth to us.
Of all former predictions, the ancientest and most certaine were such as
were drawen from the flight of birds; we have nothing equall unto it, nor
so admirable. The rule of fluttering, and order of shaking their
wings, by which they conjecture the consequences of things to ensue, must
necessarily be directed to so noble an operation by some excellent and
supernaturall meane. For it is a wresting of the letter to attribute
so wondrous effects to any naturall decree, without the knowledge, consent,
or discourse of him that causeth and produceth them, and is a most false
opinion, which to prove, the torpedo or cramp-fish hath the property to
benumme and astonish, not onely the limbs of those that touch it, but also
theirs that with any long pole or fishing line touch any part thereof,
shee doth transmit and convey a kinde If heavie numming into the hands
of those that stirre or handle the same. Moreover, it is averred that if
any matter be cast upon them

&lt;Mont2-183>
<p>the astonishment is sensibly felt to gaine upward, untill it come to
the hands, and even through the water it astonisheth the feeling-sence.
Is not this a wonderfull power? Yet is it not altogether unprofitable
for the Cramp-fish, she both knowes and makes use of it: for to catch prey
she pursueth, she is seene to hide berselfe under the mud, that, other
fishes swimming over her, strucken and benummed with her exceeding coldnesse,
may fall into her clawes. The Cranes, swallowes, and other wandering
birds, changing their abode according to the seasons of the years, shew
evidently the knowledge they have of their fore-divining faculty, and often
put the same in use. Hunters assure us that to chose the best dog,
and which they purpose to keepe from out a litter of other young whelps,
there is no better meane than the damme herselfe: for, if they be removed
from out their kennell, him that she first brings thither againe shall
alwaies prove the best; or if one but encompasse her kennell with fire,
looke which of her whelps she first seeketh to save, is undoubtedly the
best; whereby it appeareth they have a certaine use of prognosticating
that we have not; or else some hidden vertue to judge of their young ones,
different and more lively than ours. The manner of all beasts breeding,
engendering, nourishing, working, moving, living, and dying, being so neere
to ours, what ever we abridge from their moving causes, and adde to our
condition above theirs can no way depart from our reasons discourse.
For a regiment of our health, Physitians propose the example of bats manner
of life and proceeding unto us: for this common saying is alwaies in the
people's mouth:
<blockquote>Tenez chauds les pieds et la teste,
<br>Au demeurant vivez en beste./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>Keep warme ('tis meete) the head and feete:

<p>a certaine disposition of some members fittest for that purpose; nevertheless,
they bid us range our selves unto a brutish situation and disposition,
as most effectuall:

<br>Concipere uxores: quia sic loca sumere possunt,
<br>Pectoribus positis, sublatis semina lumbis./1</blockquote>
 And reject those indiscreet and insolent motions
which women have so luxuriously found out, as hurtfull: conforming them
to the example and use of beasts of their sex, as more modest and considerate.
<blockquote>Nam mulier prohibet se concipere, atgue repugnat,

<br>Atque exposato ciet omni pectore fluctus,
<br>Et enim sulci recta regione viaque

If it be justice to give every one his due, beasts which serve, love, and
defend their benefactors, pursue and outrage strangers, and such as offend
them, by so doing they represent some shew of our justice, as also in reserving
a high kinde of equality in dispensing of what they have to their young
ones. Touching friendship, without all comparison, they professe
it more lively and shew it more constantly than men. Hircanus, a
dog of Lysimachus the King, his master being dead, without eating or drinking,
would never come from off his bed, and when the dead corps was removed
thence he followed it, and lastly flung himself into the fire where his
master was burned. As did also the dogge of one called Pyrrhus, who after
he was dead would never budge from his masters couch, and when he was removed
suffered himselfe to be carried away with him, and at last flung himselfe
into the fire wherein his master was consumed. There are certaine
inclinations of affection which, without counsell of reason, arise sometimes
in us, proceeding of a casuall temerity, which some call sympathie: beasts

<p>capable of it. We see horses take a kinde of acquaintancee one
of another, so that often, traveling by the highway or feeding together,
we have much ado to keep them asunder; wee see them bend and applie their
affections to some of their fellowes colours, as if it were upon a certaine
visage: and when they meet with any such, with signes of joy and demonstration
of good will to joine and accost them, and to hate and shunne some other
formes and colours. Beasts as well as wee have choice in their loves,
and are very nice in chusing of their mates. They are not altogether
void of our extreme and unappeasable jealousies. Lustfull desires
are either naturall and necessary as eating and drinking; or else naturall
and not necessary, as the acquaintance of males and females; or else neither
necessary nor naturall: of this last kinde are almost all mens, for they
are all superfluous and artificiall. It is wonderfull to see with
how little nature will be satisfied, and how little she hath left for us
to be desired. The preparations in our kitchens doe nothing at al
concede her lawes. The Stoikes say that a man might very well sustaine
himselfe with one olive a day. The delicacy of our wines is no part
of her lesson, no more is the surcharge and relishing which we adde unto
our letcherous appetites.

These strange lustfull longings which the ignorance of good, and a false
opinion, have possest us with, are in number so infinite that in a manner
they expell all those which are naturall, even as if there were so many
strangers in a city that should either banish and expell all the naturall
inhabitants thereof, or utterly suppresse their ancient power and authority,
and absolutely usurping the same, take possession of it. Brute beastes
are much more regulare than we, and with more moderation containe themselves
within the compasse which nature hath prescribed them; but not so exactly

<p>but that they have some coherency with our riotous licenciousnesse.
And even as there have beene found, certaine furious longings and unnaturall
desires which have provoked men unto the love of beasts, so have diverse
times some of them beene drawn to love us, and are possessed with monstrous
affections from one kind to another: witnesse the elephant that in the
love of an herb-wife, in the city of Alexandria, was corivall with Aristophanes
the Grammarian, who in all offices pertayning to an earnest woer and passionate
suiter yeelded nothing unto him; for, walking thorow the fruit-market,
he would here and there snatch up some with his truncke, and carry them
unto her: as neere as might be he would never loose the sight of her, and
now and then over her hand put his truncke into her bosome, to feele her
breasts. They also report of a dragon that was exceedingly in love
with a young maiden, and of a goose in the city of Asope which dearely
loved a young childe; also of a ram that belonged to the musitian Glausia.
Do we not daily see munkies ragingly in love with women, and furiously
to pursue them? And certaine other beasts given to love the males

the reverence and manifest the awe some beasts in their marriages beare
unto their kindred; but experience makes us often see the contrary:

 Touching a subtil pranke and witty tricke, is
there any so famous as that of Thales the philosopher's mule, which, laden
with salt, passing thorow a river chanced

&lt;Mont2-187>
<p>to stumble, so that the sacks she carried were all wet, and perceiving
the salt (because the water had melted it to grow lighter, ceased not,
as seene as she came neere any water, together with her load, to plunge
herselfe therein, untill her master, being aware of her craft, commanded
her to be laden with wooll, which being wet became heavier; the mule finding
herselfe deceived, used her former policy no more. There are many
of them that lively represent the visage of our avarice, who with a greedy
kinde of desire endevour to surprise whatsoever comes within their reach,
and though they reap no commodity, nor have any use of it, to hide the
same very curiously. As for husbandry, they exceed us, not onely
in fore-sight to spare and gather together for times to come, but have
also many parts of the skill belonging thereunto. As the ants, when
they perceive their corne to grow mustie and graine to be sowre, for feare
it should rut and putrifie, spread the same abroad before their nests,
that so it may aire and drie. But the caution they use in gnawing,
and prevention they employ in paring their graines of wheat, is beyond
all imagination of mans wit: Because wheat doth not alwaies keep drie nor
wholesome, but moisten, melt, and dissolve into a kind of whey, namely,
when it beginneth to bud, fearing it should turne to seed, and lose the
nature of a storehouse, for their sustenance, the part and gnaw off the
end whereat it wonts to bud. As for<a NAME="warre1"></a><b><a href="#warre2">warre+</a></b>,
which is the greatest and most glorious of all humane actions, I would
faine know if we will use it for an argument of some prerogative, or otherwise
for a testimonie of our imbecilitie and imperfection, as in truth the science
we use to defeat and kill one another, to spoile and utterly to overthrow
our owne kind, it seemeth it hath not much to make it selfe to be wished
for in beasts, that have it not.

<p>and their weight, wee perswade ourselves they are brought forth by some
weighty and important causes; wee are deceived: They are moved, stirred
and removed in their motions by the same springs and wards that we are

out with any of our neighbours, causeth a warre to follow betweene Princes;
the same reason that makes us whip or beat a lackey maketh a Prince (if

Our histories report the earnest pursuit and sharpe chase that some dogges
have made for the death of their masters. King Pirrhus, finding a
dog that watched a dead man, and understanding he had done so three daies
and nights together, commanded the corps to be enterred and tooke the dog
along with himn It fortuned one day, as Pirrbus was surveying the general]
musters of his army the dog perceiving in that multitude the man who had
murthered his maister, loud-barking and with great rage ran furiously upon
him; by which signes he furthered and procured his maisters revenge, which
by way of justice was shortly executed. Even so did the dogge belonging
to Hesiodus, surnamed the wise, having convicted the children of Canister
of Naupactus of the murther committed on his Masters person. Another
Dogge being apointed to watch a Temple in Athens, having perceived a sacrilegious
theefe to carrie away the fairest jewels therein, barked at him so long
as he was able, and seeing he could not awaken the Sextons or temple- keepers,
followed the theefe whither-soever he went; daie-light being come, he kept
himselfe a loof-off, but never lost the sight of him: if he offered him
meat, he utterly refused it; but if any passenger chanced to come by, on
them he fawned, with wagging his taile, and tooke what-ever they offered
him; if the theefe staied to rest himselfe,

<p>he also staied in the same place. The newes of this Dogge being
come to the Temple-keepers, they as they went along, enquiring of the Dogs
haire and colour, pursued his tracke so long that at last they found both
the Dog and the theefe in the Citie of Cromyon, whom they brought backe
to Athens, where for his offence he was severely punished. And the
judges in acknowledgement of the Dogges good office, at the Cities charge
appointed him for his sustenance a certaine daily measure of Corne, and
enjoyned the Priests of the Temple, carefully to looke unto him.
Plutarke affirmeth this storie to be most true, and to have hapned in his
time. Touching<a NAME="gratitude1"></a><b> gratitude+</b> and thankfulnesse
(for me thinks we have need to further this word greatly), this onely example
shall suffice, of which Appion reporteth to have been a spectator himself.
One day (saith he) that the Senate of Rome (to please and recreate the
common people) causd a great number of wilde beasts to be baited, namely
huge great Lions, it so fortuned that there was one amongst the rest, who
by reason of his furious and stately carriage, of his unmatched strength,
of his great limbs, and of his loud and terror-causing roaring, drew all
bystanders eyes to gaze upon him. Amongst other slaves, that in sight
of all the people were presented to encounter with these beasts, there
chanced to be one<a NAME="Androclus1"></a><b> Androclus+</b> of Dacia,
who belonged unto a Roman Lord who had been Consull. This huge Lion,
having eyed him afar off, first made a suddaine stop, as strucken into
a kind of admiration, then with a milde and gentle contenance, as if he
would willingly have taken acquaintance of him), faire and softly approached
unto him: Which done, and resting, assured he was the man he tooke
him for, begun fawningly to wagge his taile, as dogges doe that fawne upon
their newfound masters, and licke the poore and miserable slaves bands
and thighs, who through fears was almost out of his wits and halfe dead.
Androclus at last taking hart of grace, and by reason of the Lions mildnesse
having rouzed up his spirits, and wishly

<p>fixing his eies upon him, to see whether he could call him to remembrance,
it was to all beholders a singular pleasure to observe the love, the joy,
and blandishments each endevored to enter-shew one another. Whereat
the people raising a loud crie, and by their shouting and clapping; of
hands seeming to be much pleased, the Emperour willed the slave to be brought
before him, as desirous to understand of him the cause of so strange and
seld-seene an accident, who related this new and wonderfull storie unto
him. My Master (said he) being Proconsull
in Affrica, forsomuch as he caused me every day to be most cruelly beaten,
and held me in so rigorous bondage, I was constrained, as being wearie
of my life, to run away; and safely to scape from so eminent a person,
and who had so great authoritie in the Countrie, I thought it best to get
me to the desart and most unfrequented wildernesses of that region, with
a full resolution, if I could not compasse the meanes to sustaine my selfe,
to finde one way or other, with violence to make myselfe away. One
day the Sunne about noone- tide became extremely hote, and the scorching
heat thereof intolerable, I fortuned to come unto a wilde unhauted cave,
hidden amongst crags and almost inaccessible, and where imagined no footing
had ever been; therein I hid myselfe. I had not long been there but
in comes this Lion, with one of his pawes sore hurt, and bloody-goared,
wailing for the smart, and groaning for the paine he felt; at whose arrivall
I was much dismaied, but he seeing me lie close-cowering in a corner of
his den, gently made his approaches unto me, holding forth his goared paw
toward me and seemed with shewing the same humbly to sue and suppliantly
to beg for help at my hands. I, moved with ruth, taking it into my
hand, pulled out a great splint which was gotten into it, and shaking off
all feare, first I wrung and crusht his sore, and caused the filth and
matter, which therein was gathered, to come forth; then, as gently as for
my heart I could, I cleansed, wiped, and dried the same. He feeling
<hr>&lt;Mont2-194>
MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>some ease in his griefe, and his paine to cease, still holding his foot
betweene my hands, began to sleep and take some rest. Thence forward
he and I lived together the full space of three yeares in his den, with
such meat as he shifted-for; for what beasts he killed, or what prey soever
he tooke, he ever brought home the better part and shared it with me, which
for want of fire I rotted in the Sunne, and therewith nourished my selfe
all that while. But at last, wearied with this kind of brutish life,
the Lion being one day gone to purchase his wonted prey, I left the place,
hoping to mend my fortunes, and having wandred up and downe three dayes,
I was at last taken by certaine souldiers, which from Africa brought me
into this Citie to my Master againe, who immediately condemned me to death,
and to be devoured by wilde beasts. And as I now perceive, the same
Lion was also shortly after taken, who as you see hath now requited me
of the good turne I did him, and the health which by my meanes he recovered.
Behold here the historie Androclus reported unto the Emperour, which after
he caused to be declared unto all the people, at whose generall request
he was forthwith set at libertie, and quit of his punishment, and by the
common consent of all had the Lion bestowed upon him. Appion saith
further, that Androclus was daily seen to lead the Lion up and downe the
streets of Rome, tied onely with a little twine, and walking from taverne
to taverne, received such money as was given him, who would gently suffer
himseIf to be handled, touched, decked, and strowed with flowers, all over
and over, many saying when they met him: 'Yonder is the Lion that is the
mans hoste, and yonder is the man that is the Lions Physitian. We
often mourne and weepe for the losse of those beasts we love, so doe they
many times for the losse of us.

<p> As some of our nations have wives in common
and some in severall, each man keeping himselfe to his owne, so have some
beasts; yet some there are that observe their marriage with as great respect
as we doe ours. Touching the mutuall societie and reciprocall confederation
which they devise amongst themselves, that so they may be fast combined
together, and in times of need help one another, it is apparant that if
Oxen, Hogs, and other beasts, being hurt by us, chance to crie, all the
heard runnes to aid him, and in his defence will joine all together.
The fish, called of the Latines Scarus, having swallowed the fishers hook,
his fellowes will presently flocke about him, and nible the line in sunder;
and if any of them happen to be taken in a bow-net, some of his fellowes,
turning his head away, will put his taile in at the neck of the net, who
with his teeth fast- bolding the same, never leave him untill they have
pulled him out. The Barbel fishes, if one of them chance to be engaged,
will set the line against their backes, and with a fin they have, toothed
like a sharp saw, presently saw and fret the same asunder. Concerning
particular offices, which we for the benefit of our life draw one from
an other, many like examples are found amongst them. It is assuredly
beleeved that the Whale never swimmeth unlesse she have a little fish going
before her as her vantgard; it is in shape like a Gudgeon, and both the
Latines and we call it the Whale-guide; for she doth ever follow him, suffering
herself as easily to be led and turned by him as the ship is directed and
turned by a sterne: for requitall of which good turne, whereas all things
else, be it beast, fish, or vessell, that comes within the horrible Chaos
of this monstrous mouth, is presently lost and devoured, this little fish
doth safety retire himselfe therein, and there sleepes verie quietly, and
as long as he sleepes the Whale never stirs; but as soone as he awaketh
and goeth his way, wherever he takes his course she alwaies followeth him,
and if she fortune to lose him, she wanders here and there, and often striketh
upon the rocks, as a ship that hath nor

MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>mast nor rudder. This Plutarke witnesseth to have seen in the
Iland of Anticyra. There is such a like societie betweene the little
bird called a Wren and the Crocodill; for the Wren serveth as a sentinell
to so great a monster: And if the Ichneumon, which is his mortall
enemie, approach to fight with him, the little birdlet, lest he might surprise
him whilst he sleepeth, with his singing, and pecking him with his bill,
awakens him, and gives him warning of the danger he is in. The bird
liveth by the scraps, and feedeth upon the leavings of that monster, who
gently receiveth him into his mouth, and suffers him to pecke his jawes
and teeth for such mamokes of flesh as sticke betweene them: and if he
purpose to close his mouth, he doth first warne him to be gone, faire and
easie closing it by little and little, without any whit crushing or hurting
him. The shell-fish called a nacre liveth even so with the pinnotere,
which is a little creature like unto a crabfish, and as his porter or usher
waits upon him, attending the opening of the nacre, which he continually
keepes gaping until he see some little fish enter in, fit for their turne,
then he creepes into the nacre, and leaves not pinching his quicke flesh
untill he makes him close his shell, and so they both together, fast in
their hold, devour their prey. In the manner of the tunnies life may be
discovered a singular knowledge of the three parts of the mathematikes.
First for astrologie, it may well be said that man doth learne it of them:
for wheresoever the winter Solstitium doth take them, there do they stay
themselves, and never stir till the next Equinoctium, and that is the reason
why Aristotle doth so willingly ascribe that art unto them: then for geometric
and arithmetike, they alwaies frame their shole of a cubike figure, every
way square: and so forme a solide close and well-ranged battalion, encompassed
round about of six equall sides. Thus orderly marshaled, they take
their course and swim whither their journey tends, as broad and wide behind
as before: so that he that seeth and telleth but one ranke, may easily

presented a stag, then a wilde boare, and then a beare, with each of which
he should have foughten, but he seemed to make no accompt of them, and
would not so much as remove out of his place for them; but when he saw
a lion, he presently rouzed himselfe, shewing evidently he meant onely
so noble a beast worthie to enter combat with him. Concerning repentance
and acknowledging of faults committed, it is reported that an elephant,
having, through rage of choler, slaine his governour, conceived such an
extreme inward griefe that he would never afterward touch any food, and
suffered himselfe to pine to death. Touching clemencie, it is reported
of a tiger (the fiercest and most inhumane beast of all having a kid given
her to feed upon, endured the force of gnawing hunger two daies together
rather than she would hurt him; the third day with maine strength she brake
the cage wherein she was kept pent, and went elsewhere to shift for feeding;
as one unwilling to seize upon the seelie kid, her familiar and guest.
And concerning privileges of familiaritie and sympathie caused by conversation,
is it not oft seen how some make cats, dogs, and hares so tame, so gentle,
and so milde, that, without harming one another, they shall live and continue
together? But that which experience teacheth sea-faring men, especially
those that come into the seas of Sicilie, of the qualitie and condition
of the Halcyon bird, or as some call it alcedo or kings-fisher, exceeds
all mens conceit. In what kinds of creature did ever nature so much prefer
both their hatching, sitting, brooding, and birth? Poets faine that
the Iland of Delos, being before wandring and fleeting up and downe, was
for the delivery of Latona made firme and setled; but Gods decree hath
beene that all the watrie wildernesse should be quiet and made calm, without
raine, wind,

bringeth forth her young ones, which is much about the winter Solstitium,
and shorteest day in the yeare: by whose privilege even in the hart and
deadest time of xinter we have seven calme daies, and as many nights to
saile without any danger. Their hens know no other cocke but their
owne: they never forsake him all the daies of their life; and if the cocke
chance to be weake and crazed, the hen will take him upon her neck and
carrie him with her wheresoever she goeth, and serve him even untill death.
Mans wit could never yet attaine to the full knowledge of that admirable
kind of building or structure which the Halcyon useth in contriving of
her neast, no, nor devise what it is of. Plutarke, who hath seen
and handled many of them, thinkes it to be made of certaine fish-bones,
which she so compacts and conjoyneth together, enterlacing some long and
some crosse- waise, adding some foldings and roundings to it, that in the
end she frameth a round kind of vessel, readie to float and swim upon the
water: which done, she carrieth the same where the sea waves beat most;
there the sea gently beating upon it, shewes her how to daube and patch
up the parts not well closed, and how to strengthen those places and fashion
those ribs that are not fast, but stir with the sea waves: and on the other
side, that which is closely wrought, the sea beating on it, doth so fasten
and conjoyne together, that nothing, no, not stone or yron, can any way
loosen divide, or break the same except with great violence and what is
most to be wondred at is the proportion and figure of the concavitie within;
for it is so composed and proportioned that it can receive or admit no
manner of thing but the bird that built it; for to all things else it is
so impenetrable, close, and hard, that nothing can possibly enter in: no,
not so much as the sea water. Loe here a most plaine description
of this building or construction taken from a verie good author: yet me
thinks it doth not fully and sufficiently resolve us of the difficultie
in this kinde of architecture.

 Those watching-dogs which in their sleep we sometimes
see to grumble, and then barking, to startle suddainly out of their slumber,
as if they perceived some stranger to arive, that stranger which their
minde seemeth to see is but an imaginarie man, and not perceived, without
any dimension, colour, or being:

Touching corporall beauties before I goe any further it were necessarie
I know whether we are yet agreed about her description. It is very
likely that we know not well what beautie either in nature or in generall
is, since we give so many and attribute so divers formes to humane beauties
yea, and to our beautie: Of which if there were any naturall or lively
description, we should generally know it, as we doe the heat of fire.

<blockquote>Turpis Romano Belgicus ore color./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>A Dutch-froes colour hath no grace,
<br>Seen in a Roman Ladies face.</blockquote>
 The Indians describe it blacks and swarthy, with
blabbered- thick lips, with a broad and flat nose, the inward gristle whereof
they loade with great gold rings, hanging downe to their mouth, and their
neather lips with great circlets beset with precious stones, which cover
all their chins, deeming it an especiall grace to shew their teeth to the
roots. In Peru, the greatest eares are ever esteemed the fairest,
which with all art and industrie they are continually stretching out; and
a man (who yet liveth) sweareth to have seen in a Province of the East
Indias the people so carefull to make them great, and so to load them with
heavie jewels, that with ease he could have thrust his arme through one
of their eare-holes. There are other Nations who endevour to make
their teeth as blacke as jeat, and skorne to have them white; and in other
places they die them red. Not onely in the province of Baske, but
in other places, women are accounted fairest when their heads are shaven,
and which is strange, in some of the Northerly frozen-countries, as Plinie
affirmeth. Those of Mexico esteems the littlenesse of their foreheads
as one of the chiefest beauties, and whereas they shave their haire over
all their bodie besides, by artificiall meanes they labour to nourish and
make it grow onely in their foreheads; and so love to have great dugs,
that they strive to have their children sucke over their shoulders.
So would we set forth ilfavordnesse. The Italians proportion it big and
plum; the Spaniards spynie and lanke; and amongst us one would bave her
white, another browne, and soft and delicate, another strong and lustie;
some desire wantonnesse and blithnesse, and othersome sturdinesse and

<p>majestie to be joyned with it. Even as the preheminence in beauties
which Plato ascribeth unto the Sphericall figure, the Epicureans refer
the same unto the Piramidall or Square; and say they cannot swallow a God
made round like a bowle. But howsoever it is, nature hath no more
privileged us in that than in other things, concerning her common lawes.
And if we impartially enter into judgement with our selves, we shall finde
that if there be any creature or beast lesse favoured in that than we,
there are others (and that in great numbers) to whom nature hath been more
favourable than to us<i>. A multis animalibus decore vincimur:/1
</i>'We
are excelled in comelinesse, by many living creatures:' Yea, of terrestriall
creatures that live with us. For, concerning those of the Sea, omitting
their figure, which no proportion can containe, so much doth it differ,
both in colour, in neatnesse, in smoothnesse, and in disposition, we must
give place unto them: which in all qualities we must likewise doe to the
eyrie ones. And that prerogative which Poets yeeld unto our upright
stature, looking towards heaven whence her beginning is,
<blockquote>Pronaque cum spectent animalia caetera terram,
<br>Os homini sublime dedit, caelumque videre
<br>Iussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus,/2</blockquote>

<blockquote>Where other creatures on earth looke and lie,
<br>A loftie looke God gave man, had him prie
<br>On heav'n, rais'd his high countenance to the skie,</blockquote>
is meerely poeticall, for there are many little beasts that have their
sight directly, fixed towards heaven: I finde the Camels and the
Estridges necke much more raised and upright than ours. What beasts
have not their face aloft and before, and looke not directly opposite as
we; and in their naturall posture descrie not as much of heaven and earth
as man doth? And what qualities of our corporall constitution, both
in Plato and Cicero, cannot fit and serve a thousand beasts? Such
as most resemble man are the vilest and

<p>filthiest of all the rout: As for outward apparance and true shape
of the visage, it is the Munkie or Ape:
<blockquote>Simia quam similis, turpissima bestia, nobis!/1</blockquote>

<blockquote>An Ape, a most il-favored beast,
<br>How like to us in all the rest?'<a NAME="Yahoo2"></a><b><a href="#Yahoo3">{Yahoo+</a></b>}</blockquote>
as for inward and vitall parts, it is the Hog. Truely, when I consider
man all naked (yea, be it in that sex which seemeth to have and challenge
the greatest share of eye-pleasing beautie) and view his defects, his naturall
subjection, and manifold imperfections, I finde we have had much more reason
to hide and cover our nakednesse than any creature else. We may be
excused for borrowing those which nature had therein favored more than
us, with their beauties to adorne us, and under their spoiles of wooll,
of haire, of feathers, and of silke to shroud us. Let us moreover
observe, that man is the onely creature whose wants offend his owne fellowes,
and he alone that in naturall actions must withdraw and sequester himselfe
from those of his owne kinde. Verely it is an effect worthie consideration,
that the skilfullest masters of amorous dalliaunce appoint for a remedie
of venierian passions a free and full survay of the bodie, which one longeth
and seeks after: and that to coole the longing and aswage the heat of friendship,
one need but perfectly view and thoroughly consider what he loveth.
<blockquote>Ille quod obscaenas in aperto corpore partes
<br>Viderat, in cursu qui fuit, heasit amor./2</blockquote>

<blockquote>The love stood still, that ran in full cariere,
<br>When bare it saw parts that should not appeare.</blockquote>
 And although this remedie may haply proceed from
a squeamish and cold humor, yet it is a wonderfull signe of our imbecillitie
that the use and knowledge should so make us to be cloyd one of an other.
It is not bashfulnesse so much as art and foresight makes our Ladies so
circumspect and unwilling to let us come

 Whereas, in other creatures there is nothing but
we love and pleaseth our senses: so that even from their excrements and
ordure we draw not only dainties to eat, but our richest ornaments and
perfumes. This discourse of beautie toucheth only our common order,
and is not so sacrilegious as it intendeth or dareth to comprehend those
divine, supernaturally and extraordinarie beauties which sometimes are
seen to shine amongst as, even as stars under a corporall and terrestriall
veile. Moreover, that part of natures favours which we impart unto beasts,
is by our owne confession much more advantageous unto them. We assume
unto our selves imaginarie and fantasticall goods, future and absent goods,
which humane capacitie can no way warrant unto her selfe; or some other,
which by the overweening of our owne opinion we falsely ascribe unto our
selves; as reason, honour, and knowledge; and to them as their proper share
we leave the essentiall, the manageable, and palpable goods, as peace,
rest, securitie, innocencie, and health: I say, which is the goodliest
and richest present nature can impart unto us. So that even Stoike
Philosophie dareth to affirme, that if Heraclitus and Pherecydes could
have changed their wisdome with health,'and by that meanes the one to have
rid himselfe of the dropsie and the other of the lowsie- evill, which so
sore tormented them, they would surely have done it: whereby they also
yeeld so much more honor unto wisdom by comparing and counterpeizing the
same

<p>unto health, than they do in this other proposition of theirs, where
they say, that if Circe had presented Vlisses with two kinds of drinke,
the one to turne a wise man into a foole, the other to change a foole into
a wise man, he would rather have accepted that of folly, than have been
pleased that Circe should transforme his humane shape into a beasts.
And they say that Wisdome herselfe would thus have spoken unto him: 'Meddle
not with me, but leave me rather than then shouldst place me under the
shape and bodie of an Asse. What? This great and heavenly wisdom?
Are Phylosophers contented then to quit it for a corporall and earthly
veile? Why then it is not for reasons sake, nor by discourse and
for the soule, we so much excell beasts: it is for the love we beare unto
our beautie, unto our faire hew, and goodly disposition of limbs, that
we reject and set our understanding at naught, our wisdome, and what else
we have. Well, I allow of this ingenious and voluntarie confession
surely they knew those parts we so much labour to pamper to be meere fantasies.
Suppose beasts had all the vertue, the knowledge, the wisdome and sufficiency
of the Stoikes, they should still be beasts; nor might they ever be compared
unto a miserable, wretched, and senseless man. For, when all is done,
whatsoever is not as we are, is not of any worth. And God to be esteemed
of us, must (as we will show anon) draw somewhat neere it. Whereby
it appeareth that it is not long of a true discourse, but of a foolish
hardinesse and selfe-perfuming obstinacie, we prefer ourselves before other
creatures, and sequester our selves from their condition and societie.

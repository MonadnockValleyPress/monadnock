<h1>A Cruel Mistress</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Carew</h2>
<p>
We read of kings and gods that kindly took<br/>
A pitcher fill'd with water from the brook;<br/>
But I have daily tender'd without thanks<br/>
Rivers of tears that overflow their banks.<br/>
A slaughter'd bull will appease angry Jove,<br/>
A horse the Sun, a lamb the god of love,<br/>
But she disdains the spotless sacrifice<br/>
Of a pure heart, that at her altar lies.<br/>
Vesta is not displeased, if her chaste urn<br/>
Do with repaired fuel ever burn;<br/>
But my saint frowns, though to her honour'd name<br/>
I consecrate a never-dying flame.<br/>
Th' Assyrian king did none i' th' furnace throw<br/>
But those that to his image did not bow;<br/>
With bended knees I daily worship her,<br/>
Yet she consumes her own idolater.<br/>
Of such a goddess no times leave record,<br/>
That burnt the temple where she was adored.<br/>

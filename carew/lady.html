<h1>To His Lady</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Carew</h2>
<p>
Ask me no more where Jove bestows,<br/>
When June is past, the fading rose;<br/>
For in your beauties' orient deep,<br/>
These flow'rs, as in their causes, sleep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ask me no more, whither do stray<br/>
The golden atoms of the day;<br/>
For, in pure love, heaven did prepare<br/>
Those powders to enrich your hair.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ask me no more, whither doth haste<br/>
The nightingale, when May is past;<br/>
For in your sweet dividing throat<br/>
She winters, and keeps warm her note.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ask me no more, where those stars light,<br/>
That downwards fall in dead of night;<br/>
For, in your eyes they sit, and there<br/>
Fixed become, as in their sphere.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ask me no more, if east or west,<br/>
The phoenix builds her spicy nest;<br/>
For unto you at last she flies,<br/>
And in your fragrant bosom dies.<br/>
</p>

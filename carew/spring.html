<h1>The Spring</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Carew</h2>
<p>
Now that the winter's gone, the earth hath lost<br/>
Her snow-white robes, and now no more the frost<br/>
Candies the grass, or casts an icy cream<br/>
Upon the silver lake or crystal stream;<br/>
But the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth,<br/>
And makes it tender; gives a sacred birth<br/>
To the dead swallow; wakes in hollow tree<br/>
The drowsy cuckoo, and the humble-bee.<br/>
Now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring<br/>
In triumph to the world the youthful Spring.<br/>
The valleys, hills, and woods in rich array<br/>
Welcome the coming of the long'd-for May.<br/>
Now all things smile, only my love doth lour;<br/>
Nor hath the scalding noonday sun the power<br/>
To melt that marble ice, which still doth hold<br/>
Her heart congeal'd, and makes her pity cold.<br/>
The ox, which lately did for shelter fly<br/>
Into the stall, doth now securely lie<br/>
In open fields; and love no more is made<br/>
By the fireside, but in the cooler shade<br/>
Amyntas now doth with his Chloris sleep<br/>
Under a sycamore, and all things keep<br/>
Time with the season; only she doth carry<br/>
June in her eyes, in her heart January.<br/>

<h1>Disdain Returned</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Carew</h2>
<p>
He that loves a rosy cheek,<br/>
Or a coral lip admires,<br/>
Or from star-like eyes doth seek<br/>
Fuel to maintain his fires;<br/>
As old Time makes these decay,<br/>
So his flames must waste away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But a smooth and steadfast mind,<br/>
Gentle thoughts and calm desires,<br/>
Hearts with equal love combin'd,<br/>
Kindle never-dying fires.<br/>
Where these are not, I despise<br/>
Lovely cheeks, or lips, or eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
No tears, Celia, now shall win<br/>
My resolv'd heart to return;<br/>
I have search'd thy soul within,<br/>
And find nought, but pride, and scorn;<br/>
I have learn'd thy arts, and now<br/>
Can disdain as much as thou.<br/>
Some power, in my revenge, convey<br/>
That love to her I cast away.<br/>
</p>

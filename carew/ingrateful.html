<h1>Ingrateful Beauty Threatened</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Carew</h2>
<p>
Know Celia, since thou art so proud,<br/>
'Twas I that gave thee thy renown;<br/>
Thou hadst, in the forgotten crowd<br/>
Of common beauties, liv'd unknown,<br/>
Had not my verse exhal'd thy name,<br/>
And with it imp'd the wings of fame.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That killing power is none of thine,<br/>
I gave it to thy voice, and eyes;<br/>
Thy sweets, thy graces, all are mine;<br/>
Thou art my star, shin'st in my skies;<br/>
Then dart not from thy borrow'd sphere<br/>
Lightning on him that fix'd thee there.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Tempt me with such affrights no more,<br/>
Lest what I made, I uncreate;<br/>
Let fools thy mystic forms adore,<br/>
I'll know thee in thy mortal state;<br/>
Wise poets that wrapp'd Truth in tales,<br/>
Knew her themselves, through all her veils.<br/>

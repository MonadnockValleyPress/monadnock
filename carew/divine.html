<h1>A Divine Mistress</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Carew</h2>
<p>
In Nature's pieces still I see<br/>
Some error that might mended be;<br/>
Something my wish could still remove,<br/>
Alter or add; but my fair love<br/>
Was fram'd by hands far more divine,<br/>
For she hath every beauteous line:<br/>
Yet I had been far happier,<br/>
Had Nature, that made me, made her.<br/>
Then likeness might (that love creates)<br/>
Have made her love what now she hates;<br/>
Yet I confess I cannot spare<br/>
From her just shape the smallest hair;<br/>
Nor need I beg from all the store<br/>
Of heaven for her one beauty more.<br/>
She hath too much divinity for me:<br/>
You gods, teach her some more humanity.<br/>

<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>December 7, 1856</h3>
<p>That Walt Whitman, of whom I wrote to you, is the most interesting fact to me at present. I have just read his second edition (which he gave me), and it has done me more good than any reading for a long time. Perhaps I remember best the poem of Walt Whitman, an American, and the Sun-Down Poem. There are two or three pieces in the book which are disagreeable, to say the least; simply sensual. He does not celebrate love at all. It is as if the beasts spoke. I think that men have not been ashamed of themselves without reason. No doubt there have always been dens where such deeds were unblushingly recited, and it is no merit to compete with their inhabitants. But even on this side he has spoken more truth than any American or modern that I know. I have found his poem exhilarating, encouraging. As for its sensuality,&mdash;and it may turn out to be less sensual than it appears,&mdash;I do not so much wish that those parts were not written, as that men and women were so pure that they could read them without harm, that is, without understanding them. One woman told me that no woman could read it,&mdash;as if a man could read what a woman could not.  Of course Walt Whitman can communicate to us no experience, and if we are shocked, whose experience is it that we are reminded of?  </p>
<p>On the whole, it sounds to me very brave and American, after whatever deductions. I do not believe that all the sermons, so called, that have been preached in this land put together are equal to it for preaching.</p>
<p>We ought to rejoice greatly in him. He occasionally suggests something a little more than human. You can't confound him with the other inhabitants of Brooklyn or New York. How they must shudder when they read him! He is awfully good.</p>
<p>To be sure I sometimes feel a little imposed on. By his heartiness and broad generalities he puts me into a liberal frame of mind prepared to see wonders,&mdash;as it were, sets me upon a hill or in the midst of a plain,&mdash;stirs me well up, and then&mdash;throws in a thousand of brick. Though rude, and sometimes ineffectual, it is a great primitive poem,&mdash;an alarum or trumpet-note ringing through the American camp. Wonderfully like the Orientals, too, considering that when I asked him if he had read them, he answered, "No: tell me about them."</p>
<p>I did not get far in conversation with him,&mdash;two more being present,&mdash;and among the few things which I chanced to say, I remember that one was, in answer to him as representing America, that I did not think much of America or of politics, and so on, which may have been somewhat of a damper to him.</p>
<p>Since I have seen him, I find that I am not disturbed by any brag or egoism in his book. He may turn out the least of a braggart of all, having a better right to be confident.</p>
<p>He is a great fellow.</p>

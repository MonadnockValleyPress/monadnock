<h1>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers: Thursday</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1849)</h2>


<p>     "He trode the unplanted forest floor, whereon<br/>

     The all-seeing sun for ages hath not shone,<br/>

     Where feeds the moose, and walks the surly bear,<br/>

     And up the tall mast runs the woodpecker.<br/>

          .  .  .  .<br/>

     Where darkness found him he lay glad at night;<br/>

     There the red morning touched him with its light.<br/>

          .  .  .  .<br/>

     Go where he will, the wise man is at home,<br/>

     His hearth the earth,—his hall the azure dome;<br/>

     Where his clear spirit leads him, there's his road,<br/>

     By God's own light illumined and foreshowed."<br/>

                                            <cite>Emerson</cite><br/>
</p>

<p>When we awoke this morning, we heard the faint, deliberate, and ominous sound of rain-drops on our cotton roof.  The rain had pattered all night, and now the whole country wept, the drops falling in the river, and on the alders, and in the pastures, and instead of any bow in the heavens, there was the trill of the hair-bird all the morning.  The cheery faith of this little bird atoned for the silence of the whole woodland choir beside.  When we first stepped abroad, a flock of sheep, led by their rams, came rushing down a ravine in our rear, with heedless haste and unreserved frisking, as if unobserved by man, from some higher pasture where they had spent the night, to taste the herbage by the river-side; but when their leaders caught sight of our white tent through the mist, struck with sudden astonishment, with their fore-feet braced, they sustained the rushing torrent in their rear, and the whole flock stood stock-still, endeavoring to solve the mystery in their sheepish brains.  At length, concluding that it boded no mischief to them, they spread themselves out quietly over the field.  We learned afterward that we had pitched our tent on the very spot which a few summers before had been occupied by a party of Penobscots.  We could see rising before us through the mist a dark conical eminence called Hooksett Pinnacle, a landmark to boatmen, and also Uncannunuc Mountain, broad off on the west side of the river.</p>

<p>This was the limit of our voyage, for a few hours more in the rain would have taken us to the last of the locks, and our boat was too heavy to be dragged around the long and numerous rapids which would occur.  On foot, however, we continued up along the bank, feeling our way with a stick through the showery and foggy day, and climbing over the slippery logs in our path with as much pleasure and buoyancy as in brightest sunshine; scenting the fragrance of the pines and the wet clay under our feet, and cheered by the tones of invisible waterfalls; with visions of toadstools, and wandering frogs, and festoons of moss hanging from the spruce-trees, and thrushes flitting silent under the leaves; our road still holding together through that wettest of weather, like faith, while we confidently followed its lead.  We managed to keep our thoughts dry, however, and only our clothes were wet.  It was altogether a cloudy and drizzling day, with occasional brightenings in the mist, when the trill of the tree-sparrow seemed to be ushering in sunny hours.</p>

<p>"Nothing that naturally happens to man can <em>hurt</em> him, earthquakes and thunder-storms not excepted," said a man of genius, who at this time lived a few miles farther on our road.  When compelled by a shower to take shelter under a tree, we may improve that opportunity for a more minute inspection of some of Nature's works.  I have stood under a tree in the woods half a day at a time, during a heavy rain in the summer, and yet employed myself happily and profitably there prying with microscopic eye into the crevices of the bark or the leaves or the fungi at my feet.  "Riches are the attendants of the miser; and the heavens rain plenteously upon the mountains." I can fancy that it would be a luxury to stand up to one's chin in some retired swamp a whole summer day, scenting the wild honeysuckle and bilberry blows, and lulled by the minstrelsy of gnats and mosquitoes!  A day passed in the society of those Greek sages, such as described in the Banquet of Xenophon, would not be comparable with the dry wit of decayed cranberry vines, and the fresh Attic salt of the moss-beds.  Say twelve hours of genial and familiar converse with the leopard frog; the sun to rise behind alder and dogwood, and climb buoyantly to his meridian of two hands' breadth, and finally sink to rest behind some bold western hummock.  To hear the evening chant of the mosquito from a thousand green chapels, and the bittern begin to boom from some concealed fort like a sunset gun!—Surely one may as profitably be soaked in the juices of a swamp for one day as pick his way dry-shod over sand.  Cold and damp,—are they not as rich experience as warmth and dryness?</p>

<p>At present, the drops come trickling down the stubble while we lie drenched on a bed of withered wild oats, by the side of a bushy hill, and the gathering in of the clouds, with the last rush and dying breath of the wind, and then the regular dripping of twigs and leaves the country over, enhance the sense of inward comfort and sociableness.  The birds draw closer and are more familiar under the thick foliage, seemingly composing new strains upon their roosts against the sunshine.  What were the amusements of the drawing-room and the library in comparison, if we had them here?  We should still sing as of old,—</p>

<p>     My books I'd fain cast off, I cannot read,<br/>

     'Twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large<br/>

     Down in the meadow, where is richer feed,<br/>

     And will not mind to hit their proper targe.<br/>
</p>

<p>     Plutarch was good, and so was Homer too,<br/>

     Our Shakespeare's life were rich to live again,<br/>

     What Plutarch read, that was not good nor true,<br/>

     Nor Shakespeare's books, unless his books were men<br/>
</p>

<p>     Here while I lie beneath this walnut bough,<br/>

     What care I for the Greeks or for Troy town,<br/>

     If juster battles are enacted now<br/>

     Between the ants upon this hummock's crown?<br/>
</p>

<p>     Bid Homer wait till I the issue learn,<br/>

     If red or black the gods will favor most,<br/>

     Or yonder Ajax will the phalanx turn,<br/>

     Struggling to heave some rock against the host.<br/>
</p>

<p>     Tell Shakespeare to attend some leisure hour,<br/>

     For now I've business with this drop of dew,<br/>

     And see you not, the clouds prepare a shower,—<br/>

     I'll meet him shortly when the sky is blue.<br/>
</p>

<p>     This bed of herd's-grass and wild oats was spread<br/>

     Last year with nicer skill than monarchs use,<br/>

     A clover tuft is pillow for my head,<br/>

     And violets quite overtop my shoes.<br/>
</p>

<p>     And now the cordial clouds have shut all in<br/>

     And gently swells the wind to say all's well<br/>

     The scattered drops are falling fast and thin,<br/>

     Some in the pool, some in the flower-bell.<br/>
</p>

<p>     I am well drenched upon my bed of oats;<br/>

     But see that globe come rolling down its stem<br/>

     Now like a lonely planet there it floats,<br/>

     And now it sinks into my garment's hem.<br/>
</p>

<p>     Drip drip the trees for all the country round,<br/>

     And richness rare distils from every bough,<br/>

     The wind alone it is makes every sound,<br/>

     Shaking down crystals on the leaves below.<br/>
</p>

<p>     For shame the sun will never show himself,<br/>

     Who could not with his beams e'er melt me so,<br/>

     My dripping locks,—they would become an elf,<br/>

     Who in a beaded coat does gayly go.<br/>
</p>

<p>The Pinnacle is a small wooded hill which rises very abruptly to the height of about two hundred feet, near the shore at Hooksett Falls.  As Uncannunuc Mountain is perhaps the best point from which to view the valley of the Merrimack, so this hill affords the best view of the river itself.  I have sat upon its summit, a precipitous rock only a few rods long, in fairer weather, when the sun was setting and filling the river valley with a flood of light.  You can see up and down the Merrimack several miles each way.  The broad and straight river, full of light and life, with its sparkling and foaming falls, the islet which divides the stream, the village of Hooksett on the shore almost directly under your feet, so near that you can converse with its inhabitants or throw a stone into its yards, the woodland lake at its western base, and the mountains in the north and northeast, make a scene of rare beauty and completeness, which the traveller should take pains to behold.</p>

<p>We were hospitably entertained in Concord, New Hampshire, which we persisted in calling <em>New</em> Concord, as we had been wont, to distinguish it from our native town, from which we had been told that it was named and in part originally settled.  This would have been the proper place to conclude our voyage, uniting Concord with Concord by these meandering rivers, but our boat was moored some miles below its port.</p>

<p>The richness of the intervals at Penacook, now Concord, New Hampshire, had been observed by explorers, and, according to the historian of Haverhill, in the</p>

<blockquote>  "year 1726, considerable progress was made in the settlement, and a road was cut through the wilderness from Haverhill to Penacook.  In the fall of 1727, the first family, that of Captain Ebenezer Eastman, moved into the place.  His team was driven by Jacob Shute, who was by birth a Frenchman, and he is said to have been the first person who drove a team through the wilderness.  Soon after, says tradition, one Ayer, a lad of 18, drove a team consisting of ten yoke of oxen to Penacook, swam the river, and ploughed a portion of the interval.  He is supposed to have been the first person who ploughed land in that place.  After he had completed his work, he started on his return at sunrise, drowned a yoke of oxen while recrossing the river, and arrived at Haverhill about midnight.  The crank of the first saw-mill was manufactured in Haverhill, and carried to Penacook on a horse."</blockquote>

<p>But we found that the frontiers were not this way any longer.  This generation has come into the world fatally late for some enterprises.  Go where we will on the <em>surface</em> of things, men have been there before us.  We cannot now have the pleasure of erecting the <em>last</em> house; that was long ago set up in the suburbs of Astoria City, and our boundaries have literally been run to the South Sea, according to the old patents.  But the lives of men, though more extended laterally in their range, are still as shallow as ever.  Undoubtedly, as a Western orator said, "Men generally live over about the same surface; some live long and narrow, and others live broad and short"; but it is all superficial living.  A worm is as good a traveller as a grasshopper or a cricket, and a much wiser settler.  With all their activity these do not hop away from drought nor forward to summer.  We do not avoid evil by fleeing before it, but by rising above or diving below its plane; as the worm escapes drought and frost by boring a few inches deeper.  The frontiers are not east or west, north or south, but wherever a man <em>fronts</em> a fact, though that fact be his neighbor, there is an unsettled wilderness between him and Canada, between him and the setting sun, or, farther still, between him and <em>it</em>.  Let him build himself a log-house with the bark on where he is, <em>fronting</em> <em>it</em>, and wage there an Old French war for seven or seventy years, with Indians and Rangers, or whatever else may come between him and the reality, and save his scalp if he can.</p>

<p>We now no longer sailed or floated on the river, but trod the unyielding land like pilgrims.  Sadi tells who may travel; among others, "A common mechanic, who can earn a subsistence by the industry of his hand, and shall not have to stake his reputation for every morsel of bread, as philosophers have said." He may travel who can subsist on the wild fruits and game of the most cultivated country.  A man may travel fast enough and earn his living on the road.  I have at times been applied to to do work when on a journey; to do tinkering and repair clocks, when I had a knapsack on my back.  A man once applied to me to go into a factory, stating conditions and wages, observing that I succeeded in shutting the window of a railroad car in which we were travelling, when the other passengers had failed.  "Hast thou not heard of a Sufi, who was hammering some nails into the sole of his sandal; an officer of cavalry took him by the sleeve, saying, Come along and shoe my horse."  Farmers have asked me to assist them in haying, when I was passing their fields.  A man once applied to me to mend his umbrella, taking me for an umbrella-mender, because, being on a journey, I carried an umbrella in my hand while the sun shone.  Another wished to buy a tin cup of me, observing that I had one strapped to my belt, and a sauce-pan on my back.  The cheapest way to travel, and the way to travel the farthest in the shortest distance, is to go afoot, carrying a dipper, a spoon, and a fish-line, some Indian meal, some salt, and some sugar.  When you come to a brook or pond, you can catch fish and cook them; or you can boil a hasty-pudding; or you can buy a loaf of bread at a farmer's house for fourpence, moisten it in the next brook that crosses the road, and dip into it your sugar,—this alone will last you a whole day;—or, if you are accustomed to heartier living, you can buy a quart of milk for two cents, crumb your bread or cold pudding into it, and eat it with your own spoon out of your own dish.  Any one of these things I mean, not all together.  I have travelled thus some hundreds of miles without taking any meal in a house, sleeping on the ground when convenient, and found it cheaper, and in many respects more profitable, than staying at home.  So that some have inquired why it would not be best to travel always.  But I never thought of travelling simply as a means of getting a livelihood.  A simple woman down in Tyngsborough, at whose house I once stopped to get a draught of water, when I said, recognizing the bucket, that I had stopped there nine years before for the same purpose, asked if I was not a traveller, supposing that I had been travelling ever since, and had now come round again; that travelling was one of the professions, more or less productive, which her husband did not follow.  But continued travelling is far from productive.  It begins with wearing away the soles of the shoes, and making the feet sore, and erelong it will wear a man clean up, after making his heart sore into the bargain.  I have observed that the after-life of those who have travelled much is very pathetic.  True and sincere travelling is no pastime, but it is as serious as the grave, or any part of the human journey, and it requires a long probation to be broken into it.  I do not speak of those that travel sitting, the sedentary travellers whose legs hang dangling the while, mere idle symbols of the fact, any more than when we speak of sitting hens we mean those that sit standing, but I mean those to whom travelling is life for the legs, and death too, at last.  The traveller must be born again on the road, and earn a passport from the elements, the principal powers that be for him.  He shall experience at last that old threat of his mother fulfilled, that he shall be skinned alive.  His sores shall gradually deepen themselves that they may heal inwardly, while he gives no rest to the sole of his foot, and at night weariness must be his pillow, that so he may acquire experience against his rainy days.—So was it with us.</p>

<p>Sometimes we lodged at an inn in the woods, where trout-fishers from distant cities had arrived before us, and where, to our astonishment, the settlers dropped in at nightfall to have a chat and hear the news, though there was but one road, and no other house was visible,—as if they had come out of the earth.  There we sometimes read old newspapers, who never before read new ones, and in the rustle of their leaves heard the dashing of the surf along the Atlantic shore, instead of the sough of the wind among the pines.  But then walking had given us an appetite even for the least palatable and nutritious food.</p>

<p>Some hard and dry book in a dead language, which you have found it impossible to read at home, but for which you have still a lingering regard, is the best to carry with you on a journey.  At a country inn, in the barren society of ostlers and travellers, I could undertake the writers of the silver or the brazen age with confidence.  Almost the last regular service which I performed in the cause of literature was to read the works of</p>

<h5>              AULUS PERSIUS FLACCUS.</h5>

<p>If you have imagined what a divine work is spread out for the poet, and approach this author too, in the hope of finding the field at length fairly entered on, you will hardly dissent from the words of the prologue,</p>

<p>     "Ipse semipaganus<br/>

     Ad sacra Vatum carmen affero nostrum."<br/>
</p>

<p>     I half pagan<br/>

     Bring my verses to the shrine of the poets.<br/>
</p>

<p>Here is none of the interior dignity of Virgil, nor the elegance and vivacity of Horace, nor will any sibyl be needed to remind you, that from those older Greek poets there is a sad descent to Persius.  You can scarcely distinguish one harmonious sound amid this unmusical bickering with the follies of men.</p>

<p>One sees that music has its place in thought, but hardly as yet in language.  When the Muse arrives, we wait for her to remould language, and impart to it her own rhythm.  Hitherto the verse groans and labors with its load, and goes not forward blithely, singing by the way.  The best ode may be parodied, indeed is itself a parody, and has a poor and trivial sound, like a man stepping on the rounds of a ladder.  Homer and Shakespeare and Milton and Marvell and Wordsworth are but the rustling of leaves and crackling of twigs in the forest, and there is not yet the sound of any bird.  The Muse has never lifted up her voice to sing.  Most of all, satire will not be sung.  A Juvenal or Persius do not marry music to their verse, but are measured fault-finders at best; stand but just outside the faults they condemn, and so are concerned rather about the monster which they have escaped, than the fair prospect before them.  Let them live on an age, and they will have travelled out of his shadow and reach, and found other objects to ponder.</p>

<p>As long as there is satire, the poet is, as it were, <em>particeps criminis</em>.  One sees not but he had best let bad take care of itself, and have to do only with what is beyond suspicion.  If you light on the least vestige of truth, and it is the weight of the whole body still which stamps the faintest trace, an eternity will not suffice to extol it, while no evil is so huge, but you grudge to bestow on it a moment of hate.  Truth never turns to rebuke falsehood; her own straightforwardness is the severest correction.  Horace would not have written satire so well if he had not been inspired by it, as by a passion, and fondly cherished his vein.  In his odes, the love always exceeds the hate, so that the severest satire still sings itself, and the poet is satisfied, though the folly be not corrected.</p>

<p>A sort of necessary order in the development of Genius is, first, Complaint; second, Plaint; third, Love.  Complaint, which is the condition of Persius, lies not in the province of poetry.  Erelong the enjoyment of a superior good would have changed his disgust into regret.  We can never have much sympathy with the complainer; for after searching nature through, we conclude that he must be both plaintiff and defendant too, and so had best come to a settlement without a hearing.  He who receives an injury is to some extent an accomplice of the wrong-doer.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be truer to say, that the highest strain of the muse is essentially plaintive.  The saint's are still <em>tears</em> of joy.  Who has ever heard the <em>Innocent</em> sing?</p>

<p>But the divinest poem, or the life of a great man, is the severest satire; as impersonal as Nature herself, and like the sighs of her winds in the woods, which convey ever a slight reproof to the hearer.  The greater the genius, the keener the edge of the satire.</p>

<p>Hence we have to do only with the rare and fragmentary traits, which least belong to Persius, or shall we say, are the properest utterances of his muse; since that which he says best at any time is what he can best say at all times.  The Spectators and Ramblers have not failed to cull some quotable sentences from this garden too, so pleasant is it to meet even the most familiar truth in a new dress, when, if our neighbor had said it, we should have passed it by as hackneyed.  Out of these six satires, you may perhaps select some twenty lines, which fit so well as many thoughts, that they will recur to the scholar almost as readily as a natural image; though when translated into familiar language, they lose that insular emphasis, which fitted them for quotation.  Such lines as the following, translation cannot render commonplace.  Contrasting the man of true religion with those who, with jealous privacy, would fain carry on a secret commerce with the gods, he says:—</p>

<p>     "Haud cuivis promptum est, murmurque humilesque susurros<br/>

     Tollere de templis; et aperto vivere voto."<br/>
</p>

<p>     It is not easy for every one to take murmurs and low<br/>

     Whispers out of the temples, and live with open vow.<br/>
</p>

<p>To the virtuous man, the universe is the only <em>sanctum sanctorum</em>, and the penetralia of the temple are the broad noon of his existence.  Why should he betake himself to a subterranean crypt, as if it were the only holy ground in all the world which he had left unprofaned?  The obedient soul would only the more discover and familiarize things, and escape more and more into light and air, as having henceforth done with secrecy, so that the universe shall not seem open enough for it.  At length, it is neglectful even of that silence which is consistent with true modesty, but by its independence of all confidence in its disclosures, makes that which it imparts so private to the hearer, that it becomes the care of the whole world that modesty be not infringed.</p>

<p>To the man who cherishes a secret in his breast, there is a still greater secret unexplored.  Our most indifferent acts may be matter for secrecy, but whatever we do with the utmost truthfulness and integrity, by virtue of its pureness, must be transparent as light.</p>

<p>In the third satire, he asks:—</p>

<p>     "Est aliquid quo tendis, et in quod dirigis arcum?<br/>

     An passim sequeris corvos, testâve, lutove,<br/>

     Securus quò pes ferat, atque ex tempore vivis?"<br/>
</p>

<p>   Is there anything to which thou tendest, and against which thou<br/>

       directest thy bow?<br/>

   Or dost thou pursue crows, at random, with pottery or clay,<br/>

   Careless whither thy feet bear thee, and live <em>ex tempore</em>?<br/>
</p>

<p>The bad sense is always a secondary one.  Language does not appear to have justice done it, but is obviously cramped and narrowed in its significance, when any meanness is described.  The truest construction is not put upon it.  What may readily be fashioned into a rule of wisdom, is here thrown in the teeth of the sluggard, and constitutes the front of his offence.  Universally, the innocent man will come forth from the sharpest inquisition and lecturing, the combined din of reproof and commendation, with a faint sound of eulogy in his ears.  Our vices always lie in the direction of our virtues, and in their best estate are but plausible imitations of the latter.  Falsehood never attains to the dignity of entire falseness, but is only an inferior sort of truth; if it were more thoroughly false, it would incur danger of becoming true.</p>

<p>     "Securus quo pes ferat, atque ex tempore <em>vivit</em>,"</p>

<p>is then the motto of a wise man.  For first, as the subtle discernment of the language would have taught us, with all his negligence he is still secure; but the sluggard, notwithstanding his heedlessness, is insecure.</p>

<p>The life of a wise man is most of all extemporaneous, for he lives out of an eternity which includes all time.  The cunning mind travels further back than Zoroaster each instant, and comes quite down to the present with its revelation.  The utmost thrift and industry of thinking give no man any stock in life; his credit with the inner world is no better, his capital no larger.  He must try his fortune again to-day as yesterday.  All questions rely on the present for their solution.  Time measures nothing but itself.  The word that is written may be postponed, but not that on the lip.  If this is what the occasion says, let the occasion say it.  All the world is forward to prompt him who gets up to live without his creed in his pocket.</p>

<p>In the fifth satire, which is the best, I find,—</p>

<p>
Stat contrà ratio, et secretam garrit in aurem,<br/>
Ne liceat facere id, quod quis vitiabit agendo."<br/>
</p>

<p>
Reason opposes, and whispers in the secret ear,<br/>
That it is not lawful to do that which one will spoil by doing.<br/>
</p>

<p>Only they who do not see how anything might be better done are forward to try their hand on it.  Even the master workman must be encouraged by the reflection, that his awkwardness will be incompetent to do that thing harm, to which his skill may fail to do justice.  Here is no apology for neglecting to do many things from a sense of our incapacity,—for what deed does not fall maimed and imperfect from our hands?—but only a warning to bungle less.</p>

<p>The satires of Persius are the furthest possible from inspired; evidently a chosen, not imposed subject.  Perhaps I have given him credit for more earnestness than is apparent; but it is certain, that that which alone we can call Persius, which is forever independent and consistent, <em>was</em> in earnest, and so sanctions the sober consideration of all.  The artist and his work are not to be separated.  The most wilfully foolish man cannot stand aloof from his folly, but the deed and the doer together make ever one sober fact.  There is but one stage for the peasant and the actor.  The buffoon cannot bribe you to laugh always at his grimaces; they shall sculpture themselves in Egyptian granite, to stand heavy as the pyramids on the ground of his character.</p>

<p>                           ———</p>

<p>Suns rose and set and found us still on the dank forest path which meanders up the Pemigewasset, now more like an otter's or a marten's trail, or where a beaver had dragged his trap, than where the wheels of travel raise a dust; where towns begin to serve as gores, only to hold the earth together.  The wild pigeon sat secure above our heads, high on the dead limbs of naval pines, reduced to a robin's size.  The very yards of our hostelries inclined upon the skirts of mountains, and, as we passed, we looked up at a steep angle at the stems of maples waving in the clouds.</p>

<p>Far up in the country,—for we would be faithful to our experience,—in Thornton, perhaps, we met a soldier lad in the woods, going to muster in full regimentals, and holding the middle of the road; deep in the forest, with shouldered musket and military step, and thoughts of war and glory all to himself.  It was a sore trial to the youth, tougher than many a battle, to get by us creditably and with soldierlike bearing.  Poor man!  He actually shivered like a reed in his thin military pants, and by the time we had got up with him, all the sternness that becomes the soldier had forsaken his face, and he skulked past as if he were driving his father's sheep under a sword-proof helmet.  It was too much for him to carry any extra armor then, who could not easily dispose of his natural arms.  And for his legs, they were like heavy artillery in boggy places; better to cut the traces and forsake them.  His greaves chafed and wrestled one with another for want of other foes.  But he did get by and get off with all his munitions, and lived to fight another day; and I do not record this as casting any suspicion on his honor and real bravery in the field.</p>

<p>Wandering on through notches which the streams had made, by the side and over the brows of hoar hills and mountains, across the stumpy, rocky, forested, and bepastured country, we at length crossed on prostrate trees over the Amonoosuck, and breathed the free air of Unappropriated Land.  Thus, in fair days as well as foul, we had traced up the river to which our native stream is a tributary, until from Merrimack it became the Pemigewasset that leaped by our side, and when we had passed its fountain-head, the Wild Amonoosuck, whose puny channel was crossed at a stride, guiding us toward its distant source among the mountains, and at length, without its guidance, we were enabled to reach the summit of Agiocochook.</p>

<p>                     ———————-</p>

<p>     "Sweet days, so cool, so calm, so bright,<br/>

     The bridal of the earth and sky,<br/>

     Sweet dews shall weep thy fall to-night,<br/>

                         For thou must die."<br/>

</p>

<p>When we returned to Hooksett, a week afterward, the melon man, in whose corn-barn we had hung our tent and buffaloes and other things to dry, was already picking his hops, with many women and children to help him.  We bought one watermelon, the largest in his patch, to carry with us for ballast.  It was Nathan's, which he might sell if he wished, having been conveyed to him in the green state, and owned daily by his eyes.  After due consultation with "Father," the bargain was concluded,—we to buy it at a venture on the vine, green or ripe, our risk, and pay "what the gentlemen pleased." It proved to be ripe; for we had had honest experience in selecting this fruit.</p>

<p>Finding our boat safe in its harbor, under Uncannunuc Mountain, with a fair wind and the current in our favor, we commenced our return voyage at noon, sitting at our ease and conversing, or in silence watching for the last trace of each reach in the river as a bend concealed it from our view.  As the season was further advanced, the wind now blew steadily from the north, and with our sail set we could occasionally lie on our oars without loss of time.  The lumbermen throwing down wood from the top of the high bank, thirty or forty feet above the water, that it might be sent down stream, paused in their work to watch our retreating sail.  By this time, indeed, we were well known to the boatmen, and were hailed as the Revenue Cutter of the stream.  As we sailed rapidly down the river, shut in between two mounds of earth, the sounds of this timber rolled down the bank enhanced the silence and vastness of the noon, and we fancied that only the primeval echoes were awakened.  The vision of a distant scow just heaving in sight round a headland also increased by contrast the solitude.</p>

<p>Through the din and desultoriness of noon, even in the most Oriental city, is seen the fresh and primitive and savage nature, in which Scythians and Ethiopians and Indians dwell.  What is echo, what are light and shade, day and night, ocean and stars, earthquake and eclipse, there?  The works of man are everywhere swallowed up in the immensity of Nature.  The Aegean Sea is but Lake Huron still to the Indian.  Also there is all the refinement of civilized life in the woods under a sylvan garb.  The wildest scenes have an air of domesticity and homeliness even to the citizen, and when the flicker's cackle is heard in the clearing, he is reminded that civilization has wrought but little change there.  Science is welcome to the deepest recesses of the forest, for there too nature obeys the same old civil laws.  The little red bug on the stump of a pine,—for it the wind shifts and the sun breaks through the clouds.  In the wildest nature, there is not only the material of the most cultivated life, and a sort of anticipation of the last result, but a greater refinement already than is ever attained by man.  There is papyrus by the river-side, and rushes for light, and the goose only flies overhead, ages before the studious are born or letters invented, and that literature which the former suggest, and even from the first have rudely served, it may be man does not yet use them to express.  Nature is prepared to welcome into her scenery the finest work of human art, for she is herself an art so cunning that the artist never appears in his work.</p>

<p>Art is not tame, and Nature is not wild, in the ordinary sense.  A perfect work of man's art would also be wild or natural in a good sense.  Man tames Nature only that he may at last make her more free even than he found her, though he may never yet have succeeded.</p>

<p>With this propitious breeze, and the help of our oars, we soon reached the Falls of Amoskeag, and the mouth of the Piscataquoag, and recognized, as we swept rapidly by, many a fair bank and islet on which our eyes had rested in the upward passage.  Our boat was like that which Chaucer describes in his Dream, in which the knight took his departure from the island,</p>

<p>     "To journey for his marriage,<br/>

     And return with such an host,<br/>

     That wedded might be least and most. . . . .<br/>

     Which barge was as a man's thought,<br/>

     After his pleasure to him brought,<br/>

     The queene herself accustomed aye<br/>

     In the same barge to play,<br/>

     It needed neither mast ne rother,<br/>

     I have not heard of such another,<br/>

     No master for the governance,<br/>

     Hie sayled by thought and pleasaunce,<br/>

     Without labor east and west,<br/>

     All was one, calme or tempest."<br/>
</p>

<p>So we sailed this afternoon, thinking of the saying of Pythagoras, though we had no peculiar right to remember it, "It is beautiful when prosperity is present with intellect, and when sailing as it were with a prosperous wind, actions are performed looking to virtue; just as a pilot looks to the motions of the stars." All the world reposes in beauty to him who preserves equipoise in his life, and moves serenely on his path without secret violence; as he who sails down a stream, he has only to steer, keeping his bark in the middle, and carry it round the falls.  The ripples curled away in our wake, like ringlets from the head of a child, while we steadily held on our course, and under the bows we watched</p>

<p>                            "The swaying soft,<br/>

     Made by the delicate wave parted in front,<br/>

     As through the gentle element we move<br/>

     Like shadows gliding through untroubled dreams."<br/>
</p>

<p>The forms of beauty fall naturally around the path of him who is in the performance of his proper work; as the curled shavings drop from the plane, and borings cluster round the auger.  Undulation is the gentlest and most ideal of motions, produced by one fluid falling on another.  Rippling is a more graceful flight.  From a hill-top you may detect in it the wings of birds endlessly repeated.  The two <em>waving</em> lines which represent the flight of birds appear to have been copied from the ripple.</p>

<p>The trees made an admirable fence to the landscape, skirting the horizon on every side.  The single trees and the groves left standing on the interval appeared naturally disposed, though the farmer had consulted only his convenience, for he too falls into the scheme of Nature.  Art can never match the luxury and superfluity of Nature.  In the former all is seen; it cannot afford concealed wealth, and is niggardly in comparison; but Nature, even when she is scant and thin outwardly, satisfies us still by the assurance of a certain generosity at the roots.  In swamps, where there is only here and there an ever-green tree amid the quaking moss and cranberry beds, the bareness does not suggest poverty.  The single-spruce, which I had hardly noticed in gardens, attracts me in such places, and now first I understand why men try to make them grow about their houses.  But though there may be very perfect specimens in front-yard plots, their beauty is for the most part ineffectual there, for there is no such assurance of kindred wealth beneath and around them, to make them show to advantage.  As we have said, Nature is a greater and more perfect art, the art of God; though, referred to herself, she is genius; and there is a similarity between her operations and man's art even in the details and trifles.  When the overhanging pine drops into the water, by the sun and water, and the wind rubbing it against the shore, its boughs are worn into fantastic shapes, and white and smooth, as if turned in a lathe.  Man's art has wisely imitated those forms into which all matter is most inclined to run, as foliage and fruit.  A hammock swung in a grove assumes the exact form of a canoe, broader or narrower, and higher or lower at the ends, as more or fewer persons are in it, and it rolls in the air with the motion of the body, like a canoe in the water.  Our art leaves its shavings and its dust about; her art exhibits itself even in the shavings and the dust which we make.  She has perfected herself by an eternity of practice.  The world is well kept; no rubbish accumulates; the morning air is clear even at this day, and no dust has settled on the grass.  Behold how the evening now steals over the fields, the shadows of the trees creeping farther and farther into the meadow, and erelong the stars will come to bathe in these retired waters.  Her undertakings are secure and never fail.  If I were awakened from a deep sleep, I should know which side of the meridian the sun might be by the aspect of nature, and by the chirp of the crickets, and yet no painter can paint this difference.  The landscape contains a thousand dials which indicate the natural divisions of time, the shadows of a thousand styles point to the hour.</p>

<p>     "Not only o'er the dial's face,<br/>

       This silent phantom day by day,<br/>

     With slow, unseen, unceasing pace<br/>

       Steals moments, months, and years away;<br/>

     From hoary rock and aged tree,<br/>

       From proud Palmyra's mouldering walls,<br/>

     From Teneriffe, towering o'er the sea,<br/>

       From every blade of grass it falls."<br/>
</p>

<p>It is almost the only game which the trees play at, this tit-for-tat, now this side in the sun, now that, the drama of the day.  In deep ravines under the eastern sides of cliffs, Night forwardly plants her foot even at noonday, and as Day retreats she steps into his trenches, skulking from tree to tree, from fence to fence, until at last she sits in his citadel and draws out her forces into the plain.  It may be that the forenoon is brighter than the afternoon, not only because of the greater transparency of its atmosphere, but because we naturally look most into the west, as forward into the day, and so in the forenoon see the sunny side of things, but in the afternoon the shadow of every tree.</p>

<p>The afternoon is now far advanced, and a fresh and leisurely wind is blowing over the river, making long reaches of bright ripples.  The river has done its stint, and appears not to flow, but lie at its length reflecting the light, and the haze over the woods is like the inaudible panting, or rather the gentle perspiration of resting nature, rising from a myriad of pores into the attenuated atmosphere.</p>

<p>On the thirty-first day of March, one hundred and forty-two years before this, probably about this time in the afternoon, there were hurriedly paddling down this part of the river, between the pine woods which then fringed these banks, two white women and a boy, who had left an island at the mouth of the Contoocook before daybreak.  They were slightly clad for the season, in the English fashion, and handled their paddles unskilfully, but with nervous energy and determination, and at the bottom of their canoe lay the still bleeding scalps of ten of the aborigines.  They were Hannah Dustan, and her nurse, Mary Neff, both of Haverhill, eighteen miles from the mouth of this river, and an English boy, named Samuel Lennardson, escaping from captivity among the Indians.  On the 15th of March previous, Hannah Dustan had been compelled to rise from child-bed, and half dressed, with one foot bare, accompanied by her nurse, commence an uncertain march, in still inclement weather, through the snow and the wilderness.  She had seen her seven elder children flee with their father, but knew not of their fate.  She had seen her infant's brains dashed out against an apple-tree, and had left her own and her neighbors' dwellings in ashes.  When she reached the wigwam of her captor, situated on an island in the Merrimack, more than twenty miles above where we now are, she had been told that she and her nurse were soon to be taken to a distant Indian settlement, and there made to run the gauntlet naked.  The family of this Indian consisted of two men, three women, and seven children, beside an English boy, whom she found a prisoner among them.  Having determined to attempt her escape, she instructed the boy to inquire of one of the men, how he should despatch an enemy in the quickest manner, and take his scalp.  "Strike 'em there," said he, placing his finger on his temple, and he also showed him how to take off the scalp.  On the morning of the 31st she arose before daybreak, and awoke her nurse and the boy, and taking the Indians' tomahawks, they killed them all in their sleep, excepting one favorite boy, and one squaw who fled wounded with him to the woods.  The English boy struck the Indian who had given him the information, on the temple, as he had been directed.  They then collected all the provision they could find, and took their master's tomahawk and gun, and scuttling all the canoes but one, commenced their flight to Haverhill, distant about sixty miles by the river.  But after having proceeded a short distance, fearing that her story would not be believed if she should escape to tell it, they returned to the silent wigwam, and taking off the scalps of the dead, put them into a bag as proofs of what they had done, and then retracing their steps to the shore in the twilight, recommenced their voyage.</p>

<p>Early this morning this deed was performed, and now, perchance, these tired women and this boy, their clothes stained with blood, and their minds racked with alternate resolution and fear, are making a hasty meal of parched corn and moose-meat, while their canoe glides under these pine roots whose stumps are still standing on the bank.  They are thinking of the dead whom they have left behind on that solitary isle far up the stream, and of the relentless living warriors who are in pursuit.  Every withered leaf which the winter has left seems to know their story, and in its rustling to repeat it and betray them.  An Indian lurks behind every rock and pine, and their nerves cannot bear the tapping of a woodpecker.  Or they forget their own dangers and their deeds in conjecturing the fate of their kindred, and whether, if they escape the Indians, they shall find the former still alive.  They do not stop to cook their meals upon the bank, nor land, except to carry their canoe about the falls.  The stolen birch forgets its master and does them good service, and the swollen current bears them swiftly along with little need of the paddle, except to steer and keep them warm by exercise.  For ice is floating in the river; the spring is opening; the muskrat and the beaver are driven out of their holes by the flood; deer gaze at them from the bank; a few faint-singing forest birds, perchance, fly across the river to the northernmost shore; the fish-hawk sails and screams overhead, and geese fly over with a startling clangor; but they do not observe these things, or they speedily forget them.  They do not smile or chat all day.  Sometimes they pass an Indian grave surrounded by its paling on the bank, or the frame of a wigwam, with a few coals left behind, or the withered stalks still rustling in the Indian's solitary cornfield on the interval.  The birch stripped of its bark, or the charred stump where a tree has been burned down to be made into a canoe, these are the only traces of man,—a fabulous wild man to us.  On either side, the primeval forest stretches away uninterrupted to Canada, or to the "South Sea"; to the white man a drear and howling wilderness, but to the Indian a home, adapted to his nature, and cheerful as the smile of the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>While we loiter here this autumn evening, looking for a spot retired enough, where we shall quietly rest to-night, they thus, in that chilly March evening, one hundred and forty-two years before us, with wind and current favoring, have already glided out of sight, not to camp, as we shall, at night, but while two sleep one will manage the canoe, and the swift stream bear them onward to the settlements, it may be, even to old John Lovewell's house on Salmon Brook to-night.</p>

<p>According to the historian, they escaped as by a miracle all roving bands of Indians, and reached their homes in safety, with their trophies, for which the General Court paid them fifty pounds.  The family of Hannah Dustan all assembled alive once more, except the infant whose brains were dashed out against the apple-tree, and there have been many who in later times have lived to say that they had eaten of the fruit of that apple-tree.</p>

<p>This seems a long while ago, and yet it happened since Milton wrote his Paradise Lost.  But its antiquity is not the less great for that, for we do not regulate our historical time by the English standard, nor did the English by the Roman, nor the Roman by the Greek.  "We must look a long way back," says Raleigh, "to find the Romans giving laws to nations, and their consuls bringing kings and princes bound in chains to Rome in triumph; to see men go to Greece for wisdom, or Ophir for gold; when now nothing remains but a poor paper remembrance of their former condition." And yet, in one sense, not so far back as to find the Penacooks and Pawtuckets using bows and arrows and hatchets of stone, on the banks of the Merrimack.  From this September afternoon, and from between these now cultivated shores, those times seemed more remote than the dark ages.  On beholding an old picture of Concord, as it appeared but seventy-five years ago, with a fair open prospect and a light on trees and river, as if it were broad noon, I find that I had not thought the sun shone in those days, or that men lived in broad daylight then.  Still less do we imagine the sun shining on hill and valley during Philip's war, on the war-path of Church or Philip, or later of Lovewell or Paugus, with serene summer weather, but they must have lived and fought in a dim twilight or night.</p>

<p>The age of the world is great enough for our imaginations, even according to the Mosaic account, without borrowing any years from the geologist.  From Adam and Eve at one leap sheer down to the deluge, and then through the ancient monarchies, through Babylon and Thebes, Brahma and Abraham, to Greece and the Argonauts; whence we might start again with Orpheus and the Trojan war, the Pyramids and the Olympic games, and Homer and Athens, for our stages; and after a breathing space at the building of Rome, continue our journey down through Odin and Christ to—America.  It is a wearisome while.  And yet the lives of but sixty old women, such as live under the hill, say of a century each, strung together, are sufficient to reach over the whole ground.  Taking hold of hands they would span the interval from Eve to my own mother.  A respectable tea-party merely,—whose gossip would be Universal History.  The fourth old woman from myself suckled Columbus,—the ninth was nurse to the Norman Conqueror,—the nineteenth was the Virgin Mary,—the twenty-fourth the Cumaean Sibyl,—the thirtieth was at the Trojan war and Helen her name,—the thirty-eighth was Queen Semiramis,—the sixtieth was Eve the mother of mankind.  So much for the</p>

<p>     "Old woman that lives under the hill,<br/>

     And if she's not gone she lives there still."<br/>
</p>

<p>It will not take a very great-granddaughter of hers to be in at the death of Time.</p>

<p>We can never safely exceed the actual facts in our narratives.  Of pure invention, such as some suppose, there is no instance.  To write a true work of fiction even, is only to take leisure and liberty to describe some things more exactly as they are.  A true account of the actual is the rarest poetry, for common sense always takes a hasty and superficial view.  Though I am not much acquainted with the works of Goethe, I should say that it was one of his chief excellences as a writer, that he was satisfied with giving an exact description of things as they appeared to him, and their effect upon him.  Most travellers have not self-respect enough to do this simply, and make objects and events stand around them as the centre, but still imagine more favorable positions and relations than the actual ones, and so we get no valuable report from them at all.  In his Italian Travels Goethe jogs along at a snail's pace, but always mindful that the earth is beneath and the heavens are above him.  His Italy is not merely the fatherland of lazzaroni and virtuosi, and scene of splendid ruins, but a solid turf-clad soil, daily shined on by the sun, and nightly by the moon.  Even the few showers are faithfully recorded.  He speaks as an unconcerned spectator, whose object is faithfully to describe what he sees, and that, for the most part, in the order in which he sees it.  Even his reflections do not interfere with his descriptions.  In one place he speaks of himself as giving so glowing and truthful a description of an old tower to the peasants who had gathered around him, that they who had been born and brought up in the neighborhood must needs look over their shoulders, "that," to use his own words, "they might behold with their eyes, what I had praised to their ears,"—"and I added nothing, not even the ivy which for centuries had decorated the walls." It would thus be possible for inferior minds to produce invaluable books, if this very moderation were not the evidence of superiority; for the wise are not so much wiser than others as respecters of their own wisdom.  Some, poor in spirit, record plaintively only what has happened to them; but others how they have happened to the universe, and the judgment which they have awarded to circumstances.  Above all, he possessed a hearty good-will to all men, and never wrote a cross or even careless word.  On one occasion the post-boy snivelling, "Signor perdonate, quésta è la mia patria," he confesses that "to me poor northerner came something tear-like into the eyes."</p>

<p>Goethe's whole education and life were those of the artist.  He lacks the unconsciousness of the poet.  In his autobiography he describes accurately the life of the author of Wilhelm Meister.  For as there is in that book, mingled with a rare and serene wisdom, a certain pettiness or exaggeration of trifles, wisdom applied to produce a constrained and partial and merely well-bred man,—a magnifying of the theatre till life itself is turned into a stage, for which it is our duty to study our parts well, and conduct with propriety and precision,—so in the autobiography, the fault of his education is, so to speak, its merely artistic completeness.  Nature is hindered, though she prevails at last in making an unusually catholic impression on the boy.  It is the life of a city boy, whose toys are pictures and works of art, whose wonders are the theatre and kingly processions and crownings.  As the youth studied minutely the order and the degrees in the imperial procession, and suffered none of its effect to be lost on him, so the man aimed to secure a rank in society which would satisfy his notion of fitness and respectability.  He was defrauded of much which the savage boy enjoys.  Indeed, he himself has occasion to say in this very autobiography, when at last he escapes into the woods without the gates: "Thus much is certain, that only the undefinable, wide-expanding feelings of youth and of uncultivated nations are adapted to the sublime, which, whenever it may be excited in us through external objects, since it is either formless, or else moulded into forms which are incomprehensible, must surround us with a grandeur which we find above our reach." He further says of himself: "I had lived among painters from my childhood, and had accustomed myself to look at objects, as they did, with reference to art."  And this was his practice to the last.  He was even too <em>well-bred</em> to be thoroughly bred.  He says that he had had no intercourse with the lowest class of his towns-boys.  The child should have the advantage of ignorance as well as of knowledge, and is fortunate if he gets his share of neglect and exposure.</p>

<p>     "The laws of Nature break the rules of Art."</p>

<p>The Man of Genius may at the same time be, indeed is commonly, an Artist, but the two are not to be confounded.  The Man of Genius, referred to mankind, is an originator, an inspired or demonic man, who produces a perfect work in obedience to laws yet unexplored.  The Artist is he who detects and applies the law from observation of the works of Genius, whether of man or nature.  The Artisan is he who merely applies the rules which others have detected.  There has been no man of pure Genius; as there has been none wholly destitute of Genius.</p>

<p>Poetry is the mysticism of mankind.</p>

<p>The expressions of the poet cannot be analyzed; his sentence is one word, whose syllables are words.  There are indeed no <em>words</em> quite worthy to be set to his music.  But what matter if we do not hear the words always, if we hear the music?</p>

<p>Much verse fails of being poetry because it was not written exactly at the right crisis, though it may have been inconceivably near to it.  It is only by a miracle that poetry is written at all.  It is not recoverable thought, but a hue caught from a vaster receding thought.</p>

<p>A poem is one undivided unimpeded expression fallen ripe into literature, and it is undividedly and unimpededly received by those for whom it was matured.</p>

<p>If you can speak what you will never hear, if you can write what you will never read, you have done rare things.</p>

<p>     The work we choose should be our own,<br/>

     God lets alone.<br/>
</p>

<p>The unconsciousness of man is the consciousness of God.</p>

<p>Deep are the foundations of sincerity.  Even stone walls have their foundation below the frost.</p>

<p>What is produced by a free stroke charms us, like the forms of lichens and leaves.  There is a certain perfection in accident which we never consciously attain.  Draw a blunt quill filled with ink over a sheet of paper, and fold the paper before the ink is dry, transversely to this line, and a delicately shaded and regular figure will be produced, in some respects more pleasing than an elaborate drawing.</p>

<p>The talent of composition is very dangerous,—the striking out the heart of life at a blow, as the Indian takes off a scalp.  I feel as if my life had grown more outward when I can express it.</p>

<p>On his journey from Brenner to Verona, Goethe writes:</p>

<p>"The Tees flows now more gently, and makes in many places broad sands.  On the land, near to the water, upon the hillsides, everything is so closely planted one to another, that you think they must choke one another,—vineyards, maize, mulberry-trees, apples, pears, quinces, and nuts.  The dwarf elder throws itself vigorously over the walls.  Ivy grows with strong stems up the rocks, and spreads itself wide over them, the lizard glides through the intervals, and everything that wanders to and fro reminds one of the loveliest pictures of art.  The women's tufts of hair bound up, the men's bare breasts and light jackets, the excellent oxen which they drive home from market, the little asses with their loads,—everything forms a living, animated Heinrich Roos.  And now that it is evening, in the mild air a few clouds rest upon the mountains, in the heavens more stand still than move, and immediately after sunset the chirping of crickets begins to grow more loud; then one feels for once at home in the world, and not as concealed or in exile.  I am contented as though I had been born and brought up here, and were now returning from a Greenland or whaling voyage.  Even the dust of my Fatherland, which is often whirled about the wagon, and which for so long a time I had not seen, is greeted.  The clock-and-bell jingling of the crickets is altogether lovely, penetrating, and agreeable.  It sounds bravely when roguish boys whistle in emulation of a field of such songstresses.  One fancies that they really enhance one another.  Also the evening is perfectly mild as the day."</p>

<p>"If one who dwelt in the south, and came hither from the south, should hear of my rapture hereupon, he would deem me very childish.  Alas!  what I here express I have long known while I suffered under an unpropitious heaven, and now may I joyful feel this joy as an exception, which we should enjoy everforth as an eternal necessity of our nature."</p>

<p>Thus we "sayled by thought and pleasaunce," as Chaucer says, and all things seemed with us to flow; the shore itself, and the distant cliffs, were dissolved by the undiluted air.  The hardest material seemed to obey the same law with the most fluid, and so indeed in the long run it does.  Trees were but rivers of sap and woody fibre, flowing from the atmosphere, and emptying into the earth by their trunks, as their roots flowed upward to the surface.  And in the heavens there were rivers of stars, and milky-ways, already beginning to gleam and ripple over our heads.  There were rivers of rock on the surface of the earth, and rivers of ore in its bowels, and our thoughts flowed and circulated, and this portion of time was but the current hour.  Let us wander where we will, the universe is built round about us, and we are central still.  If we look into the heavens they are concave, and if we were to look into a gulf as bottomless, it would be concave also.  The sky is curved downward to the earth in the horizon, because we stand on the plain.  I draw down its skirts.  The stars so low there seem loath to depart, but by a circuitous path to be remembering me, and returning on their steps.</p>

<p>We had already passed by broad daylight the scene of our encampment at Coos Falls, and at length we pitched our camp on the west bank, in the northern part of Merrimack, nearly opposite to the large island on which we had spent the noon in our way up the river.</p>

<p>There we went to bed that summer evening, on a sloping shelf in the bank, a couple of rods from our boat, which was drawn up on the sand, and just behind a thin fringe of oaks which bordered the river; without having disturbed any inhabitants but the spiders in the grass, which came out by the light of our lamp, and crawled over our buffaloes.  When we looked out from under the tent, the trees were seen dimly through the mist, and a cool dew hung upon the grass, which seemed to rejoice in the night, and with the damp air we inhaled a solid fragrance.  Having eaten our supper of hot cocoa and bread and watermelon, we soon grew weary of conversing, and writing in our journals, and, putting out the lantern which hung from the tent-pole, fell asleep.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many things have been omitted which should have been recorded in our journal; for though we made it a rule to set down all our experiences therein, yet such a resolution is very hard to keep, for the important experience rarely allows us to remember such obligations, and so indifferent things get recorded, while that is frequently neglected.  It is not easy to write in a journal what interests us at any time, because to write it is not what interests us.</p>

<p>Whenever we awoke in the night, still eking out our dreams with half-awakened thoughts, it was not till after an interval, when the wind breathed harder than usual, flapping the curtains of the tent, and causing its cords to vibrate, that we remembered that we lay on the bank of the Merrimack, and not in our chamber at home.  With our heads so low in the grass, we heard the river whirling and sucking, and lapsing downward, kissing the shore as it went, sometimes rippling louder than usual, and again its mighty current making only a slight limpid, trickling sound, as if our water-pail had sprung a leak, and the water were flowing into the grass by our side.  The wind, rustling the oaks and hazels, impressed us like a wakeful and inconsiderate person up at midnight, moving about, and putting things to rights, occasionally stirring up whole drawers full of leaves at a puff.  There seemed to be a great haste and preparation throughout Nature, as for a distinguished visitor; all her aisles had to be swept in the night, by a thousand hand-maidens, and a thousand pots to be boiled for the next day's feasting;—such a whispering bustle, as if ten thousand fairies made their fingers fly, silently sewing at the new carpet with which the earth was to be clothed, and the new drapery which was to adorn the trees.  And then the wind would lull and die away, and we like it fell asleep again.</p>

<h1>Sympathy</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1840)</h2>
<p>
Lately alas I knew a gentle boy,<br/>
Whose features all were cast in Virtue's mould,<br/>
As one she had designed for Beauty's toy,<br/>
But after manned him for her own stronghold.
</p>
<p>
On every side he open was as day,<br/>
That you might see no lack of strength within,<br/>
For walls and ports do only serve alway<br/>
For a pretence to feebleness and sin.
</p>
<p>
Say not that Caesar was victorious,<br/>
With toil and strife who stormed the House of Fame;<br/>
In other sense this youth was glorious,<br/>
Himself a kingdom wheresoe'er he came.
</p>
<p>
No strength went out to get him victory,<br/>
When all was income of its own accord;<br/>
For where he went none other was to see,<br/>
But all were parcel of their noble lord.
</p>
<p>
He forayed like the subtle breeze of summer,<br/>
That stilly shows fresh landscapes to the eyes,<br/>
And revolutions worked without a murmur,<br/>
Or rustling of a leaf beneath the skies.
</p>
<p>
So was I taken unawares by this,<br/>
I quite forgot my homage to confess;<br/>
Yet now am forced to know, though hard it is,<br/>
I might have loved him, had I loved him less.
</p>
<p>
Each moment, as we nearer drew to each,<br/>
A stern respect withheld us farther yet,<br/>
So that we seemed beyond each other's reach,<br/>
And less acquainted than when first we met.
</p>
<p>
We two were one while we did sympathize,<br/>
So could we not the simplest bargain drive;<br/>
And what avails it now that we are wise,<br/>
If absence doth this doubleness contrive?
</p>
<p>
Eternity may not the chance repeat,<br/>
But I must tread my single way alone,<br/>
In sad remembrance that we once did meet,<br/>
And know that bliss irrevocably gone.
</p>
<p>
The spheres henceforth my elegy shall sing,<br/>
For elegy has other subject none;<br/>
Each strain of music in my ears shall ring<br/>
Knell of departure from that other one.
</p>
<p>
Make haste and celebrate my tragedy;<br/>
With fitting strain resound ye woods and fields;<br/>
Sorrow is dearer in such case to me<br/>
Than all the joys other occasion yields.
</p>
<p>
Is't then too late the damage to repair?<br/>
Distance, forsooth, from my weak grasp hath reft<br/>
The empty husk, and clutched the useless tare,<br/>
But in my hands the wheat and kernel left.
</p>
<p>
If I but love that virtue which he is,<br/>
Though it be scented in the morning air,<br/>
Still shall we be dearest acquaintances,<br/>
Nor mortals know a sympathy more rare.

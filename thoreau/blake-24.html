<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, March 13, 1856</h3>
<p>Mr. Blake,&mdash;It is high time I sent you a word. I have not heard from Harrisburg since offering to go there, and have not been invited to lecture anywhere else the past winter. So you see I am fast growing rich. This is quite right, for such is my relation to the lecture-goers, I should be surprised and alarmed if there were any great call for me. I confess that I am considerably alarmed even when I hear that an individual wishes to meet me, for my experience teaches me that we shall thus only be made certain of a mutual strangeness, which otherwise we might never have been aware of.</p>
<p>I have not yet recovered strength enough for such a walk as you propose, though pretty well again for circumscribed rambles and chamber work. Even now, I am probably the greatest walker in Concord,&mdash;to its disgrace be it said. I remember our walks and talks and sailing in the past with great satisfaction, and trust that we shall have more of them ere long,&mdash;have more woodings-up,&mdash;for even in the spring we must still seek "fuel to maintain our fires."</p>
<p>As you suggest, we would fain value one another for what we are absolutely, rather than relatively. How will this do for a symbol of sympathy?</p>
<p>As for compliments, even the stars praise me, and I praise them. They and I sometimes belong to a mutual admiration society. Is it not so with you? I know you of old. Are you not tough and earnest to be talked at, praised, or blamed? Must <em>you</em> go out of the room because you are the subject of conversation? Where will you go to, pray? Shall we look into the "Letter Writer" to see what compliments are admissible? I am not afraid of praise, for I have practiced it on myself. As for my deserts, I never took an account of that stock, and in this connection care not whether I am deserving or not. When I hear praise coming, do I not elevate and arch myself to hear it like the sky, and as impersonally? Think I appropriate any of it to my weak legs? No. Praise away <em>till all is blue</em>.  </p>
<p>I see by the newspapers that the season for making sugar is at hand. Now is the time, whether you be rock, or white maple, or hickory. I trust that you have prepared a store of sap-tubs and sumach spouts, and invested largely in kettles. Early the first frosty morning, tap your maples,&mdash;the sap will not run in summer, you know. It matters not how little juice you get, if you get all you can, and boil it down. I made just one crystal of sugar once, one twentieth of an inch cube, out of a pumpkin, and it sufficed. Though the yield be no greater than that, this is not less the season for it, and it will be not the less sweet, nay, it will be infinitely the sweeter.</p>
<p>Shall, then, the maple yield sugar, and not man?  Shall the farmer be thus active, and surely have so much sugar to show for it, before this very March is gone,&mdash;while I read the newspaper? While he works in his sugar-camp let me work in mine,&mdash;for sweetness is in me, and to sugar it shall come,&mdash;it shall not all go to leaves and wood. Am I not a <em>sugar maple</em> man, then? Boil down the sweet sap which the spring causes to flow within you. Stop not at syrup,&mdash;go on to sugar, though you present the world with but a single crystal,&mdash;a crystal not made from trees in your yard, but from the new life that stirs in your pores.  Cheerfully skim your kettle, and watch it set and crystallize, making a holiday of it if you will. Heaven will be propitious to you as to him.</p>
<p>Say to the farmer: There is your crop; here is mine.  Mine is a sugar to sweeten sugar with. If you will listen to me, I will sweeten your whole load,&mdash;your whole life.</p>  
<p>Then will the callers ask, Where is Blake? He is in his sugar-camp on the mountainside. Let the world await him. Then will the little boys bless you, and the great boys too, for such sugar is the origin of many condiments,&mdash;Blakians in the shops of Worcester, of new form, with their mottoes wrapped up in them.  Shall men taste only the sweetness of the maple and the cane the coming year?</p>
<p>A walk over the crust to Asnebumskit, standing there in its inviting simplicity, is tempting to think of,&mdash;making a fire on the snow under some rock! The very poverty of outward nature implies an inward wealth in the walker. What a Golconda is he conversant with, thawing his fingers over such a blaze! But&mdash;but&mdash;</p>
<p>Have you read the new poem, "The Angel in the House"? Perhaps you will find it good for you.</p>

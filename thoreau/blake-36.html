<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, January 19, 1859</h3>
<p>Mr. Blake,&mdash;If I could have given a favorable report as to the skating, I should have answered you earlier. About a week before you wrote there was good skating; there is now none. As for the lecture, I shall be glad to come. I cannot now say when, but I will let you know, I think within a week or ten days at most, and will then leave you a week clear to make the arrangements in. I will bring something else than "What shall it profit a Man?" My father is very sick, and has been for a long time, so that there is the more need of me at home. This occurs to me, even when contemplating so short an excursion as to Worcester.</p>
<p>I want very much to see or hear your account of your adventures in the Ravine, and I trust I shall do so when I come to Worcester. Cholmondeley has been here again, returning from Virginia (for he went no farther south) to Canada; and will go thence to Europe, he thinks, in the spring, and never ramble any more.  (January 29.) I am expecting daily that my father will die, therefore I cannot leave home at present. I will write you again within ten days.  </p>

<h1>Independence</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1841)</h2>
<p>
My life more civil is and free<br/>
Than any civil polity.
</p>
<p>
Ye princes, keep your realms<br/>
And circumscrib√®d power,<br/>
Not wide as are my dreams,<br/>
Nor rich as is this hour.
</p>
<p>
What can ye give which I have not?<br/>
What can ye take which I have got?<br/>
Can ye defend the dangerless?<br/>
Can ye inherit nakedness?
</p>
<p>
To all true wants Time's ear is deaf,<br/>
Penurious states lend no relief<br/>
Out of their pelf:<br/>
But a free soul &mdash; thank God &mdash;<br/>
Can help itself.
</p>
<p>
Be sure your fate<br/>
Doth keep apart its state,<br/>
Not linked with any band,<br/>
Even the noblest of the land;
</p>
<p>
In tented fields with cloth of gold<br/>
No place doth hold,<br/>
But is more chivalrous than they are,<br/>
And sigheth for a nobler war;<br/>
A finer strain its trumpet sings,<br/>
A brighter gleam its armor flings.
</p>
<p>
The life that I aspire to live<br/>
No man proposeth me;<br/>
No trade upon the street<br/>
Wears its emblazonry.
</p>

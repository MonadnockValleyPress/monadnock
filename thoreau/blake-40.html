<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, August 3, 1860</h3>
<p>Mr. Blake,&mdash;I some time ago asked Channing if he would not spend a week with me on Monadnock; but he did not answer decidedly. Lately he has talked of an excursion somewhere, but I said that <em>now</em> I must wait till my sister returned from Plymouth, N. H.  She has returned,&mdash;and accordingly, on receiving your note this morning, I made known its contents to Channing, in order to see how far I was engaged with him.  The result is that he decides to go to Monadnock to-morrow morning; so I must defer making an excursion with you and Brown to another season. Perhaps you will call as you pass the mountain. I send this by the earliest mail.</p>
<p>P. S.&mdash;That was a very insufficient visit which you made here the last time. My mother is better, though far from well; and if you should chance along here any time after your journey, I trust that we shall all do better.</p>

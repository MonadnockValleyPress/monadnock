<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, October 5, 1854</h3>
<p>After I wrote to you, Mr. Watson postponed my going to Plymouth one week, <em>i.e.</em>, till next Sunday; and now he wishes me to carry my instruments and survey his grounds, to which he has been adding. Since I want a little money, though I contemplate but a short excursion, I do not feel at liberty to decline this work.  I do not know exactly how long it will detain me,&mdash;but there is plenty of time yet, and I will write to you again&mdash;perhaps from Plymouth.</p>
<p>There is a Mr. Thomas Cholmondeley (pronounced Chumly), a young English author, staying at our house at present, who asks me to teach him <em>botany</em>&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, anything which I know; and also to make an excursion to some mountain with him. He is a well-behaved person, and <em>possibly</em> I may propose his taking that run to Wachusett with us&mdash;if it will be agreeable to you.  Nay, if I do not hear any objection from you, I will consider myself <em>at liberty</em> to invite him.</p>

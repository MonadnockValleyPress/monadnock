<h1>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers: Tuesday</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1849)</h2>

<p>            "On either side the river lie<br/>

             Long fields of barley and of rye,<br/>

             That clothe the wold and meet the sky;<br/>

             And through the fields the road runs by<br/>

                          To many-towered Camelot."<br/>

                                            <cite>Tennyson</cite><br/>
</p>

<p>Long before daylight we ranged abroad, hatchet in hand, in search of fuel, and made the yet slumbering and dreaming wood resound with our blows.  Then with our fire we burned up a portion of the loitering night, while the kettle sang its homely strain to the morning star.  We tramped about the shore, waked all the muskrats, and scared up the bittern and birds that were asleep upon their roosts; we hauled up and upset our boat and washed it and rinsed out the clay, talking aloud as if it were broad day, until at length, by three o'clock, we had completed our preparations and were ready to pursue our voyage as usual; so, shaking the clay from our feet, we pushed into the fog.</p>

<p>Though we were enveloped in mist as usual, we trusted that there was a bright day behind it.</p>

<p>     Ply the oars! away! away!<br/>

     In each dew-drop of the morning<br/>

     Lies the promise of a day.<br/>
</p>

<p>     Rivers from the sunrise flow,<br/>

     Springing with the dewy morn;<br/>

     Voyageurs 'gainst time do row,<br/>

     Idle noon nor sunset know,<br/>

     Ever even with the dawn.<br/>
</p>

<p>Belknap, the historian of this State, says that, "In the neighborhood of fresh rivers and ponds, a whitish fog in the morning lying over the water is a sure indication of fair weather for that day; and when no fog is seen, rain is expected before night." That which seemed to us to invest the world was only a narrow and shallow wreath of vapor stretched over the channel of the Merrimack from the seaboard to the mountains.  More extensive fogs, however, have their own limits.  I once saw the day break from the top of Saddle-back Mountain in Massachusetts, above the clouds.  As we cannot distinguish objects through this dense fog, let me tell this story more at length.</p>

<p>I had come over the hills on foot and alone in serene summer days, plucking the raspberries by the wayside, and occasionally buying a loaf of bread at a farmer's house, with a knapsack on my back which held a few traveller's books and a change of clothing, and a staff in my hand.  I had that morning looked down from the Hoosack Mountain, where the road crosses it, on the village of North Adams in the valley three miles away under my feet, showing how uneven the earth may sometimes be, and making it seem an accident that it should ever be level and convenient for the feet of man.  Putting a little rice and sugar and a tin cup into my knapsack at this village, I began in the afternoon to ascend the mountain, whose summit is three thousand six hundred feet above the level of the sea, and was seven or eight miles distant by the path.  My route lay up a long and spacious valley called the Bellows, because the winds rush up or down it with violence in storms, sloping up to the very clouds between the principal range and a lower mountain.  There were a few farms scattered along at different elevations, each commanding a fine prospect of the mountains to the north, and a stream ran down the middle of the valley on which near the head there was a mill.  It seemed a road for the pilgrim to enter upon who would climb to the gates of heaven.  Now I crossed a hay-field, and now over the brook on a slight bridge, still gradually ascending all the while with a sort of awe, and filled with indefinite expectations as to what kind of inhabitants and what kind of nature I should come to at last.  It now seemed some advantage that the earth was uneven, for one could not imagine a more noble position for a farm-house than this vale afforded, farther from or nearer to its head, from a glen-like seclusion overlooking the country at a great elevation between these two mountain walls.</p>

<p>It reminded me of the homesteads of the Huguenots, on Staten Island, off the coast of New Jersey.  The hills in the interior of this island, though comparatively low, are penetrated in various directions by similar sloping valleys on a humble scale, gradually narrowing and rising to the centre, and at the head of these the Huguenots, who were the first settlers, placed their houses quite within the land, in rural and sheltered places, in leafy recesses where the breeze played with the poplar and the gum-tree, from which, with equal security in calm and storm, they looked out through a widening vista, over miles of forest and stretching salt marsh, to the Huguenot's Tree, an old elm on the shore at whose root they had landed, and across the spacious outer bay of New York to Sandy Hook and the Highlands of Neversink, and thence over leagues of the Atlantic, perchance to some faint vessel in the horizon, almost a day's sail on her voyage to that Europe whence they had come.  When walking in the interior there, in the midst of rural scenery, where there was as little to remind me of the ocean as amid the New Hampshire hills, I have suddenly, through a gap, a cleft or "clove road," as the Dutch settlers called it, caught sight of a ship under full sail, over a field of corn, twenty or thirty miles at sea.  The effect was similar, since I had no means of measuring distances, to seeing a painted ship passed backwards and forwards through a magic-lantern.</p>

<p>But to return to the mountain.  It seemed as if he must be the most singular and heavenly minded man whose dwelling stood highest up the valley.  The thunder had rumbled at my heels all the way, but the shower passed off in another direction, though if it had not, I half believed that I should get above it.  I at length reached the last house but one, where the path to the summit diverged to the right, while the summit itself rose directly in front.  But I determined to follow up the valley to its head, and then find my own route up the steep as the shorter and more adventurous way.  I had thoughts of returning to this house, which was well kept and so nobly placed, the next day, and perhaps remaining a week there, if I could have entertainment.  Its mistress was a frank and hospitable young woman, who stood before me in a dishabille, busily and unconcernedly combing her long black hair while she talked, giving her head the necessary toss with each sweep of the comb, with lively, sparkling eyes, and full of interest in that lower world from which I had come, talking all the while as familiarly as if she had known me for years, and reminding me of a cousin of mine.  She at first had taken me for a student from Williamstown, for they went by in parties, she said, either riding or walking, almost every pleasant day, and were a pretty wild set of fellows; but they never went by the way I was going.  As I passed the last house, a man called out to know what I had to sell, for seeing my knapsack, he thought that I might be a pedler who was taking this unusual route over the ridge of the valley into South Adams.  He told me that it was still four or five miles to the summit by the path which I had left, though not more than two in a straight line from where I was, but that nobody ever went this way; there was no path, and I should find it as steep as the roof of a house.  But I knew that I was more used to woods and mountains than he, and went along through his cow-yard, while he, looking at the sun, shouted after me that I should not get to the top that night.  I soon reached the head of the valley, but as I could not see the summit from this point, I ascended a low mountain on the opposite side, and took its bearing with my compass.  I at once entered the woods, and began to climb the steep side of the mountain in a diagonal direction, taking the bearing of a tree every dozen rods.  The ascent was by no means difficult or unpleasant, and occupied much less time than it would have taken to follow the path.  Even country people, I have observed, magnify the difficulty of travelling in the forest, and especially among mountains.  They seem to lack their usual common sense in this.  I have climbed several higher mountains without guide or path, and have found, as might be expected, that it takes only more time and patience commonly than to travel the smoothest highway.  It is very rare that you meet with obstacles in this world which the humblest man has not faculties to surmount.  It is true we may come to a perpendicular precipice, but we need not jump off nor run our heads against it.  A man may jump down his own cellar stairs or dash his brains out against his chimney, if he is mad.  So far as my experience goes, travellers generally exaggerate the difficulties of the way.  Like most evil, the difficulty is imaginary; for what's the hurry?  If a person lost would conclude that after all he is not lost, he is not beside himself, but standing in his own old shoes on the very spot where he is, and that for the time being he will live there; but the places that have known him, <em>they</em> are lost,—how much anxiety and danger would vanish.  I am not alone if I stand by myself.  Who knows where in space this globe is rolling?  Yet we will not give ourselves up for lost, let it go where it will.</p>

<p>I made my way steadily upward in a straight line through a dense undergrowth of mountain laurel, until the trees began to have a scraggy and infernal look, as if contending with frost goblins, and at length I reached the summit, just as the sun was setting.  Several acres here had been cleared, and were covered with rocks and stumps, and there was a rude observatory in the middle which overlooked the woods.  I had one fair view of the country before the sun went down, but I was too thirsty to waste any light in viewing the prospect, and set out directly to find water.  First, going down a well-beaten path for half a mile through the low scrubby wood, till I came to where the water stood in the tracks of the horses which had carried travellers up, I lay down flat, and drank these dry, one after another, a pure, cold, spring-like water, but yet I could not fill my dipper, though I contrived little siphons of grass-stems, and ingenious aqueducts on a small scale; it was too slow a process.  Then remembering that I had passed a moist place near the top, on my way up, I returned to find it again, and here, with sharp stones and my hands, in the twilight, I made a well about two feet deep, which was soon filled with pure cold water, and the birds too came and drank at it.  So I filled my dipper, and, making my way back to the observatory, collected some dry sticks, and made a fire on some flat stones which had been placed on the floor for that purpose, and so I soon cooked my supper of rice, having already whittled a wooden spoon to eat it with.</p>

<p>I sat up during the evening, reading by the light of the fire the scraps of newspapers in which some party had wrapped their luncheon; the prices current in New York and Boston, the advertisements, and the singular editorials which some had seen fit to publish, not foreseeing under what critical circumstances they would be read.  I read these things at a vast advantage there, and it seemed to me that the advertisements, or what is called the business part of a paper, were greatly the best, the most useful, natural, and respectable.  Almost all the opinions and sentiments expressed were so little considered, so shallow and flimsy, that I thought the very texture of the paper must be weaker in that part and tear the more easily.  The advertisements and the prices current were more closely allied to nature, and were respectable in some measure as tide and meteorological tables are; but the reading-matter, which I remembered was most prized down below, unless it was some humble record of science, or an extract from some old classic, struck me as strangely whimsical, and crude, and one-idea'd, like a school-boy's theme, such as youths write and after burn.  The opinions were of that kind that are doomed to wear a different aspect to-morrow, like last year's fashions; as if mankind were very green indeed, and would be ashamed of themselves in a few years, when they had outgrown this verdant period.  There was, moreover, a singular disposition to wit and humor, but rarely the slightest real success; and the apparent success was a terrible satire on the attempt; the Evil Genius of man laughed the loudest at his best jokes.  The advertisements, as I have said, such as were serious, and not of the modern quack kind, suggested pleasing and poetic thoughts; for commerce is really as interesting as nature.  The very names of the commodities were poetic, and as suggestive as if they had been inserted in a pleasing poem,—Lumber, Cotton, Sugar, Hides, Guano, Logwood.  Some sober, private, and original thought would have been grateful to read there, and as much in harmony with the circumstances as if it had been written on a mountain-top; for it is of a fashion which never changes, and as respectable as hides and logwood, or any natural product.  What an inestimable companion such a scrap of paper would have been, containing some fruit of a mature life.  What a relic!  What a recipe!  It seemed a divine invention, by which not mere shining coin, but shining and current thoughts, could be brought up and left there.</p>

<p>As it was cold, I collected quite a pile of wood and lay down on a board against the side of the building, not having any blanket to cover me, with my head to the fire, that I might look after it, which is not the Indian rule.  But as it grew colder towards midnight, I at length encased myself completely in boards, managing even to put a board on top of me, with a large stone on it, to keep it down, and so slept comfortably.  I was reminded, it is true, of the Irish children, who inquired what their neighbors did who had no door to put over them in winter nights as they had; but I am convinced that there was nothing very strange in the inquiry.  Those who have never tried it can have no idea how far a door, which keeps the single blanket down, may go toward making one comfortable.  We are constituted a good deal like chickens, which taken from the hen, and put in a basket of cotton in the chimney-corner, will often peep till they die, nevertheless, but if you put in a book, or anything heavy, which will press down the cotton, and feel like the hen, they go to sleep directly.  My only companions were the mice, which came to pick up the crumbs that had been left in those scraps of paper; still, as everywhere, pensioners on man, and not unwisely improving this elevated tract for their habitation.  They nibbled what was for them; I nibbled what was for me.  Once or twice in the night, when I looked up, I saw a white cloud drifting through the windows, and filling the whole upper story.</p>

<p>This observatory was a building of considerable size, erected by the students of Williamstown College, whose buildings might be seen by daylight gleaming far down in the valley.  It would be no small advantage if every college were thus located at the base of a mountain, as good at least as one well-endowed professorship.  It were as well to be educated in the shadow of a mountain as in more classical shades.  Some will remember, no doubt, not only that they went to the college, but that they went to the mountain.  Every visit to its summit would, as it were, generalize the particular information gained below, and subject it to more catholic tests.</p>

<p>I was up early and perched upon the top of this tower to see the daybreak, for some time reading the names that had been engraved there, before I could distinguish more distant objects.  An "untamable fly" buzzed at my elbow with the same nonchalance as on a molasses hogshead at the end of Long Wharf.  Even there I must attend to his stale humdrum.  But now I come to the pith of this long digression.—As the light increased I discovered around me an ocean of mist, which by chance reached up exactly to the base of the tower, and shut out every vestige of the earth, while I was left floating on this fragment of the wreck of a world, on my carved plank, in cloudland; a situation which required no aid from the imagination to render it impressive.  As the light in the east steadily increased, it revealed to me more clearly the new world into which I had risen in the night, the new <em>terra firma</em> perchance of my future life.  There was not a crevice left through which the trivial places we name Massachusetts or Vermont or New York could be seen, while I still inhaled the clear atmosphere of a July morning,—if it were July there.  All around beneath me was spread for a hundred miles on every side, as far as the eye could reach, an undulating country of clouds, answering in the varied swell of its surface to the terrestrial world it veiled.  It was such a country as we might see in dreams, with all the delights of paradise.  There were immense snowy pastures, apparently smooth-shaven and firm, and shady vales between the vaporous mountains; and far in the horizon I could see where some luxurious misty timber jutted into the prairie, and trace the windings of a water-course, some unimagined Amazon or Orinoko, by the misty trees on its brink.  As there was wanting the symbol, so there was not the substance of impurity, no spot nor stain.  It was a favor for which to be forever silent to be shown this vision.  The earth beneath had become such a flitting thing of lights and shadows as the clouds had been before.  It was not merely veiled to me, but it had passed away like the phantom of a shadow, &lt;skia's o'nar&gt;, and this new platform was gained.  As I had climbed above storm and cloud, so by successive days' journeys I might reach the region of eternal day, beyond the tapering shadow of the earth; ay,</p>

<p>             "Heaven itself shall slide,<br/>

        And roll away, like melting stars that glide<br/>

        Along their oily threads."<br/>
</p>

<p>But when its own sun began to rise on this pure world, I found myself a dweller in the dazzling halls of Aurora, into which poets have had but a partial glance over the eastern hills, drifting amid the saffron-colored clouds, and playing with the rosy fingers of the Dawn, in the very path of the Sun's chariot, and sprinkled with its dewy dust, enjoying the benignant smile, and near at hand the far-darting glances of the god.  The inhabitants of earth behold commonly but the dark and shadowy under-side of heaven's pavement; it is only when seen at a favorable angle in the horizon, morning or evening, that some faint streaks of the rich lining of the clouds are revealed.  But my muse would fail to convey an impression of the gorgeous tapestry by which I was surrounded, such as men see faintly reflected afar off in the chambers of the east.  Here, as on earth, I saw the gracious god</p>

<p>        "Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,<br/>

             .      .      .      .      .      .<br/>

          Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy."<br/>
</p>

<p>But never here did "Heaven's sun" stain himself.</p>

<p>But, alas, owing, as I think, to some unworthiness in myself, my private sun did stain himself, and</p>

<p>             "Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br/>

              With ugly wrack on his celestial face,"—<br/>
</p>

<p>for before the god had reached the zenith the heavenly pavement rose and embraced my wavering virtue, or rather I sank down again into that "forlorn world," from which the celestial sun had hid his visage,—</p>

<p>      "How may a worm that crawls along the dust,<br/>

       Clamber the azure mountains, thrown so high,<br/>

       And fetch from thence thy fair idea just,<br/>

       That in those sunny courts doth hidden lie,<br/>

       Clothed with such light as blinds the angel's eye?<br/>

          How may weak mortal ever hope to file<br/>

          His unsmooth tongue, and his deprostrate style?<br/>

       O, raise thou from his corse thy now entombed exile!"<br/>
</p>

<p>In the preceding evening I had seen the summits of new and yet higher mountains, the Catskills, by which I might hope to climb to heaven again, and had set my compass for a fair lake in the southwest, which lay in my way, for which I now steered, descending the mountain by my own route, on the side opposite to that by which I had ascended, and soon found myself in the region of cloud and drizzling rain, and the inhabitants affirmed that it had been a cloudy and drizzling day wholly.</p>

<p>But now we must make haste back before the fog disperses to the blithe Merrimack water.</p>

<p>      Since that first "Away! away!"<br/>

           Many a lengthy reach we've rowed,<br/>

      Still the sparrow on the spray<br/>

      Hastes to usher in the day<br/>

           With her simple stanza'd ode.<br/>
</p>

<p>We passed a canal-boat before sunrise, groping its way to the seaboard, and, though we could not see it on account of the fog, the few dull, thumping, stertorous sounds which we heard, impressed us with a sense of weight and irresistible motion.  One little rill of commerce already awake on this distant New Hampshire river.  The fog, as it required more skill in the steering, enhanced the interest of our early voyage, and made the river seem indefinitely broad.  A slight mist, through which objects are faintly visible, has the effect of expanding even ordinary streams, by a singular mirage, into arms of the sea or inland lakes.  In the present instance it was even fragrant and invigorating, and we enjoyed it as a sort of earlier sunshine, or dewy and embryo light.</p>

<p>         Low-anchored cloud,<br/>

         Newfoundland air,<br/>

         Fountain-head and source of rivers,<br/>

         Dew-cloth, dream drapery,<br/>

         And napkin spread by fays;<br/>

         Drifting meadow of the air,<br/>

         Where bloom the daisied banks and violets,<br/>

         And in whose fenny labyrinth<br/>

         The bittern booms and heron wades;<br/>

         Spirit of lakes and seas and rivers,<br/>

         Bear only perfumes and the scent<br/>

         Of healing herbs to just men's fields!<br/>
</p>

<p>The same pleasant and observant historian whom we quoted above says, that, "In the mountainous parts of the country, the ascent of vapors, and their formation into clouds, is a curious and entertaining object.  The vapors are seen rising in small columns like smoke from many chimneys.  When risen to a certain height, they spread, meet, condense, and are attracted to the mountains, where they either distil in gentle dews, and replenish the springs, or descend in showers, accompanied with thunder.  After short intermissions, the process is repeated many times in the course of a summer day, affording to travellers a lively illustration of what is observed in the Book of Job, `They are wet with the showers of the mountains.'"</p>

<p>Fogs and clouds which conceal the overshadowing mountains lend the breadth of the plains to mountain vales.  Even a small-featured country acquires some grandeur in stormy weather when clouds are seen drifting between the beholder and the neighboring hills.  When, in travelling toward Haverhill through Hampstead in this State, on the height of land between the Merrimack and the Piscataqua or the sea, you commence the descent eastward, the view toward the coast is so distant and unexpected, though the sea is invisible, that you at first suppose the unobstructed atmosphere to be a fog in the lowlands concealing hills of corresponding elevation to that you are upon; but it is the mist of prejudice alone, which the winds will not disperse.  The most stupendous scenery ceases to be sublime when it becomes distinct, or in other words limited, and the imagination is no longer encouraged to exaggerate it.  The actual height and breadth of a mountain or a waterfall are always ridiculously small; they are the imagined only that content us.  Nature is not made after such a fashion as we would have her.  We piously exaggerate her wonders, as the scenery around our home.</p>

<p>Such was the heaviness of the dews along this river that we were generally obliged to leave our tent spread over the bows of the boat till the sun had dried it, to avoid mildew.  We passed the mouth of Penichook Brook, a wild salmon-stream, in the fog, without seeing it.  At length the sun's rays struggled through the mist and showed us the pines on shore dripping with dew, and springs trickling from the moist banks,—</p>

<p>      "And now the taller sons, whom Titan warms,<br/>

       Of unshorn mountains blown with easy winds,<br/>

       Dandle the morning's childhood in their arms,<br/>

       And, if they chanced to slip the prouder pines,<br/>

       The under corylets did catch their shines,<br/>

       To gild their leaves."<br/>
</p>

<p>We rowed for some hours between glistening banks before the sun had dried the grass and leaves, or the day had established its character.  Its serenity at last seemed the more profound and secure for the denseness of the morning's fog.  The river became swifter, and the scenery more pleasing than before.  The banks were steep and clayey for the most part, and trickling with water, and where a spring oozed out a few feet above the river the boatmen had cut a trough out of a slab with their axes, and placed it so as to receive the water and fill their jugs conveniently.  Sometimes this purer and cooler water, bursting out from under a pine or a rock, was collected into a basin close to the edge of and level with the river, a fountain-head of the Merrimack.  So near along life's stream are the fountains of innocence and youth making fertile its sandy margin; and the voyageur will do well to replenish his vessels often at these uncontaminated sources.  Some youthful spring, perchance, still empties with tinkling music into the oldest river, even when it is falling into the sea, and we imagine that its music is distinguished by the river-gods from the general lapse of the stream, and falls sweeter on their ears in proportion as it is nearer to the ocean.  As the evaporations of the river feed thus these unsuspected springs which filter through its banks, so, perchance, our aspirations fall back again in springs on the margin of life's stream to refresh and purify it.  The yellow and tepid river may float his scow, and cheer his eye with its reflections and its ripples, but the boatman quenches his thirst at this small rill alone.  It is this purer and cooler element that chiefly sustains his life.  The race will long survive that is thus discreet.</p>

<p>Our course this morning lay between the territories of Merrimack, on the west, and Litchfield, once called Brenton's Farm, on the east, which townships were anciently the Indian Naticook.  Brenton was a fur-trader among the Indians, and these lands were granted to him in 1656.  The latter township contains about five hundred inhabitants, of whom, however, we saw none, and but few of their dwellings.  Being on the river, whose banks are always high and generally conceal the few houses, the country appeared much more wild and primitive than to the traveller on the neighboring roads.  The river is by far the most attractive highway, and those boatmen who have spent twenty or twenty-five years on it must have had a much fairer, more wild, and memorable experience than the dusty and jarring one of the teamster who has driven, during the same time, on the roads which run parallel with the stream.  As one ascends the Merrimack he rarely sees a village, but for the most part alternate wood and pasture lands, and sometimes a field of corn or potatoes, of rye or oats or English grass, with a few straggling apple-trees, and, at still longer intervals, a farmer's house.  The soil, excepting the best of the interval, is commonly as light and sandy as a patriot could desire.  Sometimes this forenoon the country appeared in its primitive state, and as if the Indian still inhabited it, and, again, as if many free, new settlers occupied it, their slight fences straggling down to the water's edge; and the barking of dogs, and even the prattle of children, were heard, and smoke was seen to go up from some hearthstone, and the banks were divided into patches of pasture, mowing, tillage, and woodland.  But when the river spread out broader, with an uninhabited islet, or a long, low sandy shore which ran on single and devious, not answering to its opposite, but far off as if it were sea-shore or single coast, and the land no longer nursed the river in its bosom, but they conversed as equals, the rustling leaves with rippling waves, and few fences were seen, but high oak woods on one side, and large herds of cattle, and all tracks seemed a point to one centre behind some statelier grove,—we imagined that the river flowed through an extensive manor, and that the few inhabitants were retainers to a lord, and a feudal state of things prevailed.</p>

<p>When there was a suitable reach, we caught sight of the Goffstown mountain, the Indian Uncannunuc, rising before us on the west side.  It was a calm and beautiful day, with only a slight zephyr to ripple the surface of the water, and rustle the woods on shore, and just warmth enough to prove the kindly disposition of Nature to her children.  With buoyant spirits and vigorous impulses we tossed our boat rapidly along into the very middle of this forenoon.  The fish-hawk sailed and screamed overhead.  The chipping or striped squirrel, <em>Sciurus striatus</em> (<em>Tamias Lysteri</em>, Aud.), sat upon the end of some Virginia fence or rider reaching over the stream, twirling a green nut with one paw, as in a lathe, while the other held it fast against its incisors as chisels.  Like an independent russet leaf, with a will of its own, rustling whither it could; now under the fence, now over it, now peeping at the voyageurs through a crack with only its tail visible, now at its lunch deep in the toothsome kernel, and now a rod off playing at hide-and-seek, with the nut stowed away in its chops, where were half a dozen more besides, extending its cheeks to a ludicrous breadth,—as if it were devising through what safe valve of frisk or somerset to let its superfluous life escape; the stream passing harmlessly off, even while it sits, in constant electric flashes through its tail.  And now with a chuckling squeak it dives into the root of a hazel, and we see no more of it.  Or the larger red squirrel or chickaree, sometimes called the Hudson Bay squirrel (<em>Scriurus Hudsonius</em>), gave warning of our approach by that peculiar alarum of his, like the winding up of some strong clock, in the top of a pine-tree, and dodged behind its stem, or leaped from tree to tree with such caution and adroitness, as if much depended on the fidelity of his scout, running along the white-pine boughs sometimes twenty rods by our side, with such speed, and by such unerring routes, as if it were some well-worn familiar path to him; and presently, when we have passed, he returns to his work of cutting off the pine-cones, and letting them fall to the ground.</p>

<p>We passed Cromwell's Falls, the first we met with on this river, this forenoon, by means of locks, without using our wheels.  These falls are the Nesenkeag of the Indians.  Great Nesenkeag Stream comes in on the right just above, and Little Nesenkeag some distance below, both in Litchfield.  We read in the Gazetteer, under the head of Merrimack, that "The first house in this town was erected on the margin of the river [soon after 1665] for a house of traffic with the Indians.  For some time one Cromwell carried on a lucrative trade with them, weighing their furs with his foot, till, enraged at his supposed or real deception, they formed the resolution to murder him.  This intention being communicated to Cromwell, he buried his wealth and made his escape.  Within a few hours after his flight, a party of the Penacook tribe arrived, and, not finding the object of their resentment, burnt his habitation." Upon the top of the high bank here, close to the river, was still to be seen his cellar, now overgrown with trees.  It was a convenient spot for such a traffic, at the foot of the first falls above the settlements, and commanding a pleasant view up the river, where he could see the Indians coming down with their furs.  The lock-man told us that his shovel and tongs had been ploughed up here, and also a stone with his name on it.  But we will not vouch for the truth of this story.  In the New Hampshire Historical Collections for 1815 it says, "Some time after pewter was found in the well, and an iron pot and trammel in the sand; the latter are preserved."  These were the traces of the white trader.  On the opposite bank, where it jutted over the stream cape-wise, we picked up four arrow-heads and a small Indian tool made of stone, as soon as we had climbed it, where plainly there had once stood a wigwam of the Indians with whom Cromwell traded, and who fished and hunted here before he came.</p>

<p>As usual the gossips have not been silent respecting Cromwell's buried wealth, and it is said that some years ago a farmer's plough, not far from here, slid over a flat stone which emitted a hollow sound, and, on its being raised, a small hole six inches in diameter was discovered, stoned about, from which a sum of money was taken.  The lock-man told us another similar story about a farmer in a neighboring town, who had been a poor man, but who suddenly bought a good farm, and was well to do in the world, and, when he was questioned, did not give a satisfactory account of the matter; how few, alas, could!  This caused his hired man to remember that one day, as they were ploughing together, the plough struck something, and his employer, going back to look, concluded not to go round again, saying that the sky looked rather lowering, and so put up his team.  The like urgency has caused many things to be remembered which never transpired.  The truth is, there is money buried everywhere, and you have only to go to work to find it.</p>

<p>Not far from these falls stands an oak-tree, on the interval, about a quarter of a mile from the river, on the farm of a Mr. Lund, which was pointed out to us as the spot where French, the leader of the party which went in pursuit of the Indians from Dunstable, was killed.  Farwell dodged them in the thick woods near.  It did not look as if men had ever had to run for their lives on this now open and peaceful interval.</p>

<p>Here too was another extensive desert by the side of the road in Litchfield, visible from the bank of the river.  The sand was blown off in some places to the depth of ten or twelve feet, leaving small grotesque hillocks of that height, where there was a clump of bushes firmly rooted.  Thirty or forty years ago, as we were told, it was a sheep-pasture, but the sheep, being worried by the fleas, began to paw the ground, till they broke the sod, and so the sand began to blow, till now it had extended over forty or fifty acres.  This evil might easily have been remedied, at first, by spreading birches with their leaves on over the sand, and fastening them down with stakes, to break the wind.  The fleas bit the sheep, and the sheep bit the ground, and the sore had spread to this extent.  It is astonishing what a great sore a little scratch breedeth.  Who knows but Sahara, where caravans and cities are buried, began with the bite of an African flea?  This poor globe, how it must itch in many places!  Will no god be kind enough to spread a salve of birches over its sores?  Here too we noticed where the Indians had gathered a heap of stones, perhaps for their council-fire, which, by their weight having prevented the sand under them from blowing away, were left on the summit of a mound.  They told us that arrow-heads, and also bullets of lead and iron, had been found here.  We noticed several other sandy tracts in our voyage; and the course of the Merrimack can be traced from the nearest mountain by its yellow sandbanks, though the river itself is for the most part invisible.  Lawsuits, as we hear, have in some cases grown out of these causes.  Railroads have been made through certain irritable districts, breaking their sod, and so have set the sand to blowing, till it has converted fertile farms into deserts, and the company has had to pay the damages.</p>

<p>This sand seemed to us the connecting link between land and water.  It was a kind of water on which you could walk, and you could see the ripple-marks on its surface, produced by the winds, precisely like those at the bottom of a brook or lake.  We had read that Mussulmen are permitted by the Koran to perform their ablutions in sand when they cannot get water, a necessary indulgence in Arabia, and we now understood the propriety of this provision.</p>

<p>Plum Island, at the mouth of this river, to whose formation, perhaps, these very banks have sent their contribution, is a similar desert of drifting sand, of various colors, blown into graceful curves by the wind.  It is a mere sand-bar exposed, stretching nine miles parallel to the coast, and, exclusive of the marsh on the inside, rarely more than half a mile wide.  There are but half a dozen houses on it, and it is almost without a tree, or a sod, or any green thing with which a countryman is familiar.  The thin vegetation stands half buried in sand, as in drifting snow.  The only shrub, the beach-plum, which gives the island its name, grows but a few feet high; but this is so abundant that parties of a hundred at once come from the main-land and down the Merrimack, in September, pitch their tents, and gather the plums, which are good to eat raw and to preserve.  The graceful and delicate beach-pea, too, grows abundantly amid the sand, and several strange, moss-like and succulent plants.  The island for its whole length is scalloped into low hills, not more than twenty feet high, by the wind, and, excepting a faint trail on the edge of the marsh, is as trackless as Sahara.  There are dreary bluffs of sand and valleys ploughed by the wind, where you might expect to discover the bones of a caravan.  Schooners come from Boston to load with the sand for masons' uses, and in a few hours the wind obliterates all traces of their work.  Yet you have only to dig a foot or two anywhere to come to fresh water; and you are surprised to learn that woodchucks abound here, and foxes are found, though you see not where they can burrow or hide themselves.  I have walked down the whole length of its broad beach at low tide, at which time alone you can find a firm ground to walk on, and probably Massachusetts does not furnish a more grand and dreary walk.  On the seaside there are only a distant sail and a few coots to break the grand monotony.  A solitary stake stuck up, or a sharper sand-hill than usual, is remarkable as a landmark for miles; while for music you hear only the ceaseless sound of the surf, and the dreary peep of the beach-birds.</p>

<p>There were several canal-boats at Cromwell's Falls passing through the locks, for which we waited.  In the forward part of one stood a brawny New Hampshire man, leaning on his pole, bareheaded and in shirt and trousers only, a rude Apollo of a man, coming down from that "vast uplandish country" to the main; of nameless age, with flaxen hair, and vigorous, weather-bleached countenance, in whose wrinkles the sun still lodged, as little touched by the heats and frosts and withering cares of life as a maple of the mountain; an undressed, unkempt, uncivil man, with whom we parleyed awhile, and parted not without a sincere interest in one another.  His humanity was genuine and instinctive, and his rudeness only a manner.  He inquired, just as we were passing out of earshot, if we had killed anything, and we shouted after him that we had shot a <em>buoy</em>, and could see him for a long while scratching his head in vain to know if he had heard aright.</p>

<p>There is reason in the distinction of civil and uncivil.  The manners are sometimes so rough a rind that we doubt whether they cover any core or sap-wood at all.  We sometimes meet uncivil men, children of Amazons, who dwell by mountain paths, and are said to be inhospitable to strangers; whose salutation is as rude as the grasp of their brawny hands, and who deal with men as unceremoniously as they are wont to deal with the elements.  They need only to extend their clearings, and let in more sunlight, to seek out the southern slopes of the hills, from which they may look down on the civil plain or ocean, and temper their diet duly with the cereal fruits, consuming less wild meat and acorns, to become like the inhabitants of cities.  A true politeness does not result from any hasty and artificial polishing, it is true, but grows naturally in characters of the right grain and quality, through a long fronting of men and events, and rubbing on good and bad fortune.  Perhaps I can tell a tale to the purpose while the lock is filling,—for our voyage this forenoon furnishes but few incidents of importance.</p>

<p>Early one summer morning I had left the shores of the Connecticut, and for the livelong day travelled up the bank of a river, which came in from the west; now looking down on the stream, foaming and rippling through the forest a mile off, from the hills over which the road led, and now sitting on its rocky brink and dipping my feet in its rapids, or bathing adventurously in mid-channel.  The hills grew more and more frequent, and gradually swelled into mountains as I advanced, hemming in the course of the river, so that at last I could not see where it came from, and was at liberty to imagine the most wonderful meanderings and descents.  At noon I slept on the grass in the shade of a maple, where the river had found a broader channel than usual, and was spread out shallow, with frequent sand-bars exposed.  In the names of the towns I recognized some which I had long ago read on teamsters' wagons, that had come from far up country; quiet, uplandish towns, of mountainous fame.  I walked along, musing and enchanted, by rows of sugar-maples, through the small and uninquisitive villages, and sometimes was pleased with the sight of a boat drawn up on a sand-bar, where there appeared no inhabitants to use it.  It seemed, however, as essential to the river as a fish, and to lend a certain dignity to it.  It was like the trout of mountain streams to the fishes of the sea, or like the young of the land-crab born far in the interior, who have never yet heard the sound of the ocean's surf.  The hills approached nearer and nearer to the stream, until at last they closed behind me, and I found myself just before nightfall in a romantic and retired valley, about half a mile in length, and barely wide enough for the stream at its bottom.  I thought that there could be no finer site for a cottage among mountains.  You could anywhere run across the stream on the rocks, and its constant murmuring would quiet the passions of mankind forever.  Suddenly the road, which seemed aiming for the mountain-side, turned short to the left, and another valley opened, concealing the former, and of the same character with it.  It was the most remarkable and pleasing scenery I had ever seen.  I found here a few mild and hospitable inhabitants, who, as the day was not quite spent, and I was anxious to improve the light, directed me four or five miles farther on my way to the dwelling of a man whose name was Rice, who occupied the last and highest of the valleys that lay in my path, and who, they said, was a rather rude and uncivil man.  But "what is a foreign country to those who have science?  Who is a stranger to those who have the habit of speaking kindly?"</p>

<p>At length, as the sun was setting behind the mountains in a still darker and more solitary vale, I reached the dwelling of this man.  Except for the narrowness of the plain, and that the stones were solid granite, it was the counterpart of that retreat to which Belphoebe bore the wounded Timias,—</p>

<p>                        "In a pleasant glade,<br/>

     With mountains round about environed,<br/>

     And mighty woods, which did the valley shade,<br/>

     And like a stately theatre it made,<br/>

     Spreading itself into a spacious plain;<br/>

     And in the midst a little river played<br/>

     Amongst the pumy stones which seemed to plain,<br/>

     With gentle murmur, that his course they did restrain."<br/>
</p>

<p>I observed, as I drew near, that he was not so rude as I had anticipated, for he kept many cattle, and dogs to watch them, and I saw where he had made maple-sugar on the sides of the mountains, and above all distinguished the voices of children mingling with the murmur of the torrent before the door.  As I passed his stable I met one whom I supposed to be a hired man, attending to his cattle, and I inquired if they entertained travellers at that house.  "Sometimes we do," he answered, gruffly, and immediately went to the farthest stall from me, and I perceived that it was Rice himself whom I had addressed.  But pardoning this incivility to the wildness of the scenery, I bent my steps to the house.  There was no sign-post before it, nor any of the usual invitations to the traveller, though I saw by the road that many went and came there, but the owner's name only was fastened to the outside; a sort of implied and sullen invitation, as I thought.  I passed from room to room without meeting any one, till I came to what seemed the guests' apartment, which was neat, and even had an air of refinement about it, and I was glad to find a map against the wall which would direct me on my journey on the morrow.  At length I heard a step in a distant apartment, which was the first I had entered, and went to see if the landlord had come in; but it proved to be only a child, one of those whose voices I had heard, probably his son, and between him and me stood in the doorway a large watch-dog, which growled at me, and looked as if he would presently spring, but the boy did not speak to him; and when I asked for a glass of water, he briefly said, "It runs in the corner." So I took a mug from the counter and went out of doors, and searched round the corner of the house, but could find neither well nor spring, nor any water but the stream which ran all along the front.  I came back, therefore, and, setting down the mug, asked the child if the stream was good to drink; whereupon he seized the mug, and, going to the corner of the room, where a cool spring which issued from the mountain behind trickled through a pipe into the apartment, filled it, and drank, and gave it to me empty again, and, calling to the dog, rushed out of doors.  Erelong some of the hired men made their appearance, and drank at the spring, and lazily washed themselves and combed their hair in silence, and some sat down as if weary, and fell asleep in their seats.  But all the while I saw no women, though I sometimes heard a bustle in that part of the house from which the spring came.</p>

<p>At length Rice himself came in, for it was now dark, with an ox-whip in his hand, breathing hard, and he too soon settled down into his seat not far from me, as if, now that his day's work was done, he had no farther to travel, but only to digest his supper at his leisure.  When I asked him if he could give me a bed, he said there was one ready, in such a tone as implied that I ought to have known it, and the less said about that the better.  So far so good.  And yet he continued to look at me as if he would fain have me say something further like a traveller.  I remarked, that it was a wild and rugged country he inhabited, and worth coming many miles to see.  "Not so very rough neither," said he, and appealed to his men to bear witness to the breadth and smoothness of his fields, which consisted in all of one small interval, and to the size of his crops; "and if we have some hills," added he, "there's no better pasturage anywhere." I then asked if this place was the one I had heard of, calling it by a name I had seen on the map, or if it was a certain other; and he answered, gruffly, that it was neither the one nor the other; that he had settled it and cultivated it, and made it what it was, and I could know nothing about it.  Observing some guns and other implements of hunting hanging on brackets around the room, and his hounds now sleeping on the floor, I took occasion to change the discourse, and inquired if there was much game in that country, and he answered this question more graciously, having some glimmering of my drift; but when I inquired if there were any bears, he answered impatiently that he was no more in danger of losing his sheep than his neighbors; he had tamed and civilized that region.  After a pause, thinking of my journey on the morrow, and the few hours of daylight in that hollow and mountainous country, which would require me to be on my way betimes, I remarked that the day must be shorter by an hour there than on the neighboring plains; at which he gruffly asked what I knew about it, and affirmed that he had as much daylight as his neighbors; he ventured to say, the days were longer there than where I lived, as I should find if I stayed; that in some way, I could not be expected to understand how, the sun came over the mountains half an hour earlier, and stayed half an hour later there than on the neighboring plains.  And more of like sort he said.  He was, indeed, as rude as a fabled satyr.  But I suffered him to pass for what he was,—for why should I quarrel with nature?—and was even pleased at the discovery of such a singular natural phenomenon.  I dealt with him as if to me all manners were indifferent, and he had a sweet, wild way with him.  I would not question nature, and I would rather have him as he was than as I would have him.  For I had come up here not for sympathy, or kindness, or society, but for novelty and adventure, and to see what nature had produced here.  I therefore did not repel his rudeness, but quite innocently welcomed it all, and knew how to appreciate it, as if I were reading in an old drama a part well sustained.  He was indeed a coarse and sensual man, and, as I have said, uncivil, but he had his just quarrel with nature and mankind, I have no doubt, only he had no artificial covering to his ill-humors.  He was earthy enough, but yet there was good soil in him, and even a long-suffering Saxon probity at bottom.  If you could represent the case to him, he would not let the race die out in him, like a red Indian.</p>

<p>At length I told him that he was a fortunate man, and I trusted that he was grateful for so much light; and, rising, said I would take a lamp, and that I would pay him then for my lodging, for I expected to recommence my journey even as early as the sun rose in his country; but he answered in haste, and this time civilly, that I should not fail to find some of his household stirring, however early, for they were no sluggards, and I could take my breakfast with them before I started, if I chose; and as he lighted the lamp I detected a gleam of true hospitality and ancient civility, a beam of pure and even gentle humanity, from his bleared and moist eyes.  It was a look more intimate with me, and more explanatory, than any words of his could have been if he had tried to his dying day.  It was more significant than any Rice of those parts could even comprehend, and long anticipated this man's culture,—a glance of his pure genius, which did not much enlighten him, but did impress and rule him for the moment, and faintly constrain his voice and manner.  He cheerfully led the way to my apartment, stepping over the limbs of his men, who were asleep on the floor in an intervening chamber, and showed me a clean and comfortable bed.  For many pleasant hours after the household was asleep I sat at the open window, for it was a sultry night, and heard the little river</p>

<p>   "Amongst the pumy stones, which seemed to plain,<br/>

     With gentle murmur, that his course they did restrain."<br/>
</p>

<p>But I arose as usual by starlight the next morning, before my host, or his men, or even his dogs, were awake; and, having left a ninepence on the counter, was already half-way over the mountain with the sun before they had broken their fast.</p>

<p>Before I had left the country of my host, while the first rays of the sun slanted over the mountains, as I stopped by the wayside to gather some raspberries, a very old man, not far from a hundred, came along with a milking-pail in his hand, and turning aside began to pluck the berries near me:—</p>

<p>          "His reverend locks<br/>

     In comelye curles did wave;<br/>

     And on his aged temples grew<br/>

        The blossoms of the grave."<br/>
</p>

<p>But when I inquired the way, he answered in a low, rough voice, without looking up or seeming to regard my presence, which I imputed to his years; and presently, muttering to himself, he proceeded to collect his cows in a neighboring pasture; and when he had again returned near to the wayside, he suddenly stopped, while his cows went on before, and, uncovering his head, prayed aloud in the cool morning air, as if he had forgotten this exercise before, for his daily bread, and also that He who letteth his rain fall on the just and on the unjust, and without whom not a sparrow falleth to the ground, would not neglect the stranger (meaning me), and with even more direct and personal applications, though mainly according to the long-established formula common to lowlanders and the inhabitants of mountains.  When he had done praying, I made bold to ask him if he had any cheese in his hut which he would sell me, but he answered without looking up, and in the same low and repulsive voice as before, that they did not make any, and went to milking.  It is written, "The stranger who turneth away from a house with disappointed hopes, leaveth there his own offences, and departeth, taking with him all the good actions of the owner."</p>

<p>Being now fairly in the stream of this week's commerce, we began to meet with boats more frequently, and hailed them from time to time with the freedom of sailors.  The boatmen appeared to lead an easy and contented life, and we thought that we should prefer their employment ourselves to many professions which are much more sought after.  They suggested how few circumstances are necessary to the well-being and serenity of man, how indifferent all employments are, and that any may seem noble and poetic to the eyes of men, if pursued with sufficient buoyancy and freedom.  With liberty and pleasant weather, the simplest occupation, any unquestioned country mode of life which detains us in the open air, is alluring.  The man who picks peas steadily for a living is more than respectable, he is even envied by his shop-worn neighbors.  We are as happy as the birds when our Good Genius permits us to pursue any out-door work, without a sense of dissipation.  Our penknife glitters in the sun; our voice is echoed by yonder wood; if an oar drops, we are fain to let it drop again.</p>

<p>The canal-boat is of very simple construction, requiring but little ship-timber, and, as we were told, costs about two hundred dollars.  They are managed by two men.  In ascending the stream they use poles fourteen or fifteen feet long, pointed with iron, walking about one third the length of the boat from the forward end.  Going down, they commonly keep in the middle of the stream, using an oar at each end; or if the wind is favorable they raise their broad sail, and have only to steer.  They commonly carry down wood or bricks,—fifteen or sixteen cords of wood, and as many thousand bricks, at a time,—and bring back stores for the country, consuming two or three days each way between Concord and Charlestown.  They sometimes pile the wood so as to leave a shelter in one part where they may retire from the rain.  One can hardly imagine a more healthful employment, or one more favorable to contemplation and the observation of nature.  Unlike the mariner, they have the constantly varying panorama of the shore to relieve the monotony of their labor, and it seemed to us that as they thus glided noiselessly from town to town, with all their furniture about them, for their very homestead is a movable, they could comment on the character of the inhabitants with greater advantage and security to themselves than the traveller in a coach, who would be unable to indulge in such broadsides of wit and humor in so small a vessel for fear of the recoil.  They are not subject to great exposure, like the lumberers of Maine, in any weather, but inhale the healthfullest breezes, being slightly encumbered with clothing, frequently with the head and feet bare.  When we met them at noon as they were leisurely descending the stream, their busy commerce did not look like toil, but rather like some ancient Oriental game still played on a large scale, as the game of chess, for instance, handed down to this generation.  From morning till night, unless the wind is so fair that his single sail will suffice without other labor than steering, the boatman walks backwards and forwards on the side of his boat, now stooping with his shoulder to the pole, then drawing it back slowly to set it again, meanwhile moving steadily forward through an endless valley and an everchanging scenery, now distinguishing his course for a mile or two, and now shut in by a sudden turn of the river in a small woodland lake.  All the phenomena which surround him are simple and grand, and there is something impressive, even majestic, in the very motion he causes, which will naturally be communicated to his own character, and he feels the slow, irresistible movement under him with pride, as if it were his own energy.</p>

<p>The news spread like wildfire among us youths, when formerly, once in a year or two, one of these boats came up the Concord River, and was seen stealing mysteriously through the meadows and past the village.  It came and departed as silently as a cloud, without noise or dust, and was witnessed by few.  One summer day this huge traveller might be seen moored at some meadow's wharf, and another summer day it was not there.  Where precisely it came from, or who these men were who knew the rocks and soundings better than we who bathed there, we could never tell.  We knew some river's bay only, but they took rivers from end to end.  They were a sort of fabulous river-men to us.  It was inconceivable by what sort of mediation any mere landsman could hold communication with them.  Would they heave to, to gratify his wishes?  No, it was favor enough to know faintly of their destination, or the time of their possible return.  I have seen them in the summer when the stream ran low, mowing the weeds in mid-channel, and with hayers' jests cutting broad swaths in three feet of water, that they might make a passage for their scow, while the grass in long windrows was carried down the stream, undried by the rarest hay-weather.  We admired unweariedly how their vessel would float, like a huge chip, sustaining so many casks of lime, and thousands of bricks, and such heaps of iron ore, with wheelbarrows aboard, and that, when we stepped on it, it did not yield to the pressure of our feet.  It gave us confidence in the prevalence of the law of buoyancy, and we imagined to what infinite uses it might be put.  The men appeared to lead a kind of life on it, and it was whispered that they slept aboard.  Some affirmed that it carried sail, and that such winds blew here as filled the sails of vessels on the ocean; which again others much doubted.  They had been seen to sail across our Fair Haven bay by lucky fishers who were out, but unfortunately others were not there to see.  We might then say that our river was navigable,—why not?  In after-years I read in print, with no little satisfaction, that it was thought by some that, with a little expense in removing rocks and deepening the channel, "there might be a profitable inland navigation." <em>I</em> then lived some-where to tell of.</p>

<p>Such is Commerce, which shakes the cocoa-nut and bread-fruit tree in the remotest isle, and sooner or later dawns on the duskiest and most simple-minded savage.  If we may be pardoned the digression, who can help being affected at the thought of the very fine and slight, but positive relation, in which the savage inhabitants of some remote isle stand to the mysterious white mariner, the child of the sun?—as if <em>we</em> were to have dealings with an animal higher in the scale of being than ourselves.  It is a barely recognized fact to the natives that he exists, and has his home far away somewhere, and is glad to buy their fresh fruits with his superfluous commodities.  Under the same catholic sun glances his white ship over Pacific waves into their smooth bays, and the poor savage's paddle gleams in the air.</p>

<p>     Man's little acts are grand,<br/>

     Beheld from land to land,<br/>

     There as they lie in time,<br/>

     Within their native clime<br/>

          Ships with the noontide weigh,<br/>

          And glide before its ray<br/>

          To some retired bay,<br/>

          Their haunt,<br/>

          Whence, under tropic sun,<br/>

          Again they run,<br/>

          Bearing gum Senegal and Tragicant.<br/>

     For this was ocean meant,<br/>

     For this the sun was sent,<br/>

     And moon was lent,<br/>

     And winds in distant caverns pent.<br/>
</p>

<p>Since our voyage the railroad on the bank has been extended, and there is now but little boating on the Merrimack.  All kinds of produce and stores were formerly conveyed by water, but now nothing is carried up the stream, and almost wood and bricks alone are carried down, and these are also carried on the railroad.  The locks are fast wearing out, and will soon be impassable, since the tolls will not pay the expense of repairing them, and so in a few years there will be an end of boating on this river.  The boating at present is principally between Merrimack and Lowell, or Hooksett and Manchester.  They make two or three trips in a week, according to wind and weather, from Merrimack to Lowell and back, about twenty-five miles each way.  The boatman comes singing in to shore late at night, and moors his empty boat, and gets his supper and lodging in some house near at hand, and again early in the morning, by starlight perhaps, he pushes away up stream, and, by a shout, or the fragment of a song, gives notice of his approach to the lock-man, with whom he is to take his breakfast.  If he gets up to his wood-pile before noon he proceeds to load his boat, with the help of his single "hand," and is on his way down again before night.  When he gets to Lowell he unloads his boat, and gets his receipt for his cargo, and, having heard the news at the public house at Middlesex or elsewhere, goes back with his empty boat and his receipt in his pocket to the owner, and to get a new load.  We were frequently advertised of their approach by some faint sound behind us, and looking round saw them a mile off, creeping stealthily up the side of the stream like alligators.  It was pleasant to hail these sailors of the Merrimack from time to time, and learn the news which circulated with them.  We imagined that the sun shining on their bare heads had stamped a liberal and public character on their most private thoughts.</p>

<p>The open and sunny interval still stretched away from the river sometimes by two or more terraces, to the distant hill-country, and when we climbed the bank we commonly found an irregular copse-wood skirting the river, the primitive having floated down-stream long ago to——the "King's navy." Sometimes we saw the river-road a quarter or half a mile distant, and the particolored Concord stage, with its cloud of dust, its van of earnest travelling faces, and its rear of dusty trunks, reminding us that the country had its places of rendezvous for restless Yankee men.  There dwelt along at considerable distances on this interval a quiet agricultural and pastoral people, with every house its well, as we sometimes proved, and every household, though never so still and remote it appeared in the noontide, its dinner about these times.  There they lived on, those New England people, farmer lives, father and grandfather and great-grandfather, on and on without noise, keeping up tradition, and expecting, beside fair weather and abundant harvests, we did not learn what.  They were contented to live, since it was so contrived for them, and where their lines had fallen.</p>

<p>     Our uninquiring corpses lie more low<br/>

     Than our life's curiosity doth go.<br/>
</p>

<p>Yet these men had no need to travel to be as wise as Solomon in all his glory, so similar are the lives of men in all countries, and fraught with the same homely experiences.  One half the world <em>knows</em> how the other half lives.</p>

<p>About noon we passed a small village in Merrimack at Thornton's Ferry, and tasted of the waters of Naticook Brook on the same side, where French and his companions, whose grave we saw in Dunstable, were ambuscaded by the Indians.  The humble village of Litchfield, with its steepleless meeting-house, stood on the opposite or east bank, near where a dense grove of willows backed by maples skirted the shore.  There also we noticed some shagbark-trees, which, as they do not grow in Concord, were as strange a sight to us as the palm would be, whose fruit only we have seen.  Our course now curved gracefully to the north, leaving a low, flat shore on the Merrimack side, which forms a sort of harbor for canal-boats.  We observed some fair elms and particularly large and handsome white-maples standing conspicuously on this interval; and the opposite shore, a quarter of a mile below, was covered with young elms and maples six inches high, which had probably sprung from the seeds which had been washed across.</p>

<p>Some carpenters were at work here mending a scow on the green and sloping bank.  The strokes of their mallets echoed from shore to shore, and up and down the river, and their tools gleamed in the sun a quarter of a mile from us, and we realized that boat-building was as ancient and honorable an art as agriculture, and that there might be a naval as well as a pastoral life.  The whole history of commerce was made manifest in that scow turned bottom upward on the shore.  Thus did men begin to go down upon the sea in ships; <em>quaeque diu steterant in montibus altis, Fluctibus ignotis insultavêre carinae;</em> "and keels which had long stood on high mountains careered insultingly (<em>insultavêre</em>) over unknown waves." (Ovid, Met.  I. 133.) We thought that it would be well for the traveller to build his boat on the bank of a stream, instead of finding a ferry or a bridge.  In the Adventures of Henry the fur-trader, it is pleasant to read that when with his Indians he reached the shore of Ontario, they consumed two days in making two canoes of the bark of the elm-tree, in which to transport themselves to Fort Niagara.  It is a worthy incident in a journey, a delay as good as much rapid travelling.  A good share of our interest in Xenophon's story of his retreat is in the manoeuvres to get the army safely over the rivers, whether on rafts of logs or fagots, or sheep-skins blown up.  And where could they better afford to tarry meanwhile than on the banks of a river?</p>

<p>As we glided past at a distance, these out-door workmen appeared to have added some dignity to their labor by its very publicness.  It was a part of the industry of nature, like the work of hornets and mud-wasps.</p>

<p>      The waves slowly beat,<br/>

      Just to keep the noon sweet,<br/>

      And no sound is floated o'er,<br/>

      Save the mallet on shore,<br/>

      Which echoing on high<br/>

      Seems a-calking the sky.<br/>
</p>

<p>The haze, the sun's dust of travel, had a Lethean influence on the land and its inhabitants, and all creatures resigned themselves to float upon the inappreciable tides of nature.</p>

<p>     Woof of the sun, ethereal gauze,<br/>

     Woven of Nature's richest stuffs,<br/>

     Visible heat, air-water, and dry sea,<br/>

     Last conquest of the eye;<br/>

     Toil of the day displayed sun-dust,<br/>

     Aerial surf upon the shores of earth.<br/>

     Ethereal estuary, frith of light,<br/>

     Breakers of air, billows of heat<br/>

     Fine summer spray on inland seas;<br/>

     Bird of the sun, transparent-winged<br/>

     Owlet of noon, soft-pinioned,<br/>

     From heath or stubble rising without song;<br/>

     Establish thy serenity o'er the fields<br/>
</p>

<p>The routine which is in the sunshine and the finest days, as that which has conquered and prevailed, commends itself to us by its very antiquity and apparent solidity and necessity.  Our weakness needs it, and our strength uses it.  We cannot draw on our boots without bracing ourselves against it.  If there were but one erect and solid standing tree in the woods, all creatures would go to rub against it and make sure of their footing.  During the many hours which we spend in this waking sleep, the hand stands still on the face of the clock, and we grow like corn in the night.  Men are as busy as the brooks or bees, and postpone everything to their business; as carpenters discuss politics between the strokes of the hammer while they are shingling a roof.</p>

<p>This noontide was a fit occasion to make some pleasant harbor, and there read the journal of some voyageur like ourselves, not too moral nor inquisitive, and which would not disturb the noon; or else some old classic, the very flower of all reading, which we had postponed to such a season</p>

<p>     "Of Syrian peace, immortal leisure."</p>

<p>But, alas, our chest, like the cabin of a coaster, contained only its well-thumbed "Navigator" for all literature, and we were obliged to draw on our memory for these things.</p>

<p>We naturally remembered Alexander Henry's Adventures here, as a sort of classic among books of American travel.  It contains scenery and rough sketching of men and incidents enough to inspire poets for many years, and to my fancy is as full of sounding names as any page of history,—Lake Winnipeg, Hudson Bay, Ottaway, and portages innumerable; Chipeways, Gens de Terres, Les Pilleurs, The Weepers; with reminiscences of Hearne's journey, and the like; an immense and shaggy but sincere country, summer and winter, adorned with chains of lakes and rivers, covered with snows, with hemlocks, and fir-trees.  There is a naturalness, an unpretending and cold life in this traveller, as in a Canadian winter, what life was preserved through low temperatures and frontier dangers by furs within a stout heart.  He has truth and moderation worthy of the father of history, which belong only to an intimate experience, and he does not defer too much to literature.  The unlearned traveller may quote his single line from the poets with as good right as the scholar.  He too may speak of the stars, for he sees them shoot perhaps when the astronomer does not.  The good sense of this author is very conspicuous.  He is a traveller who does not exaggerate, but writes for the information of his readers, for science, and for history.  His story is told with as much good faith and directness as if it were a report to his brother traders, or the Directors of the Hudson Bay Company, and is fitly dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks.  It reads like the argument to a great poem on the primitive state of the country and its inhabitants, and the reader imagines what in each case, with the invocation of the Muse, might be sung, and leaves off with suspended interest, as if the full account were to follow.  In what school was this fur-trader educated?  He seems to travel the immense snowy country with such purpose only as the reader who accompanies him, and to the latter's imagination, it is, as it were, momentarily created to be the scene of his adventures.  What is most interesting and valuable in it, however, is not the materials for the history of Pontiac, or Braddock, or the Northwest, which it furnishes; not the <em>annals</em> of the country, but the natural facts, or <em>perennials</em>, which are ever without date.  When out of history the truth shall be extracted, it will have shed its dates like withered leaves.</p>

<p>The Souhegan, or <em>Crooked</em> River, as some translate it, comes in from the west about a mile and a half above Thornton's Ferry.  Babboosuck Brook empties into it near its mouth.  There are said to be some of the finest water privileges in the country still unimproved on the former stream, at a short distance from the Merrimack.  One spring morning, March 22, in the year 1677, an incident occurred on the banks of the river here, which is interesting to us as a slight memorial of an interview between two ancient tribes of men, one of which is now extinct, while the other, though it is still represented by a miserable remnant, has long since disappeared from its ancient hunting-grounds.  A Mr. James Parker, at "Mr. Hinchmanne's farme ner Meremack," wrote thus "to the Honred Governer and Council at Bostown, <em>Hast, Post Hast":</em>—</p>

<p>  "Sagamore Wanalancet come this morning to informe me, and then went to Mr. Tyng's to informe him, that his son being on ye other sid of Meremack river over against Souhegan upon the 22 day of this instant, about tene of the clock in the morning, he discovered 15 Indians on this sid the river, which he soposed to be Mohokes by ther spech.  He called to them; they answered, but he could not understand ther spech; and he having a conow ther in the river, he went to breck his conow that they might not have ani ues of it.  In the mean time they shot about thirty guns at him, and he being much frighted fled, and come home forthwith to Nahamcock [Pawtucket Falls or Lowell], wher ther wigowames now stand."</p>

<p>Penacooks and Mohawks! <em>ubique gentium sunt?</em> In the year 1670, a Mohawk warrior scalped a Naamkeak or else a Wamesit Indian maiden near where Lowell now stands.  She, however, recovered.  Even as late as 1685, John Hogkins, a Penacook Indian, who describes his grandfather as having lived "at place called Malamake rever, other name chef Natukkog and Panukkog, that one rever great many names," wrote thus to the governor:—</p>

<p>                                                 "May 15th, 1685.</p>

<p>  "Honor governor my friend,—</p>

<p>  "You my friend I desire your worship and your power, because I hope you can do som great matters this one.  I am poor and naked and I have no men at my place because I afraid allwayes Mohogs he will kill me every day and night.  If your worship when please pray help me you no let Mohogs kill me at my place at Malamake river called Pannukkog and Natukkog, I will submit your worship and your power.  And now I want pouder and such alminishon shatt and guns, because I have forth at my hom and I plant theare.</p>

<p>  "This all Indian hand, but pray you do consider your humble servant,</p>

<p>                                                <cite>John Hogkins</cite>"</p>

<p>Signed also by Simon Detogkom, King Hary, Sam Linis, Mr. Jorge Rodunnonukgus, John Owamosimmin, and nine other Indians, with their marks against their names.</p>

<p>But now, one hundred and fifty-four years having elapsed since the date of this letter, we went unalarmed on our way without "brecking" our "conow," reading the New England Gazetteer, and seeing no traces of "Mohogs" on the banks.</p>

<p>The Souhegan, though a rapid river, seemed to-day to have borrowed its character from the noon.</p>

<p>     Where gleaming fields of haze<br/>

     Meet the voyageur's gaze,<br/>

     And above, the heated air<br/>

     Seems to make a river there,<br/>

     The pines stand up with pride<br/>

     By the Souhegan's side,<br/>

     And the hemlock and the larch<br/>

     With their triumphal arch<br/>

     Are waving o'er its march<br/>

        To the sea.<br/>

     No wind stirs its waves,<br/>

     But the spirits of the braves<br/>

        Hov'ring o'er,<br/>

     Whose antiquated graves<br/>

     Its still water laves<br/>

        On the shore.<br/>

     With an Indian's stealthy tread<br/>

     It goes sleeping in its bed,<br/>

     Without joy or grief,<br/>

     Or the rustle of a leaf,<br/>

     Without a ripple or a billow,<br/>

     Or the sigh of a willow,<br/>

     From the Lyndeboro' hills<br/>

     To the Merrimack mills.<br/>

     With a louder din<br/>

     Did its current begin,<br/>

     When melted the snow<br/>

     On the far mountain's brow,<br/>

     And the drops came together<br/>

     In that rainy weather.<br/>

     Experienced river,<br/>

     Hast thou flowed forever?<br/>

     Souhegan soundeth old,<br/>

     But the half is not told,<br/>

     What names hast thou borne,<br/>

     In the ages far gone,<br/>

     When the Xanthus and Meander<br/>

     Commenced to wander,<br/>

     Ere the black bear haunted<br/>

        Thy red forest-floor,<br/>

     Or Nature had planted<br/>

        The pines by thy shore?<br/>
</p>

<p>During the heat of the day, we rested on a large island a mile above the mouth of this river, pastured by a herd of cattle, with steep banks and scattered elms and oaks, and a sufficient channel for canal-boats on each side.  When we made a fire to boil some rice for our dinner, the flames spreading amid the dry grass, and the smoke curling silently upward and casting grotesque shadows on the ground, seemed phenomena of the noon, and we fancied that we progressed up the stream without effort, and as naturally as the wind and tide went down, not outraging the calm days by unworthy bustle or impatience.  The woods on the neighboring shore were alive with pigeons, which were moving south, looking for mast, but now, like ourselves, spending their noon in the shade.  We could hear the slight, wiry, winnowing sound of their wings as they changed their roosts from time to time, and their gentle and tremulous cooing.  They sojourned with us during the noontide, greater travellers far than we.  You may frequently discover a single pair sitting upon the lower branches of the white-pine in the depths of the wood, at this hour of the day, so silent and solitary, and with such a hermit-like appearance, as if they had never strayed beyond its skirts, while the acorn which was gathered in the forests of Maine is still undigested in their crops.  We obtained one of these handsome birds, which lingered too long upon its perch, and plucked and broiled it here with some other game, to be carried along for our supper; for, beside the provisions which we carried with us, we depended mainly on the river and forest for our supply.  It is true, it did not seem to be putting this bird to its right use to pluck off its feathers, and extract its entrails, and broil its carcass on the coals; but we heroically persevered, nevertheless, waiting for further information.  The same regard for Nature which excited our sympathy for her creatures nerved our hands to carry through what we had begun.  For we would be honorable to the party we deserted; we would fulfil fate, and so at length, perhaps, detect the secret innocence of these incessant tragedies which Heaven allows.</p>

<p>     "Too quick resolves do resolution wrong,<br/>

     What, part so soon to be divorced so long?<br/>

     Things to be done are long to be debated;<br/>

     Heaven is not day'd, Repentance is not dated."<br/>
</p>

<p>We are double-edged blades, and every time we whet our virtue the return stroke straps our vice.  Where is the skilful swordsman who can give clean wounds, and not rip up his work with the other edge?</p>

<p>Nature herself has not provided the most graceful end for her creatures.  What becomes of all these birds that people the air and forest for our solacement?  The sparrows seem always <em>chipper</em>, never infirm.  We do not see their bodies lie about.  Yet there is a tragedy at the end of each one of their lives.  They must perish miserably; not one of them is translated.  True, "not a sparrow falleth to the ground without our Heavenly Father's knowledge," but they do fall, nevertheless.</p>

<p>The carcasses of some poor squirrels, however, the same that frisked so merrily in the morning, which we had skinned and embowelled for our dinner, we abandoned in disgust, with tardy humanity, as too wretched a resource for any but starving men.  It was to perpetuate the practice of a barbarous era.  If they had been larger, our crime had been less.  Their small red bodies, little bundles of red tissue, mere gobbets of venison, would not have "fattened fire." With a sudden impulse we threw them away, and washed our hands, and boiled some rice for our dinner.  "Behold the difference between the one who eateth flesh, and him to whom it belonged!  The first hath a momentary enjoyment, whilst the latter is deprived of existence!" "Who would commit so great a crime against a poor animal, who is fed only by the herbs which grow wild in the woods, and whose belly is burnt up with hunger?" We remembered a picture of mankind in the hunter age, chasing hares down the mountains; O me miserable!  Yet sheep and oxen are but larger squirrels, whose hides are saved and meat is salted, whose souls perchance are not so large in proportion to their bodies.</p>

<p>There should always be some flowering and maturing of the fruits of nature in the cooking process.  Some simple dishes recommend themselves to our imaginations as well as palates.  In parched corn, for instance, there is a manifest sympathy between the bursting seed and the more perfect developments of vegetable life.  It is a perfect flower with its petals, like the houstonia or anemone.  On my warm hearth these cerealian blossoms expanded; here is the bank whereon they grew.  Perhaps some such visible blessing would always attend the simple and wholesome repast.</p>

<p>Here was that "pleasant harbor" which we had sighed for, where the weary voyageur could read the journal of some other sailor, whose bark had ploughed, perchance, more famous and classic seas.  At the tables of the gods, after feasting follow music and song; we will recline now under these island trees, and for our minstrel call on</p>

<h5>                            ANACREON.</h5>

<p>     "Nor has he ceased his charming song, for still that lyre,<br/>

     Though he is dead, sleeps not in Hades."<br/>

                                <em>Simonides' Epigram on Anacreon.</em><br/>
</p>

<p>I lately met with an old volume from a London bookshop, containing the Greek Minor Poets, and it was a pleasure to read once more only the words, Orpheus, Linus, Musaeus,—those faint poetic sounds and echoes of a name, dying away on the ears of us modern men; and those hardly more substantial sounds, Mimnermus, Ibycus, Alcaeus, Stesichorus, Menander.  They lived not in vain.  We can converse with these bodiless fames without reserve or personality.</p>

<p>I know of no studies so composing as those of the classical scholar.  When we have sat down to them, life seems as still and serene as if it were very far off, and I believe it is not habitually seen from any common platform so truly and unexaggerated as in the light of literature.  In serene hours we contemplate the tour of the Greek and Latin authors with more pleasure than the traveller does the fairest scenery of Greece or Italy.  Where shall we find a more refined society?  That highway down from Homer and Hesiod to Horace and Juvenal is more attractive than the Appian.  Reading the classics, or conversing with those old Greeks and Latins in their surviving works, is like walking amid the stars and constellations, a high and by way serene to travel.  Indeed, the true scholar will be not a little of an astronomer in his habits.  Distracting cares will not be allowed to obstruct the field of his vision, for the higher regions of literature, like astronomy, are above storm and darkness.</p>

<p>But passing by these rumors of bards, let us pause for a moment at the Teian poet.</p>

<p>There is something strangely modern about him.  He is very easily turned into English.  Is it that our lyric poets have resounded but that lyre, which would sound only light subjects, and which Simonides tells us does not sleep in Hades?  His odes are like gems of pure ivory.  They possess an ethereal and evanescent beauty like summer evenings, &lt;ho chr_e' se noei~n no'ou a'nthei,&gt;—<em>which you must perceive with the flower of the mind</em>,—and show how slight a beauty could be expressed.  You have to consider them, as the stars of lesser magnitude, with the side of the eye, and look aside from them to behold them.  They charm us by their serenity and freedom from exaggeration and passion, and by a certain flower-like beauty, which does not propose itself, but must be approached and studied like a natural object.  But perhaps their chief merit consists in the lightness and yet security of their tread;</p>

<p>     "The young and tender stalk<br/>

     Ne'er bends when <em>they</em> do walk."<br/>
</p>

<p>True, our nerves are never strung by them; it is too constantly the sound of the lyre, and never the note of the trumpet; but they are not gross, as has been presumed, but always elevated above the sensual.</p>

<p>These are some of the best that have come down to us.</p>

<h4>     ON HIS LYRE.</h4>

<p>     I wish to sing the Atridae,<br/>

     And Cadmus I wish to sing;<br/>

     But my lyre sounds<br/>

     Only love with its chords.<br/>

     Lately I changed the strings<br/>

     And all the lyre;<br/>

     And I began to sing the labors<br/>

     Of Hercules; but my lyre<br/>

     Resounded loves.<br/>

     Farewell, henceforth, for me,<br/>

     Heroes! for my lyre<br/>

     Sings only loves.<br/>
</p>

<h5>     TO A SWALLOW.</h5>

<p>     Thou indeed, dear swallow,<br/>

     Yearly going and coming,<br/>

     In summer weavest thy nest,<br/>

     And in winter go'st disappearing<br/>

     Either to Nile or to Memphis.<br/>

     But Love always weaveth<br/>

     His nest in my heart….<br/>
</p>

<h5>     ON A SILVER CUP.</h5>

<p>     Turning the silver,<br/>

     Vulcan, make for me,<br/>

     Not indeed a panoply,<br/>

     For what are battles to me?<br/>

     But a hollow cup,<br/>

     As deep as thou canst<br/>

     And make for me in it<br/>

     Neither stars, nor wagons,<br/>

     Nor sad Orion;<br/>

     What are the Pleiades to me?<br/>

     What the shining Bootes?<br/>

     Make vines for me,<br/>

     And clusters of grapes in it,<br/>

     And of gold Love and Bathyllus<br/>

     Treading the grapes<br/>

     With the fair Lyaeus<br/>
</p>

<h5>     ON HIMSELF.</h5>

<p>     Thou sing'st the affairs of Thebes,<br/>

     And he the battles of Troy,<br/>

     But I of my own defeats.<br/>

     No horse have wasted me,<br/>

     Nor foot, nor ships;<br/>

     But a new and different host,<br/>

     From eyes smiting me.<br/>
</p>

<h4>     TO A DOVE</h4>

<p>     Lovely dove,<br/>

     Whence, whence dost thou fly?<br/>

     Whence, running on air,<br/>

     Dost thou waft and diffuse<br/>

     So many sweet ointments?<br/>

     Who art? What thy errand?—<br/>

     Anacreon sent me<br/>

     To a boy, to Bathyllus,<br/>

     Who lately is ruler and tyrant of all.<br/>

     Cythere has sold me<br/>

     For one little song,<br/>

     And I'm doing this service<br/>

     For Anacreon.<br/>

     And now, as you see,<br/>

     I bear letters from him.<br/>

     And he says that directly<br/>

     He'll make me free,<br/>

     But though he release me,<br/>

     His slave I will tarry with him.<br/>

     For why should I fly<br/>

     Over mountains and fields,<br/>

     And perch upon trees,<br/>

     Eating some wild thing?<br/>

     Now indeed I eat bread,<br/>

     Plucking it from the hands<br/>

     Of Anacreon himself;<br/>

     And he gives me to drink<br/>

     The wine which he tastes,<br/>

     And drinking, I dance,<br/>

     And shadow my master's<br/>

     Face with my wings;<br/>

     And, going to rest,<br/>

     On the lyre itself I sleep.<br/>

     That is all; get thee gone.<br/>

     Thou hast made me more talkative,<br/>

     Man, than a crow.<br/>
</p>

<h5>     ON LOVE.</h5>

<p>     Love walking swiftly,<br/>

     With hyacinthine staff,<br/>

     Bade me to take a run with him;<br/>

     And hastening through swift torrents,<br/>

     And woody places, and over precipices,<br/>

     A water-snake stung me.<br/>

     And my heart leaped up to<br/>

     My mouth, and I should have fainted;<br/>

     But Love fanning my brows<br/>

     With his soft wings, said,<br/>

     Surely, thou art not able to love.<br/>
</p>

<h5>     ON WOMEN.</h5>

<p>     Nature has given horns<br/>

     To bulls, and hoofs to horses,<br/>

     Swiftness to hares,<br/>

     To lions yawning teeth,<br/>

     To fishes swimming,<br/>

     To birds flight,<br/>

     To men wisdom.<br/>

     For woman she had nothing beside;<br/>

     What then does she give? Beauty,—<br/>

     Instead of all sheilds,<br/>

     Instead of all  spears;<br/>

     And she conquers even iron<br/>

     And fire, who is beautiful.<br/>
</p>

<h5>     ON LOVERS.</h5>

<p>     Horses have the mark<br/>

     Of fire on their sides,<br/>

     And some have distinguished<br/>

     The Parthian men by their crests;<br/>

     So I, seeing lovers,<br/>

     Know them at once,<br/>

     For they have a certain slight<br/>

     Brand on their hearts.<br/>
</p>

<h5>     TO A SWALLOW.</h5>

<p>     What dost thou wish me to do to thee,—<br/>

     What, thou loquacious swallow?<br/>

     Dost thou wish me taking thee<br/>

     Thy light pinions to clip?<br/>

     Or rather to pluck out<br/>

     Thy tongue from within,<br/>

     As that Tereus did?<br/>

     Why with thy notes in the dawn<br/>

     Hast thou plundered Bathyllus<br/>

     From my beautiful dreams?<br/>
</p>

<h5>     TO A COLT.</h5>

<p>     Thracian colt, why at me<br/>

     Looking aslant with thy eyes,<br/>

     Dost thou cruelly flee,<br/>

     And think that I know nothing wise?<br/>

     Know I could well<br/>

     Put the bridle on thee,<br/>

     And holding the reins, turn<br/>

     Round the bounds of the course.<br/>

     But now thou browsest the meads,<br/>

     And gambolling lightly dost play,<br/>

     For thou hast no skilful horseman<br/>

     Mounted upon thy back.<br/>
</p>

<h5>     CUPID WOUNDED.</h5>

<p>     Love once among roses<br/>

     Saw not<br/>

     A sleeping bee, but was stung;<br/>

     And being wounded in the finger<br/>

     Of his hand, cried for pain.<br/>

     Running as well as flying<br/>

     To the beautiful Venus,<br/>

     I am killed, mother, said he,<br/>

     I am killed, and I die.<br/>

     A little serpent has stung me,<br/>

     Winged, which they call<br/>

     A bee,—the husbandmen.<br/>

     And she said, If the sting<br/>

     Of a bee afflicts you,<br/>

     How, think you, are they afflicted,<br/>

     Love, whom you smite?<br/>
</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, for we had lingered long on the island, we raised our sail for the first time, and for a short hour the southwest wind was our ally; but it did not please Heaven to abet us along.  With one sail raised we swept slowly up the eastern side of the stream, steering clear of the rocks, while, from the top of a hill which formed the opposite bank, some lumberers were rolling down timber to be rafted down the stream.  We could see their axes and levers gleaming in the sun, and the logs came down with a dust and a rumbling sound, which was reverberated through the woods beyond us on our side, like the roar of artillery.  But Zephyr soon took us out of sight and hearing of this commerce.  Having passed Read's Ferry, and another island called McGaw's Island, we reached some rapids called Moore's Falls, and entered on "that section of the river, nine miles in extent, converted, by law, into the Union Canal, comprehending in that space six distinct falls; at each of which, and at several intermediate places, work has been done."  After passing Moore's Falls by means of locks, we again had recourse to our oars, and went merrily on our way, driving the small sandpiper from rock to rock before us, and sometimes rowing near enough to a cottage on the bank, though they were few and far between, to see the sunflowers, and the seed vessels of the poppy, like small goblets filled with the water of Lethe, before the door, but without disturbing the sluggish household behind.  Thus we held on, sailing or dipping our way along with the paddle up this broad river, smooth and placid, flowing over concealed rocks, where we could see the pickerel lying low in the transparent water, eager to double some distant cape, to make some great bend as in the life of man, and see what new perspective would open; looking far into a new country, broad and serene, the cottages of settlers seen afar for the first time, yet with the moss of a century on their roofs, and the third or fourth generation in their shadows.  Strange was it to consider how the sun and the summer, the buds of spring and the seared leaves of autumn, were related to these cabins along the shore; how all the rays which paint the landscape radiate from them, and the flight of the crow and the gyrations of the hawk have reference to their roofs.  Still the ever rich and fertile shores accompanied us, fringed with vines and alive with small birds and frisking squirrels, the edge of some farmer's field or widow's wood-lot, or wilder, perchance, where the muskrat, the little medicine of the river, drags itself along stealthily over the alder-leaves and muscle-shells, and man and the memory of man are banished far.</p>

<p>At length the unwearied, never-sinking shore, still holding on without break, with its cool copses and serene pasture-grounds, tempted us to disembark; and we adventurously landed on this remote coast, to survey it, without the knowledge of any human inhabitant probably to this day.  But we still remember the gnarled and hospitable oaks which grew even there for our entertainment, and were no strangers to us, the lonely horse in his pasture, and the patient cows, whose path to the river, so judiciously chosen to overcome the difficulties of the way, we followed, and disturbed their ruminations in the shade; and, above all, the cool, free aspect of the wild apple-trees, generously proffering their fruit to us, though still green and crude,—the hard, round, glossy fruit, which, if not ripe, still was not poison, but New-English too, brought hither its ancestors by ours once.  These gentler trees imparted a half-civilized and twilight aspect to the otherwise barbarian land.  Still farther on we scrambled up the rocky channel of a brook, which had long served nature for a sluice there, leaping like it from rock to rock through tangled woods, at the bottom of a ravine, which grew darker and darker, and more and more hoarse the murmurs of the stream, until we reached the ruins of a mill, where now the ivy grew, and the trout glanced through the crumbling flume; and there we imagined what had been the dreams and speculations of some early settler.  But the waning day compelled us to embark once more, and redeem this wasted time with long and vigorous sweeps over the rippling stream.</p>

<p>It was still wild and solitary, except that at intervals of a mile or two the roof of a cottage might be seen over the bank.  This region, as we read, was once famous for the manufacture of straw bonnets of the Leghorn kind, of which it claims the invention in these parts; and occasionally some industrious damsel tripped down to the water's edge, to put her straw a-soak, as it appeared, and stood awhile to watch the retreating voyageurs, and catch the fragment of a boat-song which we had made, wafted over the water.</p>

<p>   Thus, perchance, the Indian hunter,<br/>

     Many a lagging year agone,<br/>

   Gliding o'er thy rippling waters,<br/>

     Lowly hummed a natural song.<br/>
</p>

<p>   Now the sun's behind the willows,<br/>

     Now he gleams along the waves,<br/>

   Faintly o'er the wearied billows<br/>

     Come the spirits of the braves.<br/>
</p>

<p>Just before sundown we reached some more falls in the town of Bedford, where some stone-masons were employed repairing the locks in a solitary part of the river.  They were interested in our adventure, especially one young man of our own age, who inquired at first if we were bound up to "'Skeag"; and when he had heard our story, and examined our outfit, asked us other questions, but temperately still, and always turning to his work again, though as if it were become his duty.  It was plain that he would like to go with us, and, as he looked up the river, many a distant cape and wooded shore were reflected in his eye, as well as in his thoughts.  When we were ready he left his work, and helped us through the locks with a sort of quiet enthusiasm, telling us that we were at Coos Falls, and we could still distinguish the strokes of his chisel for many sweeps after we had left him.</p>

<p>We wished to camp this night on a large rock in the middle of the stream, just above these falls, but the want of fuel, and the difficulty of fixing our tent firmly, prevented us; so we made our bed on the main-land opposite, on the west bank, in the town of Bedford, in a retired place, as we supposed, there being no house in sight.</p>

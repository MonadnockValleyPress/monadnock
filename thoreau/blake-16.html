<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, Saturday P.M., October 14, 1854</h3>
<p>I have just returned from Plymouth, where I have been detained surveying much longer than I expected.  What do you say to visiting Wachusett next Thursday?  I will start at 7Â¼ A. M. <em>unless there is a prospect of a stormy day</em>, go by cars to Westminster, and thence on foot five or six miles to the mountain-top, where I may engage to meet you, at (or before) 12 M. If the weather is unfavorable, I will try again, on Friday,&mdash;and again on Monday. If a storm comes on after starting, I will seek you at the tavern at Princeton centre, as soon as circumstances will permit. I shall expect an answer at once, to clinch the bargain.</p>

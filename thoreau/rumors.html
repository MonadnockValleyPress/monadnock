<h1>Rumors from an Aeolian Harp</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1842)</h2>
<p>
There is a vale which none hath seen,<br/>
Where foot of man has never been,<br/>
Such as here lives with toil and strife,<br/>
An anxious and a sinful life.
</p>
<p>
There every virtue has its birth,<br/>
Ere it descends upon the earth,<br/>
And thither every deed returns,<br/>
Which in the generous bosom burns.
</p>
<p>
There love is warm, and youth is young,<br/>
And poetry is yet unsung.<br/>
For Virtue still adventures there,<br/>
And freely breathes her native air.
</p>
<p>
And ever, if you hearken well,<br/>
You still may hear its vesper bell,<br/>
And tread of high-souled men go by,<br/>
Their thoughts conversing with the sky.
</p>

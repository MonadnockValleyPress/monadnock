<h1>The Moon Now Rises to Her Absolute Rule</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
The moon now rises to her absolute rule,<br/>
And the husbandman and hunter<br/>
Acknowledge her for their mistress.<br/>
Asters and golden-rods reign in the fields,<br/>
And the life-everlasting withers not.<br/>
The fields are reaped and shorn of their pride,<br/>
But an inward verdure still crowns them.<br/>
The thistle scatters its down on the pool,<br/>
And yellow leaves clothe the river&mdash;<br/>
And nought disturbs the serious life of men.<br/>
But behind the sheaves and under the sod,<br/>
There lurks a ripe fruit, which the reapers have not gathered,<br/>
The true harvest of the year&mdash;the boreal fruit<br/>
Which it bears forever,<br/>
With fondness annually watering and maturing it.<br/>
But man never severs the stalk<br/>
Which bears this palatable fruit.

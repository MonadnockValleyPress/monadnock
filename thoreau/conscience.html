<h1>Conscience is Instinct Bred in the Bone</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1849)</h2>
<p>
Conscience is instinct bred in the house,<br/>
Feeling and Thinking propagate the sin<br/>
By an unnatural breeding in and in.<br/>
I say, Turn it out doors,<br/>
Into the moors.<br/>
I love a life whose plot is simple,<br/>
And does not thicken with every pimple,<br/>
A soul so sound no sickly conscience binds it,<br/>
That makes the universe no worse than 't finds it.<br/>
I love an earnest soul,<br/>
Whose mighty joy and sorrow<br/>
Are not drowned in a bowl,<br/>
And brought to life to-morrow;<br/>
That lives one tragedy,<br/>
And not seventy;<br/>
A conscience worth keeping;<br/>
Laughing not weeping;<br/>
A conscience wise and steady,<br/>
And forever ready;<br/>
Not changing with events,<br/>
Dealing in compliments;<br/>
A conscience exercised about<br/>
Large things, where one may doubt.<br/>
I love a soul not all of wood,<br/>
Predestinated to be good,<br/>
But true to the backbone<br/>
Unto itself alone,<br/>
And false to none;<br/>
Born to its own affairs,<br/>
Its own joys and own cares;<br/>
By whom the work which God begun<br/>
Is finished, and not undone;<br/>
Taken up where he left off,<br/>
Whether to worship or to scoff;<br/>
If not good, why then evil,<br/>
If not good god, good devil.<br/>
Goodness! you hypocrite, come out of that,<br/>
Live your life, do your work, then take your hat.<br/>
I have no patience towards<br/>
Such conscientious cowards.<br/>
Give me simple laboring folk,<br/>
Who love their work,<br/>
Whose virtue is song<br/>
To cheer God along.

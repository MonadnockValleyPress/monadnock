<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, December 6, 1856</h3>
<p>Mr. Blake,&mdash;I trust that you got a note from me at Eagleswood, about a fortnight ago. I passed through Worcester on the morning of the 25th of November, and spent several hours (from 3.30 to 6.20) in the travelers' room at the depot, as in a dream, it now seems. As the first Harlem train unexpectedly connected with the first from Fitchburg, I did not spend the forenoon with you as I had anticipated, on account of baggage, etc. If it had been a seasonable hour, I should have seen you,&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, if you had not gone to a horse-race. But think of making a call at half past three in the morning! (would it not have implied a three-o'clock-in-the-morning courage in both you and me?) as it were, ignoring the fact that mankind are really not at home,&mdash;are not out, but so deeply in that they cannot be seen,&mdash;nearly half their hours at this season of the year.</p>
<p>I walked up and down the main street, at half past five, in the dark, and paused long in front of Brown's store, trying to distinguish its features; considering whether I might safely leave his <em>Putnam</em> in the door-handle, but concluded not to risk it. Meanwhile a watchman (?) seemed to be watching me, and I moved off. Took another turn around there, and had the very earliest offer of the <em>Transcript</em> from an urchin behind, whom I actually could not see, it was so dark. So I withdrew, wondering if you and B. would know if I had been there. You little dream who is occupying Worcester when you are all asleep. Several things occurred there that night which I will venture to say were not put into the <em>Transcript</em>. A cat caught a mouse at the depot, and gave it to her kitten to play with. So that world-famous tragedy goes on by night as well as by day, and nature is <em>emphatically</em> wrong.  Also I saw a young Irishman kneel before his mother, as if in prayer, while she wiped a cinder out of his eye with her tongue; and I found that it was never too late (or early?) to learn something. These things transpired while you and B. were, to all practical purposes, nowhere, and good for nothing,&mdash;not even for society,&mdash;not for horse-races,&mdash;nor the taking back of a <em>Putnam's Magazine</em>. It is true, I might have recalled you to life, but it would have been a cruel act, considering the kind of life you would have come back to.</p>
<p>However, I would fain write to you now by broad daylight, and report to you some of my life, such as it is, and recall you to your life, which is not always lived by you, even by daylight. Blake! Brown! are you awake? are you aware what an ever-glorious morning this is,&mdash;what long-expected, never-to-be-repeated opportunity is now offered to get life and knowledge?</p>
<p>For my part, I am trying to wake up,&mdash;to wring slumber out of my pores; for, generally, I take events as unconcernedly as a fence-post,&mdash;absorb wet and cold like it, and am pleasantly tickled with lichens slowly spreading over me. Could I not be content, then, to be a cedar post, which lasts twenty-five years?  Would I not rather be that than the farmer that set it?  or he that preaches to the farmer? and go to the heaven of posts at last? I think I should like that as well as any would like it. But I should not care if I sprouted into a living tree, put forth leaves and flowers, and bore fruit.</p>
<p>I am grateful for what I am and have. My thanksgiving is perpetual. It is surprising how contented one can be with nothing definite,&mdash;only a sense of existence.  Well, anything for variety. I am ready to try this for the next ten thousand years, and exhaust it. How sweet to think of! my extremities well charred, and my intellectual part too, so that there is no danger of worm or rot for a long while. My breath is sweet to me. O how I laugh when I think of my vague, indefinite riches. No run on my bank can drain it, for my wealth is not possession but enjoyment.</p>
<p>What are all these years made for? and now another winter comes, so much like the last? Can't we satisfy the beggars once for all?</p>
<p>Have you got in your wood for this winter? What else have you got in? Of what use a great fire on the hearth, and a confounded little fire in the heart? Are you prepared to make a decisive campaign,&mdash;to pay for your costly tuition,&mdash;to pay for the suns of past summers,&mdash;for happiness and unhappiness lavished upon you?</p>
<p>Does not Time go by swifter than the swiftest equine trotter or racker?</p>
<p>Stir up Brown. Remind him of his duties, which outrun the date and span of Worcester's years past and to come. Tell him to be sure that he is on the main street, however narrow it may be, and to have a lit sign, visible by night as well as by day.</p>
<p>Are they not patient waiters,&mdash;they who wait for us? But even they shall not be losers.</p>

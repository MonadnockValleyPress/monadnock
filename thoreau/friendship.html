<h1>Friendship</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1838)</h2>
<p>
I think awhile of Love, and while I think,<br/>
Love is to me a world,<br/>
Sole meat and sweetest drink,<br/>
And close connecting link<br/>
Tween heaven and earth.
</p>
<p>
I only know it is, not how or why,<br/>
My greatest happiness;<br/>
However hard I try,<br/>
Not if I were to die,<br/>
Can I explain.
</p>
<p>
I fain would ask my friend how it can be,<br/>
But when the time arrives,<br/>
Then Love is more lovely<br/>
Than anything to me,<br/>
And so I'm dumb.
</p>
<p>
For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak,<br/>
But only thinks and does;<br/>
Though surely out 'twill leak<br/>
Without the help of Greek,<br/>
Or any tongue.
</p>
<p>
A man may love the truth and practise it,<br/>
Beauty he may admire,<br/>
And goodness not omit,<br/>
As much as may befit<br/>
To reverence.
</p>
<p>
But only when these three together meet,<br/>
As they always incline,<br/>
And make one soul the seat,<br/>
And favorite retreat,<br/>
Of loveliness;
</p>
<p>
When under kindred shape, like loves and hates<br/>
And a kindred nature,<br/>
Proclaim us to be mates,<br/>
Exposed to equal fates<br/>
Eternally;
</p>
<p>
And each may other help, and service do,<br/>
Drawing Love's bands more tight,<br/>
Service he ne'er shall rue<br/>
While one and one make two,<br/>
And two are one;
</p>
<p>
In such case only doth man fully prove<br/>
Fully as man can do,<br/>
What power there is in Love<br/>
His inmost soul to move<br/>
Resistlessly.
</p>
<p>
Two sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side,<br/>
Withstand the winter's storm,<br/>
And spite of wind and tide,<br/>
Grow up the meadow's pride,<br/>
For both are strong.
</p>
<p>
Above they barely touch, but undermined<br/>
Down to their deepest source,<br/>
Admiring you shall find<br/>
Their roots are intertwined<br/>
Insep'rably.

<h1>When Breathless Noon Hath Paused on Hill and Vale</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
When breathless noon hath paused on hill and vale,<br/>
And now no more the woodman plies his axe,<br/>
Nor mower whets his scythe,<br/>
Somewhat it is, sole sojourner on earth,<br/>
To hear the veery on her oaken perch<br/>
Ringing her modest trill&mdash;<br/>
Sole sound of all the din that makes a world,<br/>
And I sole ear.<br/>
Fondly to nestle me in that sweet melody,<br/>
And own a kindred soul, speaking to me<br/>
From out the depths of universal being.<br/>
O'er birch and hazle, through the sultry air,<br/>
Comes that faint sound this way,<br/>
On Zephyr borne, straight to my ear.<br/>
No longer time or place, nor faintest trace<br/>
Of earth, the landscape's shimmer is my only space,<br/>
Sole remnant of a world.<br/>
Anon that throat has done, and familiar sounds<br/>
Swell strangely on the breeze, the low of cattle,<br/>
And the novel cries of sturdy swains<br/>
That plod the neighboring vale&mdash;<br/>
And I walk once more confounded a denizen of earth.<br/>

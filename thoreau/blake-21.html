<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>July 14</h3>
<p>You say that you hope I will excuse your frequent writing. I trust you will excuse my infrequent and curt writing until I am able to resume my old habits, which for three months I have been compelled to abandon.  Methinks I am beginning to be better. I think to leave the Cape next Wednesday, and so shall not see you here; but I shall be glad to meet you in Concord, though I may not be able to go <em>before the mast</em>, in a boating excursion. This is an admirable place for coolness and sea-bathing and retirement. You must come prepared for cool weather and fogs.</p>
<p>P. S.&mdash;There is no mail up till Monday morning.</p>

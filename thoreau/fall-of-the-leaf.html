<h1>The Fall of the Leaf</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
The evening of the year draws on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fields a later aspect wear;<br/>
Since Summer's garishness is gone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some grains of night tincture the noontide air.
</p>
<p>
Behold! the shadows of the trees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now circle wider 'bout their stem,<br/>
Like sentries that by slow degrees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perform their rounds, gently protecting them.
</p>
<p>
And as the year doth decline,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun allows a scantier light;<br/>
Behind each needle of the pine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There lurks a small auxiliar to the night.
</p>
<p>
I hear the cricket's slumbrous lay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around, beneath me, and on high;<br/>
It rocks the night, it soothes the day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everywhere is Nature's lullaby.
</p>
<p>
But most he chirps beneath the sod,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he has made his winter bed;<br/>
His creak grown fainter but more broad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A film of Autumn o'er the Summer spread.
</p>
<p>
Small birds, in fleets migrating by,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now beat across some meadow's bay,<br/>
And as they tack and veer on high,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With faint and hurried click beguile the way.
</p>
<p>
Far in the woods, these golden days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some leaf obeys its Maker's call;<br/>
And through their hollow aisles it plays<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With delicate touch the prelude of the Fall.
</p>
<p>
Gently withdrawing from its stem,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It lightly lays itself along<br/>
Where the same hand hath pillowed them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resigned to sleep upon the old year's throng.
</p>
<p>
The loneliest birch is brown and sere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furthest pool is strewn with leaves,<br/>
Which float upon their watery bier,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is no eye that sees, no heart that grieves.
</p>
<p>
The jay screams through the chestnut wood;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisped and yellow leaves around<br/>
Are hue and texture of my mood,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these rough burrs my heirlooms on the ground.
</p>
<p>
The threadbare trees, so poor and thin,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are no wealthier than I;<br/>
But with as brave a core within<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rear their boughs to the October sky.
</p>
<p>
Poor knights they are which bravely wait<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge of Winter's cavalry,<br/>
Keeping a simple Roman state,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discumbered of their Persian luxury.

<h1>Prayer</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1842)</h2>
<p>
Great God! I ask thee for no meaner pelf<br/>
Than that I may not disappoint myself;<br/>
That in my action I may soar as high,<br/>
As I can now discern with this clear eye.
</p>
<p>
And next in value, which thy kindness lends,<br/>
That I may greatly disappoint my friends,<br/>
Howe'er they think or hope it that may be,<br/>
They may not dream how thou'st distinguished me.
</p>
<p>
That my weak hand may equal my firm faith,<br/>
And my life practice more than my tongue saith;<br/>
That my low conduct may not show,<br/>
Nor my relenting lines,<br/>
That I thy purpose did not know,<br/>
Or overrated thy designs.
</p>

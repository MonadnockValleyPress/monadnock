<h1>Walden</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
&mdash;True, our converse a stranger is to speech,<br/>
Only the practised ear can catch the surging words,<br/>
That break and die upon thy pebbled lips.<br/>
Thy flow of thought is noiseless as the lapse of thy own waters,<br/>
Wafted as is the morning mist up from thy surface,<br/>
So that the passive Soul doth breathe it in,<br/>
And is infected with the truth thou wouldst express.
</p>
<p>
E'en the remotest stars have come in troops<br/>
And stooped low to catch the benediction<br/>
Of thy countenance. Oft as the day came round,<br/>
Impartial has the sun exhibited himself<br/>
Before thy narrow skylight&mdash;nor has the moon<br/>
For cycles failed to roll this way<br/>
As oft as elsewhither, and tell thee of the night.<br/>
No cloud so rare but hitherward it stalked,<br/>
And in thy face looked doubly beautiful.<br/>
O! tell me what the winds have writ within these thousand years,<br/>
On the blue vault that spans thy flood&mdash;<br/>
Or sun transferred and delicately reprinted<br/>
For thy own private reading. Somewhat<br/>
Within these latter days I've read,<br/>
But surely there was much that would have thrilled the Soul,<br/>
Which human eye saw not.<br/>
I would give much to read that first bright page,<br/>
Wet from a virgin press, when Eurus&mdash;Boreas&mdash;<br/>
And the host of airy quill-drivers<br/>
First dipped their pens in mist.

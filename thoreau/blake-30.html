<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, April 17, 1857</h3>
<p>Mr. Blake,&mdash;I returned from New Bedford night before last. I met Alcott there, and learned from him that probably you had gone to Concord. I am very sorry that I missed you. I had expected you earlier, and at last thought that I should get back before you came; but I ought to have notified you of my absence.  However, it would have been too late, after I had made up my mind to go. I hope you lost nothing by going a little round.</p>
<p>I took out the celtis seeds at your request, at the time we spoke of them, and left them in the chamber on some shelf or other. If you have found them, very well; if you have not found them, very well; but tell Hale of it, if you see him. My mother says that you and Brown and Rogers and Wasson (titles left behind) talk of coming down on me some day. Do not fail to come, one and all, and within a week or two, if possible; else I may be gone again. Give me a short notice, and then come and spend a day on Concord River,&mdash;or say that you will come if it is fair, unless you are confident of bringing fair weather with you.  Come and be Concord, as I have been Worcestered.</p>
<p>Perhaps you came nearer to me for not finding me at home; for trains of thought the more connect when trains of cars do not. If I had actually met you, you would have gone again; but now I have not yet dismissed you. I hear what you say about personal relations with joy. It is as if you had said: "I value the best and finest part of you, and not the worst. I can even endure your very near and real approach, and prefer it to a shake of the hand." This intercourse is not subject to time or distance.</p>
<p>I have a very long new and faithful letter from Cholmondeley which I wish to show you. He speaks of sending me more books!!</p>
<p>If I were with you now, I could tell you much of Ricketson, and my visit to New Bedford; but I do not know how it will be by and by. I should like to have you meet R., who is the frankest man I know.  Alcott and he get along very well together. Channing has returned to Concord with me,&mdash;probably for a short visit only.</p>
<p>Consider this a business letter, which you know <em>counts</em> nothing in the game we play. Remember me particularly to Brown.</p>

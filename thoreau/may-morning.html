<h1>May Morning</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
The school boy loitered on his way to school,<br/>
Scorning to live so rare a day by rule.<br/>
So mild the air a pleasure 'twas to breathe,<br/>
For what seems heaven above was earth beneath.
</p>
<p>
Soured neighbors chatted by the garden pale,<br/>
Nor quarrelled who should drive the needed nail&mdash;<br/>
The most unsocial made new friends that day,<br/>
As when the sun shines husbandmen make hay.
</p>
<p>
How long I slept I know not, but at last<br/>
I felt my consciousness returning fast,<br/>
For Zephyr rustled past with leafy tread,<br/>
And heedlessly with one heel grazed my head.
</p>
<p>
My eyelids opened on a field of blue,<br/>
For close above a nodding violet grew,<br/>
A part of heaven it seemed, which one could scent,<br/>
Its blue commingling with the firmament.
</p>

<h1>The "Book of Gems"</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
&mdash;With cunning plates the polished leaves were decked,<br/>
Each one a window to the poet's world,<br/>
So rich a prospect that you might suspect<br/>
In that small space all paradise unfurled.<br/>
It was a right delightful road to go,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;marching through pastures of such fair herbage,<br/>
O'er hill and dale it lead, and to and fro,<br/>
From bard to bard, making an easy stage.
</p>
<p>
Where ever and anon I slaked my thirst<br/>
Like a tired traveller at some poet's well,<br/>
Which from the teeming ground did bubbling burst,<br/>
And tinkling thence adown the page it fell.<br/>
Still through the leaves its music you might hear,<br/>
Till other springs fell faintly on the ear.

<h1>The Summer Rain</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1842)</h2>
<p>
My books I'd fain cast off, I cannot read,<br/>
'Twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large<br/>
Down in the meadow, where is richer feed,<br/>
And will not mind to hit their proper targe.
</p>
<p>
Plutarch was good, and so was Homer too,<br/>
Our Shakespeare's life were rich to live again,<br/>
What Plutarch read, that was not good nor true,<br/>
Nor Shakespeare's books, unless his books were men.
</p>
<p>
Here while I lie beneath this walnut bough,<br/>
What care I for the Greeks or for Troy town,<br/>
If juster battles are enacted now<br/>
Between the ants upon this hummock's crown?
</p>
<p>
Bid Homer wait till I the issue learn,<br/>
If red or black the gods will favor most,<br/>
Or yonder Ajax will the phalanx turn,<br/>
Struggling to heave some rock against the host.
</p>
<p>
Tell Shakespeare to attend some leisure hour,<br/>
For now I've business with this drop of dew,<br/>
And see you not, the clouds prepare a shower &mdash;<br/>
I'll meet him shortly when the sky is blue.
</p>
<p>
This bed of herd's grass and wild oats was spread<br/>
Last year with nicer skill than monarchs use.<br/>
A clover tuft is pillow for my head,<br/>
And violets quite overtop my shoes.
</p>
<p>
And now the cordial clouds have shut all in,<br/>
And gently swells the wind to say all's well;<br/>
The scattered drops are falling fast and thin,<br/>
Some in the pool, some in the flower-bell.
</p>
<p>
I am well drenched upon my bed of oats;<br/>
But see that globe come rolling down its stem,<br/>
Now like a lonely planet there it floats,<br/>
And now it sinks into my garment's hem.
</p>
<p>
Drip drip the trees for all the country round,<br/>
And richness rare distills from every bough;<br/>
The wind alone it is makes every sound,<br/>
Shaking down crystals on the leaves below.
</p>
<p>
For shame the sun will never show himself,<br/>
Who could not with his beams e'er melt me so;<br/>
My dripping locks &mdash; they would become an elf,<br/>
Who in a beaded coat does gayly go.
</p>

<h1>Within the Circuit of This Plodding Life</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1842)</h2>
<p>
Within the circuit of this plodding life<br/>
There enter moments of an azure hue,<br/>
Untarnished fair as is the violet<br/>
Or anemone, when the spring strews them<br/>
By some meandering rivulet, which make<br/>
The best philosophy untrue that aims<br/>
But to console man for his grievances.<br/>
I have remembered when the winter came,<br/>
High in my chamber in the frosty nights,<br/>
When in the still light of the cheerful moon,<br/>
On every twig and rail and jutting spout,<br/>
The icy spears were adding to their length<br/>
Against the arrows of the coming sun,<br/>
How in the shimmering noon of summer past<br/>
Some unrecorded beam slanted across<br/>
The upland pastures where the Johnswort grew;<br/>
Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind,<br/>
The bee's long smothered hum, on the blue flag<br/>
Loitering amidst the mead; or busy rill,<br/>
Which now through all its course stands still and dumb<br/>
Its own memorial,&mdash;purling at its play<br/>
Along the slopes, and through the meadows next,<br/>
Until its youthful sound was hushed at last<br/>
In the staid current of the lowland stream;<br/>
Or seen the furrows shine but late upturned,<br/>
And where the fieldfare followed in the rear,<br/>
When all the fields around lay bound and hoar<br/>
Beneath a thick integument of snow.<br/>
So by God's cheap economy made rich<br/>
To go upon my winter's task again.

<h1>Manhood</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
I love to see the man, a long-lived child,<br/>
As yet uninjured by all worldly taint<br/>
As the fresh infant whose whole life is play.<br/>
'Tis a serene spectacle for a serene day;<br/>
But better still I love to contemplate<br/>
The mature soul of lesser innocence,<br/>
Who hath traveled far on life's dusty road<br/>
Far from the starting point of infancy<br/>
And proudly bears his small degen'racy<br/>
Blazon'd on his memorial standard high<br/>
Who from the sad experience of his fate<br/>
Since his bark struck on that unlucky rock<br/>
Has proudly steered his life with his own hands.<br/>
Though his face harbors less of innocence<br/>
Yet there do chiefly lurk within its depths<br/>
Furrowed by care, but yet all over spread<br/>
With the ripe bloom of a self-wrought content<br/>
Noble resolves which do reprove the gods<br/>
And it doth more assert man's eminence<br/>
Above the happy level of the brute<br/>
And more doth advertise me of the heights<br/>
To which no natural path doth ever lead<br/>
No natural light can ever light our steps,<br/>
&mdash;But the far-piercing ray that shines<br/>
From the recesses of a brave man's eye.

<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, December 19, 1853</h3>
<p>Mr. Blake,&mdash;My debt has accumulated so that I should have answered your last letter at once, if I had not been the subject of what is called a press of engagements, having a lecture to write for last Wednesday, and surveying more than usual besides. It has been a kind of running fight with me,&mdash;the enemy not always behind me I trust.</p>
<p>True, a man cannot lift himself by his own waistbands, because he cannot get out of himself; but he can expand himself (which is better, there being no up nor down in nature), and so split his waistbands, being already within himself.</p>
<p>You speak of doing and being, and the vanity, real or apparent, of much doing. The suckers&mdash;I think it is they&mdash;make nests in our river in the spring of more than a cart-load of small stones, amid which to deposit their ova. The other day I opened a muskrat's house.  It was made of weeds, five feet broad at base, and three feet high, and far and low within it was a little cavity, only a foot in diameter, where the rat dwelt.  It may seem trivial, this piling up of weeds, but so the race of muskrats is preserved. We must heap up a great pile of doing, for a small diameter of being. Is it not imperative on us that we <em>do</em> something, if we only work in a treadmill? And, indeed, some sort of revolving is necessary to produce a centre and nucleus of being. What exercise is to the body, employment is to the mind and morals. Consider what an amount of drudgery must be performed,&mdash;how much humdrum and prosaic labor goes to any work of the least value.  There are so many layers of mere white lime in every shell to that thin inner one so beautifully tinted. Let not the shellfish think to build his house of that alone; and pray, what are its tints to him? Is it not his smooth, close-fitting shirt merely, whose tints <em>are not</em> to him, being in the dark, but only when he is gone or dead, and his shell is heaved up to light, a wreck upon the beach, do they appear. With him, too, it is a Song of the Shirt, "Work,&mdash;work,&mdash;work!" And the work is not merely a police in the gross sense, but in the higher sense a discipline. If it is surely the means to the highest end we know, can any work be humble or disgusting? Will it not rather be elevating as a ladder, the means by which we are translated?</p>
<p>How admirably the artist is made to accomplish his self-culture by devotion to his art! The wood-sawyer, through his effort to do his work well, becomes not merely a better wood-sawyer, but measurably a better <em>man</em>. Few are the men that can work on their navels,&mdash;only some Brahmins that I have heard of. To the painter is given some paint and canvas instead; to the Irishman a hog, typical of himself. In a thousand apparently humble ways men busy themselves to make some right take the place of some wrong,&mdash;if it is only to make a better paste blacking,&mdash;and they are themselves <em>so much</em> the better morally for it.</p>
<p>You say that you do not succeed much. Does it concern you enough that you do not? Do you work hard enough at it? Do you get the benefit of discipline out of it? If so, persevere. Is it a more serious thing than to walk a thousand miles in a thousand successive hours? Do you get any corns by it? Do you ever think of hanging yourself on account of failure?</p>
<p>If you are going into that line,&mdash;going to besiege the city of God,&mdash;you must not only be strong in engines, but prepared with provisions to starve out the garrison. An Irishman came to see me to-day, who is endeavoring to get his family out to this New World.  He rises at half past four, milks twenty-eight cows (which has swollen the joints of his fingers), and eats his breakfast, without any milk in his tea or coffee, before six; and so on, day after day, for six and a half dollars a month; and thus he keeps his virtue in him, if he does not add to it; and he regards me as a gentleman able to assist him; but if I ever get to be a gentleman, it will be by working after my fashion harder than he does. If my joints are not swollen, it must be because I deal with the teats of celestial cows before breakfast (and the milker in this case is always allowed some of the milk for his breakfast), to say nothing of the flocks and herds of Admetus afterward.</p>
<p>It is the art of mankind to polish the world, and every one who works is scrubbing in some part.</p>
<p>If the work is high and far,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You must not only aim aright,<br/>
But draw the bow with all your might.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You must qualify yourself to use a bow which no humbler archer can bend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Work,&mdash;work,&mdash;work!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who shall know it for a bow? It is not of yew tree.  It is straighter than a ray of light; flexibility is not known for one of its qualities.</p>
<p>December 22.</p>
<p>So far I had got when I was called off to survey.  Pray read the life of Haydon the painter, if you have not. It is a small revelation for these latter days; a great satisfaction to know that he has lived, though he is now dead. Have you met with the letter of a Turkish cadi at the end of Layard's "Ancient Babylon"?  that also is refreshing, and a capital comment on the whole book which precedes it,&mdash;the Oriental genius speaking through him.</p>
<p>Those Brahmins "put it through." They come off, or rather stand still, conquerors, with some withered arms or legs at least to show; and they are said to have cultivated the faculty of abstraction to a degree unknown to Europeans. If we cannot sing of faith and triumph, we will sing our despair. We will be that kind of bird. There are day owls, and there are night owls, and each is beautiful and even musical while about its business.</p>
<p>Might you not find some positive work to do with your back to Church and State, letting your back do all the rejection of them? Can you not <em>go</em> upon your pilgrimage, Peter, along the winding mountain path whither you face? A step more will make those funereal church bells over your shoulder sound far and sweet as a natural sound.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Work,&mdash;work,&mdash;work!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why not make a <em>very large</em> mud pie and bake it in the sun! Only put no Church nor State into it, nor upset any other pepper-box that way. Dig out a woodchuck,&mdash;for that has nothing to do with rotting institutions.  Go ahead.</p>
<p>Whether a man spends his day in an ecstasy or despondency, he must do some work to show for it, even as there are flesh and bones to show for him. We are superior to the joy we experience.</p>
<p>Your last two letters, methinks, have more nerve and will in them than usual, as if you had erected yourself more. Why are not they good work, if you only had a
hundred correspondents to tax you?</p>
<p>Make your failure tragical by the earnestness and steadfastness of your endeavor, and then it will not differ from success. Prove it to be the inevitable fate of mortals,&mdash;of one mortal,&mdash;if you can.</p>
<p>You said that you were writing on Immortality. I wish you would communicate to me what you know about that. You are sure to live while that is your theme.</p>
<p>Thus I write on some text which a sentence of your letters may have furnished.</p>
<p>I think of coming to see you as soon as I get a new coat, if I have money enough left. I will write to you again about it.</p>

<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, May 28, 1850</h3>
<p>Mr. Blake,&mdash;"I never found any contentment in the life which the newspapers record,"&mdash;anything of more value than the cent which they cost. Contentment in being covered with dust an inch deep! We who walk the streets, and hold time together, are but the refuse of ourselves, and that life is for the shells of us,&mdash;of our body and our mind,&mdash;for our scurf,&mdash;a thoroughly <em>scurvy</em> life. It is coffee made of coffee-grounds the twentieth time, which was only coffee the first time,&mdash;while the living water leaps and sparkles by our doors. I know some who, in their charity, give their coffee-grounds to the poor! We, demanding news, and putting up with <em>such</em> news! Is it a new convenience, or a new accident, or, rather, a new perception of the truth that we want!</p>
<p>You say that "the serene hours in which friendship, books, nature, thought, seem alone primary considerations, visit you but faintly." Is not the attitude of expectation somewhat divine?&mdash;a sort of home-made divineness? Does it not compel a kind of sphere-music to attend on it? And do not its satisfactions merge at length, by insensible degrees, in the enjoyment of the thing expected?</p>
<p>What if I should forget to write about my not writing?  It is not worth the while to make that a theme.  It is as if I had written every day. It is as if I had never written before. I wonder that you think so much about it, for not writing is the most like writing, in my case, of anything I know.</p>
<p>Why will you not relate to me your dream? That would be to realize it somewhat. You tell me that you dream, but not what you dream. I can <em>guess</em> what comes to pass. So do the frogs dream. Would that I knew what. I have never found out whether they are awake or asleep,&mdash;whether it is day or night with them.</p>
<p>I am preaching, mind you, to bare walls, that is, to myself; and if you have chanced to come in and occupy a pew, do not think that my remarks are directed at you particularly, and so slam the seat in disgust. This discourse was written long before these exciting times.</p>
<p>Some absorbing employment on your higher ground,&mdash;your upland farm,&mdash;whither no cart-path leads, but where you mount alone with your hoe,&mdash;where the life everlasting grows; there you raise a crop which needs not to be brought down into the valley to a market; which you barter for heavenly products.</p>
<p>Do you separate distinctly enough the support of your body from that of your essence? By how distinct a course commonly are these two ends attained! Not that they should not be attained by one and the same means,&mdash;that, indeed, is the rarest success,&mdash;but there is no half and half about it.</p>
<p>I shall be glad to read my lecture to a small audience in Worcester such as you describe, and will only require that my expenses be paid. If only the parlor be large enough for an echo, and the audience will embarrass themselves with hearing as much as the lecturer would otherwise embarrass himself with reading. But I warn you that this is no better calculated for a promiscuous audience than the last two which I read to you. It requires, in every sense, a concordant audience.</p>
<p>I will come on next Saturday and spend Sunday with you if you wish it. Say so if you do.</p>
<p>"Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring."</p>
<p>Be not deterred by melancholy on the path which leads to immortal health and joy. When they tasted of the water of the river over which they were to go, they thought it tasted a little bitterish to the palate, but it proved sweeter when it was down.</p>
<p>H. D. T.</p>

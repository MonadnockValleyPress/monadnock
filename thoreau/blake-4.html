<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, November 20, 1849</h3>
<p>Mr. Blake,&mdash;I have not forgotten that I am your debtor. When I read over your letters, as I have just done, I feel that I am unworthy to have received or to answer them, though they are addressed, as I would have them, to the ideal of me. It behooves me, if I would reply, to speak out of the rarest part of myself.</p>
<p>At present I am subsisting on certain wild flavors which nature wafts to me, which unaccountably sustain me, and make my apparently poor life rich.  Within a year my walks have extended themselves, and almost every afternoon (I read, or write, or make pencils in the forenoon, and by the last means get a living for my body) I visit some new hill, or pond, or wood, many miles distant. I am astonished at the wonderful retirement through which I move, rarely meeting a man in these excursions, never seeing one similarly engaged, unless it be my companion, when I have one. I cannot help feeling that of all the human inhabitants of nature hereabouts, only we two have leisure to admire and enjoy our inheritance.</p>
<p>"Free in this world as the birds in the air, disengaged from every kind of chains, those who have practiced the <em>yoga</em> gather in Brahma the certain fruit of their works."</p>
<p>Depend upon it that, rude and careless as I am, I would fain practice the <em>yoga</em> faithfully.</p>
<p>"The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, contributes in his degree to creation: he breathes a divine perfume, he hears wonderful things. Divine forms traverse him without tearing him, and, united to the nature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts as animating original matter."</p>
<p>To some extent, and at rare intervals, even I am a yogi.</p>
<p>I know little about the affairs of Turkey, but I am sure that I know something about barberries and chestnuts, of which I have collected a store this fall. When I go to see my neighbor, he will formally communicate to me the latest news from Turkey, which he read in yesterday's mail,&mdash;"Now Turkey by this time looks determined, and Lord Palmerston"&mdash;Why, I would rather talk of the bran, which, unfortunately, was sifted out of my bread this morning, and thrown away. It is a fact which lies nearer to me. The newspaper gossip with which our hosts abuse our ears is as far from a true hospitality as the viands which they set before us.  We did not need them to feed our bodies, and the news can be bought for a penny. We want the inevitable news, be it sad or cheering, wherefore and by what means they are extant this <em>new</em> day. If they are well, let them whistle and dance; if they are dyspeptic, it is their duty to complain, that so they may in any case be <em>entertaining</em>. If words were invented to conceal thought, I think that newspapers are a great improvement on a bad invention. Do not suffer your life to be taken by newspapers.</p>
<p>I thank you for your hearty appreciation of my book.  I am glad to have had such a long talk with you, and that you had patience to listen to me to the end. I think that I had the advantage of you, for I chose my own mood, and in one sense your mood too,&mdash;that is, a quiet and attentive reading mood. Such advantage has the writer over the talker. I am sorry that you did not come to Concord in your vacation. Is it not time for another vacation? I am here yet, and Concord is here.</p>
<p>You will have found out by this time who it is that writes this, and will be glad to have you write to him, without his subscribing himself</p>
<p>P. S.&mdash;It is so long since I have seen you, that, as you will perceive, I have to speak, as it were, <em>in vacuo</em>, as if I were sounding hollowly for an echo, and it did not make much odds what kind of a sound I made.  But the gods do not hear any rude or discordant sound, as we learn from the echo; and I know that the nature toward which I launch these sounds is so rich that it will modulate anew and wonderfully improve my rudest strain.</p>

<h1>I Seek the Present Time</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
I seek the present time,<br/>
No other clime,<br/>
Life in to-day,<br/>
Not to sail another way,<br/>
To Paris or to Rome,<br/>
Or farther still from home.<br/>
That man, whoe’er he is,<br/>
Lives but a moral death<br/>
Whose life is not coeval<br/>
With his breath.<br/>
What are deeds done<br/>
Away from home?<br/>
What the best essay<br/>
On the Ruins of Rome?<br/>
The dusty highways,<br/>
What Scripture says,<br/>
This pleasant weather,<br/>
And all else together,<br/>
The river’s meander,<br/>
All things, in short,<br/>
Forbid me to wander<br/>
In deed or in thought.<br/>
In cold or in drouth,<br/>
Not seek the sunny South,<br/>
But make my whole tour<br/>
In the sunny present hour.<br/>
For here if thou fail,<br/>
Where can’st thou prevail?<br/>
If you love not<br/>
Your own land most,<br/>
You’ll find nothing lovely<br/>
On a distant coast.<br/>
If you love not<br/>
The latest sunset,<br/>
What is there in pictures<br/>
Or old gems set?
</p>
<p>
If no man should travel<br/>
Till he had the means,<br/>
There'd be little travelling<br/>
For kings or for queens.<br/>
The means, what are they!<br/>
They are the wherewithal<br/>
Great expenses to pay;&mdash;<br/>
Life got, and some to spare,<br/>
Great works on hand,<br/>
And freedom from care.<br/>
Plenty of time well spent,<br/>
To use,&mdash;<br/>
Clothes paid for, and no rent<br/>
in your shoes;&mdash;<br/>
Something to eat,<br/>
And something to burn,<br/>
And, above all, no need to return;&mdash;<br/>
For they who come back,<br/>
Have they not failed,<br/>
Wherever they've ridden<br/>
Or steamed it, or sailed?<br/>
All your grass hayed,&mdash;<br/>
All your debts paid,&mdash;<br/>
All your wills made?<br/>
Then you might as well have stayed,<br/>
For are you not dead,<br/>
Only not buried?
</p>
<p>
The way unto "Today,"<br/>
The rail road to "Here,"<br/>
They'll never grade that way,<br/>
Nor shorten it, I fear.<br/>
There are plenty of depots<br/>
All the world o'er,<br/>
But not a single station<br/>
At a man's door;<br/>
If we would get near<br/>
To the secret of things,<br/>
We shall not have to hear<br/>
When the engine bell rings.

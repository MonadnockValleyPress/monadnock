<h1>The Old Marlborough Road</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1861)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Old Marlborough Road</p>
<p>
Where they once dug for money,<br/>
But never found any;<br/>
Where sometimes Martial Miles<br/>
Singly files,<br/>
And Elijah Wood,<br/>
I fear for no good:<br/>
No other man,<br/>
Save Elisha Dugan -- <br/>
O man of wild habits,<br/>
Partridges and rabbits<br/>
Who hast no cares<br/>
Only to set snares,<br/>
Who liv'st all alone,<br/>
Close to the bone<br/>
And where life is sweetest<br/>
Constantly eatest.<br/>
When the spring stirs my blood<br/>
With the instinct to travel,<br/>
I can get enough gravel<br/>
On the Old Marlborough Road.<br/>
Nobody repairs it,<br/>
For nobody wears it;<br/>
It is a living way,<br/>
As the Christians say.<br/>
Not many there be<br/>
Who enter therein,<br/>
Only the guests of the<br/>
Irishman Quin.<br/>
What is it, what is it<br/>
But a direction out there,<br/>
And the bare possibility<br/>
Of going somewhere?<br/>
Great guide-boards of stone,<br/>
But travelers none;<br/>
Cenotaphs of the towns<br/>
Named on their crowns.<br/>
It is worth going to see
</p>
<p>
Where you <em>might</em> be.<br/>
What king<br/>
Did the thing,<br/>
I am still wondering;<br/>
Set up how or when,<br/>
By what selectmen,<br/>
Gourgas or Lee,<br/>
Clark or Darby?<br/>
They're a great endeavor<br/>
To be something forever;<br/>
Blank tablets of stone,<br/>
Where a traveler might groan,<br/>
And in one sentence<br/>
Grave all that is known<br/>
Which another might read,<br/>
In his extreme need.<br/>
I know one or two<br/>
Lines that would do,<br/>
Literature that might stand<br/>
All over the land<br/>
Which a man could remember<br/>
Till next December,<br/>
And read again in the spring,<br/>
After the thawing.<br/>
If with fancy unfurled<br/>
You leave your abode,<br/>
You may go round the world<br/>
By the Old Marlborough Road.

<h1>Forever in My Dream and in My Morning Thought</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1857)</h2>
<p>
Forever in my dream and in my morning thought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eastward a mount ascends&mdash;<br/>
But when in the sunbeam its hard outline is sought&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all dissolves and ends.<br/>
The woods that way are gates&mdash;the pastures too slope<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To an unearthly ground&mdash;<br/>
But when I ask my mates, to take the staff and cup,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can no more be found&mdash;<br/>
Perchance I have no shoes fit for the lofty soil<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where my thoughts graze&mdash;<br/>
No properly spun clues&mdash;nor well strained mid day oil!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or&mdash;must I mend my ways?<br/>
It is a promised land which I have not yet earned,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not made beginning<br/>
With consecrated hand&mdash;I have not even learned<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lay the underpinning.<br/>
The mountain sinks by day&mdash;as do my lofty thoughts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I'm not highminded.<br/>
If I could think alway above these hills and warts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should see it, though blinded.<br/>
It is a spiral path within the pilgrim's soul<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leads to this mountain's brow<br/>
Commencing at his hearth he reaches to this goal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows not when nor how.

<h1>At Midnight's Hour I Raised My Head</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
At midnight's hour I raised my head<br/>
The owls were seeking for their bread<br/>
The foxes barked impatient still<br/>
At their wan fate they bear so ill&mdash;<br/>
I thought me of eternities delayed<br/>
And of commands but half obeyed&mdash;<br/>
The night wind rustled through the glade<br/>
As if a force of men there staid<br/>
The word was whispered through the ranks<br/>
And every hero seized his lance<br/>
The word was whispered through the ranks<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance.

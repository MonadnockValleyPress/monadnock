<h1>Brother Where Dost Thou Dwell</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
Brother, where dost thou dwell?<br/>
What sun shines for thee no?<br/>
Dost thou indeed fare well,<br/>
As we wished thee here below?
</p>
<p>
What season didst thou find?<br/>
'Twas winter here.<br/>
Are not the Fates more kind<br/>
Than they appear?
</p>
<p>
Is thy brow clear again<br/>
As in thy youthful years?<br/>
And was that ugly pain<br/>
The summit of thy fears?
</p>
<p>
Yet thou wast cheery still;<br/>
They could not quench thy fire;<br/>
Thou didst abide their will,<br/>
And then retire.
</p>
<p>
Where chiefly shall I look<br/>
To feel thy presence near?<br/>
Along the neighboring brook<br/>
May I thy voice still hear?
</p>
<p>
Dost thou still haunt the brink<br/>
Of yonder river's tide?<br/>
And may I ever think<br/>
That thou art by my side?
</p>
<p>
What bird wilt thou employ<br/>
To bring me word of thee?<br/>
For it would give them joy&mdash;<br/>
'Twould give them liberty&mdash;<br/>
To serve their former lord<br/>
With wing and minstrelsy.
</p>
<p>
A sadder strain mixed with their song,<br/>
They've slowlier built their nests;<br/>
Since thou art gone<br/>
Their lively labor rests.
</p>
<p>
Where is the finch, the thrush,<br/>
I used to hear?<br/>
Ah, they could well abide<br/>
The dying year.
</p>
<p>
Now they no more return,<br/>
I hear them not;<br/>
They have remained to mourn,<br/>
Or else forgot.

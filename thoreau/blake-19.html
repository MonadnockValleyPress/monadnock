<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, June 27, 1855</h3>
<p>Mr. Blake,&mdash;I have been sick and good for nothing but to lie on my back and wait for something to turn up, for two or three months. This has <em>compelled me</em> to postpone several things, among them writing to you, to whom I am so deeply in debt, and inviting you and Brown to Concord,&mdash;not having brains adequate to such an exertion. I should feel a little less ashamed if I could give any name to my disorder,&mdash;but I cannot, and our doctor cannot help me to it,&mdash;and I will not take the name of any disease in vain. However, there is one consolation in being sick; and that is the possibility that you may recover to a better state than you were ever in before. I expected in the winter to be deep in the woods of Maine in my canoe, long before this; but I am so far from this that I can only take a languid walk in Concord streets.</p>
<p>I do not know how the mistake arose about the Cape Cod excursion. The nearest I have come to that with anybody is this: About a month ago Channing proposed to me to go to Truro on Cape Cod with him, and board there a while,&mdash;but I declined. For a week past, however, I have been a little inclined to go there and sit on the seashore a week or more; but I do not venture to propose myself as the companion of him or of any peripatetic man. Not that I should not rejoice to have you and Brown or C. sitting there also. I am not sure that C. really wishes to go now; and as I go simply for the medicine of it, I should not think it worth the while to notify him when I am about to take my bitters. Since I began this, or within five minutes, I have begun to think that I will start for Truro next Saturday morning, the 30th. I do not know at what hour the packet leaves Boston, nor exactly what kind of accommodation I shall find at Truro.</p>
<p>I should be singularly favored if you and Brown were there at the same time; and though you speak of the 20th of July, I will be so bold as to suggest your coming to Concord Friday night (when, by the way, Garrison and Phillips hold forth here), and going to the Cape with me. Though we take short walks together there, we can have <em>long</em> talks, and you and Brown will have time enough for your own excursions besides.</p>
<p>I received a letter from Cholmondeley last winter, which I should like to show you, as well as his book. He said that he had "accepted the offer of a captaincy in the Salop Militia," and was hoping to take an active part in the war before long.</p>
<p>I thank you again and again for the encouragement your letters are to me. But I must stop this writing, or I shall have to pay for it.</p>

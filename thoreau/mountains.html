<h1>The Mountains in the Horizon</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1843)</h2>
<p>
With frontier strength ye stand your ground,<br/>
With grand content ye circle round,<br/>
Tumultuous silence for all sound,<br/>
Ye distant nursery of rills,<br/>
Monadnock, and the Peterboro' hills;<br/>
Like some vast fleet,<br/>
Sailing through rain and sleet,<br/>
Through winter's cold and summer's heat;<br/>
Still holding on, upon your high emprise,<br/>
Until ye find a shore amid the skies;<br/>
Not skulking close to land,<br/>
With cargo contraband.<br/>
For they who sent a venture out by ye<br/>
Have set the sun to see<br/>
Their honesty.<br/>
Ships of the line, each one,<br/>
Ye to the westward run,<br/>
Always before the gale,<br/>
Under a press of sail,<br/>
With weight of metal all untold.<br/>
I seem to feel ye, in my firm seat here,<br/>
Immeasurable depth of hold,<br/>
And breadth of beam, and length of running gear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Methinks ye take luxurious pleasure<br/>
In your novel western leisure;<br/>
So cool your brows, and freshly blue,<br/>
As Time had nought for ye to do;<br/>
For ye lie at your length,<br/>
An unappropriated strength,<br/>
Unhewn primeval timber,<br/>
For knees so stiff, for masts so limber;<br/>
The stock of which new earths are made,<br/>
One day to be our western trade,<br/>
Fit for the stanchions of a world<br/>
Which through the seas of space is hurled.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While we enjoy a lingering ray,<br/>
Ye still o'ertop the western day,<br/>
Reposing yonder, on God's croft,<br/>
Like solid stacks of hay.<br/>
Edged with silver, and with gold,<br/>
The clouds hang o'er in damask fold,<br/>
And with such depth of amber light<br/>
The west is dight,<br/>
Where still a few rays slant,<br/>
That even heaven seems extravagant.<br/>
On the earth's edge mountains and trees<br/>
Stand as they were on air graven,<br/>
Or as the vessels in a haven<br/>
Await the morning breeze.<br/>
I fancy even<br/>
Through your defiles windeth the way to heaven;<br/>
And yonder still, in spite of history's page,<br/>
Linger the golden and the silver age;<br/>
Upon the laboring gale<br/>
The news of future centuries is brought,<br/>
And of new dynasties of thought,<br/>
From your remotest vale.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But special I remember thee,<br/>
Wachusett, who like me<br/>
Standest alone without society.<br/>
Thy far blue eye,<br/>
A remnant of the sky,<br/>
Seen through the clearing or the gorge,<br/>
Or from the windows on the forge,<br/>
Doth leaven all it passes by.<br/>
Nothing is true,<br/>
But stands 'tween me and you,<br/>
Thou western pioneer,<br/>
Who know'st not shame nor fear,<br/>
By venturous spirit driven,<br/>
Under the eaves of heaven,<br/>
And can'st expand thee there,<br/>
And breathe enough of air?<br/>
Upholding heaven, holding down earth,<br/>
Thy pastime from thy birth,<br/>
Not steadied by the one, nor leaning on the other;<br/>
May I approve myself thy worthy brother!<br/>

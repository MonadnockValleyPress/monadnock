<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, December 31, 1856</h3>
<p>Mr. Blake,&mdash;I think it will not be worth the while for me to come to Worcester to lecture at all this year.  It will be better to wait till I am&mdash;perhaps unfortunately&mdash;more in that line. My writing has not taken the shape of lectures, and therefore I should be obliged to read one of three or four old lectures, the best of which I have read to some of your auditors before. I carried that one which I call "Walking, or the Wild," to Amherst, N. H., the evening of that cold Thursday, and I am to read another at Fitchburg, February 3.  I am simply their hired man. This will probably be the extent of my lecturing hereabouts.</p>
<p>I must depend on meeting Mr. Wasson some other time.  </p>
<p>Perhaps it always costs me more than it comes to to lecture before a promiscuous audience. It is an irreparable injury done to my modesty even,&mdash;I become so indurated.</p>
<p>O solitude! obscurity! meanness! I never triumph so as when I have the least success in my neighbor's eyes. The lecturer gets fifty dollars a night; but what becomes of his winter? What consolation will it be hereafter to have fifty thousand dollars for living in the world? I should like not to exchange <em>any</em> of my life for money.</p>
<p>These, you may think, are reasons for not lecturing, when you have no great opportunity. It is even so, perhaps. I could lecture on dry oak leaves; I could, but who could hear me? If I were to try it on any large audience, I fear it would be no gain to them, and a positive loss to me. I should have behaved rudely toward my rustling friends.  </p>
<p>I am surveying, instead of lecturing, at present. Let me have a skimming from your "pan of unwrinkled cream." </p>

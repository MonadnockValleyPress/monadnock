<h1>Sic Vita</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1841)</h2>
<p>
I am a parcel of vain strivings tied<br/>
By a chance bond together,<br/>
Dangling this way and that, their links<br/>
Were made so loose and wide,<br/>
Methinks,<br/>
For milder weather.
</p>
<p>
A bunch of violets without their roots,<br/>
And sorrel intermixed,<br/>
Encircled by a wisp of straw<br/>
Once coiled about their shoots,<br/>
The law<br/>
By which I'm fixed.
</p>
<p>
A nosegay which Time clutched from out<br/>
Those fair Elysian fields,<br/>
With weeds and broken stems, in haste,<br/>
Doth make the rabble rout<br/>
That waste<br/>
The day he yields.
</p>
<p>
And here I bloom for a short hour unseen,<br/>
Drinking my juices up,<br/>
With no root in the land<br/>
To keep my branches green,<br/>
But stand<br/>
In a bare cup.
</p>
<p>
Some tender buds were left upon my stem<br/>
In mimicry of life,<br/>
But ah! the children will not know,<br/>
Till time has withered them,<br/>
The woe<br/>
With which they're rife.
</p>
<p>
But now I see I was not plucked for naught,<br/>
And after in life's vase<br/>
Of glass set while I might survive,<br/>
But by a kind hand brought<br/>
Alive<br/>
To a strange place.
</p>
<p>
That stock thus thinned will soon redeem its hours,<br/>
And by another year,<br/>
Such as God knows, with freer air,<br/>
More fruits and fairer flowers<br/>
Will bear,<br/>
While I droop here.

<h1>Nature</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau (1841)</h2>
<p>
O Nature! I do not aspire<br/>
To be the highest in thy quire,&mdash;<br/>
To be a meteor in the sky,<br/>
Or comet that may range on high;<br/>
Only a zephyr that may blow<br/>
Among the reeds by the river low;<br/>
Give me thy most privy place<br/>
Where to run my airy race.
</p>
<p>
In some withdrawn, unpublic mead<br/>
Let me sigh upon a reed,<br/>
Or in the woods, with leafy din,<br/>
Whisper the still evening in:<br/>
Some still work give me to do,&mdash;<br/>
Only&mdash;be it near to you!
</p>
<p>
For I had rather be thy child<br/>
And pupil, in the forest wild,<br/>
Than be the king of men elsewhere,<br/>
And most sovereign slave of care:<br/>
To have one moment of thy dawn,<br/>
Than share the city's year forlorn.

<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>North Truro, July 8, 1855</h3>
<p>There being no packet, I did not leave Boston till last Thursday, though I came down on Wednesday, and Channing with me. There is no public house here; but we are boarding in a little house attached to the Highland Lighthouse with Mr. James Small, the keeper.  It is true the table is not so clean as could be desired, but I have found it much superior in that respect to a Provincetown hotel. They are what are called "good livers." Our host has another larger and very good house, within a quarter of a mile, unoccupied, where he says he can accommodate several more. He is a very good man to deal with,&mdash;has often been the representative of the town, and is perhaps the most intelligent man in it. I shall probably stay here as much as ten days longer. Board $3.50 per week. So you and Brown had better come down forthwith. You will find either the schooner Melrose or another, or both, leaving Commerce Street, or else T Wharf, at 9 A. M. (it commonly means 10), Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays,&mdash;if not other days. We left about 10 A. M., and reached Provincetown at 5 P. M.,&mdash;a very good run.  A stage runs up the Cape every morning but Sunday, starting at 4Â½ A. M., and reaches the post-office in North Truro, seven miles from Provincetown, and one from the lighthouse, about 6 o'clock. If you arrive at P.  before night, you can walk over, and leave your baggage to be sent. You can also come by cars from Boston to Yarmouth, and thence by stage forty miles more,&mdash;through every day, but it costs much more, and is not so pleasant. Come by all means, for it is the best place to see the ocean in the States.... I <em>hope</em> I shall be worth meeting.</p>

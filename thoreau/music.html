<h1>Music</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
Far from this atmosphere that music sounds<br/>
Bursting some azure chink in the dull clouds<br/>
Of sense that overarch my recent years<br/>
And steal his freshness from the noonday sun.<br/>
Ah, I have wandered many ways and lost<br/>
The boyant step, the whole responsive life<br/>
That stood with joy to hear what seemed then<br/>
Its echo, its own harmony borne back<br/>
Upon its ear. This tells of better space,<br/>
Far far beyond the woods the clouds<br/>
That bound my low and plodding valley life,<br/>
Far from my sin, remote from my distrust,<br/>
When first my healthy morning life perchance<br/>
Trod lightly as on clouds, and not as yet<br/>
My weary and faint hearted noon had sunk<br/>
Upon the clod while the bright day went by.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, I feared my life was empty, now<br/>
I know though a frail tenement that it still<br/>
Is worth repair, if yet its hollowness<br/>
Doth entertain so fine a guest within, and through<br/>
Its empty aisles there still doth ring<br/>
Though but the echo of so high a straing;<br/>
It shall be swept again and cleansed from sin<br/>
To be a thoroughfare for celestial airs;<br/>
Perchance the God who is proprietor<br/>
Will pity take on his poor tenant here<br/>
And countenance his efforts to improve<br/>
His property and make it worthy to revert,<br/>
At some late day unto himself again.

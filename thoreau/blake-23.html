<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, December 9, 1855</h3>
<p>Mr. Blake,&mdash;Thank you! thank you for going a-wooding with me,&mdash;and enjoying it,&mdash;for being warmed by my wood fire. I have indeed enjoyed it much alone. I see how I might enjoy it yet more with company,&mdash;how we might help each other to live.  And to be admitted to Nature's hearth costs nothing.  None is excluded, but excludes himself. You have only to push aside the curtain.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that you were there too. There are many more such voyages, and longer ones, to be made on that river, for it is the water of life. The Ganges is nothing to it. Observe its reflections,&mdash;no idea but is familiar to it. That river, though to dull eyes it seems terrestrial wholly, flows through Elysium.  What powers bathe in it invisible to villagers! Talk of its shallowness,&mdash;that hay-carts can be driven through it at midsummer; its depth passeth my understanding.  If, forgetting the allurements of the world, I could drink deeply enough of it; if, cast adrift from the shore, I could with complete integrity float on it, I should never be seen on the Mill-Dam again.  If there is any depth in me, there is a corresponding depth in it. It is the cold blood of the gods. I paddle and bathe in their artery.</p>
<p>I do not want a stick of wood for so trivial a use as to burn even, but they get it overnight, and carve and gild it that it may please my eye. What persevering lovers they are! What infinite pains to attract and delight us! They will supply us with fagots wrapped in the daintiest packages, and freight paid; sweet-scented woods, and bursting into flower, and resounding as if Orpheus had just left them,&mdash;these shall be our fuel, and we still prefer to chaffer with the wood-merchant!</p>
<p>The jug we found still stands draining bottom up on the bank, on the sunny side of the house. That river,&mdash;who shall say exactly whence it came, and whither it goes? Does aught that flows come from a higher source? Many things drift downward on its surface which would enrich a man. If you could only be on the alert all day, and every day! And the nights are as long as the days.</p>
<p>Do you not think you could contrive thus to get woody fibre enough to bake your wheaten bread with?  Would you not perchance have tasted the sweet crust of another kind of bread in the meanwhile, which ever hangs ready baked on the bread-fruit trees of the world?</p>
<p>Talk of burning your smoke after the wood has been consumed! There is a far more important and warming heat, commonly lost, which precedes the burning of the wood. It is the smoke of industry, which is incense.  I had been so thoroughly warmed in body and spirit, that when at length my fuel was housed, I came near selling it to the ash-man, as if I had extracted all its heat.</p>
<p>You should have been here to help me get in my boat. The last time I used it, November 27th, paddling up the Assabet, I saw a great round pine log sunk deep in the water, and with labor got it aboard.  When I was floating this home so gently, it occurred to me why I had found it. It was to make wheels with to roll my boat into winter quarters upon. So I sawed off two thick rollers from one end, pierced them for wheels, and then of a joist which I had found drifting on the river in the summer I made an axletree, and on this I rolled my boat out.</p>
<p>Miss Mary Emerson is here,&mdash;the youngest person in Concord, though about eighty,&mdash;and the most apprehensive of a genuine thought; earnest to know of your inner life; most stimulating society; and exceedingly witty withal. She says they called her old when she was young, and she has never grown any older.  I wish you could see her.</p>
<p>My books did not arrive till November 30th, the cargo of the Asia having been complete when they reached Liverpool. I have arranged them in a case which I made in the meanwhile, partly of river boards.  I have not dipped far into the new ones yet. One is splendidly bound and illuminated. They are in English, French, Latin, Greek, and Sanscrit. I have not made out the significance of this godsend yet.</p>
<p>Farewell, and bright dreams to you!</p>

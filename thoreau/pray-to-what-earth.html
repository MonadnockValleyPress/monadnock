<h1>Pray to What Earth Does This Sweet Cold Belong</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<p>
Pray to what earth does this sweet cold belong,<br/>
Which asks no duties and no conscience?<br/>
The moon goes up by leaps her cheerful path<br/>
In some far summer stratum of the sky,<br/>
While stars with their cold shine bedot her way.<br/>
The fields gleam mildly back upon the sky,<br/>
And far and near upon the leafless shrubs<br/>
The snow dust still emits a silvery light.<br/>
Under the hedge, where drift banks are their screen,<br/>
The titmice now pursue their downy dreams,<br/>
As often in the sweltering summer nights<br/>
The bee doth drop asleep in the flower cup,<br/>
When evening overtakes him with his load.<br/>
By the brooksides, in the still genial night,<br/>
The more adventurous wanderer may hear<br/>
The crystals shoot and form, and winter slow<br/>
Increase his rule by gentlest summer means.

<h1>Letters to Harrison Blake</h1>
<h2>by Henry David Thoreau</h2>
<h3>Concord, September 21, 1854</h3>
<p>Blake,&mdash;I have just read your letter, but do not mean now to answer it, solely for want of time to say what I wish. I directed a copy of "Walden" to you at Ticknor's, on the day of its publication, and it should have reached you before. I am encouraged to know that it interests you as it now stands,&mdash;a printed book,&mdash;for you apply a very severe test to it,&mdash;you make the highest demand on me. As for the excursion you speak of, I should like it right well,&mdash;indeed I thought of proposing the same thing to you and Brown, some months ago. Perhaps it would have been better if I had done so then; for in that case I should have been able to enter into it with that infinite margin to my views,&mdash;spotless of all engagements,&mdash;which I think so necessary. As it is, I have agreed to go a-lecturing to Plymouth, Sunday after next (October 1) and to Philadelphia in November, and thereafter to the West, <em>if they shall want me</em>; and, as I have prepared nothing in that shape, I feel as if my hours were spoken for. However, I think that, after having been to Plymouth, I may take a day or two&mdash;if that date will suit you and Brown. <em>At any rate</em> I will write to you then.</p>

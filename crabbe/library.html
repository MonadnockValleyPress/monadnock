<h1>Elegy</h1>
<h2>by George Crabbe (1781)</h2>
<p>
When the sad soul, by care and grief oppress'd,<br/>
Looks round the world, but looks in vain for rest;<br/>
When every object that appears in view<br/>
Partakes her gloom and seems dejected too;<br/>
Where shall affliction from itself retire?<br/>
Where fade away and placidly expire?<br/>
Alas! we fly to silent scenes in vain;<br/>
Care blasts the honours of the flow'ry plain:<br/>
Care veils in clouds the sun's meridian beam,<br/>
Sighs through the grove, and murmurs in the stream;<br/>
For when the soul is labouring in despair,<br/>
In vain the body breathes a purer air:<br/>
No storm&mdash;tost sailor sighs for slumbering seas,&mdash;<br/>
He dreads the tempest, but invokes the breeze;<br/>
On the smooth mirror of the deep resides<br/>
Reflected woe, and o'er unruffled tides<br/>
The ghost of every former danger glides.<br/>
Thus, in the calms of life, we only see<br/>
A steadier image of our misery;<br/>
But lively gales and gently clouded skies<br/>
Disperse the sad reflections as they rise;<br/>
And busy thoughts and little cares avail<br/>
To ease the mind, when rest and reason fail.<br/>
When the dull thought, by no designs employ'd,<br/>
Dwells on the past, or suffer'd or enjoy'd,<br/>
We bleed anew in every former grief,<br/>
And joys departed furnish no relief.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Hope herself, with all her flattering art,<br/>
Can cure this stubborn sickness of the heart:<br/>
The soul disdains each comfort she prepares,<br/>
And anxious searches for congenial cares;<br/>
Those lenient cares, which with our own combined,<br/>
By mix'd sensations ease th' afflicted mind,<br/>
And steal our grief away, and leave their own behind;<br/>
A lighter grief! which feeling hearts endure<br/>
Without regret, nor e'en demand a cure.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what strange art, what magic can dispose<br/>
The troubled mind to change its native woes?<br/>
Or lead us willing from ourselves, to see<br/>
Others more wretched, more undone than we?<br/>
This BOOKS can do; &mdash; nor this alone; they give<br/>
New views to life, and teach us how to live;<br/>
They soothe the grieved, the stubborn they chastise,<br/>
Fools they admonish, and confirm the wise:<br/>
Their aid they yield to all: they never shun<br/>
The man of sorrow, nor the wretch undone:<br/>
Unlike the hard, the selfish, and the proud,<br/>
They fly not sullen from the suppliant crowd;<br/>
Nor tell to various people various things,<br/>
But show to subjects what they show to kings.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, Child of Care! to make thy soul serene,<br/>
Approach the treasures of this tranquil scene;<br/>
Survey the dome, and, as the doors unfold,<br/>
The soul's best cure, in all her cares, behold!<br/>
Where mental wealth the poor in thought may find,<br/>
And mental physic the diseased in mind;<br/>
See here the balms that passion's wounds assuage;<br/>
See coolers here, that damp the fire of rage;<br/>
Here alt'ratives, by slow degrees control<br/>
The chronic habits of the sickly soul;<br/>
And round the heart and o'er the aching head,<br/>
Mild opiates here their sober influence shed.<br/>
Now bid thy soul man's busy scenes exclude,<br/>
And view composed this silent multitude:&mdash;<br/>
Silent they are &mdash; but though deprived of sound,<br/>
Here all the living languages abound;<br/>
Here all that live no more; preserved they lie,<br/>
In tombs that open to the curious eye.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blest be the gracious Power, who taught mankind<br/>
To stamp a lasting image of the mind!<br/>
Beasts may convey, and tuneful birds may sing,<br/>
Their mutual feelings, in the opening spring ;<br/>
But Man alone has skill and power to send<br/>
The heart's warm dictates to the distant friend;<br/>
'Tis his alone to please, instruct, advise<br/>
Ages remote, and nations yet to rise.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In sweet repose, when Labour's children sleep,<br/>
When Joy forgets to smile and Care to weep,<br/>
When Passion slumbers in the lover's breast,<br/>
And Fear and Guilt partake the balm of rest,<br/>
Why then denies the studious man to share<br/>
Man's common good, who feels his common care?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the hope is his, that bids him fly<br/>
Night's soft repose, and sleep's mild power defy;<br/>
That after&mdash;ages may repeat his praise,<br/>
And fame's fair meed be his, for length of days.<br/>
Delightful prospect! when we leave behind<br/>
A worthy offspring of the fruitful mind!<br/>
Which, born and nursed through many an anxious day,<br/>
Shall all our labour, all our care repay.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet all are not these births of noble kind,<br/>
Not all the children of a vigorous mind;<br/>
But where the wisest should alone preside,<br/>
The weak would rule us, and the blind would guide;<br/>
Nay, man's best efforts taste of man, and show<br/>
The poor and troubled source from which they flow;<br/>
Where most he triumphs we his wants perceive,<br/>
And for his weakness in his wisdom grieve.<br/>
But though imperfect all; yet wisdom loves<br/>
This seat serene, and virtue's self approves:&mdash;<br/>
Here come the grieved, a change of thought to find;<br/>
The curious here to feed a craving mind;<br/>
Here the devout their peaceful temple choose;<br/>
And here the poet meets his favouring Muse.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With awe, around these silent walks I tread;<br/>
These are the lasting mansions of the dead:&mdash;<br/>
"The dead!" methinks a thousand tongues reply;<br/>
"These are the tombs of such as cannot die!"<br/>
Crown'd with eternal fame, they sit sublime,<br/>
"And laugh at all the little strife of time."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, then, immortals! ye who shine above,<br/>
Each, in his sphere, the literary Jove;<br/>
And ye the common people of these skies,<br/>
A humbler crowd of nameless deities;<br/>
Whether ‘tis yours to lead the willing mind<br/>
Through History's mazes, and the turnings find;<br/>
Or, whether led by Science, ye retire,<br/>
Lost and bewilder'd in the vast desire;<br/>
Whether the Muse invites you to her bowers,<br/>
And crowns your placid brows with living flowers;<br/>
Or godlike Wisdom teaches you to show<br/>
The noblest road to happiness below;<br/>
Or men and manners prompt the easy page<br/>
To mark the flying follies of the age:<br/>
Whatever good ye boast, that good impart;<br/>
Inform the head and rectify the heart.<br/>
Lo, all in silence, all in order stand,<br/>
And mighty folios first, a lordly band ;<br/>
Then quartos their well&mdash;order'd ranks maintain,<br/>
And light octavos fill a spacious plain:<br/>
See yonder, ranged in more frequented rows,<br/>
A humbler band of duodecimos;<br/>
While undistinguish'd trifles swell the scene,<br/>
The last new play and fritter'd magazine.<br/>
Thus ‘tis in life, where first the proud, the great,<br/>
In leagued assembly keep their cumbrous state;<br/>
Heavy and huge, they fill the world with dread,<br/>
Are much admired, and are but little read:<br/>
The commons next, a middle rank, are found;<br/>
Professions fruitful pour their offspring round;<br/>
Reasoners and wits are next their place allowed,<br/>
And last, of vulgar tribes a countless crowd.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us view the form, the size, the dress;<br/>
For these the manners, nay the mind, express:<br/>
That weight of wood, with leathern coat o'erlaid;<br/>
Those ample clasps, of solid metal made;<br/>
The close&mdash;press'd leaves, unclosed for many an age;<br/>
The dull red edging of the well&mdash;fill'd page;<br/>
On the broad back the stubborn ridges roll'd,<br/>
Where yet the title stands in tarnish'd gold;<br/>
These all a sage and labour'd work proclaim,<br/>
A painful candidate for lasting fame:<br/>
No idle wit, no trifling verse can lurk<br/>
In the deep bosom of that weighty work;<br/>
No playful thoughts degrade the solemn style,<br/>
Nor one light sentence claims a transient smile.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in these times, untouch'd the pages lie,<br/>
And slumber out their immortality:<br/>
They <em>had</em> their day, when, after after all his toil,<br/>
His morning study, and his midnight oil,<br/>
At length an author's ONE great work appeared,<br/>
By patient hope, and length of days, endear'd:<br/>
Expecting nations hail'd it from the press;<br/>
Poetic friends prefix'd each kind address;<br/>
Princes and kings received the pond'rous gift,<br/>
And ladies read the work they could not lift.<br/>
Fashion, though Folly's child, and guide of fools,<br/>
Rules e'en the wisest, and in learning rules;<br/>
From crowds and courts to "Wisdom's seat she goes<br/>
And reigns triumphant o'er her mother's foes.<br/>
For lo! these fav'rites of the ancient mode<br/>
Lie all neglected like the Birthday Ode.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! needless now this weight of massy chain;<br/>
Safe in themselves, the once&mdash;loved works remain;<br/>
No readers now invade their still retreat,<br/>
None try to steal them from their parent&mdash;seat;<br/>
Like ancient beauties, they may now discard<br/>
Chains, bolts, and locks, and lie without a guard.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our patient fathers trifling themes laid by, <br/>
And roll'd, o'er labour'd works, th' attentive
eye:<br/>
Page after page the much&mdash;enduring men<br/>
Explored the deeps and shallows of the pen:<br/>
Till, every former note and comment known,<br/>
They mark'd the spacious margin with their own;<br/>
Minute corrections proved their studious care;<br/>
The little index, pointing, told us where;<br/>
And many an emendation show'd the age<br/>
Look'd far beyond the rubric title&mdash;page.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our nicer palates lighter labours seek,<br/>
Cloy'd with a folio&mdash;<em>Number</em> once a week;<br/>
Bibles, with cuts and comments, thus go down:<br/>
E'en light Voltaire is <em>number'd</em> through the town:<br/>
Thus physic flies abroad, and thus the law,<br/>
From men of study, and from men of straw;<br/>
Abstracts, abridgments, please the fickle times,<br/>
Pamphlets and plays, and politics and rhymes:<br/>
But though to write be now a task of ease,<br/>
The task is hard by manly arts to please,<br/>
When all our weakness is exposed to view,<br/>
And half our judges are our rivals too.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid these works, on which the eager eye<br/>
Delights to fix, or glides reluctant by,<br/>
When all combined, their decent pomp display,<br/>
Where shall we first our early offering pay?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To thee, DIVINITY! to thee, the light<br/>
And guide of mortals, through their mental night;<br/>
By whom we learn our hopes and fears to guide;<br/>
To bear with pain, and to contend with pride;<br/>
When grieved, to pray; when injured, to forgive;<br/>
And with the world in charity to live.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not truths like these inspired that numerous race,<br/>
Whose pious labours fill this ample space;<br/>
But questions nice, where doubt on doubt arose,<br/>
Awaked to war the long&mdash;contending foes.<br/>
For dubious meanings, learned polemics strove,<br/>
And wars on faith prevented works of love;<br/>
The brands of discord far around were hurl'd,<br/>
And holy wrath inflamed a sinful world:&mdash;<br/>
Dull though impatient, peevish though devout,<br/>
With wit disgusting, and despised without;<br/>
Saints in design, in execution men,<br/>
Peace in their looks, and vengeance in their pen.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Methinks I see, and sicken at the sight,<br/>
Spirits of spleen from yonder pile alight;<br/>
Spirits who prompted every damning page,<br/>
With pontiff pride and still&mdash;increasing rage:<br/>
Lo! how they stretch their gloomy wings around,<br/>
And lash with furious strokes the trembling ground!<br/>
They pray, they fight, they murder, and they weep,&mdash;<br/>
Wolves in their vengeance, in their manners sheep;<br/>
Too well they act the prophet's fatal part,<br/>
Denouncing evil with a zealous heart;<br/>
And each, like Jonah, is displeased if God<br/>
Repent his anger, or withhold his rod.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But here the dormant fury rests unsought,<br/>
And Zeal sleeps soundly by the foes she fought;<br/>
Here all the rage of controversy ends,<br/>
And rival zealots rest like bosom&mdash;friends:<br/>
An Athanasian here, in deep repose,<br/>
Sleeps with the fiercest of his Arian foes;<br/>
Socinians here with Calvinists abide,<br/>
And thin partitions angry chiefs divide;<br/>
Here wily Jesuits simple Quakers meet,<br/>
And Bellarmine has rest at Luther's feet.<br/>
Great authors, for the church's glory fired,<br/>
Are for the church's peace to rest retired;<br/>
And close beside, a mystic, maudlin race,<br/>
Lie "Crumbs of Comfort for the Babes of Grace."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against her foes Religion well defends<br/>
Her sacred truths, but often fears her friends:<br/>
If learn'd, their pride, if weak, their zeal she dreads,<br/>
And their hearts' weakness, who have soundest heads.<br/>
But most she fears the controversial pen,<br/>
The holy strife of disputatious men;<br/>
Who the blest Gospel's peaceful page explore,<br/>
Only to fight against its precepts more.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Near to these seats behold yon slender frames,<br/>
All closely fill'd and mark'd with modern names;<br/>
Where no fair science ever shows her face,<br/>
Few sparks of genius, and no spark of grace;<br/>
There sceptics rest, a still&mdash;increasing throng,<br/>
And stretch their widening wings ten thousand strong;<br/>
Some in close fight their dubious claims maintain;<br/>
Some skirmish lightly, fly, and fight again;<br/>
Coldly profane, and impiously gay,<br/>
Their end the same, though various in their way.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When first Religion came to bless the land,<br/>
Her friends were then a firm believing band;<br/>
To doubt was then to plunge in guilt extreme,<br/>
And all was gospel that a monk could dream;<br/>
Insulted Reason fled the grov'lling soul,<br/>
For Fear to guide, and visions to control:<br/>
But now, when Reason has assumed her throne,<br/>
She, in her turn, demands to reign alone;<br/>
Rejecting all that lies beyond her view,<br/>
And, being judge, will be a witness too:<br/>
Insulted Faith then leaves the doubtful mind,<br/>
To seek for truth, without a power to find:<br/>
Ah! when will both in friendly beams unite,<br/>
And pour on erring man resistless light?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to the seats, well stored with works divine,<br/>
An ample space, PHILOSOPHY! is thine;<br/>
Our reason's guide, by whose assisting light<br/>
We trace the moral bounds of wrong and right;<br/>
Our guide through nature, from the sterile clay,<br/>
To the bright orbs of yon celestial way!<br/>
'Tis thine, the great, the golden chain to trace,<br/>
Which runs through all, connecting race with race;<br/>
Save where those puzzling, stubborn links remain,<br/>
Which thy inferior light pursues in vain:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How vice and virtue in the soul contend;<br/>
How widely differ, yet how nearly blend;<br/>
What various passions war on either part,<br/>
And now confirm, now melt the yielding heart:<br/>
How Fancy loves around the world to stray,<br/>
While Judgment slowly picks his sober way;<br/>
The stores of memory, and the flights sublime<br/>
Of genius, bound by neither space nor time; &mdash;<br/>
All these divine Philosophy explores,<br/>
Till, lost in awe, she wonders and adores.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From these, descending to the earth, she turns,<br/>
And matter, in its various forms, discerns;<br/>
She parts the beamy light with skill profound,<br/>
Metes the thin air, and weighs the flying sound;<br/>
‘Tis hers the lightning from the clouds to call,<br/>
And teach the fiery mischief where to fall.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet more her volumes teach, &mdash; on these we look<br/>
As abstracts drawn from Nature's larger book:<br/>
Here, first described, the torpid earth appears,<br/>
And next, the vegetable robe it wears;<br/>
Where flow'ry tribes, in valleys, fields, and groves,<br/>
Nurse the still flame, and feed the silent loves;<br/>
Loves where no grief, nor joy, nor bliss, nor pain,<br/>
Warm the glad heart or vex the labouring brain;<br/>
But as the green blood moves along the blade,<br/>
The bed of Flora on the branch is made;<br/>
Where, without passion love instinctive lives,<br/>
And gives new life, unconscious that it gives.<br/>
Advancing still in Nature's maze, we trace,<br/>
In dens and burning plains, her savage race<br/>
With those tame tribes who on their lord attend,<br/>
And find in man a master and a friend;<br/>
Man crowns the scene, a world of wonders new,<br/>
A moral world, that well demands our view.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This world is here; for, of more lofty kind,<br/>
These neighbouring volumes reason on the mind;<br/>
They paint the state of man ere yet endued<br/>
With knowledge; &mdash; man, poor, ignorant, and rude;<br/>
Then, as his state improves, their pages swell,<br/>
And all its cares, and all its comforts, tell:<br/>
Here we behold how inexperience buys,<br/>
At little price, the wisdom of the wise;<br/>
Without the troubles of an active state,<br/>
Without the cares and dangers of the great,<br/>
Without the miseries of the poor, we know<br/>
What wisdom, wealth, and poverty bestow;<br/>
We see how reason calms the raging mind,<br/>
And how contending passions urge mankind:<br/>
Some, won by virtue, glow with sacred fire;<br/>
Some, lured by vice, indulge the low desire;<br/>
Whilst others, won by either, now pursue<br/>
The guilty chase, now keep the good in view;<br/>
For ever wretched, with themselves at strife,<br/>
They lead a puzzled, vex'd, uncertain life;<br/>
For transient vice bequeaths a lingering pain,<br/>
Which transient virtue seeks to cure in vain.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst thus engaged, high views enlarge the soul,<br/>
New interests draw, new principles control:<br/>
Nor thus the soul alone resigns her grief,<br/>
But here the tortured body finds relief;<br/>
For see where yonder sage Arachne shapes<br/>
Her subtile gin, that not a fly escapes!<br/>
There PHYSIC fills the space, and far around,<br/>
Pile above pile her learned works abound:<br/>
Glorious their aim&mdash; to ease the labouring heart;<br/>
To war with death, and stop his flying dart;<br/>
To trace the source whence the fierce contest grew,<br/>
And life's short lease on easier terms renew;<br/>
To calm the phrensy of the burning brain;<br/>
To heal the tortures of imploring pain;<br/>
Or, when more powerful ills all efforts brave,<br/>
To ease the victim no device can save,<br/>
And smooth the stormy passage to the grave.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But man, who knows no good unmix'd and pure,<br/>
Oft finds a poison where he sought a cure;<br/>
For grave deceivers lodge their labours here,<br/>
And cloud the science they pretend to clear;<br/>
Scourges for sin, the solemn tribe are sent;<br/>
Like fire and storms, they call us to repent;<br/>
But storms subside, and fires forget to rage.<br/>
<em>These</em> are eternal scourges of the age:<br/>
'Tis not enough that each terrific hand<br/>
Spreads desolations round a guilty land;<br/>
But train'd to ill, and harden'd by its crimes,<br/>
Their pen relentless kills through future times.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, ye, who search these records of the dead&mdash;<br/>
Who read huge works, to boast what ye have read;<br/>
Can all the real knowledge ye possess,<br/>
Or those &mdash; if such there are &mdash; who more than guess,<br/>
Atone for each impostor's wild mistakes,<br/>
And mend the blunders pride or folly makes ?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What thought so wild, what airy dream so light,<br/>
That will not prompt a theorist to write?<br/>
What art so prevalent, what proof so strong,<br/>
That will convince him his attempt is wrong?<br/>
One in the solids finds each lurking ill,<br/>
Nor grants the passive fluids power to kill;<br/>
A learned friend some subtler reason brings,<br/>
Absolves the channels, but condemns their springs;<br/>
The subtile nerves, that shun the doctor's eye,<br/>
Escape no more his subtler theory;<br/>
The vital heat, that warms the labouring heart,<br/>
Lends a fair system to these sons of art;<br/>
The vital air, a pure and subtile stream,<br/>
Serves a foundation for an airy scheme,<br/>
Assists the doctor, and supports his dream.<br/>
Some have their favourite ills, and each disease<br/>
Is but a younger branch that kills from these;<br/>
One to the gout contracts all human pain;<br/>
He views it raging in the frantic brain;<br/>
Finds it in fevers all his efforts mar,<br/>
And sees it lurking in the cold catarrh:<br/>
Bilious by some, by others nervous seen,<br/>
Rage the fantastic demons of the spleen;<br/>
And every symptom of the strange disease<br/>
With every system of the sage agrees.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye frigid tribe, on whom I wasted long<br/>
The tedious hours, and ne'er indulged in song;<br/>
Ye first seducers of my easy heart,<br/>
Who promised knowledge ye could not impart;<br/>
Ye dull deluders, truth's destructive foes;<br/>
Ye sons of fiction, clad in stupid prose;<br/>
Ye treacherous leaders, who, yourselves in doubt,<br/>
Light up false fires, and send us far about;&mdash;<br/>
Still may yon spider round your pages spin,<br/>
Subtile and slow, her emblematic gin!<br/>
Buried in dust and lost in silence, dwell,<br/>
Most potent, grave, and reverend friends &mdash; farewell!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Near these, and where the setting sun displays,<br/>
Through the dim window, his departing rays,<br/>
And gilds yon columns, there, on either side,<br/>
The huge Abridgments of the LAW abide;<br/>
Fruitful as vice the dread correctors stand,<br/>
And spread their guardian terrors round the land;<br/>
Yet, as the best that human care can do<br/>
Is mix'd with error, oft with evil too,<br/>
Skill'd in deceit, and practised to evade,<br/>
Knaves stand secure, for whom these laws were made,<br/>
And justice vainly each expedient tries,<br/>
While art eludes it, or while power defies.<br/>
"Ah! happy age," the youthful poet sings,<br/>
"When the free nations knew not laws nor kings,<br/>
When all were blest to share a common store,<br/>
And none were proud of wealth, for none were poor,<br/>
No wars nor tumults vex'd each still domain,<br/>
No thirst of empire, no desire of gain;<br/>
No proud great man, nor one who would be great,<br/>
Drove modest merit from its proper state;<br/>
Nor into distant climes would Avarice roam,<br/>
To fetch delights for Luxury at home:<br/>
Bound by no ties which kept the soul in awe,<br/>
They dwelt at liberty, and love was law!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mistaken youth! each nation first was rude,<br/>
Each man a cheerless son of solitude,<br/>
To whom no joys of social life were known,<br/>
None felt a care that was not all his own;<br/>
Or in some languid clime his abject soul<br/>
Bow'd to a little tyrant's stern control;<br/>
A slave, with slaves his monarch's throne he raised,<br/>
And in rude song his ruder idol praised;<br/>
The meaner cares of life were all he knew;<br/>
Bounded his pleasures, and his wishes few;<br/>
But when by slow degrees the Arts arose,<br/>
And Science waken'd from her long repose;<br/>
When Commerce, rising from the bed of ease,<br/>
Ran round the land, and pointed to the seas;<br/>
When Emulation, born with jealous eye,<br/>
And Avarice, lent their spurs to industry;<br/>
Then one by one the numerous laws were made,<br/>
Those to control, and these to succour trade;<br/>
To curb the insolence of rude command,<br/>
To snatch the victim from the usurer's hand;<br/>
To awe the bold, to yield the wrong'd redress,<br/>
And feed the poor with Luxury's excess."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some vast flood, unbounded, fierce, and strong,<br/>
His nature leads ungovern'd man along;<br/>
Like mighty bulwarks made to stem that tide,<br/>
The laws are form'd, and placed on ev'ry side;<br/>
Whene'er it breaks the bounds by these decreed,<br/>
New statutes rise, and stronger laws succeed;<br/>
More and more gentle grows the dying stream,<br/>
More and more strong the rising bulwarks seem;<br/>
Till, like a miner working sure and slow,<br/>
Luxury creeps on, and ruins all below;<br/>
The basis sinks, the ample piles decay;<br/>
The stately fabric, shakes and falls away;<br/>
Primeval want and ignorance come on,<br/>
But Freedom, that exalts the savage state, is gone.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, HISTORY ranks; &mdash; there full in front she lies,<br/>
And every nation her dread tale supplies;<br/>
Yet History has her doubts, and every age<br/>
With sceptic queries marks the passing page;<br/>
Records of old nor later date are clear,<br/>
Too distant those, and these are placed too near;<br/>
There time conceals the objects from our view,<br/>
Here our own passions and a writer's too:<br/>
Yet, in these volumes, see how states arose!<br/>
Guarded by virtue from surrounding foes;<br/>
Their virtue lost, and of their triumphs vain,<br/>
Lo! how they sunk to slavery again!<br/>
Satiate with power, of fame and wealth possess'd,<br/>
A nation grows too glorious to be blest;<br/>
Conspicuous made, she stands the mark of all,<br/>
And foes join foes to triumph in her fall.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus speaks the page that paints ambition's
race,<br/>
The monarch's pride, his glory, his disgrace;<br/>
The headlong course, that madd'ning heroes run,<br/>
How soon triumphant, and how soon undone;<br/>
How slaves, turn'd tyrants, offer crowns to sale,<br/>
And each fall'n nation's melancholy tale.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! where of late the Book of Martyrs stood,<br/>
Old pious tracts, and Bibles bound in wood;<br/>
There, such the taste of our degenerate age,<br/>
Stand the profane delusions of the STAGE:<br/>
Yet virtue owns the TRAGIC MUSE a friend,<br/>
Fable her means, morality her end;<br/>
For this she rules all passions in their turns,<br/>
And now the bosom bleeds, and now it burns;<br/>
Pity with weeping eye surveys her bowl,<br/>
Her anger swells, her terror chills the soul;<br/>
She makes the vile to virtue yield applause,<br/>
And own her sceptre while they break her laws;<br/>
For vice in others is abhorr'd of all,<br/>
And villains triumph when the worthless fall.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not thus her sister COMEDY prevails,<br/>
Who shoots at Folly, for her arrow fails;<br/>
Folly, by Dulness arm'd, eludes the wound,<br/>
And harmless sees the feather'd shafts rebound;<br/>
Unhurt she stands, applauds the archer's skill,<br/>
Laughs at her malice, and is Folly still.<br/>
Yet well the Muse portrays, in fancied scenes,<br/>
What pride will stoop to, what profession means;<br/>
How formal fools the farce of state applaud;<br/>
How caution watches at the lips of fraud;<br/>
The wordy variance of domestic life;<br/>
The tyrant husband, the retorting wife;<br/>
The snares for innocence, the lie of trade,<br/>
And the smooth tongue's habitual masquerade.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With her the Virtues too obtain a place,<br/>
Each gentle passion, each becoming grace;<br/>
The social joy in life's securer road,<br/>
Its easy pleasure, its substantial good;<br/>
The happy thought that conscious virtue gives,<br/>
And all that ought to live, and all that lives.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But who are these? Methinks a noble mien<br/>
And awful grandeur in their form are seen,<br/>
Now in disgrace: what though by time is spread<br/>
Polluting dust o'er every reverend head;<br/>
What though beneath yon gilded tribe they lie,<br/>
And dull observers pass insulting by:<br/>
Forbid it shame, forbid it decent awe,<br/>
What seems so grave, should no attention draw!<br/>
Come, let us then with reverend step advance,<br/>
And greet &mdash; the ancient worthies of ROMANCE.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, ye profane! I feel a former dread,<br/>
A thousand visions float around my head:<br/>
Hark! hollow blasts through empty courts resound,<br/>
And shadowy forms with staring eyes stalk round;<br/>
See! moats and bridges, walls and castles rise,<br/>
Ghosts, fairies, demons, dance before our eyes;<br/>
Lo! magic verse inscribed on golden gate,<br/>
And bloody hand that beckons on to fate:&mdash;<br/>
"And who art thou, thou little page, unfold?<br/>
Say, doth thy lord my Claribel withhold?<br/>
Go tell him straight, Sir Knight, thou must resign<br/>
The captive queen; &mdash; for Claribel is mine."<br/>
Away he flies; and now for bloody deeds,<br/>
Black suits of armour, masks, and foaming steeds;<br/>
The giant falls; his recreant throat I seize,<br/>
And from his corslet take the massy keys:&mdash;<br/>
Dukes, lords, and knights, in long procession move, <br/>
Released from bondage with my virgin love:&mdash;<br/>
She comes! she comes! in all the charms of youth,<br/>
Unequall'd love, and unsuspected truth!<br/>
Ah! happy he who thus, in magic themes,<br/>
O'er worlds bewitch'd, in early rapture dreams,<br/>
Where wild Enchantment waves her potent wand,<br/>
And Fancy's beauties fill her fairy land;<br/>
Where doubtful objects strange desires excite,<br/>
And Fear and Ignorance afford delight.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But lost, for ever lost, to me these joys,<br/>
Which Reason scatters, and which Time destroys;<br/>
Too dearly bought: maturer judgment calls<br/>
My busied mind from tales and madrigals;<br/>
My doughty giants all are slain or fled,<br/>
And all my knignts &mdash; blue, green, and yellow &mdash; dead!<br/>
No more the midnight fairy tribe I view,<br/>
All in the merry moonshine tippling dew;<br/>
E'en the last lingering fiction of the brain,<br/>
The churchyard ghost, is now at rest again;<br/>
And all these wayward wanderings of my youth<br/>
Fly Reason's power, and shun the light of Truth.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Fiction then does real joy reside,<br/>
And is our reason the delusive guide?<br/>
Is it then right to dream the syrens sing?<br/>
Or mount enraptured on the dragon's wing?<br/>
No; 'tis the infant mind, to care unknown,<br/>
That makes th' imagined paradise its own;<br/>
Soon as reflections in the bosom rise,<br/>
Light slumbers vanish from the clouded eyes:<br/>
The tear and smile, that once together rose,<br/>
Are then divorced; the head and heart are foes:<br/>
Enchantment bows to Wisdom's serious plan,<br/>
And Pain and Prudence make and mar the man.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While thus, of power and fancied empire vain,<br/>
With various thoughts my mind I entertain;<br/>
While books, my slaves, with tyrant hand I seize,<br/>
Pleased with the pride that will not let them please,<br/>
Sudden I find terrific thoughts arise,<br/>
And sympathetic sorrow fills my eyes;<br/>
For, lo! while yet my heart admits the wound,<br/>
I see the CRITIC army ranged around.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Foes to our race! if ever ye have known<br/>
A father's fears for offspring of your own;<br/>
If ever, smiling o'er a lucky line,<br/>
Ye thought the sudden sentiment divine,<br/>
Then paused and doubted, and then, tired of doubt,<br/>
With rage as sudden dash'd the stanza out;&mdash;<br/>
If, after fearing much and pausing long,<br/>
Ye ventured on the world your labour'd song,<br/>
And from the crusty critics of those days<br/>
Implored the feeble tribute of their praise;<br/>
Remember now the fears that moved you then,<br/>
And, spite of truth, let mercy guide your pen.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What vent'rous race are ours! what mighty foes<br/>
Lie waiting all around them to oppose!<br/>
What treacherous friends betray them to the fight!<br/>
What dangers threaten them &mdash; yet still they write:<br/>
A hapless tribe! to every evil born,<br/>
Whom villains hate, and fools affect to scorn:<br/>
Strangers they come, amid a world of woe,<br/>
And taste the largest portion ere they go.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensive I spoke, and cast mine eyes around;<br/>
The roof, methought, return'd a solemn sound;<br/>
Each column seem'd to shake, and clouds, like smoke,<br/>
From dusty piles and ancient volumes broke;<br/>
Gathering above, like mists condensed they seem,<br/>
Exhaled in summer from the rushy stream;<br/>
Like flowing robes they now appear, and twine<br/>
Round the large members of a form divine;<br/>
His silver beard, that swept his aged breast,<br/>
His piercing eye, that inward light express'd,<br/>
Were seen, &mdash; but clouds and darkness veil'd the rest. <br/>
Fear chill'd my heart: to one of mortal race,<br/>
How awful seem'd the Genius of the place!<br/>
So in Cimmerian shores, Ulysses saw<br/>
His parent&mdash;shade, and shrunk in pious awe;<br/>
Like him I stood, and wrapt in thought profound,<br/>
When from the pitying power broke forth a solemn sound:&mdash;<br/>
"Care lives with all; no rules, no precepts save<br/>
The wise from woe, no fortitude the brave;<br/>
Grief is to man as certain as the grave:<br/>
Tempests and storms in life's whole progress rise,<br/>
And hope shines dimly through o'erclouded skies.<br/>
Some drops of comfort on the favour'd fall,<br/>
But showers of sorrow are the lot of <em>all</em>:<br/>
Partial to talents, then, shall Heav'n withdraw<br/>
Th' afflicting rod, or break the general law?<br/>
Shall he who soars, inspired by loftier views,<br/>
Life's little cares and little pains refuse?<br/>
Shall he not rather feel a double share<br/>
Of mortal woe, when doubly arm'd to bear?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hard is his fate who builds his peace of mind<br/>
On the precarious mercy of mankind;<br/>
Who hopes for wild and visionary things,<br/>
And mounts o'er unknown seas with vent'rous wings;<br/>
But as, of various evils that befall<br/>
The human race, some portion goes to all;<br/>
To him perhaps the milder lot's assigned<br/>
Who feels his consolation in his mind,<br/>
And, lock'd within his bosom, bears about<br/>
A mental charm for every care without.<br/>
E'en in the pangs of each domestic grief,<br/>
Or health or vigorous hope affords relief;<br/>
And every wound the tortured bosom feels,<br/>
Or virtue bears, or some preserver heals;<br/>
Some generous friend of ample power possess'd;<br/>
Some feeling heart, that bleeds for the distress'd;<br/>
Some breast that glows with virtues all divine;<br/>
Some noble RUTLAND, misery's friend and thine.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nor say, the Muse's song, the Poet's pen,<br/>
Merit the scorn they meet from little men.<br/>
With cautious freedom if the numbers flow,<br/>
Not wildly high, nor pitifully low;<br/>
If vice alone their honest aims oppose,<br/>
Why so ashamed their friends, so loud their foes?<br/>
Happy for men in every age and clime,<br/>
If all the sons of vision dealt in rhyme.<br/>
Go on, then, Son of Vision! still pursue<br/>
Thy airy dreams; the world is dreaming too.<br/>
Ambition's lofty views, the pomp of state,<br/>
The pride of wealth, the splendour of the great,<br/>
Stripp'd of their mask, their cares and troubles known,<br/>
Are visions far less happy than thy own:<br/>
Go on! and, while the sons of care complain,<br/>
Be wisely gay and innocently vain;<br/>
While serious souls are by their fears undone,<br/>
Blow sportive bladders in the beamy sun,<br/>
And call them worlds! and bid the greatest show<br/>
More radiant colours in their worlds below:<br/>
Then, as they break, the slaves of care reprove,<br/>
And tell them, Such are all the toys they love."<br/>

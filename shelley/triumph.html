<h1>The Triumph of Life</h1>
<h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
<p>[This is the poem Shelley was working on at the time of his death.]</p>
<p>
Swift as a spirit hastening to his task<br/>
Of glory and of good, the Sun sprang forth<br/>
Rejoicing in his splendour, and the mask<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of darkness fell from the awakened Earth&mdash;<br/>
The smokeless altars of the mountain snows<br/>
Flamed above crimson clouds, and at the birth<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of light, the Ocean's orison arose,<br/>
To which the birds tempered their matin lay.<br/>
All flowers in field or forest which unclose<br/>
</p>
<p>
Their trembling eyelids to the kiss of day,<br/>
Swinging their censers in the element,<br/>
With orient incense lit by the new ray<br/>
</p>
<p>
Burned slow and inconsumably, and sent<br/>
Their odorous sighs up to the smiling air;<br/>
And, in succession due, did continent,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Isle, ocean, and all things that in them wear<br/>
The form and character of mortal mould,<br/>
Rise as the Sun their father rose, to bear<br/>
</p>
<p>
Their portion of the toil, which he of old<br/>
Took as his own, and then imposed on them:<br/>
But I, whom thoughts which must remain untold<br/>
</p>
<p>
Had kept as wakeful as the stars that gem<br/>
The cone of night, now they were laid asleep<br/>
Stretched my faint limbs beneath the hoary stem<br/>
</p>
<p>
Which an old chestnut flung athwart the steep<br/>
Of a green Apennine: before me fled<br/>
The night; behind me rose the day; the deep<br/>
</p>
<p>
Was at my feet, and Heaven above my head,&mdash;<br/>
When a strange trance over my fancy grew<br/>
Which was not slumber, for the shade it spread<br/>
</p>
<p>
Was so transparent, that the scene came through<br/>
As clear as when a veil of light is drawn<br/>
O'er evening hills they glimmer; and I knew<br/>
</p>
<p>
That I had felt the freshness of that dawn<br/>
Bathe in the same cold dew my brow and hair,<br/>
And sate as thus upon that slope of lawn<br/>
</p>
<p>
Under the self-same bough, and heard as there<br/>
The birds, the fountains and the ocean hold<br/>
Sweet talk in music through the enamoured air,<br/>
And then a vision on my train was rolled.<br/>
</p>
<p>
...</p>
<p>
As in that trance of wondrous thought I lay,<br/>
This was the tenour of my waking dream:&mdash;<br/>
Methought I sate beside a public way<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thick strewn with summer dust, and a great stream<br/>
Of people there was hurrying to and fro,<br/>
Numerous as gnats upon the evening gleam,<br/>
</p>
<p>
All hastening onward, yet none seemed to know<br/>
Whither he went, or whence he came, or why<br/>
He made one of the multitude, and so<br/>
</p>
<p>
Was borne amid the crowd, as through the sky<br/>
One of the million leaves of summer's bier;<br/>
Old age and youth, manhood and infancy,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Mixed in one mighty torrent did appear,<br/>
Some flying from the thing they feared, and some<br/>
Seeking the object of another's fear;<br/>
</p>
<p>
And others, as with steps towards the tomb,<br/>
Pored on the trodden worms that crawled beneath,<br/>
And others mournfully within the gloom<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of their own shadow walked, and called it death;<br/>
And some fled from it as it were a ghost,<br/>
Half fainting in the affliction of vain breath:<br/>
</p>
<p>
But more, with motions which each other crossed,<br/>
Pursued or shunned the shadows the clouds threw,<br/>
Or birds within the noonday aether lost,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Upon that path where flowers never grew,&mdash;<br/>
And, weary with vain toil and faint for thirst,<br/>
Heard not the fountains, whose melodious dew<br/>
</p>
<p>
Out of their mossy cells forever burst;<br/>
Nor felt the breeze which from the forest told<br/>
Of grassy paths and wood-lawns interspersed<br/>
</p>
<p>
With overarching elms and caverns cold,<br/>
And violet banks where sweet dreams brood, but they<br/>
Pursued their serious folly as of old.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And as I gazed, methought that in the way<br/>
The throng grew wilder, as the woods of June<br/>
When the south wind shakes the extinguished day,<br/>
</p>
<p>
And a cold glare, intenser than the noon,<br/>
But icy cold, obscured with blinding light<br/>
The sun, as he the stars. Like the young moon&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
When on the sunlit limits of the night<br/>
Her white shell trembles amid crimson air,<br/>
And whilst the sleeping tempest gathers might&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
Doth, as the herald of its coming, bear<br/>
The ghost of its dead mother, whose dim form<br/>
Bends in dark aether from her infant's chair,&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
So came a chariot on the silent storm<br/>
Of its own rushing splendour, and a Shape<br/>
So sate within, as one whom years deform,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Beneath a dusky hood and double cape,<br/>
Crouching within the shadow of a tomb;<br/>
And o'er what seemed the head a cloud-like crape<br/>
</p>
<p>
Was bent, a dun and faint aethereal gloom<br/>
Tempering the light. Upon the chariot-beam<br/>
A Janus-visaged Shadow did assume<br/>
</p>
<p>
The guidance of that wonder-winged team;<br/>
The shapes which drew it in thick lightenings<br/>
Were lost:&mdash;I heard alone on the air's soft stream<br/>
</p>
<p>
The music of their ever-moving wings.<br/>
All the four faces of that Charioteer<br/>
Had their eyes banded; little profit brings<br/>
</p>
<p>
Speed in the van and blindness in the rear,<br/>
Nor then avail the beams that quench the sun,&mdash;<br/>
Or that with banded eyes could pierce the sphere<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of all that is, has been or will be done;<br/>
So ill was the car guided&mdash;but it passed<br/>
With solemn speed majestically on.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The crowd gave way, and I arose aghast,<br/>
Or seemed to rise, so mighty was the trance,<br/>
And saw, like clouds upon the thunder-blast,<br/>
</p>
<p>
The million with fierce song and maniac dance<br/>
Raging around&mdash;such seemed the jubilee<br/>
As when to greet some conqueror's advance<br/>
</p>
<p>
Imperial Rome poured forth her living sea<br/>
From senate-house, and forum, and theatre,<br/>
When ... upon the free<br/>
</p>
<p>
Had bound a yoke, which soon they stooped to bear.<br/>
Nor wanted here the just similitude<br/>
Of a triumphal pageant, for where'er<br/>
</p>
<p>
The chariot rolled, a captive multitude<br/>
Was driven;&mdash;all those who had grown old in power<br/>
Or misery,&mdash;all who had their age subdued<br/>
</p>
<p>
By action or by suffering, and whose hour<br/>
Was drained to its last sand in weal or woe,<br/>
So that the trunk survived both fruit and flower;&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
All those whose fame or infamy must grow<br/>
Till the great winter lay the form and name<br/>
Of this green earth with them for ever low;&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
All but the sacred few who could not tame<br/>
Their spirits to the conquerors&mdash;but as soon<br/>
As they had touched the world with living flame,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fled back like eagles to their native noon,<br/>
Or those who put aside the diadem<br/>
Of earthly thrones or gems...<br/>
</p>
<p>
Were there, of Athens or Jerusalem.<br/>
Were neither mid the mighty captives seen,<br/>
Nor mid the ribald crowd that followed them,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor those who went before fierce and obscene.<br/>
The wild dance maddens in the van, and those<br/>
Who lead it&mdash;fleet as shadows on the green,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Outspeed the chariot, and without repose<br/>
Mix with each other in tempestuous measure<br/>
To savage music, wilder as it grows,<br/>
</p>
<p>
They, tortured by their agonizing pleasure,<br/>
Convulsed and on the rapid whirlwinds spun<br/>
Of that fierce Spirit, whose unholy leisure<br/>
</p>
<p>
Was soothed by mischief since the world begun,<br/>
Throw back their heads and loose their streaming hair;<br/>
And in their dance round her who dims the sun,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Maidens and youths fling their wild arms in air<br/>
As their feet twinkle; they recede, and now<br/>
Bending within each other's atmosphere,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Kindle invisibly&mdash;and as they glow,<br/>
Like moths by light attracted and repelled,<br/>
Oft to their bright destruction come and go,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Till like two clouds into one vale impelled,<br/>
That shake the mountains when their lightnings mingle<br/>
And die in rain&mdash;the fiery band which held<br/>
</p>
<p>
Their natures, snaps&mdash;while the shock still may tingle<br/>
One falls and then another in the path<br/>
Senseless&mdash;nor is the desolation single,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet ere I can say WHERE&mdash;the chariot hath<br/>
Passed over them&mdash;nor other trace I find<br/>
But as of foam after the ocean's wrath<br/>
</p>
<p>
Is spent upon the desert shore;&mdash;behind,<br/>
Old men and women foully disarrayed,<br/>
Shake their gray hairs in the insulting wind,<br/>
</p>
<p>
And follow in the dance, with limbs decayed,<br/>
Seeking to reach the light which leaves them still<br/>
Farther behind and deeper in the shade.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But not the less with impotence of will<br/>
They wheel, though ghastly shadows interpose<br/>
Round them and round each other, and fulfil<br/>
</p>
<p>
Their work, and in the dust from whence they rose<br/>
Sink, and corruption veils them as they lie,<br/>
And past in these performs what ... in those.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Struck to the heart by this sad pageantry,<br/>
Half to myself I said&mdash;'And what is this?<br/>
Whose shape is that within the car? And why&mdash;'<br/>
</p>
<p>
I would have added&mdash;'is all here amiss?&mdash;'<br/>
But a voice answered&mdash;'Life!'&mdash;I turned, and knew<br/>
(O Heaven, have mercy on such wretchedness!)<br/>
</p>
<p>
That what I thought was an old root which grew<br/>
To strange distortion out of the hill side,<br/>
Was indeed one of those deluded crew,<br/>
</p>
<p>
And that the grass, which methought hung so wide<br/>
And white, was but his thin discoloured hair,<br/>
And that the holes he vainly sought to hide,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Were or had been eyes:&mdash;'If thou canst forbear<br/>
To join the dance, which I had well forborne,'<br/>
Said the grim Feature, of my thought aware,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'I will unfold that which to this deep scorn<br/>
Led me and my companions, and relate<br/>
The progress of the pageant since the morn;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'If thirst of knowledge shall not then abate,<br/>
Follow it thou even to the night, but I<br/>
Am weary.'&mdash;Then like one who with the weight<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of his own words is staggered, wearily<br/>
He paused; and ere he could resume, I cried:<br/>
'First, who art thou?'&mdash;'Before thy memory,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'I feared, loved, hated, suffered, did and died,<br/>
And if the spark with which Heaven lit my spirit<br/>
Had been with purer nutriment supplied,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Corruption would not now thus much inherit<br/>
Of what was once Rousseau,&mdash;nor this disguise<br/>
Stain that which ought to have disdained to wear it;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'If I have been extinguished, yet there rise<br/>
A thousand beacons from the spark I bore'&mdash;<br/>
'And who are those chained to the car?'&mdash;'The wise,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'The great, the unforgotten,&mdash;they who wore<br/>
Mitres and helms and crowns, or wreaths of light,<br/>
Signs of thought's empire over thought&mdash;their lore<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Taught them not this, to know themselves; their might<br/>
Could not repress the mystery within,<br/>
And for the morn of truth they feigned, deep night<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Caught them ere evening.'&mdash;'Who is he with chin<br/>
Upon his breast, and hands crossed on his chain?'&mdash;<br/>
'The child of a fierce hour; he sought to win<br/>
</p>
<p>
'The world, and lost all that it did contain<br/>
Of greatness, in its hope destroyed; and more<br/>
Of fame and peace than virtue's self can gain<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Without the opportunity which bore<br/>
Him on its eagle pinions to the peak<br/>
From which a thousand climbers have before<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Fallen, as Napoleon fell.'&mdash;I felt my cheek<br/>
Alter, to see the shadow pass away,<br/>
Whose grasp had left the giant world so weak<br/>
</p>
<p>
That every pigmy kicked it as it lay;<br/>
And much I grieved to think how power and will<br/>
In opposition rule our mortal day,<br/>
</p>
<p>
And why God made irreconcilable<br/>
Good and the means of good; and for despair<br/>
I half disdained mine eyes' desire to fill<br/>
</p>
<p>
With the spent vision of the times that were<br/>
And scarce have ceased to be.&mdash;'Dost thou behold,'<br/>
Said my guide, 'those spoilers spoiled, Voltaire,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Frederick, and Paul, Catherine, and Leopold,
And hoary anarchs, demagogues, and sage&mdash;
names which the world thinks always old,</p>
<p>
'For in the battle Life and they did wage,<br/>
She remained conqueror. I was overcome<br/>
By my own heart alone, which neither age,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Nor tears, nor infamy, nor now the tomb<br/>
Could temper to its object.'&mdash;'Let them pass,'<br/>
I cried, 'the world and its mysterious doom<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Is not so much more glorious than it was,<br/>
That I desire to worship those who drew<br/>
New figures on its false and fragile glass<br/>
</p>
<p>
'As the old faded.'&mdash;'Figures ever new<br/>
Rise on the bubble, paint them as you may;<br/>
We have but thrown, as those before us threw,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Our shadows on it as it passed away.<br/>
But mark how chained to the triumphal chair<br/>
The mighty phantoms of an elder day;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'All that is mortal of great Plato there<br/>
Expiates the joy and woe his master knew not;<br/>
The star that ruled his doom was far too fair.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And life, where long that flower of Heaven grew not,<br/>
Conquered that heart by love, which gold, or pain,<br/>
Or age, or sloth, or slavery could subdue not.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And near him walk the ... twain,<br/>
The tutor and his pupil, whom Dominion<br/>
Followed as tame as vulture in a chain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'The world was darkened beneath either pinion<br/>
Of him whom from the flock of conquerors<br/>
Fame singled out for her thunder-bearing minion;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'The other long outlived both woes and wars,<br/>
Throned in the thoughts of men, and still had kept<br/>
The jealous key of Truth's eternal doors,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'If Bacon's eagle spirit had not lept<br/>
Like lightning out of darkness&mdash;he compelled<br/>
The Proteus shape of Nature, as it slept<br/>
</p>
<p>
'To wake, and lead him to the caves that held<br/>
The treasure of the secrets of its reign.<br/>
See the great bards of elder time, who quelled<br/>
</p>
<p>
'The passions which they sung, as by their strain<br/>
May well be known: their living melody<br/>
Tempers its own contagion to the vein<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Of those who are infected with it&mdash;I<br/>
Have suffered what I wrote, or viler pain!<br/>
And so my words have seeds of misery&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Even as the deeds of others, not as theirs.'<br/>
And then he pointed to a company,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Midst whom I quickly recognized the heirs<br/>
Of Caesar's crime, from him to Constantine;<br/>
The anarch chiefs, whose force and murderous snares<br/>
</p>
<p>
Had founded many a sceptre-bearing line,<br/>
And spread the plague of gold and blood abroad:<br/>
And Gregory and John, and men divine,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Who rose like shadows between man and God;<br/>
Till that eclipse, still hanging over heaven,<br/>
Was worshipped by the world o'er which they strode,<br/>
</p>
<p>
For the true sun it quenched&mdash;'Their power was given<br/>
But to destroy,' replied the leader:&mdash;'I<br/>
Am one of those who have created, even<br/>
</p>
<p>
'If it be but a world of agony.'&mdash;<br/>
'Whence camest thou? and whither goest thou?<br/>
How did thy course begin?' I said, 'and why?<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Mine eyes are sick of this perpetual flow<br/>
Of people, and my heart sick of one sad thought&mdash;<br/>
Speak!'&mdash;'Whence I am, I partly seem to know,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And how and by what paths I have been brought<br/>
To this dread pass, methinks even thou mayst guess;&mdash;<br/>
Why this should be, my mind can compass not;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Whither the conqueror hurries me, still less;&mdash;<br/>
But follow thou, and from spectator turn<br/>
Actor or victim in this wretchedness,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And what thou wouldst be taught I then may learn<br/>
From thee. Now listen:&mdash;In the April prime,<br/>
When all the forest-tips began to burn<br/>
</p>
<p>
'With kindling green, touched by the azure clime<br/>
Of the young season, I was laid asleep<br/>
Under a mountain, which from unknown time<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Had yawned into a cavern, high and deep;<br/>
And from it came a gentle rivulet,<br/>
Whose water, like clear air, in its calm sweep<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Bent the soft grass, and kept for ever wet<br/>
The stems of the sweet flowers, and filled the grove<br/>
With sounds, which whoso hears must needs forget<br/>
</p>
<p>
'All pleasure and all pain, all hate and love,<br/>
Which they had known before that hour of rest;<br/>
A sleeping mother then would dream not of<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Her only child who died upon the breast<br/>
At eventide&mdash;a king would mourn no more<br/>
The crown of which his brows were dispossessed<br/>
</p>
<p>
'When the sun lingered o'er his ocean floor<br/>
To gild his rival's new prosperity.<br/>
'Thou wouldst forget thus vainly to deplore<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Ills, which if ills can find no cure from thee,<br/>
The thought of which no other sleep will quell,<br/>
Nor other music blot from memory,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'So sweet and deep is the oblivious spell;<br/>
And whether life had been before that sleep<br/>
The Heaven which I imagine, or a Hell<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Like this harsh world in which I woke to weep,<br/>
I know not. I arose, and for a space<br/>
The scene of woods and waters seemed to keep,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Though it was now broad day, a gentle trace<br/>
Of light diviner than the common sun<br/>
Sheds on the common earth, and all the place<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Was filled with magic sounds woven into one<br/>
Oblivious melody, confusing sense<br/>
Amid the gliding waves and shadows dun;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And, as I looked, the bright omnipresence<br/>
Of morning through the orient cavern flowed,<br/>
And the sun's image radiantly intense<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Burned on the waters of the well that glowed<br/>
Like gold, and threaded all the forest's maze<br/>
With winding paths of emerald fire; there stood<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Amid the sun, as he amid the blaze<br/>
Of his own glory, on the vibrating<br/>
Floor of the fountain, paved with flashing rays,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'A Shape all light, which with one hand did fling<br/>
Dew on the earth, as if she were the dawn,<br/>
And the invisible rain did ever sing<br/>
</p>
<p>
'A silver music on the mossy lawn;<br/>
And still before me on the dusky grass,<br/>
Iris her many-coloured scarf had drawn:<br/>
</p>
<p>
'In her right hand she bore a crystal glass,<br/>
Mantling with bright Nepenthe; the fierce splendour<br/>
Fell from her as she moved under the mass<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Of the deep cavern, and with palms so tender,<br/>
Their tread broke not the mirror of its billow,<br/>
Glided along the river, and did bend her<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Head under the dark boughs, till like a willow<br/>
Her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream<br/>
That whispered with delight to be its pillow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'As one enamoured is upborne in dream<br/>
O'er lily-paven lakes, mid silver mist<br/>
To wondrous music, so this shape might seem<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Partly to tread the waves with feet which kissed<br/>
The dancing foam; partly to glide along<br/>
The air which roughened the moist amethyst,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Or the faint morning beams that fell among<br/>
The trees, or the soft shadows of the trees;<br/>
And her feet, ever to the ceaseless song<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Of leaves, and winds, and waves, and birds, and bees,<br/>
And falling drops, moved in a measure new<br/>
Yet sweet, as on the summer evening breeze,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Up from the lake a shape of golden dew<br/>
Between two rocks, athwart the rising moon,<br/>
Dances i' the wind, where never eagle flew;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And still her feet, no less than the sweet tune<br/>
To which they moved, seemed as they moved to blot<br/>
The thoughts of him who gazed on them; and soon<br/>
</p>
<p>
'All that was, seemed as if it had been not;<br/>
And all the gazer's mind was strewn beneath<br/>
Her feet like embers; and she, thought by thought,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Trampled its sparks into the dust of death<br/>
As day upon the threshold of the east<br/>
Treads out the lamps of night, until the breath<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Of darkness re-illumine even the least<br/>
Of heaven's living eyes&mdash;like day she came,<br/>
Making the night a dream; and ere she ceased<br/>
</p>
<p>
'To move, as one between desire and shame<br/>
Suspended, I said&mdash;If, as it doth seem,<br/>
Thou comest from the realm without a name<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Into this valley of perpetual dream,<br/>
Show whence I came, and where I am, and why&mdash;<br/>
Pass not away upon the passing stream.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Arise and quench thy thirst, was her reply.<br/>
And as a shut lily stricken by the wand<br/>
Of dewy morning's vital alchemy,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'I rose; and, bending at her sweet command,<br/>
Touched with faint lips the cup she raised,<br/>
And suddenly my brain became as sand<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Where the first wave had more than half erased<br/>
The track of deer on desert Labrador;<br/>
Whilst the wolf, from which they fled amazed,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Leaves his stamp visibly upon the shore,<br/>
Until the second bursts;&mdash;so on my sight<br/>
Burst a new vision, never seen before,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And the fair shape waned in the coming light,<br/>
As veil by veil the silent splendour drops<br/>
From Lucifer, amid the chrysolite<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Of sunrise, ere it tinge the mountain-tops;<br/>
And as the presence of that fairest planet,<br/>
Although unseen, is felt by one who hopes<br/>
</p>
<p>
'That his day's path may end as he began it,<br/>
In that star's smile, whose light is like the scent<br/>
Of a jonquil when evening breezes fan it,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Or the soft note in which his dear lament<br/>
The Brescian shepherd breathes, or the caress<br/>
That turned his weary slumber to content;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'So knew I in that light's severe excess<br/>
The presence of that Shape which on the stream<br/>
Moved, as I moved along the wilderness,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'More dimly than a day-appearing dream,<br/>
The host of a forgotten form of sleep;<br/>
A light of heaven, whose half-extinguished beam<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Through the sick day in which we wake to weep<br/>
Glimmers, for ever sought, for ever lost;<br/>
So did that shape its obscure tenour keep<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Beside my path, as silent as a ghost;<br/>
But the new Vision, and the cold bright car,<br/>
With solemn speed and stunning music, crossed<br/>
</p>
<p>
'The forest, and as if from some dread war<br/>
Triumphantly returning, the loud million<br/>
Fiercely extolled the fortune of her star.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'A moving arch of victory, the vermilion<br/>
And green and azure plumes of Iris had<br/>
Built high over her wind-winged pavilion,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And underneath aethereal glory clad<br/>
The wilderness, and far before her flew<br/>
The tempest of the splendour, which forbade<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Shadow to fall from leaf and stone; the crew<br/>
Seemed in that light, like atomies to dance<br/>
Within a sunbeam;&mdash;some upon the new<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Embroidery of flowers, that did enhance<br/>
The grassy vesture of the desert, played,<br/>
Forgetful of the chariot's swift advance;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Others stood gazing, till within the shade<br/>
Of the great mountain its light left them dim;<br/>
Others outspeeded it; and others made<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Circles around it, like the clouds that swim<br/>
Round the high moon in a bright sea of air;<br/>
And more did follow, with exulting hymn,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'The chariot and the captives fettered there:&mdash;<br/>
But all like bubbles on an eddying flood<br/>
Fell into the same track at last, and were<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Borne onward.&mdash;I among the multitude<br/>
Was swept&mdash;me, sweetest flowers delayed not long;<br/>
Me, not the shadow nor the solitude;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Me, not that falling stream's Lethean song;<br/>
Me, not the phantom of that early Form<br/>
Which moved upon its motion&mdash;but among<br/>
</p>
<p>
'The thickest billows of that living storm<br/>
I plunged, and bared my bosom to the clime<br/>
Of that cold light, whose airs too soon deform.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Before the chariot had begun to climb<br/>
The opposing steep of that mysterious dell,<br/>
Behold a wonder worthy of the rhyme<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Of him who from the lowest depths of hell,<br/>
Through every paradise and through all glory,<br/>
Love led serene, and who returned to tell<br/>
</p>
<p>
'The words of hate and awe; the wondrous story<br/>
How all things are transfigured except Love;<br/>
For deaf as is a sea, which wrath makes hoary,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'The world can hear not the sweet notes that move<br/>
The sphere whose light is melody to lovers&mdash;<br/>
A wonder worthy of his rhyme.&mdash;The grove<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Grew dense with shadows to its inmost covers,<br/>
The earth was gray with phantoms, and the air<br/>
Was peopled with dim forms, as when there hovers<br/>
</p>
<p>
'A flock of vampire-bats before the glare<br/>
Of the tropic sun, bringing, ere evening,<br/>
Strange night upon some Indian isle;&mdash;thus were<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Phantoms diffused around; and some did fling<br/>
Shadows of shadows, yet unlike themselves,<br/>
Behind them; some like eaglets on the wing<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Were lost in the white day; others like elves<br/>
Danced in a thousand unimagined shapes<br/>
Upon the sunny streams and grassy shelves;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And others sate chattering like restless apes<br/>
On vulgar hands,...<br/>
Some made a cradle of the ermined capes<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Of kingly mantles; some across the tiar<br/>
Of pontiffs sate like vultures; others played<br/>
Under the crown which girt with empire<br/>
</p>
<p>
'A baby's or an idiot's brow, and made<br/>
Their nests in it. The old anatomies<br/>
Sate hatching their bare broods under the shade<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Of daemon wings, and laughed from their dead eyes<br/>
To reassume the delegated power,<br/>
Arrayed in which those worms did monarchize,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Who made this earth their charnel. Others more<br/>
Humble, like falcons, sate upon the fist<br/>
Of common men, and round their heads did soar;<br/>
</p>
<p>
Or like small gnats and flies, as thick as mist<br/>
On evening marshes, thronged about the brow<br/>
Of lawyers, statesmen, priest and theorist;&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And others, like discoloured flakes of snow<br/>
On fairest bosoms and the sunniest hair,<br/>
Fell, and were melted by the youthful glow<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Which they extinguished; and, like tears, they were<br/>
A veil to those from whose faint lids they rained<br/>
In drops of sorrow. I became aware<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Of whence those forms proceeded which thus stained<br/>
The track in which we moved. After brief space,<br/>
From every form the beauty slowly waned;<br/>
</p>
<p>
'From every firmest limb and fairest face<br/>
The strength and freshness fell like dust, and left<br/>
The action and the shape without the grace<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Of life. The marble brow of youth was cleft<br/>
With care; and in those eyes where once hope shone,<br/>
Desire, like a lioness bereft<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Of her last cub, glared ere it died; each one<br/>
Of that great crowd sent forth incessantly<br/>
These shadows, numerous as the dead leaves blown<br/>
</p>
<p>
'In autumn evening from a poplar tree.<br/>
Each like himself and like each other were<br/>
At first; but some distorted seemed to be<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Obscure clouds, moulded by the casual air;<br/>
And of this stuff the car's creative ray<br/>
Wrought all the busy phantoms that were there,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'As the sun shapes the clouds; thus on the way<br/>
Mask after mask fell from the countenance<br/>
And form of all; and long before the day<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Was old, the joy which waked like heaven's glance<br/>
The sleepers in the oblivious valley, died;<br/>
And some grew weary of the ghastly dance,<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And fell, as I have fallen, by the wayside;&mdash;<br/>
Those soonest from whose forms most shadows passed,<br/>
And least of strength and beauty did abide.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Then, what is life? I cried.'&mdash;

<h1>The Recollection</h1>
<h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
Now the last day of many days,<br/>
All beautiful and bright as thou,<br/>
The loveliest and the last, is dead,<br/>
Rise, Memory, and write its praise!<br/>
Up,&mdash;to thy wonted work! come, trace<br/>
The epitaph of glory fled,&mdash;<br/>
For now the Earth has changed its face,<br/>
A frown is on the Heaven's brow.<br/>
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
We wandered to the Pine Forest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That skirts the Ocean's foam,<br/>
The lightest wind was in its nest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tempest in its home.<br/>
The whispering waves were half asleep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds were gone to play,<br/>
And on the bosom of the deep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of Heaven lay;<br/>
It seemed as if the hour were one<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent from beyond the skies,<br/>
Which scattered from above the sun<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light of Paradise.<br/>
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
We paused amid the pines that stood<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giants of the waste,<br/>
Tortured by storms to shapes as rude<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As serpents interlaced;<br/>
And, soothed by every azure breath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That under Heaven is blown,<br/>
To harmonies and hues beneath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As tender as its own,<br/>
Now all the tree-tops lay asleep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like green waves on the sea,<br/>
As still as in the silent deep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ocean woods may be.<br/>
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
How calm it was!&mdash;the silence there<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By such a chain was bound<br/>
That even the busy woodpecker<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made stiller by her sound<br/>
The inviolable quietness;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath of peace we drew<br/>
With its soft motion made not less<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm that round us grew.<br/>
There seemed from the remotest seat<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the white mountain waste,<br/>
To the soft flower beneath our feet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magic circle traced,&mdash;<br/>
A spirit interfused around<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thrilling, silent life,&mdash;<br/>
To momentary peace it bound<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mortal nature's strife;<br/>
And still I felt the centre of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic circle there<br/>
Was one fair form that filled with love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lifeless atmosphere.<br/>
</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>
We paused beside the pools that lie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the forest bough,&mdash;<br/>
Each seemed as 'twere a little sky<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulfed in a world below;<br/>
A firmament of purple light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which in the dark earth lay,<br/>
More boundless than the depth of night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And purer than the day&mdash;<br/>
In which the lovely forests grew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the upper air,<br/>
More perfect both in shape and hue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any spreading there.<br/>
There lay the glade and neighbouring lawn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the dark green wood<br/>
The white sun twinkling like the dawn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of a speckled cloud.<br/>
Sweet views which in our world above<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can never well be seen,<br/>
Were imaged by the water's love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that fair forest green.<br/>
And all was interfused beneath<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an Elysian glow,<br/>
An atmosphere without a breath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A softer day below.<br/>
Like one beloved the scene had lent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the dark water's breast,<br/>
Its every leaf and lineament<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than truth expressed;<br/>
Until an envious wind crept by,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an unwelcome thought,<br/>
Which from the mind's too faithful eye<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blots one dear image out.<br/>
Though thou art ever fair and kind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forests ever green,<br/>
Less oft is peace in Shelley's mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than calm in waters, seen.<br/>

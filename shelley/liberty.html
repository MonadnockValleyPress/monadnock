<h1>Ode to Liberty</h1>
<h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
<p>
Yet, Freedom, yet, thy banner, torn but flying,<br/>
Streams like a thunder-storm against the wind.<br/>
&mdash;Byron
</p>
<p>
1.<br/>
A glorious people vibrated again<br/>
The lightning of the nations: Liberty<br/>
From heart to heart, from tower to tower, o'er Spain,<br/>
Scattering contagious fire into the sky,<br/>
Gleamed. My soul spurned the chains of its dismay, <br/>
And in the rapid plumes of song<br/>
Clothed itself, sublime and strong;<br/>
As a young eagle soars the morning clouds among,<br/>
Hovering inverse o'er its accustomed prey;<br/>
Till from its station in the Heaven of fame <br/>
The Spirit's whirlwind rapped it, and the ray<br/>
Of the remotest sphere of living flame<br/>
Which paves the void was from behind it flung,<br/>
As foam from a ship's swiftness, when there came<br/>
A voice out of the deep: I will record the same. 
</p>
<p>
2.<br/>
The Sun and the serenest Moon sprang forth:<br/>
The burning stars of the abyss were hurled<br/>
Into the depths of Heaven. The daedal earth,<br/>
That island in the ocean of the world,<br/>
Hung in its cloud of all-sustaining air: <br/>
But this divinest universe<br/>
Was yet a chaos and a curse,<br/>
For thou wert not: but, power from worst producing worse,<br/>
The spirit of the beasts was kindled there,<br/>
And of the birds, and of the watery forms, <br/>
And there was war among them, and despair<br/>
Within them, raging without truce or terms:<br/>
The bosom of their violated nurse<br/>
Groaned, for beasts warred on beasts, and worms on worms,<br/>
And men on men; each heart was as a hell of storms. 
</p>
<p>
3.<br/>
Man, the imperial shape, then multiplied<br/>
His generations under the pavilion<br/>
Of the Sun's throne: palace and pyramid,<br/>
Temple and prison, to many a swarming million<br/>
Were, as to mountain-wolves their ragged caves. <br/>
This human living multitude<br/>
Was savage, cunning, blind, and rude,<br/>
For thou wert not; but o'er the populous solitude,<br/>
Like one fierce cloud over a waste of waves,<br/>
Hung Tyranny; beneath, sate deified <br/>
The sister-pest, congregator of slaves;<br/>
Into the shadow of her pinions wide<br/>
Anarchs and priests, who feed on gold and blood<br/>
Till with the stain their inmost souls are dyed,<br/>
Drove the astonished herds of men from every side. 
</p>
<p>
4.<br/>
The nodding promontories, and blue isles,<br/>
And cloud-like mountains, and dividuous waves<br/>
Of Greece, basked glorious in the open smiles<br/>
Of favouring Heaven: from their enchanted caves<br/>
Prophetic echoes flung dim melody. <br/>
On the unapprehensive wild<br/>
The vine, the corn, the olive mild,<br/>
Grew savage yet, to human use unreconciled;<br/>
And, like unfolded flowers beneath the sea,<br/>
Like the man's thought dark in the infant's brain, <br/>
Like aught that is which wraps what is to be,<br/>
Art's deathless dreams lay veiled by many a vein<br/>
Of Parian stone; and, yet a speechless child,<br/>
Verse murmured, and Philosophy did strain<br/>
Her lidless eyes for thee; when o'er the Aegean main <br/>
</p>
<p>
5.<br/>
Athens arose: a city such as vision<br/>
Builds from the purple crags and silver towers<br/>
Of battlemented cloud, as in derision<br/>
Of kingliest masonry: the ocean-floors<br/>
Pave it; the evening sky pavilions it; <br/>
Its portals are inhabited<br/>
By thunder-zoned winds, each head<br/>
Within its cloudy wings with sun-fire garlanded,—<br/>
A divine work! Athens, diviner yet,<br/>
Gleamed with its crest of columns, on the will <br/>
Of man, as on a mount of diamond, set;<br/>
For thou wert, and thine all-creative skill<br/>
Peopled, with forms that mock the eternal dead<br/>
In marble immortality, that hill<br/>
Which was thine earliest throne and latest oracle. 
</p>
<p>
6.<br/>
Within the surface of Time's fleeting river<br/>
Its wrinkled image lies, as then it lay<br/>
Immovably unquiet, and for ever<br/>
It trembles, but it cannot pass away!<br/>
The voices of thy bards and sages thunder <br/>
With an earth-awakening blast<br/>
Through the caverns of the past:<br/>
(Religion veils her eyes; Oppression shrinks aghast:)<br/>
A winged sound of joy, and love, and wonder,<br/>
Which soars where Expectation never flew, <br/>
Rending the veil of space and time asunder!<br/>
One ocean feeds the clouds, and streams, and dew;<br/>
One Sun illumines Heaven; one Spirit vast<br/>
With life and love makes chaos ever new,<br/>
As Athens doth the world with thy delight renew. 
</p>
<p>
7.<br/>
Then Rome was, and from thy deep bosom fairest,<br/>
Like a wolf-cub from a Cadmaean Maenad,<br/>
She drew the milk of greatness, though thy dearest<br/>
From that Elysian food was yet unweaned;<br/>
And many a deed of terrible uprightness <br/>
By thy sweet love was sanctified;<br/>
And in thy smile, and by thy side,<br/>
Saintly Camillus lived, and firm Atilius died.<br/>
But when tears stained thy robe of vestal-whiteness,<br/>
And gold profaned thy Capitolian throne, <br/>
Thou didst desert, with spirit-winged lightness,
The senate of the tyrants: they sunk prone<br/>
Slaves of one tyrant: Palatinus sighed<br/>
Faint echoes of Ionian song; that tone<br/>
Thou didst delay to hear, lamenting to disown 
</p>
<p>
8.<br/>
From what Hyrcanian glen or frozen hill,<br/>
Or piny promontory of the Arctic main,<br/>
Or utmost islet inaccessible,<br/>
Didst thou lament the ruin of thy reign,<br/>
Teaching the woods and waves, and desert rocks, <br/>
And every Naiad's ice-cold urn,<br/>
To talk in echoes sad and stern<br/>
Of that sublimest lore which man had dared unlearn?<br/>
For neither didst thou watch the wizard flocks<br/>
Of the Scald's dreams, nor haunt the Druid's sleep. <br/>
What if the tears rained through thy shattered locks<br/>
Were quickly dried? for thou didst groan, not weep,<br/>
When from its sea of death, to kill and burn,<br/>
The Galilean serpent forth did creep,<br/>
And made thy world an undistinguishable heap. 
</p>
<p>
9.<br/>
A thousand years the Earth cried, 'Where art thou?'<br/>
And then the shadow of thy coming fell<br/>
On Saxon Alfred's olive-cinctured brow:<br/>
And many a warrior-peopled citadel.<br/>
Like rocks which fire lifts out of the flat deep, <br/>
Arose in sacred Italy,<br/>
Frowning o'er the tempestuous sea<br/>
Of kings, and priests, and slaves, in tower-crowned majesty;<br/>
That multitudinous anarchy did sweep<br/>
And burst around their walls, like idle foam, <br/>
Whilst from the human spirit's deepest deep<br/>
Strange melody with love and awe struck dumb<br/>
Dissonant arms; and Art, which cannot die,<br/>
With divine wand traced on our earthly home<br/>
Fit imagery to pave Heaven's everlasting dome. 
</p>
<p>
10.<br/>
Thou huntress swifter than the Moon! thou terror<br/>
Of the world's wolves! thou bearer of the quiver,<br/>
Whose sunlike shafts pierce tempest-winged Error,<br/>
As light may pierce the clouds when they dissever<br/>
In the calm regions of the orient day! <br/>
Luther caught thy wakening glance;<br/>
Like lightning, from his leaden lance<br/>
Reflected, it dissolved the visions of the trance<br/>
In which, as in a tomb, the nations lay;<br/>
And England's prophets hailed thee as their queen, <br/>
In songs whose music cannot pass away,<br/>
Though it must flow forever: not unseen<br/>
Before the spirit-sighted countenance<br/>
Of Milton didst thou pass, from the sad scene<br/>
Beyond whose night he saw, with a dejected mien. <br/>
</p>
<p>
11.<br/>
The eager hours and unreluctant years<br/>
As on a dawn-illumined mountain stood.<br/>
Trampling to silence their loud hopes and fears,<br/>
Darkening each other with their multitude,<br/>
And cried aloud, 'Liberty!' Indignation <br/>
Answered Pity from her cave;<br/>
Death grew pale within the grave,<br/>
And Desolation howled to the destroyer, Save!<br/>
When like Heaven's Sun girt by the exhalation<br/>
Of its own glorious light, thou didst arise. <br/>
Chasing thy foes from nation unto nation<br/>
Like shadows: as if day had cloven the skies<br/>
At dreaming midnight o'er the western wave,<br/>
Men started, staggering with a glad surprise,<br/>
Under the lightnings of thine unfamiliar eyes. 
</p>
<p>
12.<br/>
Thou Heaven of earth! what spells could pall thee then<br/>
In ominous eclipse? a thousand years<br/>
Bred from the slime of deep Oppression's den.<br/>
Dyed all thy liquid light with blood and tears.<br/>
Till thy sweet stars could weep the stain away; <br/>
How like Bacchanals of blood<br/>
Round France, the ghastly vintage, stood<br/>
Destruction's sceptred slaves, and Folly's mitred brood!<br/>
When one, like them, but mightier far than they,<br/>
The Anarch of thine own bewildered powers, <br/>
Rose: armies mingled in obscure array,<br/>
Like clouds with clouds, darkening the sacred bowers<br/>
Of serene Heaven. He, by the past pursued,<br/>
Rests with those dead, but unforgotten hours,<br/>
Whose ghosts scare victor kings in their ancestral towers. 
</p>
<p>
13.<br/>
England yet sleeps: was she not called of old?<br/>
Spain calls her now, as with its thrilling thunder<br/>
Vesuvius wakens Aetna, and the cold<br/>
Snow-crags by its reply are cloven in sunder:<br/>
O'er the lit waves every Aeolian isle <br/>
From Pithecusa to Pelorus<br/>
Howls, and leaps, and glares in chorus:<br/>
They cry, 'Be dim; ye lamps of Heaven suspended o'er us!'<br/>
Her chains are threads of gold, she need but smile<br/>
And they dissolve; but Spain's were links of steel, <br/>
Till bit to dust by virtue's keenest file.<br/>
Twins of a single destiny! appeal<br/>
To the eternal years enthroned before us<br/>
In the dim West; impress us from a seal,<br/>
All ye have thought and done! Time cannot dare conceal. 
</p>
<p>
14.<br/>
Tomb of Arminius! render up thy dead<br/>
Till, like a standard from a watch-tower's staff,<br/>
His soul may stream over the tyrant's head;<br/>
Thy victory shall be his epitaph,<br/>
Wild Bacchanal of truth's mysterious wine, <br/>
King-deluded Germany,<br/>
His dead spirit lives in thee.<br/>
Why do we fear or hope? thou art already free!<br/>
And thou, lost Paradise of this divine<br/>
And glorious world! thou flowery wilderness! <br/>
Thou island of eternity! thou shrine<br/>
Where Desolation, clothed with loveliness,<br/>
Worships the thing thou wert! O Italy,<br/>
Gather thy blood into thy heart; repress<br/>
The beasts who make their dens thy sacred palaces. 
</p>
<p>
15.<br/>
Oh, that the free would stamp the impious name<br/>
Of KING into the dust! or write it there,<br/>
So that this blot upon the page of fame<br/>
Were as a serpent's path, which the light air<br/>
Erases, and the flat sands close behind! <br/>
Ye the oracle have heard:<br/>
Lift the victory-flashing sword.<br/>
And cut the snaky knots of this foul gordian word,<br/>
Which, weak itself as stubble, yet can bind<br/>
Into a mass, irrefragably firm, <br/>
The axes and the rods which awe mankind;<br/>
The sound has poison in it, 'tis the sperm<br/>
Of what makes life foul, cankerous, and abhorred;<br/>
Disdain not thou, at thine appointed term,<br/>
To set thine armed heel on this reluctant worm. 
</p>
<p>
16.<br/>
Oh, that the wise from their bright minds would kindle<br/>
Such lamps within the dome of this dim world,<br/>
That the pale name of PRIEST might shrink and dwindle<br/>
Into the hell from which it first was hurled,<br/>
A scoff of impious pride from fiends impure; <br/>
Till human thoughts might kneel alone,<br/>
Each before the judgement-throne<br/>
Of its own aweless soul, or of the Power unknown!<br/>
Oh, that the words which make the thoughts obscure<br/>
From which they spring, as clouds of glimmering dew <br/>
From a white lake blot Heaven's blue portraiture,<br/>
Were stripped of their thin masks and various hue<br/>
And frowns and smiles and splendours not their own,<br/>
Till in the nakedness of false and true<br/>
They stand before their Lord, each to receive its due! 
</p>
<p>
17.<br/>
He who taught man to vanquish whatsoever<br/>
Can be between the cradle and the grave<br/>
Crowned him the King of Life. Oh, vain endeavour!<br/>
If on his own high will, a willing slave,<br/>
He has enthroned the oppression and the oppressor <br/>
What if earth can clothe and feed<br/>
Amplest millions at their need,<br/>
And power in thought be as the tree within the seed?<br/>
Or what if Art, an ardent intercessor,<br/>
Driving on fiery wings to Nature's throne, <br/>
Checks the great mother stooping to caress her,<br/>
And cries: 'Give me, thy child, dominion<br/>
Over all height and depth'? if Life can breed<br/>
New wants, and wealth from those who toil and groan,<br/>
Rend of thy gifts and hers a thousandfold for one! 
</p>
<p>
18.<br/>
Come thou, but lead out of the inmost cave<br/>
Of man's deep spirit, as the morning-star<br/>
Beckons the Sun from the Eoan wave,<br/>
Wisdom. I hear the pennons of her car<br/>
Self-moving, like cloud charioted by flame; <br/>
Comes she not, and come ye not,<br/>
Rulers of eternal thought,<br/>
To judge, with solemn truth, life's ill-apportioned lot?<br/>
Blind Love, and equal Justice, and the Fame<br/>
Of what has been, the Hope of what will be? <br/>
O Liberty! if such could be thy name<br/>
Wert thou disjoined from these, or they from thee:<br/>
If thine or theirs were treasures to be bought<br/>
By blood or tears, have not the wise and free<br/>
Wept tears, and blood like tears?—The solemn harmony 
</p>
<p>
19.<br/>
Paused, and the Spirit of that mighty singing<br/>
To its abyss was suddenly withdrawn;<br/>
Then, as a wild swan, when sublimely winging<br/>
Its path athwart the thunder-smoke of dawn,<br/>
Sinks headlong through the aereal golden light <br/>
On the heavy-sounding plain,<br/>
When the bolt has pierced its brain;<br/>
As summer clouds dissolve, unburthened of their rain;<br/>
As a far taper fades with fading night,<br/>
As a brief insect dies with dying day,— <br/>
My song, its pinions disarrayed of might,<br/>
Drooped; o'er it closed the echoes far away<br/>
Of the great voice which did its flight sustain,<br/>
As waves which lately paved his watery way<br/>
Hiss round a drowner's head in their tempestuous play.

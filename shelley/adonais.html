<h1>Adonais</h1>
<h2>An Elegy on the Death of John Keats</h2>
<h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p>
I weep for Adonais&mdash;he is dead!<br/>
O, weep for Adonais! though our tears<br/>
Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head!<br/>
And thou, sad Hour, selected from all years<br/>
To mourn our loss, rouse thy obscure compeers,<br/>
And teach them thine own sorrow, say: "With me<br/>
Died Adonais; till the Future dares<br/>
Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be<br/>
An echo and a light unto eternity!"<br/>
</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p>
Where wert thou, mighty Mother, when he lay,<br/>
When thy Son lay, pierced by the shaft which flies<br/>
In darkness? where was lorn Urania<br/>
When Adonais died? With veiled eyes,<br/>
'Mid listening Echoes, in her Paradise<br/>
She sate, while one, with soft enamoured breath,<br/>
Rekindled all the fading melodies,<br/>
With which, like flowers that mock the corse beneath,<br/>
He had adorned and hid the coming bulk of Death.<br/>
</p>
<h3>3.</h3>
<p>
Oh, weep for Adonais&mdash;he is dead!<br/>
Wake, melancholy Mother, wake and weep!<br/>
Yet wherefore? Quench within their burning bed<br/>
Thy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart keep<br/>
Like his, a mute and uncomplaining sleep;<br/>
For he is gone, where all things wise and fair<br/>
Descend;&mdash;oh, dream not that the amorous Deep<br/>
Will yet restore him to the vital air;<br/>
Death feeds on his mute voice, and laughs at our despair.<br/>
</p>
<h3>4.</h3>
<p>
Most musical of mourners, weep again!<br/>
Lament anew, Urania!&mdash;He died,<br/>
Who was the Sire of an immortal strain,<br/>
Blind, old and lonely, when his country's pride,<br/>
The priest, the slave, and the liberticide,<br/>
Trampled and mocked with many a loathed rite<br/>
Of lust and blood; he went, unterrified,<br/>
Into the gulf of death; but his clear Sprite<br/>
Yet reigns o'er earth; the third among the sons of light.<br/>
</p>
<h3>5.</h3>
<p>
Most musical of mourners, weep anew!<br/>
Not all to that bright station dared to climb;<br/>
And happier they their happiness who knew,<br/>
Whose tapers yet burn through that night of time<br/>
In which suns perished; others more sublime,<br/>
Struck by the envious wrath of man or god,<br/>
Have sunk, extinct in their refulgent prime;<br/>
And some yet live, treading the thorny road,<br/>
Which leads, through toil and hate, to Fame's serene abode.<br/>
</p>
<h3>6.</h3>
<p>
But now, thy youngest, dearest one, has perished&mdash;<br/>
The nursling of thy widowhood, who grew,<br/>
Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished,<br/>
And fed with true-love tears, instead of dew;<br/>
Most musical of mourners, weep anew!<br/>
Thy extreme hope, the loveliest and the last,<br/>
The bloom, whose petals nipped before they blew<br/>
Died on the promise of the fruit, is waste;<br/>
The broken lily lies&mdash;the storm is overpast.<br/>
</p>
<h3>7.</h3>
<p>
To that high Capital, where kingly Death<br/>
Keeps his pale court in beauty and decay,<br/>
He came; and bought, with price of purest breath,<br/>
A grave among the eternal.&mdash;Come away!<br/>
Haste, while the vault of blue Italian day<br/>
Is yet his fitting charnel-roof! while still<br/>
He lies, as if in dewy sleep he lay;<br/>
Awake him not! surely he takes his fill<br/>
Of deep and liquid rest, forgetful of all ill.<br/>
</p>
<h3>8.</h3>
<p>
He will awake no more, oh, never more!&mdash;<br/>
Within the twilight chamber spreads apace<br/>
The shadow of white Death, and at the door<br/>
Invisible Corruption waits to trace<br/>
His extreme way to her dim dwelling-place;<br/>
The eternal Hunger sits, but pity and awe<br/>
Soothe her pale rage, nor dares she to deface<br/>
So fair a prey, till darkness and the law<br/>
Of change, shall o'er his sleep the mortal curtain draw.<br/>
</p>
<h3>9.</h3>
<p>
Oh, weep for Adonais!&mdash;The quick Dreams,<br/>
The passion-winged Ministers of thought,<br/>
Who were his flocks, whom near the living streams<br/>
Of his young spirit he fed, and whom he taught<br/>
The love which was its music, wander not,&mdash;<br/>
Wander no more, from kindling brain to brain,<br/>
But droop there, whence they sprung; and mourn their lot<br/>
Round the cold heart, where, after their sweet pain,<br/>
They ne'er will gather strength, or find a home again.<br/>
</p>
<h3>10.</h3>
<p>
And one with trembling hands clasps his cold head,<br/>
And fans him with her moonlight wings, and cries;<br/>
'Our love, our hope, our sorrow, is not dead;<br/>
See, on the silken fringe of his faint eyes,<br/>
Like dew upon a sleeping flower, there lies<br/>
A tear some Dream has loosened from his brain.'<br/>
Lost Angel of a ruined Paradise!<br/>
She knew not 'twas her own; as with no stain<br/>
She faded, like a cloud which had outwept its rain.<br/>
</p>
<h3>11.</h3>
<p>
One from a lucid urn of starry dew<br/>
Washed his light limbs as if embalming them;<br/>
Another clipped her profuse locks, and threw<br/>
The wreath upon him, like an anadem,<br/>
Which frozen tears instead of pearls begem;<br/>
Another in her wilful grief would break<br/>
Her bow and winged reeds, as if to stem<br/>
A greater loss with one which was more weak;<br/>
And dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek.<br/>
</p>
<h3>12.</h3>
<p>
Another Splendour on his mouth alit,<br/>
That mouth, whence it was wont to draw the breath<br/>
Which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit,<br/>
And pass into the panting heart beneath<br/>
With lightning and with music: the damp death<br/>
Quenched its caress upon his icy lips;<br/>
And, as a dying meteor stains a wreath<br/>
Of moonlight vapour, which the cold night clips,<br/>
It flushed through his pale limbs, and passed to its eclipse.<br/>
</p>
<h3>13.</h3>
<p>
And others came ... Desires and Adorations,<br/>
Winged Persuasions and veiled Destinies,<br/>
Splendours, and Glooms, and glimmering Incarnations<br/>
Of hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies;<br/>
And Sorrow, with her family of Sighs,<br/>
And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleam<br/>
Of her own dying smile instead of eyes,<br/>
Came in slow pomp;&mdash;the moving pomp might seem<br/>
Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream.<br/>
</p>
<h3>14.</h3>
<p>
All he had loved, and moulded into thought,<br/>
From shape, and hue, and odour, and sweet sound,<br/>
Lamented Adonais. Morning sought<br/>
Her eastern watch-tower, and her hair unbound,<br/>
Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground,<br/>
Dimmed the aereal eyes that kindle day;<br/>
Afar the melancholy thunder moaned,<br/>
Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber lay,<br/>
And the wild Winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay.<br/>
</p>
<h3>15.</h3>
<p>
Lost Echo sits amid the voiceless mountains,<br/>
And feeds her grief with his remembered lay,<br/>
And will no more reply to winds or fountains,<br/>
Or amorous birds perched on the young green spray,<br/>
Or herdsman's horn, or bell at closing day;<br/>
Since she can mimic not his lips, more dear<br/>
Than those for whose disdain she pined away<br/>
Into a shadow of all sounds:&mdash;a drear<br/>
Murmur, between their songs, is all the woodmen hear.<br/>
</p>
<h3>16.</h3>
<p>
Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw down<br/>
Her kindling buds, as if she Autumn were,<br/>
Or they dead leaves; since her delight is flown,<br/>
For whom should she have waked the sullen year?<br/>
To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so dear<br/>
Nor to himself Narcissus, as to both<br/>
Thou, Adonais: wan they stand and sere<br/>
Amid the faint companions of their youth,<br/>
With dew all turned to tears; odour, to sighing ruth.<br/>
</p>
<h3>17.</h3>
<p>
Thy spirit's sister, the lorn nightingale<br/>
Mourns not her mate with such melodious pain;<br/>
Not so the eagle, who like thee could scale<br/>
Heaven, and could nourish in the sun's domain<br/>
Her mighty youth with morning, doth complain,<br/>
Soaring and screaming round her empty nest,<br/>
As Albion wails for thee: the curse of Cain<br/>
Light on his head who pierced thy innocent breast,<br/>
And scared the angel soul that was its earthly guest!<br/>
</p>
<h3>18.</h3>
<p>
Ah, woe is me! Winter is come and gone,<br/>
But grief returns with the revolving year;<br/>
The airs and streams renew their joyous tone;<br/>
The ants, the bees, the swallows reappear;<br/>
Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Seasons' bier;<br/>
The amorous birds now pair in every brake,<br/>
And build their mossy homes in field and brere;<br/>
And the green lizard, and the golden snake,<br/>
Like unimprisoned flames, out of their trance awake.<br/>
</p>
<h3>19.</h3>
<p>
Through wood and stream and field and hill and Ocean<br/>
A quickening life from the Earth's heart has burst<br/>
As it has ever done, with change and motion,<br/>
From the great morning of the world when first<br/>
God dawned on Chaos; in its stream immersed,<br/>
The lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light;<br/>
All baser things pant with life's sacred thirst;<br/>
Diffuse themselves; and spend in love's delight,<br/>
The beauty and the joy of their renewed might.<br/>
</p>
<h3>20.</h3>
<p>
The leprous corpse, touched by this spirit tender,<br/>
Exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath;<br/>
Like incarnations of the stars, when splendour<br/>
Is changed to fragrance, they illumine death<br/>
And mock the merry worm that wakes beneath;<br/>
Nought we know, dies. Shall that alone which knows<br/>
Be as a sword consumed before the sheath<br/>
By sightless lightning?&mdash;the intense atom glows<br/>
A moment, then is quenched in a most cold repose.<br/>
</p>
<h3>21.</h3>
<p>
Alas! that all we loved of him should be,<br/>
But for our grief, as if it had not been,<br/>
And grief itself be mortal! Woe is me!<br/>
Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene<br/>
The actors or spectators? Great and mean<br/>
Meet massed in death, who lends what life must borrow.<br/>
As long as skies are blue, and fields are green,<br/>
Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow,<br/>
Month follow month with woe, and year wake year to sorrow.<br/>
</p>
<h3>22.</h3>
<p>
HE will awake no more, oh, never more!<br/>
'Wake thou,' cried Misery, 'childless Mother, rise<br/>
Out of thy sleep, and slake, in thy heart's core,<br/>
A wound more fierce than his, with tears and sighs.'<br/>
And all the Dreams that watched Urania's eyes,<br/>
And all the Echoes whom their sister's song<br/>
Had held in holy silence, cried: 'Arise!'<br/>
Swift as a Thought by the snake Memory stung,<br/>
From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour sprung.<br/>
</p>
<h3>23.</h3>
<p>
She rose like an autumnal Night, that springs<br/>
Out of the East, and follows wild and drear<br/>
The golden Day, which, on eternal wings,<br/>
Even as a ghost abandoning a bier,<br/>
Had left the Earth a corpse. Sorrow and fear<br/>
So struck, so roused, so rapped Urania;<br/>
So saddened round her like an atmosphere<br/>
Of stormy mist; so swept her on her way<br/>
Even to the mournful place where Adonais lay.<br/>
</p>
<h3>24.</h3>
<p>
Out of her secret Paradise she sped,<br/>
Through camps and cities rough with stone, and steel,<br/>
And human hearts, which to her aery tread<br/>
Yielding not, wounded the invisible<br/>
Palms of her tender feet where'er they fell:<br/>
And barbed tongues, and thoughts more sharp than they,<br/>
Rent the soft Form they never could repel,<br/>
Whose sacred blood, like the young tears of May,<br/>
Paved with eternal flowers that undeserving way.<br/>
</p>
<h3>25.</h3>
<p>
In the death-chamber for a moment Death,<br/>
Shamed by the presence of that living Might,<br/>
Blushed to annihilation, and the breath<br/>
Revisited those lips, and Life's pale light<br/>
Flashed through those limbs, so late her dear delight.<br/>
'Leave me not wild and drear and comfortless,<br/>
As silent lightning leaves the starless night!<br/>
Leave me not!' cried Urania: her distress<br/>
Roused Death: Death rose and smiled, and met her vain caress.<br/>
</p>
<h3>26.</h3>
<p>
'Stay yet awhile! speak to me once again;<br/>
Kiss me, so long but as a kiss may live;<br/>
And in my heartless breast and burning brain<br/>
That word, that kiss, shall all thoughts else survive,<br/>
With food of saddest memory kept alive,<br/>
Now thou art dead, as if it were a part<br/>
Of thee, my Adonais! I would give<br/>
All that I am to be as thou now art!<br/>
But I am chained to Time, and cannot thence depart!<br/>
</p>
<h3>27.</h3>
<p>
'O gentle child, beautiful as thou wert,<br/>
Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men<br/>
Too soon, and with weak hands though mighty heart<br/>
Dare the unpastured dragon in his den?<br/>
Defenceless as thou wert, oh, where was then<br/>
Wisdom the mirrored shield, or scorn the spear?<br/>
Or hadst thou waited the full cycle, when<br/>
Thy spirit should have filled its crescent sphere,<br/>
The monsters of life's waste had fled from thee like deer.<br/>
</p>
<h3>28.</h3>
<p>
'The herded wolves, bold only to pursue;<br/>
The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the dead;<br/>
The vultures to the conqueror's banner true<br/>
Who feed where Desolation first has fed,<br/>
And whose wings rain contagion;&mdash;how they fled,<br/>
When, like Apollo, from his golden bow<br/>
The Pythian of the age one arrow sped<br/>
And smiled!&mdash;The spoilers tempt no second blow,<br/>
They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low.<br/>
</p>
<h3>29.</h3>
<p>
'The sun comes forth, and many reptiles spawn;<br/>
He sets, and each ephemeral insect then<br/>
Is gathered into death without a dawn,<br/>
And the immortal stars awake again;<br/>
So is it in the world of living men:<br/>
A godlike mind soars forth, in its delight<br/>
Making earth bare and veiling heaven, and when<br/>
It sinks, the swarms that dimmed or shared its light<br/>
Leave to its kindred lamps the spirit's awful night.'<br/>
</p>
<h3>30.</h3>
<p>
Thus ceased she: and the mountain shepherds came,<br/>
Their garlands sere, their magic mantles rent;<br/>
The Pilgrim of Eternity, whose fame<br/>
Over his living head like Heaven is bent,<br/>
An early but enduring monument,<br/>
Came, veiling all the lightnings of his song<br/>
In sorrow; from her wilds Ierne sent<br/>
The sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong,<br/>
And Love taught Grief to fall like music from his tongue.<br/>
</p>
<h3>31.</h3>
<p>
Midst others of less note, came one frail Form,<br/>
A phantom among men; companionless<br/>
As the last cloud of an expiring storm<br/>
Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,<br/>
Had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness,<br/>
Actaeon-like, and now he fled astray<br/>
With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness,<br/>
And his own thoughts, along that rugged way,<br/>
Pursued, like raging hounds, their father and their prey.<br/>
</p>
<h3>32.</h3>
<p>
A pardlike Spirit beautiful and swift&mdash;<br/>
A Love in desolation masked;&mdash;a Power<br/>
Girt round with weakness;&mdash;it can scarce uplift<br/>
The weight of the superincumbent hour;<br/>
It is a dying lamp, a falling shower,<br/>
A breaking billow;&mdash;even whilst we speak<br/>
Is it not broken? On the withering flower<br/>
The killing sun smiles brightly: on a cheek<br/>
The life can burn in blood, even while the heart may break.<br/>
</p>
<h3>33.</h3>
<p>
His head was bound with pansies overblown,<br/>
And faded violets, white, and pied, and blue;<br/>
And a light spear topped with a cypress cone,<br/>
Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grew<br/>
Yet dripping with the forest's noonday dew,<br/>
Vibrated, as the ever-beating heart<br/>
Shook the weak hand that grasped it; of that crew<br/>
He came the last, neglected and apart;<br/>
A herd-abandoned deer struck by the hunter's dart.<br/>
</p>
<h3>34.</h3>
<p>
All stood aloof, and at his partial moan<br/>
Smiled through their tears; well knew that gentle band<br/>
Who in another's fate now wept his own,<br/>
As in the accents of an unknown land<br/>
He sung new sorrow; sad Urania scanned<br/>
The Stranger's mien, and murmured: 'Who art thou?'<br/>
He answered not, but with a sudden hand<br/>
Made bare his branded and ensanguined brow,<br/>
Which was like Cain's or Christ's&mdash;oh! that it should be so!<br/>
</p>
<h3>35.</h3>
<p>
What softer voice is hushed over the dead?<br/>
Athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown?<br/>
What form leans sadly o'er the white death-bed,<br/>
In mockery of monumental stone,<br/>
The heavy heart heaving without a moan?<br/>
If it be He, who, gentlest of the wise,<br/>
Taught, soothed, loved, honoured the departed one,<br/>
Let me not vex, with inharmonious sighs,<br/>
The silence of that heart's accepted sacrifice.<br/>
</p>
<h3>36.</h3>
<p>
Our Adonais has drunk poison&mdash;oh!<br/>
What deaf and viperous murderer could crown<br/>
Life's early cup with such a draught of woe?<br/>
The nameless worm would now itself disown:<br/>
It felt, yet could escape, the magic tone<br/>
Whose prelude held all envy, hate and wrong,<br/>
But what was howling in one breast alone,<br/>
Silent with expectation of the song,<br/>
Whose master's hand is cold, whose silver lyre unstrung.<br/>
</p>
<h3>37.</h3>
<p>
Live thou, whose infamy is not thy fame!<br/>
Live! fear no heavier chastisement from me,<br/>
Thou noteless blot on a remembered name!<br/>
But be thyself, and know thyself to be!<br/>
And ever at thy season be thou free<br/>
To spill the venom when thy fangs o'erflow;<br/>
Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to thee;<br/>
Hot Shame shall burn upon thy secret brow,<br/>
And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt&mdash;as now.<br/>
</p>
<h3>38.</h3>
<p>
Nor let us weep that our delight is fled<br/>
Far from these carrion kites that scream below;<br/>
He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead;<br/>
Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now&mdash;<br/>
Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall flow<br/>
Back to the burning fountain whence it came,<br/>
A portion of the Eternal, which must glow<br/>
Through time and change, unquenchably the same,<br/>
Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame.<br/>
</p>
<h3>39.</h3>
<p>
Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep&mdash;<br/>
He hath awakened from the dream of life&mdash;<br/>
'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep<br/>
With phantoms an unprofitable strife,<br/>
And in mad trance, strike with our spirit's knife<br/>
Invulnerable nothings.&mdash;WE decay<br/>
Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief<br/>
Convulse us and consume us day by day,<br/>
And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.<br/>
</p>
<h3>40.</h3>
<p>
He has outsoared the shadow of our night;<br/>
Envy and calumny and hate and pain,<br/>
And that unrest which men miscall delight,<br/>
Can touch him not and torture not again;<br/>
From the contagion of the world's slow stain<br/>
He is secure, and now can never mourn<br/>
A heart grown cold, a head grown gray in vain;<br/>
Nor, when the spirit's self has ceased to burn,<br/>
With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn.<br/>
</p>
<h3>41.</h3>
<p>
He lives, he wakes&mdash;'tis Death is dead, not he;<br/>
Mourn not for Adonais.&mdash;Thou young Dawn,<br/>
Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from thee<br/>
The spirit thou lamentest is not gone;<br/>
Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan!<br/>
Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains, and thou Air,<br/>
Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown<br/>
O'er the abandoned Earth, now leave it bare<br/>
Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair!<br/>
</p>
<h3>42.</h3>
<p>
He is made one with Nature: there is heard<br/>
His voice in all her music, from the moan<br/>
Of thunder, to the song of night's sweet bird;<br/>
He is a presence to be felt and known<br/>
In darkness and in light, from herb and stone,<br/>
Spreading itself where'er that Power may move<br/>
Which has withdrawn his being to its own;<br/>
Which wields the world with never-wearied love,<br/>
Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above.<br/>
</p>
<h3>43.</h3>
<p>
He is a portion of the loveliness<br/>
Which once he made more lovely: he doth bear<br/>
His part, while the one Spirit's plastic stress<br/>
Sweeps through the dull dense world, compelling there<br/>
All new successions to the forms they wear;<br/>
Torturing th' unwilling dross that checks its flight<br/>
To its own likeness, as each mass may bear;<br/>
And bursting in its beauty and its might<br/>
From trees and beasts and men into the Heaven's light.<br/>
</p>
<h3>44.</h3>
<p>
The splendours of the firmament of time<br/>
May be eclipsed, but are extinguished not;<br/>
Like stars to their appointed height they climb,<br/>
And death is a low mist which cannot blot<br/>
The brightness it may veil. When lofty thought<br/>
Lifts a young heart above its mortal lair,<br/>
And love and life contend in it, for what<br/>
Shall be its earthly doom, the dead live there<br/>
And move like winds of light on dark and stormy air.<br/>
</p>
<h3>45.</h3>
<p>
The inheritors of unfulfilled renown<br/>
Rose from their thrones, built beyond mortal thought,<br/>
Far in the Unapparent. Chatterton<br/>
Rose pale,&mdash;his solemn agony had not<br/>
Yet faded from him; Sidney, as he fought<br/>
And as he fell and as he lived and loved<br/>
Sublimely mild, a Spirit without spot,<br/>
Arose; and Lucan, by his death approved:<br/>
Oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved.<br/>
</p>
<h3>46.</h3>
<p>
And many more, whose names on Earth are dark,<br/>
But whose transmitted effluence cannot die<br/>
So long as fire outlives the parent spark,<br/>
Rose, robed in dazzling immortality.<br/>
'Thou art become as one of us,' they cry,<br/>
'It was for thee yon kingless sphere has long<br/>
Swung blind in unascended majesty,<br/>
Silent alone amid a Heaven of Song.<br/>
Assume thy winged throne, thou Vesper of our throng!'<br/>
</p>
<h3>47.</h3>
<p>
Who mourns for Adonais? Oh, come forth,<br/>
Fond wretch! and know thyself and him aright.<br/>
Clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous Earth;<br/>
As from a centre, dart thy spirit's light<br/>
Beyond all worlds, until its spacious might<br/>
Satiate the void circumference: then shrink<br/>
Even to a point within our day and night;<br/>
And keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink<br/>
When hope has kindled hope, and lured thee to the brink.<br/>
</p>
<h3>48.</h3>
<p>
Or go to Rome, which is the sepulchre,<br/>
Oh, not of him, but of our joy: 'tis nought<br/>
That ages, empires and religions there<br/>
Lie buried in the ravage they have wrought;<br/>
For such as he can lend,&mdash;they borrow not<br/>
Glory from those who made the world their prey;<br/>
And he is gathered to the kings of thought<br/>
Who waged contention with their time's decay,<br/>
And of the past are all that cannot pass away.<br/>
</p>
<h3>49.</h3>
<p>
Go thou to Rome,&mdash;at once the Paradise,<br/>
The grave, the city, and the wilderness;<br/>
And where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise,<br/>
And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress<br/>
The bones of Desolation's nakedness<br/>
Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead<br/>
Thy footsteps to a slope of green access<br/>
Where, like an infant's smile, over the dead<br/>
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread;<br/>
</p>
<h3>50.</h3>
<p>
And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time<br/>
Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;<br/>
And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime,<br/>
Pavilioning the dust of him who planned<br/>
This refuge for his memory, doth stand<br/>
Like flame transformed to marble; and beneath,<br/>
A field is spread, on which a newer band<br/>
Have pitched in Heaven's smile their camp of death,<br/>
Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath.<br/>
</p>
<h3>51.</h3>
<p>
Here pause: these graves are all too young as yet<br/>
To have outgrown the sorrow which consigned<br/>
Its charge to each; and if the seal is set,<br/>
Here, on one fountain of a mourning mind,<br/>
Break it not thou! too surely shalt thou find<br/>
Thine own well full, if thou returnest home,<br/>
Of tears and gall. From the world's bitter wind<br/>
Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb.<br/>
What Adonais is, why fear we to become?<br/>
</p>
<h3>52.</h3>
<p>
The One remains, the many change and pass;<br/>
Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;<br/>
Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,<br/>
Stains the white radiance of Eternity,<br/>
Until Death tramples it to fragments.&mdash;Die,<br/>
If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!<br/>
Follow where all is fled!&mdash;Rome's azure sky,<br/>
Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weak<br/>
The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak.<br/>
</p>
<h3>53.</h3>
<p>
Why linger, why turn back, why shrink, my Heart?<br/>
Thy hopes are gone before: from all things here<br/>
They have departed; thou shouldst now depart!<br/>
A light is passed from the revolving year,<br/>
And man, and woman; and what still is dear<br/>
Attracts to crush, repels to make thee wither.<br/>
The soft sky smiles,&mdash;the low wind whispers near:<br/>
'Tis Adonais calls! oh, hasten thither,<br/>
No more let Life divide what Death can join together.<br/>
</p>
<h3>54.</h3>
<p>
That Light whose smile kindles the Universe,<br/>
That Beauty in which all things work and move,<br/>
That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse<br/>
Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love<br/>
Which through the web of being blindly wove<br/>
By man and beast and earth and air and sea,<br/>
Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of<br/>
The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me,<br/>
Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.<br/>
</p>
<h3>55.</h3>
<p>
The breath whose might I have invoked in song<br/>
Descends on me; my spirit's bark is driven,<br/>
Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng<br/>
Whose sails were never to the tempest given;<br/>
The massy earth and sphered skies are riven!<br/>
I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;<br/>
Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven,<br/>
The soul of Adonais, like a star,<br/>
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.<br/>

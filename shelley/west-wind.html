<h1>Ode to the West Wind</h1>
<h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,<br/>
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead<br/>
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,
</p>
<p>
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,<br/>
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,<br/>
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
</p>
<p>
The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,<br/>
Each like a corpse within its grave, until<br/>
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow
</p>
<p>
Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill<br/>
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)<br/>
With living hues and odours plain and hill:
</p>
<p>
Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;<br/>
Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh, hear!
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
Thou on whose stream, mid the steep sky's commotion,<br/>
Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed,<br/>
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,
</p>
<p>
Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread<br/>
On the blue surface of thine aery surge,<br/>
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head
</p>
<p>
Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge<br/>
Of the horizon to the zenith's height,<br/>
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge
</p>
<p>
Of the dying year, to which this closing night<br/>
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre,<br/>
Vaulted with all thy congregated might
</p>
<p>
Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere<br/>
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh, hear!
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams<br/>
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,<br/>
Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,
</p>
<p>
Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,<br/>
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers<br/>
Quivering within the wave's intenser day,
</p>
<p>
All overgrown with azure moss and flowers<br/>
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou<br/>
For whose path the Atlantic's level powers
</p>
<p>
Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below<br/>
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear<br/>
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know
</p>
<p>
Thy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,<br/>
And tremble and despoil themselves: oh, hear!
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;<br/>
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;<br/>
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share
</p>
<p>
The impulse of thy strength, only less free<br/>
Than thou, O uncontrollable! If even<br/>
I were as in my boyhood, and could be
</p>
<p>
The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,<br/>
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed<br/>
Scarce seemed a vision; I would ne'er have striven
</p>
<p>
As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.<br/>
Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!<br/>
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!
</p>
<p>
A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed<br/>
One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.
</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>
Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:<br/>
What if my leaves are falling like its own!<br/>
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies
</p>
<p>
Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,<br/>
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,<br/>
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!
</p>
<p>
Drive my dead thoughts over the universe<br/>
Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!<br/>
And, by the incantation of this verse,
</p>
<p>
Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth<br/>
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!<br/>
Be through my lips to unawakened earth
</p>
<p>
The trumpet of a prophecy! O, Wind,<br/>
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?

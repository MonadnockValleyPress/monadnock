<h1>The Masque of Anarchy</h1>
<h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
<p><em>Written on the occasion of the massacre carried out by the British Government at Peterloo, Manchester 1819</em></p>
<p>
As I lay asleep in Italy<br/>
There came a voice from over the Sea,<br/>
And with great power it forth led me<br/>
To walk in the visions of Poesy.
</p>
<p>
I met Murder on the way &mdash;<br/>
He had a mask like Castlereagh &mdash;<br/>
Very smooth he looked, yet grim;<br/>
Seven blood-hounds followed him:
</p>
<p>
All were fat; and well they might<br/>
Be in admirable plight,<br/>
For one by one, and two by two,<br/>
He tossed the human hearts to chew<br/>
Which from his wide cloak he drew.
</p>
<p>
Next came Fraud, and he had on,<br/>
Like Eldon, an ermined gown;<br/>
His big tears, for he wept well,<br/>
Turned to mill-stones as they fell.
</p>
<p>
And the little children, who<br/>
Round his feet played to and fro,<br/>
Thinking every tear a gem,<br/>
Had their brains knocked out by them.
</p>
<p>
Clothed with the Bible, as with light,<br/>
And the shadows of the night,<br/>
Like Sidmouth, next, Hypocrisy<br/>
On a crocodile rode by.
</p>
<p>
And many more Destructions played<br/>
In this ghastly masquerade,<br/>
All disguised, even to the eyes,<br/>
Like Bishops, lawyers, peers, or spies.
</p>
<p>
Last came Anarchy: he rode<br/>
On a white horse, splashed with blood;<br/>
He was pale even to the lips,<br/>
Like Death in the Apocalypse.
</p>
<p>
And he wore a kingly crown;<br/>
And in his grasp a sceptre shone;<br/>
On his brow this mark I saw &mdash;<br/>
'I AM GOD, AND KING, AND LAW!'
</p>
<p>
With a pace stately and fast,<br/>
Over English land he passed,<br/>
Trampling to a mire of blood<br/>
The adoring multitude.
</p>
<p>
And a mighty troop around,<br/>
With their trampling shook the ground,<br/>
Waving each a bloody sword,<br/>
For the service of their Lord.
</p>
<p>
And with glorious triumph, they<br/>
Rode through England proud and gay,<br/>
Drunk as with intoxication<br/>
Of the wine of desolation.
</p>
<p>
O'er fields and towns, from sea to sea,<br/>
Passed the Pageant swift and free,<br/>
Tearing up, and trampling down;<br/>
Till they came to London town.
</p>
<p>
And each dweller, panic-stricken,<br/>
Felt his heart with terror sicken<br/>
Hearing the tempestuous cry<br/>
Of the triumph of Anarchy.
</p>
<p>
For with pomp to meet him came,<br/>
Clothed in arms like blood and flame,<br/>
The hired murderers, who did sing<br/>
'Thou art God, and Law, and King.
</p>
<p>
'We have waited, weak and lone<br/>
For thy coming, Mighty One!<br/>
Our Purses are empty, our swords are cold,<br/>
Give us glory, and blood, and gold.'
</p>
<p>
Lawyers and priests, a motley crowd,<br/>
To the earth their pale brows bowed;<br/>
Like a bad prayer not over loud,<br/>
Whispering &mdash; 'Thou art Law and God.' &mdash;
</p>
<p>
Then all cried with one accord,<br/>
'Thou art King, and God and Lord;<br/>
Anarchy, to thee we bow,<br/>
Be thy name made holy now!'
</p>
<p>
And Anarchy, the skeleton,<br/>
Bowed and grinned to every one,<br/>
As well as if his education<br/>
Had cost ten millions to the nation.
</p>
<p>
For he knew the Palaces<br/>
Of our Kings were rightly his;<br/>
His the sceptre, crown and globe,<br/>
And the gold-inwoven robe.
</p>
<p>
So he sent his slaves before<br/>
To seize upon the Bank and Tower,<br/>
And was proceeding with intent<br/>
To meet his pensioned Parliament
</p>
<p>
When one fled past, a maniac maid,<br/>
And her name was Hope, she said:<br/>
But she looked more like Despair,<br/>
And she cried out in the air:
</p>
<p>
'My father Time is weak and gray<br/>
With waiting for a better day;<br/>
See how idiot-like he stands,<br/>
Fumbling with his palsied hands!
</p>
<p>
He has had child after child,<br/>
And the dust of death is piled<br/>
Over every one but me &mdash;<br/>
Misery, oh, Misery!'
</p>
<p>
Then she lay down in the street,<br/>
Right before the horses' feet,<br/>
Expecting, with a patient eye,<br/>
Murder, Fraud, and Anarchy.
</p>
<p>
When between her and her foes<br/>
A mist, a light, an image rose,<br/>
Small at first, and weak, and frail<br/>
Like the vapour of a vale:
</p>
<p>
Till as clouds grow on the blast,<br/>
Like tower-crowned giants striding fast,<br/>
And glare with lightnings as they fly,<br/>
And speak in thunder to the sky,
</p>
<p>
It grew &mdash; a Shape arrayed in mail<br/>
Brighter than the viper's scale,<br/>
And upborne on wings whose grain<br/>
Was as the light of sunny rain.
</p>
<p>
On its helm, seen far away,<br/>
A planet, like the Morning's, lay;<br/>
And those plumes its light rained through<br/>
Like a shower of crimson dew.
</p>
<p>
With step as soft as wind it passed<br/>
O'er the heads of men &mdash; so fast<br/>
That they knew the presence there,<br/>
And looked, &mdash; but all was empty air.
</p>
<p>
As flowers beneath May's footstep waken,<br/>
As stars from Night's loose hair are shaken,<br/>
As waves arise when loud winds call,<br/>
Thoughts sprung where'er that step did fall.
</p>
<p>
And the prostrate multitude<br/>
Looked &mdash; and ankle-deep in blood,<br/>
Hope, that maiden most serene,<br/>
Was walking with a quiet mien:
</p>
<p>
And Anarchy, the ghastly birth,<br/>
Lay dead earth upon the earth;<br/>
The Horse of Death tameless as wind<br/>
Fled, and with his hoofs did grind<br/>
To dust the murderers thronged behind.
</p>
<p>
A rushing light of clouds and splendour,<br/>
A sense awakening and yet tender<br/>
Was heard and felt &mdash; and at its close<br/>
These words of joy and fear arose
</p>
<p>
As if their own indignant Earth<br/>
Which gave the sons of England birth<br/>
Had felt their blood upon her brow,<br/>
And shuddering with a mother's throe
</p>
<p>
Had turned every drop of blood<br/>
By which her face had been bedewed<br/>
To an accent unwithstood, &mdash;<br/>
As if her heart had cried aloud:
</p>
<p>
'Men of England, heirs of Glory,<br/>
Heroes of unwritten story,<br/>
Nurslings of one mighty Mother,<br/>
Hopes of her, and one another;
</p>
<p>
'Rise like Lions after slumber<br/>
In unvanquishable number,<br/>
Shake your chains to earth like dew<br/>
Which in sleep had fallen on you &mdash;<br/>
Ye are many &mdash; they are few.
</p>
<p>
'What is Freedom? &mdash; ye can tell<br/>
That which slavery is, too well &mdash;<br/>
For its very name has grown<br/>
To an echo of your own.
</p>
<p>
'Tis to work and have such pay<br/>
As just keeps life from day to day<br/>
In your limbs, as in a cell<br/>
For the tyrants' use to dwell,
</p>
<p>
'So that ye for them are made<br/>
Loom, and plough, and sword, and spade,<br/>
With or without your own will bent<br/>
To their defence and nourishment.
</p>
<p>
'Tis to see your children weak<br/>
With their mothers pine and peak,<br/>
When the winter winds are bleak, &mdash;<br/>
They are dying whilst I speak.
</p>
<p>
'Tis to hunger for such diet<br/>
As the rich man in his riot<br/>
Casts to the fat dogs that lie<br/>
Surfeiting beneath his eye;
</p>
<p>
'Tis to let the Ghost of Gold<br/>
Take from Toil a thousandfold<br/>
More that e'er its substance could<br/>
In the tyrannies of old.
</p>
<p>
'Paper coin &mdash; that forgery<br/>
Of the title-deeds, which ye<br/>
Hold to something of the worth<br/>
Of the inheritance of Earth.
</p>
<p>
'Tis to be a slave in soul<br/>
And to hold no strong control<br/>
Over your own wills, but be<br/>
All that others make of ye.
</p>
<p>
'And at length when ye complain<br/>
With a murmur weak and vain<br/>
'Tis to see the Tyrant's crew<br/>
Ride over your wives and you &mdash;<br/>
Blood is on the grass like dew.
</p>
<p>
'Then it is to feel revenge<br/>
Fiercely thirsting to exchange<br/>
Blood for blood &mdash; and wrong for wrong &mdash;<br/>
Do not thus when ye are strong.
</p>
<p>
'Birds find rest, in narrow nest<br/>
When weary of their wing&egrave;d quest<br/>
Beasts find fare, in woody lair<br/>
When storm and snow are in the air.
</p>
<p>
'Asses, swine, have litter spread<br/>
And with fitting food are fed;<br/>
All things have a home but one &mdash;<br/>
Thou, Oh, Englishman, hast none!
</p>
<p>
'This is slavery &mdash; savage men<br/>
Or wild beasts within a den<br/>
Would endure not as ye do &mdash;<br/>
But such ills they never knew.
</p>
<p>
'What art thou Freedom? O! could slaves<br/>
Answer from their living graves<br/>
This demand &mdash; tyrants would flee<br/>
Like a dream's dim imagery:
</p>
<p>
'Thou art not, as impostors say,<br/>
A shadow soon to pass away,<br/>
A superstition, and a name<br/>
Echoing from the cave of Fame.
</p>
<p>
'For the labourer thou art bread,<br/>
And a comely table spread<br/>
From his daily labour come<br/>
In a neat and happy home.
</p>
<p>
'Thou art clothes, and fire, and food<br/>
For the trampled multitude &mdash;<br/>
No &mdash; in countries that are free<br/>
Such starvation cannot be<br/>
As in England now we see.
</p>
<p>
'To the rich thou art a check,<br/>
When his foot is on the neck<br/>
Of his victim, thou dost make<br/>
That he treads upon a snake.
</p>
<p>
'Thou art Justice &mdash; ne'er for gold<br/>
May thy righteous laws be sold<br/>
As laws are in England &mdash; thou<br/>
Shield'st alike the high and low.
</p>
<p>
'Thou art Wisdom &mdash; Freemen never<br/>
Dream that God will damn for ever<br/>
All who think those things untrue<br/>
Of which Priests make such ado.
</p>
<p>
'Thou art Peace &mdash; never by thee<br/>
Would blood and treasure wasted be<br/>
As tyrants wasted them, when all<br/>
Leagued to quench thy flame in Gaul.
</p>
<p>
'What if English toil and blood<br/>
Was poured forth, even as a flood?<br/>
It availed, Oh, Liberty,<br/>
To dim, but not extinguish thee.
</p>
<p>
'Thou art Love &mdash; the rich have kissed<br/>
Thy feet, and like him following Christ,<br/>
Give their substance to the free<br/>
And through the rough world follow thee,
</p>
<p>
'Or turn their wealth to arms, and make<br/>
War for thy belov&egrave;d sake<br/>
On wealth, and war, and fraud &mdash; whence they<br/>
Drew the power which is their prey.
</p>
<p>
'Science, Poetry, and Thought<br/>
Are thy lamps; they make the lot<br/>
Of the dwellers in a cot<br/>
So serene, they curse it not.
</p>
<p>
'Spirit, Patience, Gentleness,<br/>
All that can adorn and bless<br/>
Art thou &mdash; let deeds, not words, express<br/>
Thine exceeding loveliness.
</p>
<p>
'Let a great Assembly be<br/>
Of the fearless and the free<br/>
On some spot of English ground<br/>
Where the plains stretch wide around.
</p>
<p>
'Let the blue sky overhead,<br/>
The green earth on which ye tread,<br/>
All that must eternal be<br/>
Witness the solemnity.
</p>
<p>
'From the corners uttermost<br/>
Of the bounds of English coast;<br/>
From every hut, village, and town<br/>
Where those who live and suffer moan,
</p>
<p>
'From the workhouse and the prison<br/>
Where pale as corpses newly risen,<br/>
Women, children, young and old<br/>
Groan for pain, and weep for cold &mdash;
</p>
<p>
'From the haunts of daily life<br/>
Where is waged the daily strife<br/>
With common wants and common cares<br/>
Which sows the human heart with tares &mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Lastly from the palaces<br/>
Where the murmur of distress<br/>
Echoes, like the distant sound<br/>
Of a wind alive around
</p>
<p>
'Those prison halls of wealth and fashion,<br/>
Where some few feel such compassion<br/>
For those who groan, and toil, and wail<br/>
As must make their brethren pale &mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Ye who suffer woes untold,<br/>
Or to feel, or to behold<br/>
Your lost country bought and sold<br/>
With a price of blood and gold &mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Let a vast assembly be,<br/>
And with great solemnity<br/>
Declare with measured words that ye<br/>
Are, as God has made ye, free &mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Be your strong and simple words<br/>
Keen to wound as sharpened swords,<br/>
And wide as targes let them be,<br/>
With their shade to cover ye.
</p>
<p>
'Let the tyrants pour around<br/>
With a quick and startling sound,<br/>
Like the loosening of a sea,<br/>
Troops of armed emblazonry.
</p>
<p>
Let the charged artillery drive<br/>
Till the dead air seems alive<br/>
With the clash of clanging wheels,<br/>
And the tramp of horses' heels.
</p>
<p>
'Let the fix&egrave;d bayonet<br/>
Gleam with sharp desire to wet<br/>
Its bright point in English blood<br/>
Looking keen as one for food.
</p>
<p>
'Let the horsemen's scimitars<br/>
Wheel and flash, like sphereless stars<br/>
Thirsting to eclipse their burning<br/>
In a sea of death and mourning.
</p>
<p>
'Stand ye calm and resolute,<br/>
Like a forest close and mute,<br/>
With folded arms and looks which are<br/>
Weapons of unvanquished war,
</p>
<p>
'And let Panic, who outspeeds<br/>
The career of arm&egrave;d steeds<br/>
Pass, a disregarded shade<br/>
Through your phalanx undismayed.
</p>
<p>
'Let the laws of your own land,<br/>
Good or ill, between ye stand<br/>
Hand to hand, and foot to foot,<br/>
Arbiters of the dispute,
</p>
<p>
'The old laws of England &mdash; they<br/>
Whose reverend heads with age are gray,<br/>
Children of a wiser day;<br/>
And whose solemn voice must be<br/>
Thine own echo &mdash; Liberty!
</p>
<p>
'On those who first should violate<br/>
Such sacred heralds in their state<br/>
Rest the blood that must ensue,<br/>
And it will not rest on you.
</p>
<p>
'And if then the tyrants dare<br/>
Let them ride among you there,<br/>
Slash, and stab, and maim, and hew, &mdash;<br/>
What they like, that let them do.
</p>
<p>
'With folded arms and steady eyes,<br/>
And little fear, and less surprise,<br/>
Look upon them as they slay<br/>
Till their rage has died away.
</p>
<p>
'Then they will return with shame<br/>
To the place from which they came,<br/>
And the blood thus shed will speak<br/>
In hot blushes on their cheek.
</p>
<p>
'Every woman in the land<br/>
Will point at them as they stand &mdash;<br/>
They will hardly dare to greet<br/>
Their acquaintance in the street.
</p>
<p>
'And the bold, true warriors<br/>
Who have hugged Danger in wars<br/>
Will turn to those who would be free,<br/>
Ashamed of such base company.
</p>
<p>
'And that slaughter to the Nation<br/>
Shall steam up like inspiration,<br/>
Eloquent, oracular;<br/>
A volcano heard afar.
</p>
<p>
'And these words shall then become<br/>
Like Oppression's thundered doom<br/>
Ringing through each heart and brain,<br/>
Heard again &mdash; again &mdash; again &mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Rise like Lions after slumber<br/>
In unvanquishable number &mdash;<br/>
Shake your chains to earth like dew<br/>
Which in sleep had fallen on you &mdash;<br/>
Ye are many &mdash; they are few.'

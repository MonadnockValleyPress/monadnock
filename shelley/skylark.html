<h1>To a Skylark</h1>
<h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley (1820)</h2>
<p>
Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!<br/>
Bird thou never wert,<br/>
That from Heaven, or near it,<br/>
Pourest thy full heart<br/>
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art. 
</p>
<p>
Higher still and higher<br/>
From the earth thou springest<br/>
Like a cloud of fire;<br/>
The blue deep thou wingest,<br/>
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest. 
</p>
<p>
In the golden lightning<br/>
Of the sunken sun,<br/>
O'er which clouds are bright'ning.<br/>
Thou dost float and run;<br/>
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun. 
</p>
<p>
The pale purple even<br/>
Melts around thy flight;<br/>
Like a star of Heaven,<br/>
In the broad daylight<br/>
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight, 
</p>
<p>
Keen as are the arrows<br/>
Of that silver sphere,<br/>
Whose intense lamp narrows<br/>
In the white dawn clear<br/>
Until we hardly see—we feel that it is there. 
</p>
<p>
All the earth and air<br/>
With thy voice is loud,<br/>
As, when night is bare,<br/>
From one lonely cloud<br/>
The moon rains out her beams, and Heaven is overflowed. 
</p>
<p>
What thou art we know not;<br/>
What is most like thee?<br/>
From rainbow clouds there flow not<br/>
Drops so bright to see<br/>
As from thy presence showers a rain of melody. 
</p>
<p>
Like a Poet hidden<br/>
In the light of thought,<br/>
Singing hymns unbidden,<br/>
Till the world is wrought<br/>
To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not: 
</p>
<p>
Like a high-born maiden<br/>
In a palace-tower,<br/>
Soothing her love-laden<br/>
Soul in secret hour<br/>
With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower: 
</p>
<p>
Like a glow-worm golden<br/>
In a dell of dew,<br/>
Scattering unbeholden<br/>
Its aereal hue<br/>
Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view! 
</p>
<p>
Like a rose embowered<br/>
In its own green leaves,<br/>
By warm winds deflowered,<br/>
Till the scent it gives<br/>
Makes faint with too much sweet those heavy-winged thieves: 
</p>
<p>
Sound of vernal showers<br/>
On the twinkling grass,<br/>
Rain-awakened flowers,<br/>
All that ever was<br/>
Joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass: 
</p>
<p>
Teach us, Sprite or Bird,<br/>
What sweet thoughts are thine:<br/>
I have never heard<br/>
Praise of love or wine<br/>
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine. 
</p>
<p>
Chorus Hymeneal,<br/>
Or triumphal chant,<br/>
Matched with thine would be all<br/>
But an empty vaunt,<br/>
A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want. 
</p>
<p>
What objects are the fountains<br/>
Of thy happy strain?<br/>
What fields, or waves, or mountains?<br/>
What shapes of sky or plain?<br/>
What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain? 
</p>
<p>
With thy clear keen joyance<br/>
Languor cannot be:<br/>
Shadow of annoyance<br/>
Never came near thee:<br/>
Thou lovest—but ne'er knew love's sad satiety. 
</p>
<p>
Waking or asleep,<br/>
Thou of death must deem<br/>
Things more true and deep<br/>
Than we mortals dream,<br/>
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream? 
</p>
<p>
We look before and after,<br/>
And pine for what is not:<br/>
Our sincerest laughter<br/>
With some pain is fraught;<br/>
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought. 
</p>
<p>
Yet if we could scorn<br/>
Hate, and pride, and fear;<br/>
If we were things born<br/>
Not to shed a tear,<br/>
I know not how thy joy we ever should come near. 
</p>
<p>
Better than all measures<br/>
Of delightful sound,<br/>
Better than all treasures<br/>
That in books are found,<br/>
Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground! 
</p>
<p>
Teach me half the gladness<br/>
That thy brain must know,<br/>
Such harmonious madness<br/>
From my lips would flow<br/>
The world should listen then&mdash;as I am listening now.

<h1>The Cloud</h1>
<h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
<p>
I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the seas and the streams;<br/>
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their noonday dreams.<br/>
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet buds every one,<br/>
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she dances about the sun.<br/>
I wield the flail of the lashing hail,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whiten the green plains under,<br/>
And then again I dissolve it in rain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laugh as I pass in thunder.
</p>
<p>
I sift the snow on the mountains below,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their great pines groan aghast;<br/>
And all the night 'tis my pillow white,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I sleep in the arms of the blast.<br/>
Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning my pilot sits;<br/>
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It struggles and howls at fits;<br/>
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pilot is guiding me,<br/>
Lured by the love of the genii that move<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the purple sea;<br/>
Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the lakes and the plains,<br/>
Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit he loves remains;<br/>
And I all the while bask in Heaven's blue smile,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst he is dissolving in rains. 
</p>
<p>
The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his burning plumes outspread,<br/>
Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the morning star shines dead;<br/>
As on the jag of a mountain crag,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which an earthquake rocks and swings,<br/>
An eagle alit one moment may sit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of its golden wings.<br/>
And when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its ardours of rest and of love,<br/>
And the crimson pall of eve may fall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the depth of Heaven above.<br/>
With wings folded I rest, on mine aery nest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As still as a brooding dove.
</p>
<p>
That orbed maiden with white fire laden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom mortals call the Moon,<br/>
Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the midnight breezes strewn;<br/>
And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which only the angels hear,<br/>
May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars peep behind her and peer;<br/>
And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a swarm of golden bees.<br/>
When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas,<br/>
Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are each paved with the moon and these.
</p>
<p>
I bind the Sun's throne with a burning zone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Moon's with a girdle of pearl;<br/>
The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.<br/>
From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a torrent sea,<br/>
Sunbeam-proof, I hand like a roof,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains its columns be.<br/>
The triumphal arch through which I march<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hurricane, fire, and snow,<br/>
When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the million-coloured bow;<br/>
The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the moist Earth was laughing below.
</p>
<p>
I am the daughter of Earth and Water,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the nursling of the Sky;<br/>
I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I change, but I cannot die.<br/>
For after the rain when with never a stain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pavilion of Heaven is bare,<br/>
And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build up the blue dome of air,<br/>
I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of the caverns of rain,<br/>
Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I arise and unbuild it again.

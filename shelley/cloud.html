<h1>The Cloud</h1>
<h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley (1820)</h2>
<p>
I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,<br/>
From the seas and the streams;<br/>
I bear light shade for the leaves when laid<br/>
In their noonday dreams.<br/>
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken<br/>
The sweet buds every one,<br/>
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,<br/>
As she dances about the sun.<br/>
I wield the flail of the lashing hail,<br/>
And whiten the green plains under,<br/>
And then again I dissolve it in rain,<br/>
And laugh as I pass in thunder.
</p>
<p>
I sift the snow on the mountains below,<br/>
And their great pines groan aghast;<br/>
And all the night 'tis my pillow white, <br/>
While I sleep in the arms of the blast.<br/>
Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,<br/>
Lightning my pilot sits;<br/>
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,<br/>
It struggles and howls at fits; <br/>
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,<br/>
This pilot is guiding me,<br/>
Lured by the love of the genii that move<br/>
In the depths of the purple sea;<br/>
Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills. <br/>
Over the lakes and the plains,<br/>
Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,<br/>
The Spirit he loves remains;<br/>
And I all the while bask in Heaven's blue smile,<br/>
Whilst he is dissolving in rains. 
</p>
<p>
The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes,<br/>
And his burning plumes outspread,<br/>
Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,<br/>
When the morning star shines dead;<br/>
As on the jag of a mountain crag, <br/>
Which an earthquake rocks and swings,<br/>
An eagle alit one moment may sit<br/>
In the light of its golden wings.<br/>
And when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,<br/>
Its ardours of rest and of love, <br/>
And the crimson pall of eve may fall<br/>
From the depth of Heaven above.<br/>
With wings folded I rest, on mine aery nest,<br/>
As still as a brooding dove.
</p>
<p>
That orbed maiden with white fire laden, <br/>
Whom mortals call the Moon,<br/>
Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,<br/>
By the midnight breezes strewn;<br/>
And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,<br/>
Which only the angels hear, <br/>
May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof.<br/>
The stars peep behind her and peer;<br/>
And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,<br/>
Like a swarm of golden bees.<br/>
When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent, <br/>
Till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas,<br/>
Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,<br/>
Are each paved with the moon and these.
</p>
<p>
I bind the Sun's throne with a burning zone,
And the Moon's with a girdle of pearl; 
The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim,
When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.
From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,
Over a torrent sea,
Sunbeam-proof, I hand like a roof,â€” 
The mountains its columns be.
The triumphal arch through which I march
With hurricane, fire, and snow,
When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair,
Is the million-coloured bow; 
The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove,
While the moist Earth was laughing below.
</p>
<p>
I am the daughter of Earth and Water,
And the nursling of the Sky;
I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores; 
I change, but I cannot die.
For after the rain when with never a stain
The pavilion of Heaven is bare,
And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams
Build up the blue dome of air, 
I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,
And out of the caverns of rain,
Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,
I arise and unbuild it again.

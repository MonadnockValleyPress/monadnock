<h1>The Invitation</h1>
<h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
<p>
Best and brightest, come away!<br/>
Fairer far than this fair Day,<br/>
Which, like thee to those in sorrow,<br/>
Comes to bid a sweet good-morrow<br/>
To the rough Year just awake<br/>
In its cradle on the brake.<br/>
The Brightest hour of unborn Spring,<br/>
Through the winter wandering,<br/>
Found, it seems, the halcyon Morn<br/>
To hoar February born.<br/>
Bending from Heaven, in azure mirth,<br/>
It kissed the forehead of the Earth,<br/>
And smiled upon the silent sea,<br/>
And bade the frozen streams be free,<br/>
And waked to music all their fountains,<br/>
And breathed upon the frozen mountains,<br/>
And like a prophetess of May<br/>
Strewed flowers upon the barren way,<br/>
Making the wintry world appear<br/>
Like one on whom thou smilest, dear.<br/>
Away, away, from men and towns,<br/>
To the wild wood and the downs&mdash;<br/>
To the silent wilderness<br/>
Where the soul need not repress<br/>
Its music lest it should not find<br/>
An echo in another’s mind.<br/>
While the touch of Nature’s art<br/>
Harmonizes heart to heart.<br/>
I leave this notice on my door<br/>
For each accustomed visitor:&mdash;<br/>
“I am gone into the fields<br/>
To take what this sweet hour yields;&mdash;<br/>
Reflection, you may come tomorrow,<br/>
Sit by the fireside with Sorrow.&mdash;<br/>
You with the unpaid bill, Despair,&mdash;<br/>
You, tiresome verse-reciter, Care,&mdash;<br/>
I will pay you in the grave,&mdash;<br/>
Death will listen to your stave.<br/>
Expectation too, be off!<br/>
Today is for itself enough;<br/>
Hope, in pity mock not Woe<br/>
With smiles, nor follow where I go;<br/>
Long having lived on thy sweet food,<br/>
At length I find one moment’s good<br/>
After long pain&mdash;with all your love,<br/>
This you never told me of.”
</p>
<p>
Radiant Sister of the Day,<br/>
Awake! arise! And come away!<br/>
To the wild woods and the plains,<br/>
And the pools where winter rains<br/>
Image all their roof of leaves,<br/>
Where the pine its garland weaves<br/>
Of sapless green, and ivy dun<br/>
Round stems that never kiss the sun:<br/>
Where the lawns and pastures be,<br/>
And the sandhills of the sea:&mdash;<br/>
Where the melting hoar-frost wets<br/>
The daisy-star that never sets,<br/>
And wind-flowers, and violets,<br/>
Which yet join not scent to hue,<br/>
Crown the pale year weak and new;<br/>
When the night is left behind<br/>
In the deep east, dun and blind,<br/>
And the blue noon is over us,<br/>
And the multitudinous<br/>
Billows murmur at our feet,<br/>
Where the earth and ocean meet,<br/>
And all things seem only one<br/>
In the universal sun.

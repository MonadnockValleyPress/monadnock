<h1>The Craftsman</h1>
<h2>by Rudyard Kipling</h2>
<p>
Once, after long-drawn revel at The Mermaid,<br/>
He to the overbearing Boanerges<br/>
Jonson, uttered (if half of it were liquor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed be the vintage!)
</p>
<p>
Saying how, at an alehouse under Cotswold,<br/>
He had made sure of his very Cleopatra,<br/>
Drunk with enormous, salvation-con temning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love for a tinker.
</p>
<p>
How, while he hid from Sir Thomas's keepers,<br/>
Crouched in a ditch and drenched by the midnight<br/>
Dews, he had listened to gipsy Juliet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rail at the dawning.
</p>
<p>
How at Bankside, a boy drowning kittens<br/>
Winced at the business; whereupon his sister &#151;<br/>
Lady Macbeth aged seven &#151; thrust 'em under,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sombrely scornful.
</p>
<p>
How on a Sabbath, hushed and compassionate &#151; <br/>
She being known since her birth to the townsfolk &#151;<br/>
Stratford dredged and delivered from Avon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dripping Ophelia.
</p>
<p>
So, with a thin third finger marrying<br/>
Drop to wine-drop domed on the table,<br/>
Shakespeare opened his heart till the sunrise &#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered to hear him.
</p>
<p>
London wakened and he, imperturbable,<br/>
Passed from waking to hurry after shadows . . .<br/>
Busied upon shows of no earthly importance?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but he knew it!

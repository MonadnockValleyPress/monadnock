<h1>If&#151;</h1>
<h2>by Rudyard Kipling</h2>
<p>
If you can keep your head when all about you<br />
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br />
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br />
But make allowance for their doubting too:<br />
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br />
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br />
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;
</p>
<p>
If you can dream&#151;and not make dreams your master;<br />
If you can think&#151;and not make thoughts your aim,<br />
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br />
And treat those two imposters just the same:<br />
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br />
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools;
</p>
<p>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br />
And never breathe a word about your loss:<br />
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />
Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"
</p>
<p>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />
Or walk with Kings&#151;nor lose the common touch,<br />
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br />
If all men count with you, but none too much:<br />
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br />
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br />
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br />
And&#151;which is more&#151;you'll be a Man, my son!

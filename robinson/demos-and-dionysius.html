<h1>Demos and Dionysius</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson (1925)</h2>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
Good morning, Demos.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought you were dead.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
If you look too assuredly for death<br/>
To consummate your preference and desire,<br/>
Sometime you may endure, to your surprise<br/>
The pang of an especial disappointment.<br/>
Why such a fever of unfriendliness?<br/>
And why, again, so brief a courtesy?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
There was no courtesy. Had I the power<br/>
to crown my will with its accomplishment,<br/>
the crowning would be brief enough, God knows.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
And you would then be king.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say as you like,<br/>
Your words are of a measure with your works.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
If you assume with me too large a license,<br/>
How do you know that you may not be seized<br/>
With one of my more celebrated frenzies<br/>
And eat yourself alive? If you do that,<br/>
Who then shall be the king that shall inherit<br/>
The realm that is your envy and the dream<br/>
Of your immoderate magnificence?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
There are to be no kings where I shall reign.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
Not so? Then how are you to do your reigning?<br/>
I'm asking only as an eager child<br/>
Might ask as much of an impatient faith<br/>er.
We'll say a patient and unusual child,<br/>
Not listening always for a sudden answer.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
Your days are as the pages of a book,<br/>
And one where Finis waits for no long reading.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
Your are somewhat irrelevant, and too hasty,<br/>
But that's to be forgiven of a king.<br/>
The king can do no wrong. As for my book<br/>
Where Finis waits, how far along are you<br/>
In reading it, and thereby in absorbing<br/>
The indemnifying gist of what it means?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
I have read far enough to find in it<br/>
No sure indemnity save one of grief,<br/>
And one of death.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing of life at all?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
Nothing of life to me.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How came you then<br/>
So neutrally and unecstatically<br/>
At one time to be born?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see<br/>
More than some words in that.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you don't,<br/>
The book of what you do not see, my friend,<br/>
Would have no Finis in it. Your dim faith&mdash;<br/>
Your faith in something somewhere out of nothing&mdash;<br/>
And your industrious malevolence<br/>
Against yourself and the divine escape<br/>
That makes a wine of water when it will&mdash;<br/>
Or not, if it will not&mdash;may soon or late<br/>
Consume your folly in a long fatigue,<br/>
And to an angry death. You measure me<br/>
By something in a flagon or a glass&mdash;<br/>
And we're away from that. Leaving aside<br/>
The lesser and the larger mysteries,<br/>
By what obscured immeasurable means<br/>
Are you to have in your attractive prison<br/>
The music of the world and of the stars<br/>
Without me, or to make of love and art<br/>
The better part&mdash;without me? Do you know?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
I do not see the prison.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you will;<br/>
And having filled it you may blow it up<br/>
In the necessity of desperation.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
I do not know your language; and far less<br/>
Do I concede with you in love and art<br/>
The better part.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that you never will.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
I hope not.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your hope will come to pass,<br/>
If you achieve your way. You stamp your coin<br/>
Of words too small compass their design,<br/>
Or to authenticate their currency.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
Yet somehow they are current.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they are;<br/>
And so are the uncounted flying seeds<br/>
Of death for you to breathe and eat and drink,<br/>
Never aware of their ascendancy<br/>
Till you are down where they're devouring you<br/>
And you are groaning to be rid of them.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
They are physicians.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not so many<br/>
That you may trust them for immunity<br/>
From your disease, or pay them for a cure<br/>
With your ingenious coin. Under your sway<br/>
They would all be as easily indisposed<br/>
As you are now and at as blind a loss<br/>
To say what ailed them. Given release enough,<br/>
They might arrive, in a combined rebellion,<br/>
At some unethical unanimity<br/>
As to the poison most expedient<br/>
For the accomplishment of your transition,<br/>
But they would never cure you otherwise;<br/>
And they will never make you less the monster<br/>
That you would be, and may be&mdash;for a time.<br/>
They are futilities and enormities<br/>
That must be loved and honored and obeyed<br/>
Before they are found out. If you be one,<br/>
Or other, or both, as I believe you are,<br/>
God help the credulous and expectant slaves<br/>
Of your unconscionable supremacy.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
They are expectant, certainly, and wisely;<br/>
My argument enfolds them and assures them.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
And obfuscates their proper sight of you.<br/>
In your forensic you are not unlike<br/>
The pleasant and efficient octopus,<br/>
Who inks the sea around him with a cloud<br/>
That hides his most essential devilishness,<br/>
Leaving his undulating tentacles<br/>
To writhe and shoot and strangle as they may.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
By turning your two eyes to land again<br/>
You may regard some hundred million souls<br/>
Or ore that are awaiting my tuition&mdash;<br/>
Where Reason and Equality, like strong twins,<br/>
Will soon be brother giants, overseeing<br/>
Incessantly the welfare of them all.<br/>
A little strangling will be good for them,<br/>
And they will have no courage to complain.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
They will not have their souls by then. By then,<br/>
You and your twins&mdash;both illegitimate,<br/>
And the most credible liars ever conceived&mdash;<br/>
Will have reduced their souls to common fuel,<br/>
And their obedient selves to poor machines<br/>
That ultimately will disintegrate,<br/>
Leaving you outcast and discredited,<br/>
A king of ruins; though you are not yet worse<br/>
Than a malignant and a specious warning&mdash;<br/>
Albeit you may attain to your desire<br/>
If it be fate that you shall be the scourge<br/>
Of a slave-ridden state for long enough<br/>
To prove and alienate your demonship<br/>
Till you are done with. In the mixed meantime,<br/>
A thousand men, had they the will to speak,<br/>
Might shred your folly to its least of words<br/>
And thereby have the ruin less methodized<br/>
If not forestalled and thwarted. You may smile<br/>
Till you may be as far from recognition<br/>
As from a reason why a man should live,<br/>
But you will be no lovelier then for that<br/>
Than you are now. Why do you wet your lips<br/>
With your mendacious tongue, and rub your hands?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
Why do I smile? Why do I rub my hands?<br/>
Because your thousand men will never speak.<br/>
I have you there, my master. Some will curse<br/>
Among themselves a little; some will grunt;<br/>
Others will shrug their unoffending shoulders<br/>
At my offensive name; others will stretch<br/>
Themselves, and in the refuge of a yawn<br/>
Will say they have enough to last their time<br/>
And the future must attend itself&mdash;<br/>
As you foresee it will. They are all safe,<br/>
And comfortably gagged. They will not speak&mdash;<br/>
Or not more than a few&mdash;and fewer still<br/>
Will act; and those who do may do no more<br/>
Than a few shipwrecked generals on an island<br/>
Might do if they were all to draw their swords<br/>
At once, and then make faces and throw stones<br/>
At my perfidious and indifferent image.<br/>
I fear, my master, you are left behind.<br/>
One of these days, the world will be a hive&mdash;<br/>
The veritable asylum you deplore<br/>
So vainly now. Then every little bee<br/>
Will have his little task, and having done it,<br/>
His time to play. So all will be in order,<br/>
And the soaring hopes of individuals<br/>
To be some day themselves, though God knows how,<br/>
Will all be sweetened with synthetic honey.<br/>
The waste of excellence that you call art<br/>
Will be a thing remembered as a toy<br/>
Dug somewhere from forgotten history;<br/>
And this infirmity that you name love<br/>
Will be subdued to studious preservation.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
Of what?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, of Reason and Equality.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
Your twins again. With you for the king-bee,<br/>
And with an array of converted drones<br/>
Stinging your hive to order, as you say,<br/>
Where then would be the purpose or the need<br/>
Of any such hive? Were it not better now,<br/>
Beforehand, to forestall monotony<br/>
And servitude with one complete carouse,<br/>
Capped with a competent oblivion&mdash;<br/>
Or with a prayer at least for such an end?<br/>
If in the sorry picture that you flaunt<br/>
Before me as your ultimate panorama<br/>
Of an invertebrate futility<br/>
You see no reason to be sick at heart,&mdash;<br/>
I do. I see a reason to shed tears.<br/>
What will be left in your millennium<br/>
When self and soul are gone an all subdued<br/>
Insensibly?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self and soul will not be missed,<br/>
Having been rather too much in the way,<br/>
And too long, for the good of the machine,<br/>
In which I see an end and a beginning.<br/>
Men have been playing heretofore too much<br/>
With feeling and with unprofitable fancy.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
I see an end, but not yet the beginning.<br/>
Feeling and fancy? What do you know of them?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
Enough to say that in the kingdom coming&mdash;<br/>
O yes, I shall be king&mdash;they shall be whipped<br/>
And rationed into reason. Where a few<br/>
That are peculiar would precede the many,<br/>
Measures are always waiting.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there be not<br/>
A few that are peculiar in your world,<br/>
Your world will be a more peculiar place<br/>
Than all your nightmares have inhabited;<br/>
And howsoever you compel your zeal<br/>
To swallow your deceit, I'll apprehend<br/>
Their presence even in your machinery.<br/>
Something will break if they are not subdued.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
They will be ground to death if they are there,
And in the way.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the machine breaks<br/>
In breaking them, who patches the machine?<br/>
You and your amiable automatons<br/>
Will have no more the feeling or the fancy<br/>
To prove or guess what ails it.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine,
Once running, will run always. As for you,<br/>
You will be driven off somewhere from the world,<br/>
And in some hell of exile and remembrance<br/>
Will see how it all goes, and how securely<br/>
The mechanistic hive subdues itself<br/>
To system and to order&mdash;and to Reason.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
And to Equality. How do you know today<br/>
That I may not return again from hell&mdash;<br/>
Acceptably, perchance&mdash;and bring some fancy?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
Your sort of honey will have no taste then<br/>
For palates that are duly neutralized;<br/>
And all its evil sweet and stickiness<br/>
Will be a freight for you to ferry back<br/>
To the same place where you discovered it.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
Why do you so invidiously insist<br/>
That I shall go so far&mdash;or that my honey<br/>
Is half so evil or so inimical<br/>
As that of your abject anticipation?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
Abject? I do not wholly see it so.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
It must have been the milder side of me<br/>
That held a lodging for so mild a word.<br/>
While I consider the compliant slaves<br/>
That you would have subdued to your machine,<br/>
I beg your mechanistic leave to shudder,<br/>
For your "subdued" pursues me.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in due time<br/>
It will for certain seize you and arraign you<br/>
For what you are.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that it might do so!<br/>
Yet that's the one of all things onerous<br/>
And easy that will not be done for me.<br/>
Simplicity was not my father's name,<br/>
Nor was it ever mine; yet I'm unfeigned<br/>
To see, for those who may. My mother died<br/>
Because she would see God. I did not die.<br/>
Was it not strange that I should be twice born<br/>
For nothing, if I be what you make of me&mdash;<br/>
A lord of life that has no worthier fate<br/>
Than one of hell, with death and evil honey<br/>
For my companionship and consolation?
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
I have not made of you a lord of life;<br/>
And as for recommending hell and honey,<br/>
There may be one for you without the other.<br/>
We shall have neither here.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm of a mind<br/>
To prophesy that you may have the one<br/>
And hunger for the other, till presently<br/>
You shall have both again, as you do now.<br/>
My way would not be yours; and my machine<br/>
Would have a more forbearing alternation<br/>
Attending a less dread beneficence.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
What do you mean by that?
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean as much<br/>
As an observing child might understand<br/>
Who grows to see between him and another<br/>
A living difference and an impetus<br/>
To breathe and be himself. I mean, also,<br/>
An increment of reason not like yours,<br/>
Which is the cruxifixion of all reason,<br/>
But one that quickens in the seed of truth<br/>
And is the flower of truth&mdash;not always fair,<br/>
Yet always to be found if you will see it.<br/>
There <em>is</em> a Demos, and you know his name<br/>
By force of easy stealing; yet his face<br/>
Would be one of a melancholy stranger<br/>
To you if he saw yours. I know his face,<br/>
And why he keeps it hidden until the wreck<br/>
Of your invention shall betray itself<br/>
As a monstrosity beyond repair,<br/>
And only by slow toil to be removed.<br/>
I mean that all of your frantic insolence<br/>
Of hate and of denatured eagerness<br/>
To build in the air a solid monument<br/>
From the wrong end will end in a collapse,<br/>
With you beneath it bellowing for relief<br/>
Not interested or available.<br/>
I mean that of all noxious tyrannies<br/>
Potential in imaginable folly,<br/>
The tyrant of the most intolerable<br/>
And unenduring will obscure himself<br/>
With much the same suave and benevolent mask<br/>
As this that you are wearing now to cover<br/>
The guile you date not show to your disciples.<br/>
I mean that your delirious clumsy leap<br/>
From reason to the folly you call reason<br/>
Will only make of you and of your dupes<br/>
A dislocated and unlovely mess<br/>
For undertakers, who are not yet born<br/>
To view the coming ruin that is to be<br/>
Their occupation and emolument&mdash;<br/>
If your delusion for a time prevail<br/>
As like enough it will. I mean, also,<br/>
That after suffering time has had enough<br/>
Of you and of your sterile dispensation,<br/>
Some wholesome fire of though and competence<br/>
Will make of what is left a cannistered<br/>
Memorial of unlovely orts and ashes,<br/>
To be a warning and a wonderment<br/>
Where you shall plot no more. I mean a world<br/>
Fit for a self-defending human race<br/>
To recognize, and finally to live in.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
I'll put the clamps on harder, just for that,<br/>
And let you see what Reason really is,<br/>
In fact and action. We have had too much<br/>
Of the insurgent individual<br/>
With his free fancy and his free this and that,<br/>
And his ingenuous right to be himself.<br/>
What right has anyone now to be himself,<br/>
Since I am here to fix him in his place<br/>
And hold him there? And as for your fit world,<br/>
I'll have it all alike and of a piece&mdash;<br/>
Punctual, accurate, tamed and uniform,<br/>
And equal. Then romance and love and art<br/>
And ecstasy will be remembrances<br/>
Of man's young weakness on his way to reason.<br/>
When my world's once in order, you shall see.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
I may, but God forbid the sight of it.<br/>
I'd rather stay in hell, which you imply<br/>
To be preparing for me.
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I approve<br/>
Unspeakably of such a preference<br/>
On your part. Go at once, for all I care,<br/>
And stay.
</p>
<p>DIONYSIUS<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may go somewhere, for a while,<br/>
But I a one of those who have perforce<br/>
To live and to return. Should there be need<br/>
Of me, I may remain; and you may find<br/>
One day a merry welcome waiting you<br/>
In the same place where you say I belong:<br/>
Take off your mask and find another name,<br/>
Or I'll be sure you will. Good morning, Demos.<br/>
</p>
<p>DEMOS<br />
Good morning, Dionysius. Wait and see.

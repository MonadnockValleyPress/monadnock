<h1>Hillcrest</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson (1916)</h2>
<p><em>(To Mrs. Edward MacDowell)</em></p>
<p>
No sound of any storm that shakes<br/>
Old island walls with older seas<br/>
Comes here where now September makes<br/>
An island in a sea of trees.
</p>
<p>
Between the sunlight and the shade<br/>
A man may learn till he forgets<br/>
The roaring of a world remade,<br/>
And all his ruins and regrets;
</p>
<p>
And if he still remembers here<br/>
Poor fights he may have won or lost,&mdash;<br/>
If he be ridden with the fear<br/>
Of what some other fight may cost,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
If, eager to confuse too soon,<br/>
What he has known with what may be,<br/>
He reads a planet out of tune<br/>
For cause of his jarred harmony,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
If here he venture to unroll<br/>
His index of adagios,<br/>
And he be given to console<br/>
Humanity with what he knows,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
He may by contemplation learn<br/>
A little more than what he knew,<br/>
And even see great oaks return<br/>
To acorns out of which they grew.
</p>
<p>
He may, if he but listen well,<br/>
Through twilight and the silence here,<br/>
Be told what there are none may tell<br/>
To vanity's impatient ear;
</p>
<p>
And he may never dare again<br/>
Say what awaits him, or be sure<br/>
What sunlit labyrinth of pain<br/>
He may not enter and endure.
</p>
<p>
Who knows to-day from yesterday<br/>
May learn to count no thing too strange:<br/>
Love builds of what Time takes away,<br/>
Till Death itself is less than Change.
</p>
<p>
Who sees enough in his duress<br/>
May go as far as dreams have gone;<br/>
Who sees a little may do less<br/>
Than many who are blind have done;
</p>
<p>
Who sees unchastened here the soul<br/>
Triumphant has no other sight<br/>
Than has a child who sees the whole<br/>
World radiant with his own delight.
</p>
<p>
Far journeys and hard wandering<br/>
Await him in whose crude surmise<br/>
Peace, like a mask, hides everything<br/>
That is and has been from his eyes;
</p>
<p>
And all his wisdom is unfound,<br/>
Or like a web that error weaves<br/>
On airy looms that have a sound<br/>
No louder now than falling leaves.

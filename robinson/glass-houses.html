<h1>Glass Houses</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson (1925)</h2>
<p>
Learn if you must, but do not come to me<br/>
For truth of what your pleasant neighbor says<br/>
Behind you of your looks or of your ways,<br/>
Or of your worth and virtue generally;<br/>
If he's a pleasure to you, let him be &mdash;<br/>
Being the same to him; and let your days<br/>
Be tranquil, having each the other's praise,<br/>
And each his own opinions peaceably.
</p>
<p>
Two others once did love each other well,<br/>
Yet not so well but that a punguent word<br/>
From each came stinging home to the wrong ears.<br/>
The rest would be an overflow to tell,<br/>
Surely; and you may have slowly inferred<br/>
That you may not be here a thousand years.

<h1>The World</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson</h2>
<p>
Some are the brothers of all humankind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And own them, whatsoever their estate;<br/>
And some, for sorrow and self-scorn, are blind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With enmity for man's unguarded fate.
</p>
<p>
For some there is a music all day long<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like flutes in Paradise, they are so glad;<br/>
And there is hell's eternal under-song<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of curses and the cries of men gone mad.
</p>
<p>
Some say the Scheme with love stands luminous,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say 't were better back to chaos hurled;<br/>
And so 't is what we are that makes for us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The measure and the meaning of the world.
</p>

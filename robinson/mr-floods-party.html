<h1>Mr. Flood's Party</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson (1921)</h2>
<p>
Old Eben Flood, climbing alone one night<br/>
Over the hill between the town below<br/>
And the forsaken upland hermitage<br/>
That held as much as he should ever know<br/>
On earth again of home, paused warily.<br/>
The road was his with not a native near;<br/>
And Eben, having leisure, said aloud,<br/>
For no man else in Tilbury Town to hear:
</p>
<p>
"Well, Mr. Flood, we have the harvest moon<br/>
Again, and we may not have many more;<br/>
The bird is on the wing, the poet says,<br/>
And you and I have said it here before.<br/>
Drink to the bird." He raised up to the light<br/>
The jug that he had gone so far to fill,<br/>
And answered huskily: "Well, Mr. Flood,<br/>
Since you propose it, I believe I will."
</p>
<p>
Alone, as if enduring to the end<br/>
A valiant armor of scarred hopes outworn,<br/>
He stood there in the middle of the road<br/>
Like Roland's ghost winding a silent horn.<br/>
Below him, in the town among the trees,<br/>
Where friends of other days had honored him,<br/>
A phantom salutation of the dead<br/>
Rang thinly till old Eben's eyes were dim.
</p>
<p>
Then, as a mother lays her sleeping child<br/>
Down tenderly, fearing it may awake,<br/>
He set the jug down slowly at his feet<br/>
With trembling care, knowing that most things break;<br/>
And only when assured that on firm earth<br/>
It stood, as the uncertain lives of men<br/>
Assuredly did not, he paced away,<br/>
And with his hand extended paused again:
</p>
<p>
"Well, Mr. Flood, we have not met like this<br/>
In a long time; and many a change has come<br/>
To both of us, I fear, since last it was<br/>
We had a drop together. Welcome home!"<br/>
Convivially returning with himself,<br/>
Again he raised the jug up to the light;<br/>
And with an acquiescent quaver said:<br/>
"Well, Mr. Flood, if you insist, I might.
</p>
<p>
"Only a very little, Mr. Flood &mdash;<br/>
For auld lang syne. No more, sir; that will do."<br/>
So, for the time, apparently it did,<br/>
And Eben evidently thought so too;<br/>
For soon amid the silver loneliness<br/>
Of night he lifted up his voice and sang,<br/>
Secure, with only two moons listening,<br/>
Until the whole harmonious landscape rang &mdash;
</p>
<p>
"For auld lang syne." The weary throat gave out,<br/>
The last word wavered; and the song being done,<br/>
He raised again the jug regretfully<br/>
And shook his head, and was again alone.<br/>
There was not much that was ahead of him,<br/>
And there was nothing in the town below &mdash;<br/>
Where strangers would have shut the many doors<br/>
That many friends had opened long ago.

<h1>Villanelle of Change</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson</h2>
<p>
Since Persia fell at Marathon,<br/>
The yellow years have gathered fast:<br/>
Long centuries have come and gone.
</p>
<p>
And yet (they say) the place will don<br/>
A phantom fury of the past,<br/>
Since Persia fell at Marathon;
</p>
<p>
And as of old, when Helicon<br/>
Trembled and swayed with rapture vast<br/>
(Long centuries have come and gone),
</p>
<p>
This ancient plain, when night comes on,<br/>
Shakes to a ghostly battle-blast,<br/>
Since Persia fell at Marathon.
</p>
<p>
But into soundless Acheron<br/>
The glory of Greek shame was cast:<br/>
Long centuries have come and gone,
</p>
<p>
The suns of Hellas have all shone,<br/>
The first has fallen to the last: &mdash;<br/>
Since Persia fell at Marathon,<br/>
Long centuries have come and gone.

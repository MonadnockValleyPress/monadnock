<h1>Modernities</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson (1921)</h2>
<p>
Small knowledge have we that by knowledge met<br/>
May not some day be quaint as any told<br/>
In almagest or chronicle of old,<br/>
Whereat we smile because we are as yet<br/>
The lastâ€”though not the last who may forget<br/>
What cleavings and abrasions manifold<br/>
Have marked an armor that was never scrolled<br/>
Before for human glory and regret.
</p>
<p>
With infinite unseen enemies in the way<br/>
We have encountered the intangible,<br/>
To vanquish where our fathers, who fought well,<br/>
Scarce had assumed endurance for a day;<br/>
Yet we shall have our darkness, even as they,<br/>
And there shall be another tale to tell.
</p>

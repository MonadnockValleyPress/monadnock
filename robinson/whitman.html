<h1>Walt Whitman</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson (1897)</h2>
<p>
The master-songs are ended, and the man<br/>
That sang them is a name.  And so is God<br/>
A name; and so is love, and life, and death,<br/>
And everything.  But we, who are too blind<br/>
To read what we have written, or what faith<br/>
Has written for us, do not understand:<br/>
We only blink, and wonder.
</p>
<p>
Last night it was the song that was the man,<br/>
But now it is the man that is the song.<br/>
We do not hear him very much to-day:<br/>
His piercing and eternal cadence rings<br/>
Too pure for us &mdash; too powerfully pure,<br/>
Too lovingly triumphant, and too large;<br/>
But there are some that hear him, and they know<br/>
That he shall sing to-morrow for all men,<br/>
And that all time shall listen.
</p>
<p>
The master-songs are ended?  Rather say<br/>
No songs are ended that are ever sung,<br/>
And that no names are dead names.  When we write<br/>
Men's letters on proud marble or on sand,<br/>
We write them there forever.
</p>

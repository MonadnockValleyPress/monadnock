<h1>Vain Gratuities</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson (1921)</h2>
<p>
Never was there a man much uglier<br/>
In eyes of other women, or more grim:<br/>
"The Lord has filled her chalice to the brim,<br/>
So let us pray she's a philosopher,"<br/>
They said; and there was more they said of her &mdash;<br/>
Deeming it, after twenty years with him,<br/>
No wonder that she kept her figure slim<br/>
And always made you think of lavender.
</p>
<p>
But she, demure as ever, and as fair,<br/>
Almost, as they remembered her before<br/>
She found him, would have laughed had she been there,<br/>
And all they said would have been heard no more<br/>
Than foam that washes on an island shore<br/>
Where there are none to listen or to care.

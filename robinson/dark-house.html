<h1>The Dark House</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson</h2>
<p>
Where a faint light shines alone,<br/>
Dwells a Demon I have known.<br/>
Most of you had better say<br/>
"The Dark House", and go your way.<br/>
Do not wonder if I stay.
</p>
<p>
For I know the Demon's eyes,<br/>
And their lure that never dies.<br/>
Banish all your fond alarms,<br/>
For I know the foiling charms<br/>
Of her eyes and of her arms,
</p>
<p>
And I know that in one room<br/>
Burns a lamp as in a tomb;<br/>
And I see the shadow glide,<br/>
Back and forth, of one denied<br/>
Power to find himself outside.
</p>
<p>
There he is who is my friend,<br/>
Damned, he fancies, to the end&mdash;<br/>
Vanquished, ever since a door<br/>
Closed, he thought, for evermore<br/>
On the life that was before.
</p>
<p>
And the friend who knows him best<br/>
Sees him as he sees the rest<br/>
Who are striving to be wise<br/>
While a Demon's arms and eyes<br/>
Hold them as a web would flies.
</p>
<p>
All the words of all the world,<br/>
Aimed together and then hurled,<br/>
Would be stiller in his ears<br/>
Than a closing of still shears<br/>
On a thread made out of years.
</p>
<p>
But there lives another sound,<br/>
More compelling, more profound;<br/>
There's a music, so it seems,<br/>
That assuages and redeems,<br/>
More than reason, more than dreams.
</p>
<p>
There's a music yet unheard<br/>
By the creature of the word,<br/>
Though it matters little more<br/>
Than a wave-wash on a shore&mdash;<br/>
Till a Demon shuts a door.
</p>
<p>
So, if he be very still<br/>
With his Demon, and one will,<br/>
Murmurs of it may be blown<br/>
To my friend who is alone<br/>
In a room that I have known.
</p>
<p>
After that from everywhere<br/>
Singing life will find him there;<br/>
Then the door will open wide,<br/>
And my friend, again outside,<br/>
Will be living, having died.

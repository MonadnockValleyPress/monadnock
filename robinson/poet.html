<h1>Sonnet ("Oh for a Poet")</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson</h2>
<p>
Oh for a poet &mdash; for a beacon bright<br/>
To rift this changeless glimmer of dead gray;<br/>
To spirit back the Muses, long astray,<br/>
And flush Parnassus with a newer light;<br/>
To put these little sonnet-men to flight<br/>
Who fashion, in a shrewd, mechanic way,<br/>
Songs without souls, that flicker for a day,<br/>
To vanish in irrevocable night.
</p>
<p>
What does it mean, this barren age of ours?<br/>
Here are the men, the women, and the flowers,<br/>
The seasons, and the sunset, as before.<br/>
What does it mean?  Shall not one bard arise<br/>
To wrench one banner from the western skies,<br/>
And mark it with his name forevermore?
</p>

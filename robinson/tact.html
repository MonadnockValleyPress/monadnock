<h1>Tact</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson</h2>
<p>
Observant of the way she told<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much of what was true,<br/>
No vanity could long withhold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Regard that was her due:<br/>
She spared him the familiar guile,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So easily achieved,<br/>
That only made a man to smile<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him undeceived.
</p>
<p>
Aware that all imagining<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of more than what she meant<br/>
Would urge an end of everything,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed; and when he went,<br/>
They parted with a merry word<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That was to him as light<br/>
As any that was ever heard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a starry night.
</p>
<p>
She smiled a little, knowing well<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he would not remark<br/>
The ruins of a day that fell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Around her in the dark:<br/>
He saw no ruins anywhere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor fancied there were scars<br/>
On anyone who lingered there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone below the stars.

<h1>Neighbors</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson (1920)</h2>
<p>
As often as we thought of her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We thought of a gray life<br/>
That made a quaint economist<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a wolf-haunted wife;<br/>
We made the best of all she bore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That was not ours to bear,<br/>
And honored her for wearing things<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That were not things to wear.
</p>
<p>
There was a distance in her look<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That made us look again;<br/>
And if she smiled, we might believe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That we had looked in vain.<br/>
Rarely she came inside our doors,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And had not long to stay;<br/>
And when she left, it seemed somehow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That she was far away.
</p>
<p>
At last, when we had all forgot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That all is here to change,<br/>
A shadow on the commonplace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was for a moment strange.<br/>
Yet there was nothing for surprise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor much that need be told:<br/>
Love, with his gift of pain, had given<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one heart could hold.

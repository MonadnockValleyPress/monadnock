<h1>Many Are Called</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson</h2>
<p>
The Lord Apollo, who has never died,<br/>
Still holds alone his immemorial reign,<br/>
Supreme in an impregnable domain<br/>
That with his magic he has fortified;<br/>
And though melodious multitudes have tried<br/>
In ecstasy, in anguish, and in vain,<br/>
With invocation sacred and profane<br/>
To lure him, even the loudest are outside.
</p>
<p>
Only at unconjectured intervals,<br/>
By will of him on whom no man may gaze,<br/>
By word of him whose law no man has read,<br/>
A questing light may rift the sullen walls,<br/>
To cling where mostly its infrequent rays<br/>
Fall golden on the patience of the dead.
</p>

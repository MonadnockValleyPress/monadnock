<h1>A Man in our Town</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson</h2>
<p>
We pitied him as one too much at ease<br/>
With Nemesis and impending indigence;<br/>
Also, as if by the way of recompense,<br/>
We sought him always in extremities;<br/>
And while ways more like our had more to please<br/>
Our common code than his improvidence,<br/>
There lurked alive in our experience<br/>
His homely genius for emergencies
</p>
<p>
He was not one for men to marvel at,<br/>
And yet there was another neighborhood<br/>
When he was gone, and many a thrifty tear.<br/>
There was an increase in a man like that;<br/>
And though he be forgotten, it was good<br/>
For more than one of you that he was here.

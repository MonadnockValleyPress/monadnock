<h1>Monadnock through the Trees</h1>
<h2>by Edwin Arlington Robinson (1921)</h2>
<p>
Before there was in Egypt any sound<br/>
Of those who reared a more prodigious means<br/>
For the self-heavy sleep of kings and queens<br/>
Than hitherto had mocked the most renowned, &mdash;<br/>
Unvisioned here and waiting to be found,<br/>
Alone, amid remote and older scenes,<br/>
You loomed above ancestral evergreens<br/>
Before there were the first of us around.
</p>
<p>
And when the last of us, if we know how,<br/>
See farther from ourselves than we do now,<br/>
Assured with other sight than heretofore<br/>
That we have done our mortal best and worst, &mdash;<br/>
Your calm will be the same as when the first<br/>
Assyrians went howling south to war.

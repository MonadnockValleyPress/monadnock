<h1>Lady Susan</h1>
<h2>by Jane Austen</h2>
<h3>XXXV: Lady Susan to Mr. De Courcy</h3>
<p>Upper Seymour Street.</p>
<p>I will not attempt to describe my astonishment in reading the note this moment received from you. I am bewildered in my endeavours to form some rational conjecture of what Mrs. Mainwaring can have told you to occasion so extraordinary a change in your sentiments. Have I not explained everything to you with respect to myself which could bear a doubtful meaning, and which the ill-nature of the world had interpreted to my discredit? What can you now have heard to stagger your esteem for me? Have I ever had a concealment from you? Reginald, you agitate me beyond expression, I cannot suppose that the old story of Mrs.  Mainwaring's jealousy can be revived again, or at least be <em>listened</em> to again. Come to me immediately, and explain what is at present absolutely incomprehensible. Believe me the single word of Langford is not of such potent intelligence as to supersede the necessity of more. If we <em>are</em> to part, it will at least be handsome to take your personal leave &#151; but I have little heart to jest; in truth, I am serious enough; for to be sunk, though but for an hour, in your esteem is a humiliation to which I know not how to submit. I shall count every minute till your arrival.</p>

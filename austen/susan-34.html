<h1>Lady Susan</h1>
<h2>by Jane Austen</h2>
<h3>XXXIV: Mr. de Courcy to Lady Susan</h3>
<p> &#151; Hotel</p>
<p>I write only to bid you farewell, the spell is removed; I see you as you are. Since we parted yesterday, I have received from indisputable authority such a history of you as must bring the most mortifying conviction of the imposition I have been under, and the absolute necessity of an immediate and eternal separation from you. You cannot doubt to what I allude. Langford! Langford! that word will be sufficient. I received my information in Mr. Johnson's house, from Mrs.  Mainwaring herself. You know how I have loved you; you can intimately judge of my present feelings, but I am not so weak as to find indulgence in describing them to a woman who will glory in having excited their anguish, but whose affection they have never been able to gain.</p>
<p>R. de Courcy.</p>

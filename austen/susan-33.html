<h1>Lady Susan</h1>
<h2>by Jane Austen</h2>
<h3>XXXIII: Lady Susan to Mrs. Johnson</h3>
<p>Upper Seymour Street.</p>
<p>This eclaircissement is rather provoking. How unlucky that you should have been from home! I thought myself sure of you at seven! I am undismayed however. Do not torment yourself with fears on my account; depend on it, I can make my story good with Reginald. Mainwaring is just gone; he brought me the news of his wife's arrival. Silly woman, what does she expect by such manoeuvres? Yet I wish she had stayed quietly at Langford. Reginald will be a little enraged at first, but by to-morrow's dinner, everything will be well again.</p>
<p>Adieu!</p>
<p>S. V.</p>

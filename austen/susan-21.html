<h1>Lady Susan</h1>
<h2>by Jane Austen</h2>
<h3>XXI: Miss Vernon to Mr. De Courcy</h3>
<p>Sir, &#151; I hope you will excuse this liberty; I am forced upon it by the greatest distress, or I should be ashamed to trouble you. I am very miserable about Sir James Martin, and have no other way in the world of helping myself but by writing to you, for I am forbidden even speaking to my uncle and aunt on the subject; and this being the case, I am afraid my applying to you will appear no better than equivocation, and as if I attended to the letter and not the spirit of mamma's commands.  But if you do not take my part and persuade her to break it off, I shall be half distracted, for I cannot bear him. No human being but <em>you</em> could have any chance of prevailing with her. If you will, therefore, have the unspeakably great kindness of taking my part with her, and persuading her to send Sir James away, I shall be more obliged to you than it is possible for me to express. I always disliked him from the first: it is not a sudden fancy, I assure you, sir; I always thought him silly and impertinent and disagreeable, and now he is grown worse than ever. I would rather work for my bread than marry him. I do not know how to apologize enough for this letter; I know it is taking so great a liberty. I am aware how dreadfully angry it will make mamma, but I remember the risk.</p>
<p>I am, Sir, your most humble servant,</p>
<p>F. S. V.</p>

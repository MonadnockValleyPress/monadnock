<h1>Homunculus et La Belle Etoile</h1>
<h2>by Wallace Stevens</h2>
<p>
In the sea, Biscayne, there prinks<br/>
The young emerald, evening star,<br/>
Good light for drunkards, poets, widows,<br/>
And ladies soon to be married.
</p>
<p>
By this light the salty fishes<br/>
Arch in the sea like tree-branches,<br/>
Going in many directions<br/>
Up and down.
</p>
<p>
This light conducts<br/>
The thoughts of drunkards, the feelings<br/>
Of widows and trembling ladies,<br/>
The movements of fishes.
</p>
<p>
How pleasant an existence it is<br/>
That this emerald charms philosophers,<br/>
Until they become thoughtlessly willing<br/>
To bathe their hearts in later moonlight,
</p>
<p>
Knowing that they can bring back thought<br/>
In the night that is still to be silent,<br/>
Reflecting this thing and that,<br/>
Before they sleep!
</p>
<p>
It is better that, as scholars,<br/>
They should think hard in the dark cuffs<br/>
Of voluminous cloaks,<br/>
And shave their heads and bodies.
</p>
<p>
It might well be that their mistress<br/>
Is no gaunt fugitive phantom.<br/>
She might, after all, be a wanton,<br/>
Abundantly beautiful, eager,
</p>
<p>
Fecund,<br/>
From whose being by starlight, on sea-coast,<br/>
The innermost good of their seeking<br/>
Might come in the simplest of speech.
</p>
<p>
It is a good light, then, for those<br/>
That know the ultimate Plato,<br/>
Tranquillizing with this jewel<br/>
The torments of confusion.

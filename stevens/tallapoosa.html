<h1>Stars at Tallapoosa</h1>
<h2>by Wallace Stevens</h2>
<p>
The lines are straight and swift between the stars.<br/>
The night is not the cradle that they cry,<br/>
The criers, undulating the deep-oceaned phrase.<br/>
The lines are much too dark and much too sharp.
</p>
<p>
The mind herein attains simplicity,<br/>
There is no moon, no single, silvered leaf.<br/>
The body is no body to be seen<br/>
But is an eye that studies its black lid.
</p>
<p>
Let these be your delight, secretive hunter,<br/>
Wading the sea-lines, moist and ever-mingling,<br/>
Mounting the earth-lines, long and lax, lethargic.<br/>
These lines are swift and fall without diverging.
</p>
<p>
The melon-flower nor dew nor web of either<br/>
Is like to these. But in yourself is like:<br/>
A sheaf of brilliant arrows flying straight,<br/>
Flying and falling straightway for their pleasure,
</p>
<p>
Their pleasure that is all bright-edged and cold;<br/>
Or, if not arrows, then the nimblest motions,<br/>
Making recoveries of young nakedness<br/>
And the lost vehemence the midnights hold.
</p>

<h1>Anecdote of Men by the Thousand</h1>
<h2>by Wallace Stevens</h2>
<p>
The soul, he said, is composed<br/>
Of the external world.
</p>
<p>
There are men of the East, he said,<br/>
Who are the East.<br/>
There are men of a province<br/>
Who are that province.<br/>
There are men of a valley<br/>
Who are that valley.
</p>
<p>
There are men whose words<br/>
Are as natural sounds<br/>
Of their places<br/>
As the cackle of toucans<br/>
In the place of toucans.
</p>
<p>
The mandoline is the instrument<br/>
Of a place.
</p>
<p>
Are there mandolines of western mountains?<br/>
Are there mandolines of northern moonlight?
</p>
<p>
The dress of a woman of Lhassa,<br/>
In its place,<br/>
Is an invisible element of that place<br/>
Made visible.

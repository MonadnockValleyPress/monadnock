<h1>A High-Toned Old Christian Woman</h1>
<h2>by Wallace Stevens</h2>
<p>
Poetry is the supreme fiction, madame.<br/>
Take the moral law and make a nave of it<br/>
And from the nave build haunted heaven. Thus,<br/>
The conscience is converted into palms,<br/>
Like windy citherns hankering for hymns.<br/>
We agree in principle. Thatâ€™s clear. But take<br/>
The opposing law and make a peristyle,<br/>
And from the peristyle project a masque<br/>
Beyond the planets. Thus, our bawdiness,<br/>
Unpurged by epitaph, indulged at last,<br/>
Is equally converted into palms,<br/>
Squiggling like saxophones. And palm for palm,<br/>
Madame, we are where we began. Allow,<br/>
Therefore, that in the planetary scene<br/>
Your disaffected flagellants, well-stuffed,<br/>
Smacking their muzzy bellies in parade,<br/>
Proud of such novelties of the sublime,<br/>
Such tink and tank and tunk-a-tunk-tunk,<br/>
May, merely may, madame, whip from themselves<br/>
A jovial hullabaloo among the spheres.<br/>
This will make widows wince. But fictive things<br/>
Wink as they will. Wink most when widows wince.

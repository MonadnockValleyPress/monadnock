<h1>Peter Quince at the Clavier</h1>
<h2>by Wallace Stevens</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Just as my fingers on these keys<br/>
Make music, so the self-same sounds<br/>
On my spirit make a music, too.
</p>
<p>
Music is feeling, then, not sound;<br/>
And thus it is that what I feel,<br/>
Here in this room, desiring you,
</p>
<p>
Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk,<br/>
Is music. It is like the strain<br/>
Waked in the elders by Susanna;
</p>
<p>
Of a green evening, clear and warm,<br/>
She bathed in her still garden, while<br/>
The red-eyed elders, watching, felt
</p>
<p>
The basses of their beings throb<br/>
In witching chords, and their thin blood<br/>
Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
In the green water, clear and warm,<br/>
Susanna lay.<br/>
She searched<br/>
The touch of springs,<br/>
And found<br/>
Concealed imaginings.<br/>
She sighed,<br/>
For so much melody.<br/>
Upon the bank, she stood<br/>
In the cool<br/>
Of spent emotions.<br/>
She felt, among the leaves,<br/>
The dew<br/>
Of old devotions.
</p>
<p>
She walked upon the grass,<br/>
Still quavering.<br/>
The winds were like her maids,<br/>
On timid feet,<br/>
Fetching her woven scarves,<br/>
Yet wavering.
</p>
<p>
A breath upon her hand<br/>
Muted the night.<br/>
She turned&mdash;<br/>
A cymbal crashed,<br/>
And roaring horns.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
Soon, with a noise like tambourines,<br/>
Came her attendant Byzantines.
</p>
<p>
They wondered why Susanna cried<br/>
Against the elders by her side;
</p>
<p>
And as they whispered, the refrain<br/>
Was like a willow swept by rain.
</p>
<p>
Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame<br/>
Revealed Susanna and her shame.
</p>
<p>
And then, the simpering Byzantines<br/>
Fled, with a noise like tambourines.
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
Beauty is momentary in the mind&mdash;<br/>
The fitful tracing of a portal;<br/>
But in the flesh it is immortal.
</p>
<p>
The body dies; the body's beauty lives.<br/>
So evenings die, in their green going,<br/>
A wave, interminably flowing.<br/>
So gardens die, their meek breath scenting<br/>
The cowl of winter, done repenting.<br/>
So maidens die, to the auroral<br/>
Celebration of a maiden's choral.
</p>
<p>
Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings<br/>
Of those white elders; but, escaping,<br/>
Left only Death's ironic scraping.<br/>
Now, in its immortality, it plays<br/>
On the clear viol of her memory,<br/>
And makes a constant sacrament of praise.

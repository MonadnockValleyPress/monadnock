<h1>Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird</h1>
<h2>by Wallace Stevens</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Among twenty snowy mountains,<br/>
The only moving thing<br/>
Was the eye of the black bird.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
I was of three minds,<br/>
Like a tree<br/>
In which there are three blackbirds.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.<br/>
It was a small part of the pantomime.
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
A man and a woman<br/>
Are one.<br/>
A man and a woman and a blackbird<br/>
Are one.
</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>
I do not know which to prefer,<br/>
The beauty of inflections<br/>
Or the beauty of innuendoes,<br/>
The blackbird whistling<br/>
Or just after.
</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>
Icicles filled the long window<br/>
With barbaric glass.<br/>
The shadow of the blackbird<br/>
Crossed it, to and fro.<br/>
The mood<br/>
Traced in the shadow<br/>
An indecipherable cause.
</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p>
O thin men of Haddam,<br/>
Why do you imagine golden birds?<br/>
Do you not see how the blackbird<br/>
Walks around the feet<br/>
Of the women about you?
</p>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<p>
I know noble accents<br/>
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;<br/>
But I know, too,<br/>
That the blackbird is involved<br/>
In what I know.
</p>
<h3>IX</h3>
<p>
When the blackbird flew out of sight,<br/>
It marked the edge<br/>
Of one of many circles.
</p>
<h3>X</h3>
<p>
At the sight of blackbirds<br/>
Flying in a green light,<br/>
Even the bawds of euphony<br/>
Would cry out sharply.
</p>
<h3>XI</h3>
<p>
He rode over Connecticut<br/>
In a glass coach.<br/>
Once, a fear pierced him,<br/>
In that he mistook<br/>
The shadow of his equipage<br/>
For blackbirds.
</p>
<h3>XII</h3>
<p>
The river is moving.<br/>
The blackbird must be flying.
</p>
<h3>XIII</h3>
<p>
It was evening all afternoon.<br/>
It was snowing<br/>
And it was going to snow.<br/>
The blackbird sat<br/>
In the cedar-limbs.

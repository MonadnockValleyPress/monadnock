<h1>Tea at the Palaz of Hoon</h1>
<h2>by Wallace Stevens</h2>
<p>
Not less because in purple I descended<br/>
The western day through what you called<br/>
The loneliest air, not less was I myself.
</p>
<p>
What was the ointment sprinkled on my beard?<br/>
What were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears?<br/>
What was the sea whose tide swept through me there?
</p>
<p>
Out of my mind the golden ointment rained,<br/>
And my ears made the blowing hymns they heard.<br/>
I was myself the compass of that sea:
</p>
<p>
I was the world in which I walked, and what I saw<br/>
Or heard or felt came not but from myself;<br/>
And there I found myself more truly and more strange.

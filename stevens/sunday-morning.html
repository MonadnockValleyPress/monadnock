<h1>Sunday Morning</h1>
<h2>by Wallace Stevens</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Complacencies of the peignoir, and late<br/>
Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,<br/>
And the green freedom of a cockatoo<br/>
Upon a rug mingle to dissipate<br/>
The holy hush of ancient sacrifice.<br/>
She dreams a little, and she feels the dark<br/>
Encroachment of that old catastrophe,<br/>
As a calm darkens among water-lights.<br/>
The pungent oranges and bright, green wings<br/>
Seem things in some procession of the dead,<br/>
Winding across wide water, without sound.<br/>
The day is like wide water, without sound,<br/>
Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet<br/>
Over the seas, to silent Palestine,<br/>
Dominion of the blood and sepulchre.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
Why should she give her bounty to the dead?<br/>
What is divinity if it can come<br/>
Only in silent shadows and in dreams?<br/>
Shall she not find in comforts of the sun,<br/>
In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else<br/>
In any balm or beauty of the earth,<br/>
Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven?<br/>
Divinity must live within herself:<br/>
Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;<br/>
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued<br/>
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty<br/>
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights;<br/>
All pleasures and all pains, remembering<br/>
The bough of summer and the winter branch.<br/>
These are the measures destined for her soul.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth.<br/>
No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave<br/>
Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind.<br/>
He moved among us, as a muttering king,<br/>
Magnificent, would move among his hinds,<br/>
Until our blood, commingling, virginal,<br/>
With heaven, brought such requital to desire<br/>
The very hinds discerned it, in a star.<br/>
Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be<br/>
The blood of paradise? And shall the earth<br/>
Seem all of paradise that we shall know?<br/>
The sky will be much friendlier then than now,<br/>
A part of labor and a part of pain,<br/>
And next in glory to enduring love,<br/>
Not this dividing and indifferent blue.
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
She says, "I am content when wakened birds,<br/>
Before they fly, test the reality<br/>
Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings;<br/>
But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields<br/>
Return no more, where, then, is paradise?"<br/>
There is not any haunt of prophesy,<br/>
Nor any old chimera of the grave,<br/>
Neither the golden underground, nor isle<br/>
Melodious, where spirits gat them home,<br/>
Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm<br/>
Remote on heaven's hill, that has endured<br/>
As April's green endures; or will endure<br/>
Like her remembrance of awakened birds,<br/>
Or her desire for June and evening, tipped<br/>
By the consummation of the swallow's wings.
</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>
She says, "But in contentment I still feel<br/>
The need of some imperishable bliss."<br/>
Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her,<br/>
Alone, shall come fulfilment to our dreams<br/>
And our desires. Although she strews the leaves<br/>
Of sure obliteration on our paths,<br/>
The path sick sorrow took, the many paths<br/>
Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love<br/>
Whispered a little out of tenderness,<br/>
She makes the willow shiver in the sun<br/>
For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze<br/>
Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet.<br/>
She causes boys to pile new plums and pears<br/>
On disregarded plate. The maidens taste<br/>
And stray impassioned in the littering leaves.
</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>
Is there no change of death in paradise?<br/>
Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs<br/>
Hang always heavy in that perfect sky,<br/>
Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth,<br/>
With rivers like our own that seek for seas<br/>
They never find, the same receding shores<br/>
That never touch with inarticulate pang?<br/>
Why set the pear upon those river-banks<br/>
Or spice the shores with odors of the plum?<br/>
Alas, that they should wear our colors there,<br/>
The silken weavings of our afternoons,<br/>
And pick the strings of our insipid lutes!<br/>
Death is the mother of beauty, mystical,<br/>
Within whose burning bosom we devise<br/>
Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly.
</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p>
Supple and turbulent, a ring of men<br/>
Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn<br/>
Their boisterous devotion to the sun,<br/>
Not as a god, but as a god might be,<br/>
Naked among them, like a savage source.<br/>
Their chant shall be a chant of paradise,<br/>
Out of their blood, returning to the sky;<br/>
And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice,<br/>
The windy lake wherein their lord delights,<br/>
The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills,<br/>
That choir among themselves long afterward.<br/>
They shall know well the heavenly fellowship<br/>
Of men that perish and of summer morn.<br/>
And whence they came and whither they shall go<br/>
The dew upon their feet shall manifest.
</p>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<p>
She hears, upon that water without sound,<br/>
A voice that cries, "The tomb in Palestine<br/>
Is not the porch of spirits lingering.<br/>
It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay."<br/>
We live in an old chaos of the sun,<br/>
Or old dependency of day and night,<br/>
Or island solitude, unsponsored, free,<br/>
Of that wide water, inescapable.<br/>
Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail<br/>
Whistle about us their spontaneous cries;<br/>
Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness;<br/>
And, in the isolation of the sky,<br/>
At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make<br/>
Ambiguous undulations as they sink,<br/>
Downward to darkness, on extended wings.

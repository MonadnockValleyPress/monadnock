<h1>Six Significant Landscapes</h1>
<h2>by Wallace Stevens</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
An old man sits<br/>
In the shadow of a pine tree<br/>
In China.<br/>
He sees larkspur,<br/>
Blue and white,<br/>
At the edge of the shadow,<br/>
Move in the wind.<br/>
His beard moves in the wind.<br/>
The pine tree moves in the wind.<br/>
Thus water flows<br/>
Over weeds.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
The night is of the color<br/>
Of a woman's arm:<br/>
Night, the female,<br/>
Obscure,<br/>
Fragrant and supple,<br/>
Conceals herself.<br/>
A pool shines,<br/>
Like a bracelet<br/>
Shaken in a dance.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
I measure myself<br/>
Against a tall tree.<br/>
I find that I am much taller,<br/>
For I reach right up to the sun,<br/>
With my eye;<br/>
And I reach to the shore of the sea<br/>
With my ear.<br/>
Nevertheless, I dislike<br/>
The way the ants crawl<br/>
In and out of my shadow.
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
When my dream was near the moon,<br/>
The white folds of its gown<br/>
Filled with yellow light.<br/>
The soles of its feet<br/>
Grew red.<br/>
Its hair filled<br/>
With certain blue crystallizations<br/>
From stars,<br/>
Not far off.
</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>
Not all the knives of the lamp-posts,<br/>
Nor the chisels of the long streets,<br/>
Nor the mallets of the domes<br/>
And high towers,<br/>
Can carve<br/>
What one star can carve,<br/>
Shining through the grape-leaves.
</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>
Rationalists, wearing square hats,<br/>
Think, in square rooms,<br/>
Looking at the floor,<br/>
Looking at the ceiling.<br/>
They confine themselves<br/>
To right-angled triangles.<br/>
If they tried rhomboids,<br/>
Cones, waving lines, ellipses&mdash;<br/>
As for example, the ellipse of the half-moon&mdash;<br/>
Rationalists would wear sombreros.

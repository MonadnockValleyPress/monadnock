<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto IX</h3>
<p>That hue which cowardice brought out on me,<br/>
    Beholding my Conductor backward turn,<br/>
    Sooner repressed within him his new colour.</p>
<p>He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,<br/>
    Because the eye could not conduct him far<br/>
    Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.</p>
<p>"Still it behoveth us to win the fight,"<br/>
    Began he; "Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .<br/>
    O how I long that some one here arrive!"</p>
<p>Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning<br/>
    He covered up with what came afterward,<br/>
    That they were words quite different from the first;</p>
<p>But none the less his saying gave me fear,<br/>
    Because I carried out the broken phrase,<br/>
    Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.</p>
<p>"Into this bottom of the doleful conch<br/>
    Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,<br/>
    Which for its pain has only hope cut off?"</p>
<p>This question put I; and he answered me:<br/>
    "Seldom it comes to pass that one of us<br/>
    Maketh the journey upon which I go.</p>
<p>True is it, once before I here below<br/>
    Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,<br/>
    Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.</p>
<p>Naked of me short while the flesh had been,<br/>
    Before within that wall she made me enter,<br/>
    To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;</p>
<p>That is the lowest region and the darkest,<br/>
    And farthest from the heaven which circles all.<br/>
    Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.</p>
<p>This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,<br/>
    Encompasses about the city dolent,<br/>
    Where now we cannot enter without anger."</p>
<p>And more he said, but not in mind I have it;<br/>
    Because mine eye had altogether drawn me<br/>
    Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,</p>
<p>Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen<br/>
    The three infernal Furies stained with blood,<br/>
    Who had the limbs of women and their mien,</p>
<p>And with the greenest hydras were begirt;<br/>
    Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,<br/>
    Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.</p>
<p>And he who well the handmaids of the Queen<br/>
    Of everlasting lamentation knew,<br/>
    Said unto me: "Behold the fierce Erinnys.</p>
<p>This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;<br/>
    She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;<br/>
    Tisiphone is between;" and then was silent.</p>
<p>Each one her breast was rending with her nails;<br/>
    They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,<br/>
    That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.</p>
<p>"Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!"<br/>
    All shouted looking down; "in evil hour<br/>
    Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!"</p>
<p>"Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,<br/>
    For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,<br/>
    No more returning upward would there be."</p>
<p>Thus said the Master; and he turned me round<br/>
    Himself, and trusted not unto my hands<br/>
    So far as not to blind me with his own.</p>
<p>O ye who have undistempered intellects,<br/>
    Observe the doctrine that conceals itself<br/>
    Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!</p>
<p>And now there came across the turbid waves<br/>
    The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,<br/>
    Because of which both of the margins trembled;</p>
<p>Not otherwise it was than of a wind<br/>
    Impetuous on account of adverse heats,<br/>
    That smites the forest, and, without restraint,</p>
<p>The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;<br/>
    Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,<br/>
    And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.</p>
<p>Mine eyes he loosed, and said: "Direct the nerve<br/>
    Of vision now along that ancient foam,<br/>
    There yonder where that smoke is most intense."</p>
<p>Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent<br/>
    Across the water scatter all abroad,<br/>
    Until each one is huddled in the earth.</p>
<p>More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,<br/>
    Thus fleeing from before one who on foot<br/>
    Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.</p>
<p>From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,<br/>
    Waving his left hand oft in front of him,<br/>
    And only with that anguish seemed he weary.</p>
<p>Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,<br/>
    And to the Master turned; and he made sign<br/>
    That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.</p>
<p>Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!<br/>
    He reached the gate, and with a little rod<br/>
    He opened it, for there was no resistance.</p>
<p>"O banished out of Heaven, people despised!"<br/>
    Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;<br/>
    "Whence is this arrogance within you couched?</p>
<p>Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,<br/>
    From which the end can never be cut off,<br/>
    And which has many times increased your pain?</p>
<p>What helpeth it to butt against the fates?<br/>
    Your Cerberus, if you remember well,<br/>
    For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled."</p>
<p>Then he returned along the miry road,<br/>
    And spake no word to us, but had the look<br/>
    Of one whom other care constrains and goads</p>
<p>Than that of him who in his presence is;<br/>
    And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,<br/>
    After those holy words all confident.</p>
<p>Within we entered without any contest;<br/>
    And I, who inclination had to see<br/>
    What the condition such a fortress holds,</p>
<p>Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,<br/>
    And see on every hand an ample plain,<br/>
    Full of distress and torment terrible.</p>
<p>Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,<br/>
    Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,<br/>
    That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,</p>
<p>The sepulchres make all the place uneven;<br/>
    So likewise did they there on every side,<br/>
    Saving that there the manner was more bitter;</p>
<p>For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,<br/>
    By which they so intensely heated were,<br/>
    That iron more so asks not any art.</p>
<p>All of their coverings uplifted were,<br/>
    And from them issued forth such dire laments,<br/>
    Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.</p>
<p>And I: "My Master, what are all those people<br/>
    Who, having sepulture within those tombs,<br/>
    Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "Here are the Heresiarchs,<br/>
    With their disciples of all sects, and much<br/>
    More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.</p>
<p>Here like together with its like is buried;<br/>
    And more and less the monuments are heated."<br/>
    And when he to the right had turned, we passed</p>
<p>Between the torments and high parapets.</p>

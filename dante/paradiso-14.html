<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XIV</h3>
<p>From centre unto rim, from rim to centre,<br/>
    In a round vase the water moves itself,<br/>
    As from without 'tis struck or from within.</p>
<p>Into my mind upon a sudden dropped<br/>
    What I am saying, at the moment when<br/>
    Silent became the glorious life of Thomas,</p>
<p>Because of the resemblance that was born<br/>
    Of his discourse and that of Beatrice,<br/>
    Whom, after him, it pleased thus to begin:</p>
<p>"This man has need (and does not tell you so,<br/>
    Nor with the voice, nor even in his thought)<br/>
    Of going to the root of one truth more.</p>
<p>Declare unto him if the light wherewith<br/>
    Blossoms your substance shall remain with you<br/>
    Eternally the same that it is now;</p>
<p>And if it do remain, say in what manner,<br/>
    After ye are again made visible,<br/>
    It can be that it injure not your sight."</p>
<p>As by a greater gladness urged and drawn<br/>
    They who are dancing in a ring sometimes<br/>
    Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;</p>
<p>So, at that orison devout and prompt,<br/>
    The holy circles a new joy displayed<br/>
    In their revolving and their wondrous song.</p>
<p>Whoso lamenteth him that here we die<br/>
    That we may live above, has never there<br/>
    Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain.</p>
<p>The One and Two and Three who ever liveth,<br/>
    And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,<br/>
    Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,</p>
<p>Three several times was chanted by each one<br/>
    Among those spirits, with such melody<br/>
    That for all merit it were just reward;</p>
<p>And, in the lustre most divine of all<br/>
    The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,<br/>
    Such as perhaps the Angel's was to Mary,</p>
<p>Answer: "As long as the festivity<br/>
    Of Paradise shall be, so long our love<br/>
    Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.</p>
<p>Its brightness is proportioned to the ardour,<br/>
    The ardour to the vision; and the vision<br/>
    Equals what grace it has above its worth.</p>
<p>When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh<br/>
    Is reassumed, then shall our persons be<br/>
    More pleasing by their being all complete;</p>
<p>For will increase whate'er bestows on us<br/>
    Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,<br/>
    Light which enables us to look on Him;</p>
<p>Therefore the vision must perforce increase,<br/>
    Increase the ardour which from that is kindled,<br/>
    Increase the radiance which from this proceeds.</p>
<p>But even as a coal that sends forth flame,<br/>
    And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it<br/>
    So that its own appearance it maintains,</p>
<p>Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now<br/>
    Shall be o'erpowered in aspect by the flesh,<br/>
    Which still to-day the earth doth cover up;</p>
<p>Nor can so great a splendour weary us,<br/>
    For strong will be the organs of the body<br/>
    To everything which hath the power to please us."</p>
<p>So sudden and alert appeared to me<br/>
    Both one and the other choir to say Amen,<br/>
    That well they showed desire for their dead bodies;</p>
<p>Nor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,<br/>
    The fathers, and the rest who had been dear<br/>
    Or ever they became eternal flames.</p>
<p>And lo! all round about of equal brightness<br/>
    Arose a lustre over what was there,<br/>
    Like an horizon that is clearing up.</p>
<p>And as at rise of early eve begin<br/>
    Along the welkin new appearances,<br/>
    So that the sight seems real and unreal,</p>
<p>It seemed to me that new subsistences<br/>
    Began there to be seen, and make a circle<br/>
    Outside the other two circumferences.</p>
<p>O very sparkling of the Holy Spirit,<br/>
    How sudden and incandescent it became<br/>
    Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not!</p>
<p>But Beatrice so beautiful and smiling<br/>
    Appeared to me, that with the other sights<br/>
    That followed not my memory I must leave her.</p>
<p>Then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed<br/>
    The power, and I beheld myself translated<br/>
    To higher salvation with my Lady only.</p>
<p>Well was I ware that I was more uplifted<br/>
    By the enkindled smiling of the star,<br/>
    That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont.</p>
<p>With all my heart, and in that dialect<br/>
    Which is the same in all, such holocaust<br/>
    To God I made as the new grace beseemed;</p>
<p>And not yet from my bosom was exhausted<br/>
    The ardour of sacrifice, before I knew<br/>
    This offering was accepted and auspicious;</p>
<p>For with so great a lustre and so red<br/>
    Splendours appeared to me in twofold rays,<br/>
    I said: "O Helios who dost so adorn them!"</p>
<p>Even as distinct with less and greater lights<br/>
    Glimmers between the two poles of the world<br/>
    The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt,</p>
<p>Thus constellated in the depths of Mars,<br/>
    Those rays described the venerable sign<br/>
    That quadrants joining in a circle make.</p>
<p>Here doth my memory overcome my genius;<br/>
    For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ,<br/>
    So that I cannot find ensample worthy;</p>
<p>But he who takes his cross and follows Christ<br/>
    Again will pardon me what I omit,<br/>
    Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ.</p>
<p>From horn to horn, and 'twixt the top and base,<br/>
    Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating<br/>
    As they together met and passed each other;</p>
<p>Thus level and aslant and swift and slow<br/>
    We here behold, renewing still the sight,<br/>
    The particles of bodies long and short,</p>
<p>Across the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed<br/>
    Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence<br/>
    People with cunning and with art contrive.</p>
<p>And as a lute and harp, accordant strung<br/>
    With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make<br/>
    To him by whom the notes are not distinguished,</p>
<p>So from the lights that there to me appeared<br/>
    Upgathered through the cross a melody,<br/>
    Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn.</p>
<p>Well was I ware it was of lofty laud,<br/>
    Because there came to me, "Arise and conquer!"<br/>
    As unto him who hears and comprehends not.</p>
<p>So much enamoured I became therewith,<br/>
    That until then there was not anything<br/>
    That e'er had fettered me with such sweet bonds.</p>
<p>Perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold,<br/>
    Postponing the delight of those fair eyes,<br/>
    Into which gazing my desire has rest;</p>
<p>But who bethinks him that the living seals<br/>
    Of every beauty grow in power ascending,<br/>
    And that I there had not turned round to those,</p>
<p>Can me excuse, if I myself accuse<br/>
    To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly:<br/>
    For here the holy joy is not disclosed,</p>
<p>Because ascending it becomes more pure.</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXX</h3>
<p>'Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,<br/>
    For Semele, against the Theban blood,<br/>
    As she already more than once had shown,</p>
<p>So reft of reason Athamas became,<br/>
    That, seeing his own wife with children twain<br/>
    Walking encumbered upon either hand,</p>
<p>He cried: "Spread out the nets, that I may take<br/>
    The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;"<br/>
    And then extended his unpitying claws,</p>
<p>Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,<br/>
    And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;<br/>
    And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;&mdash;</p>
<p>And at the time when fortune downward hurled<br/>
    The Trojan's arrogance, that all things dared,<br/>
    So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,</p>
<p>Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,<br/>
    When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,<br/>
    And of her Polydorus on the shore</p>
<p>Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,<br/>
    Out of her senses like a dog she barked,<br/>
    So much the anguish had her mind distorted;</p>
<p>But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan<br/>
    Were ever seen in any one so cruel<br/>
    In goading beasts, and much more human members,</p>
<p>As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,<br/>
    Who, biting, in the manner ran along<br/>
    That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.</p>
<p>One to Capocchio came, and by the nape<br/>
    Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging<br/>
    It made his belly grate the solid bottom.</p>
<p>And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,<br/>
    Said to me: "That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,<br/>
    And raving goes thus harrying other people."</p>
<p>"O," said I to him, "so may not the other<br/>
    Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee<br/>
    To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence."</p>
<p>And he to me: "That is the ancient ghost<br/>
    Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became<br/>
    Beyond all rightful love her father's lover.</p>
<p>She came to sin with him after this manner,<br/>
    By counterfeiting of another's form;<br/>
    As he who goeth yonder undertook,</p>
<p>That he might gain the lady of the herd,<br/>
    To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,<br/>
    Making a will and giving it due form."</p>
<p>And after the two maniacs had passed<br/>
    On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back<br/>
    To look upon the other evil-born.</p>
<p>I saw one made in fashion of a lute,<br/>
    If he had only had the groin cut off<br/>
    Just at the point at which a man is forked.</p>
<p>The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions<br/>
    The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,<br/>
    That the face corresponds not to the belly,</p>
<p>Compelled him so to hold his lips apart<br/>
    As does the hectic, who because of thirst<br/>
    One tow'rds the chin, the other upward turns.</p>
<p>"O ye, who without any torment are,<br/>
    And why I know not, in the world of woe,"<br/>
    He said to us, "behold, and be attentive</p>
<p>Unto the misery of Master Adam;<br/>
    I had while living much of what I wished,<br/>
    And now, alas! a drop of water crave.</p>
<p>The rivulets, that from the verdant hills<br/>
    Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,<br/>
    Making their channels to be cold and moist,</p>
<p>Ever before me stand, and not in vain;<br/>
    For far more doth their image dry me up<br/>
    Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.</p>
<p>The rigid justice that chastises me<br/>
    Draweth occasion from the place in which<br/>
    I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.</p>
<p>There is Romena, where I counterfeited<br/>
    The currency imprinted with the Baptist,<br/>
    For which I left my body burned above.</p>
<p>But if I here could see the tristful soul<br/>
    Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,<br/>
    For Branda's fount I would not give the sight.</p>
<p>One is within already, if the raving<br/>
    Shades that are going round about speak truth;<br/>
    But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?</p>
<p>If I were only still so light, that in<br/>
    A hundred years I could advance one inch,<br/>
    I had already started on the way,</p>
<p>Seeking him out among this squalid folk,<br/>
    Although the circuit be eleven miles,<br/>
    And be not less than half a mile across.</p>
<p>For them am I in such a family;<br/>
    They did induce me into coining florins,<br/>
    Which had three carats of impurity."</p>
<p>And I to him: "Who are the two poor wretches<br/>
    That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,<br/>
    Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?"</p>
<p>"I found them here," replied he, "when I rained<br/>
    Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,<br/>
    Nor do I think they will for evermore.</p>
<p>One the false woman is who accused Joseph,<br/>
    The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;<br/>
    From acute fever they send forth such reek."</p>
<p>And one of them, who felt himself annoyed<br/>
    At being, peradventure, named so darkly,<br/>
    Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.</p>
<p>It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;<br/>
    And Master Adam smote him in the face,<br/>
    With arm that did not seem to be less hard,</p>
<p>Saying to him: "Although be taken from me<br/>
    All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,<br/>
    I have an arm unfettered for such need."</p>
<p>Whereat he answer made: "When thou didst go<br/>
    Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:<br/>
    But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining."</p>
<p>The dropsical: "Thou sayest true in that;<br/>
    But thou wast not so true a witness there,<br/>
    Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy."</p>
<p>"If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,"<br/>
    Said Sinon; "and for one fault I am here,<br/>
    And thou for more than any other demon."</p>
<p>"Remember, perjurer, about the horse,"<br/>
    He made reply who had the swollen belly,<br/>
    "And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it."</p>
<p>"Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks<br/>
    Thy tongue," the Greek said, "and the putrid water<br/>
    That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes."</p>
<p>Then the false-coiner: "So is gaping wide<br/>
    Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont;<br/>
    Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me</p>
<p>Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,<br/>
    And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus<br/>
    Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee."</p>
<p>In listening to them was I wholly fixed,<br/>
    When said the Master to me: "Now just look,<br/>
    For little wants it that I quarrel with thee."</p>
<p>When him I heard in anger speak to me,<br/>
    I turned me round towards him with such shame<br/>
    That still it eddies through my memory.</p>
<p>And as he is who dreams of his own harm,<br/>
    Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,<br/>
    So that he craves what is, as if it were not;</p>
<p>Such I became, not having power to speak,<br/>
    For to excuse myself I wished, and still<br/>
    Excused myself, and did not think I did it.</p>
<p>"Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,"<br/>
    The Master said, "than this of thine has been;<br/>
    Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,</p>
<p>And make account that I am aye beside thee,<br/>
    If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee<br/>
    Where there are people in a like dispute;</p>
<p>For a base wish it is to wish to hear it."</p>

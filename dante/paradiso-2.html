<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto II</h3>
<p>O Ye, who in some pretty little boat,<br/>
    Eager to listen, have been following<br/>
    Behind my ship, that singing sails along,</p>
<p>Turn back to look again upon your shores;<br/>
    Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,<br/>
    In losing me, you might yourselves be lost.</p>
<p>The sea I sail has never yet been passed;<br/>
    Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,<br/>
    And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.</p>
<p>Ye other few who have the neck uplifted<br/>
    Betimes to th' bread of Angels upon which<br/>
    One liveth here and grows not sated by it,</p>
<p>Well may you launch upon the deep salt-sea<br/>
    Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you<br/>
    Upon the water that grows smooth again.</p>
<p>Those glorious ones who unto Colchos passed<br/>
    Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,<br/>
    When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!</p>
<p>The con-created and perpetual thirst<br/>
    For the realm deiform did bear us on,<br/>
    As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.</p>
<p>Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;<br/>
    And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt<br/>
    And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,</p>
<p>Arrived I saw me where a wondrous thing<br/>
    Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she<br/>
    From whom no care of mine could be concealed,</p>
<p>Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful,<br/>
    Said unto me: "Fix gratefully thy mind<br/>
    On God, who unto the first star has brought us."</p>
<p>It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,<br/>
    Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright<br/>
    As adamant on which the sun is striking.</p>
<p>Into itself did the eternal pearl<br/>
    Receive us, even as water doth receive<br/>
    A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.</p>
<p>If I was body, (and we here conceive not<br/>
    How one dimension tolerates another,<br/>
    Which needs must be if body enter body,)</p>
<p>More the desire should be enkindled in us<br/>
    That essence to behold, wherein is seen<br/>
    How God and our own nature were united.</p>
<p>There will be seen what we receive by faith,<br/>
    Not demonstrated, but self-evident<br/>
    In guise of the first truth that man believes.</p>
<p>I made reply: "Madonna, as devoutly<br/>
    As most I can do I give thanks to Him<br/>
    Who has removed me from the mortal world.</p>
<p>But tell me what the dusky spots may be<br/>
    Upon this body, which below on earth<br/>
    Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?"</p>
<p>Somewhat she smiled; and then, "If the opinion<br/>
    Of mortals be erroneous," she said,<br/>
    "Where'er the key of sense doth not unlock,</p>
<p>Certes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee<br/>
    Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,<br/>
    Thou seest that the reason has short wings.</p>
<p>But tell me what thou think'st of it thyself."<br/>
    And I: "What seems to us up here diverse,<br/>
    Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense."</p>
<p>And she: "Right truly shalt thou see immersed<br/>
    In error thy belief, if well thou hearest<br/>
    The argument that I shall make against it.</p>
<p>Lights many the eighth sphere displays to you<br/>
    Which in their quality and quantity<br/>
    May noted be of aspects different.</p>
<p>If this were caused by rare and dense alone,<br/>
    One only virtue would there be in all<br/>
    Or more or less diffused, or equally.</p>
<p>Virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits<br/>
    Of formal principles; and these, save one,<br/>
    Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.</p>
<p>Besides, if rarity were of this dimness<br/>
    The cause thou askest, either through and through<br/>
    This planet thus attenuate were of matter,</p>
<p>Or else, as in a body is apportioned<br/>
    The fat and lean, so in like manner this<br/>
    Would in its volume interchange the leaves.</p>
<p>Were it the former, in the sun's eclipse<br/>
    It would be manifest by the shining through<br/>
    Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.</p>
<p>This is not so; hence we must scan the other,<br/>
    And if it chance the other I demolish,<br/>
    Then falsified will thy opinion be.</p>
<p>But if this rarity go not through and through,<br/>
    There needs must be a limit, beyond which<br/>
    Its contrary prevents the further passing,</p>
<p>And thence the foreign radiance is reflected,<br/>
    Even as a colour cometh back from glass,<br/>
    The which behind itself concealeth lead.</p>
<p>Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself<br/>
    More dimly there than in the other parts,<br/>
    By being there reflected farther back.</p>
<p>From this reply experiment will free thee<br/>
    If e'er thou try it, which is wont to be<br/>
    The fountain to the rivers of your arts.</p>
<p>Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove<br/>
    Alike from thee, the other more remote<br/>
    Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.</p>
<p>Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back<br/>
    Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors<br/>
    And coming back to thee by all reflected.</p>
<p>Though in its quantity be not so ample<br/>
    The image most remote, there shalt thou see<br/>
    How it perforce is equally resplendent.</p>
<p>Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays<br/>
    Naked the subject of the snow remains<br/>
    Both of its former colour and its cold,</p>
<p>Thee thus remaining in thy intellect,<br/>
    Will I inform with such a living light,<br/>
    That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.</p>
<p>Within the heaven of the divine repose<br/>
    Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies<br/>
    The being of whatever it contains.</p>
<p>The following heaven, that has so many eyes,<br/>
    Divides this being by essences diverse,<br/>
    Distinguished from it, and by it contained.</p>
<p>The other spheres, by various differences,<br/>
    All the distinctions which they have within them<br/>
    Dispose unto their ends and their effects.</p>
<p>Thus do these organs of the world proceed,<br/>
    As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;<br/>
    Since from above they take, and act beneath.</p>
<p>Observe me well, how through this place I come<br/>
    Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter<br/>
    Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford</p>
<p>The power and motion of the holy spheres,<br/>
    As from the artisan the hammer's craft,<br/>
    Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.</p>
<p>The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,<br/>
    From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,<br/>
    The image takes, and makes of it a seal.</p>
<p>And even as the soul within your dust<br/>
    Through members different and accommodated<br/>
    To faculties diverse expands itself,</p>
<p>So likewise this Intelligence diffuses<br/>
    Its virtue multiplied among the stars.<br/>
    Itself revolving on its unity.</p>
<p>Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage<br/>
    Make with the precious body that it quickens,<br/>
    In which, as life in you, it is combined.</p>
<p>From the glad nature whence it is derived,<br/>
    The mingled virtue through the body shines,<br/>
    Even as gladness through the living pupil.</p>
<p>From this proceeds whate'er from light to light<br/>
    Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:<br/>
    This is the formal principle that produces,</p>
<p>According to its goodness, dark and bright."</p>

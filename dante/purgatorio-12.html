<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XII</h3>
<p>Abreast, like oxen going in a yoke,<br/>
    I with that heavy-laden soul went on,<br/>
    As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted;</p>
<p>But when he said, "Leave him, and onward pass,<br/>
    For here 'tis good that with the sail and oars,<br/>
    As much as may be, each push on his barque;"</p>
<p>Upright, as walking wills it, I redressed<br/>
    My person, notwithstanding that my thoughts<br/>
    Remained within me downcast and abashed.</p>
<p>I had moved on, and followed willingly<br/>
    The footsteps of my Master, and we both<br/>
    Already showed how light of foot we were,</p>
<p>When unto me he said: "Cast down thine eyes;<br/>
    'Twere well for thee, to alleviate the way,<br/>
    To look upon the bed beneath thy feet."</p>
<p>As, that some memory may exist of them,<br/>
    Above the buried dead their tombs in earth<br/>
    Bear sculptured on them what they were before;</p>
<p>Whence often there we weep for them afresh,<br/>
    From pricking of remembrance, which alone<br/>
    To the compassionate doth set its spur;</p>
<p>So saw I there, but of a better semblance<br/>
    In point of artifice, with figures covered<br/>
    Whate'er as pathway from the mount projects.</p>
<p>I saw that one who was created noble<br/>
    More than all other creatures, down from heaven<br/>
    Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side.</p>
<p>I saw Briareus smitten by the dart<br/>
    Celestial, lying on the other side,<br/>
    Heavy upon the earth by mortal frost.</p>
<p>I saw Thymbraeus, Pallas saw, and Mars,<br/>
    Still clad in armour round about their father,<br/>
    Gaze at the scattered members of the giants.</p>
<p>I saw, at foot of his great labour, Nimrod,<br/>
    As if bewildered, looking at the people<br/>
    Who had been proud with him in Sennaar.</p>
<p>O Niobe! with what afflicted eyes<br/>
    Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced,<br/>
    Between thy seven and seven children slain!</p>
<p>O Saul! how fallen upon thy proper sword<br/>
    Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa,<br/>
    That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!</p>
<p>O mad Arachne! so I thee beheld<br/>
    E'en then half spider, sad upon the shreds<br/>
    Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee!</p>
<p>O Rehoboam! no more seems to threaten<br/>
    Thine image there; but full of consternation<br/>
    A chariot bears it off, when none pursues!</p>
<p>Displayed moreo'er the adamantine pavement<br/>
    How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon<br/>
    Costly appear the luckless ornament;</p>
<p>Displayed how his own sons did throw themselves<br/>
    Upon Sennacherib within the temple,<br/>
    And how, he being dead, they left him there;</p>
<p>Displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage<br/>
    That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,<br/>
    "Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!"</p>
<p>Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians<br/>
    After that Holofernes had been slain,<br/>
    And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.</p>
<p>I saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns;<br/>
    O Ilion! thee, how abject and debased,<br/>
    Displayed the image that is there discerned!</p>
<p>Whoe'er of pencil master was or stile,<br/>
    That could portray the shades and traits which there<br/>
    Would cause each subtile genius to admire?</p>
<p>Dead seemed the dead, the living seemed alive;<br/>
    Better than I saw not who saw the truth,<br/>
    All that I trod upon while bowed I went.</p>
<p>Now wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted,<br/>
    Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your faces<br/>
    So that ye may behold your evil ways!</p>
<p>More of the mount by us was now encompassed,<br/>
    And far more spent the circuit of the sun,<br/>
    Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,</p>
<p>When he, who ever watchful in advance<br/>
    Was going on, began: "Lift up thy head,<br/>
    'Tis no more time to go thus meditating.</p>
<p>Lo there an Angel who is making haste<br/>
    To come towards us; lo, returning is<br/>
    From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.</p>
<p>With reverence thine acts and looks adorn,<br/>
    So that he may delight to speed us upward;<br/>
    Think that this day will never dawn again."</p>
<p>I was familiar with his admonition<br/>
    Ever to lose no time; so on this theme<br/>
    He could not unto me speak covertly.</p>
<p>Towards us came the being beautiful<br/>
    Vested in white, and in his countenance<br/>
    Such as appears the tremulous morning star.</p>
<p>His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;<br/>
    "Come," said he, "near at hand here are the steps,<br/>
    And easy from henceforth is the ascent."</p>
<p>At this announcement few are they who come!<br/>
    O human creatures, born to soar aloft,<br/>
    Why fall ye thus before a little wind?</p>
<p>He led us on to where the rock was cleft;<br/>
    There smote upon my forehead with his wings,<br/>
    Then a safe passage promised unto me.</p>
<p>As on the right hand, to ascend the mount<br/>
    Where seated is the church that lordeth it<br/>
    O'er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,</p>
<p>The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken<br/>
    By stairways that were made there in the age<br/>
    When still were safe the ledger and the stave,</p>
<p>E'en thus attempered is the bank which falls<br/>
    Sheer downward from the second circle there;<br/>
    But on this, side and that the high rock graze.</p>
<p>As we were turning thitherward our persons,<br/>
    "Beati pauperes spiritu," voices<br/>
    Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.</p>
<p>Ah me! how different are these entrances<br/>
    From the Infernal! for with anthems here<br/>
    One enters, and below with wild laments.</p>
<p>We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,<br/>
    And it appeared to me by far more easy<br/>
    Than on the plain it had appeared before.</p>
<p>Whence I: "My Master, say, what heavy thing<br/>
    Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly<br/>
    Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?"</p>
<p>He answered: "When the P's which have remained<br/>
    Still on thy face almost obliterate<br/>
    Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,</p>
<p>Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,<br/>
    That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,<br/>
    But urging up will be to them delight."</p>
<p>Then did I even as they do who are going<br/>
    With something on the head to them unknown,<br/>
    Unless the signs of others make them doubt,</p>
<p>Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,<br/>
    And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office<br/>
    Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;</p>
<p>And with the fingers of the right hand spread<br/>
    I found but six the letters, that had carved<br/>
    Upon my temples he who bore the keys;</p>
<p>Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.</p>

<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXI</h3>
<p>The natural thirst, that ne'er is satisfied<br/>
    Excepting with the water for whose grace<br/>
    The woman of Samaria besought,</p>
<p>Put me in travail, and haste goaded me<br/>
    Along the encumbered path behind my Leader<br/>
    And I was pitying that righteous vengeance;</p>
<p>And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth<br/>
    That Christ appeared to two upon the way<br/>
    From the sepulchral cave already risen,</p>
<p>A shade appeared to us, and came behind us,<br/>
    Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,<br/>
    Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,</p>
<p>Saying, "My brothers, may God give you peace!"<br/>
    We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered<br/>
    To him the countersign thereto conforming.</p>
<p>Thereon began he: "In the blessed council,<br/>
    Thee may the court veracious place in peace,<br/>
    That me doth banish in eternal exile!"</p>
<p>"How," said he, and the while we went with speed,<br/>
    "If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,<br/>
    Who up his stairs so far has guided you?"</p>
<p>And said my Teacher: "If thou note the marks<br/>
    Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces<br/>
    Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.</p>
<p>But because she who spinneth day and night<br/>
    For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,<br/>
    Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,</p>
<p>His soul, which is thy sister and my own,<br/>
    In coming upwards could not come alone,<br/>
    By reason that it sees not in our fashion.</p>
<p>Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat<br/>
    Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him<br/>
    As far on as my school has power to lead.</p>
<p>But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder<br/>
    Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together<br/>
    All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?"</p>
<p>In asking he so hit the very eye<br/>
    Of my desire, that merely with the hope<br/>
    My thirst became the less unsatisfied.</p>
<p>"Naught is there," he began, "that without order<br/>
    May the religion of the mountain feel,<br/>
    Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom.</p>
<p>Free is it here from every permutation;<br/>
    What from itself heaven in itself receiveth<br/>
    Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;</p>
<p>Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,<br/>
    Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls<br/>
    Than the short, little stairway of three steps.</p>
<p>Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,<br/>
    Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,<br/>
    That often upon earth her region shifts;</p>
<p>No arid vapour any farther rises<br/>
    Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,<br/>
    Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.</p>
<p>Lower down perchance it trembles less or more,<br/>
    But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden<br/>
    I know not how, up here it never trembled.</p>
<p>It trembles here, whenever any soul<br/>
    Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves<br/>
    To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.</p>
<p>Of purity the will alone gives proof,<br/>
    Which, being wholly free to change its convent,<br/>
    Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.</p>
<p>First it wills well; but the desire permits not,<br/>
    Which divine justice with the self-same will<br/>
    There was to sin, upon the torment sets.</p>
<p>And I, who have been lying in this pain<br/>
    Five hundred years and more, but just now felt<br/>
    A free volition for a better seat.</p>
<p>Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious<br/>
    Spirits along the mountain rendering praise<br/>
    Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards."</p>
<p>So said he to him; and since we enjoy<br/>
    As much in drinking as the thirst is great,<br/>
    I could not say how much it did me good.</p>
<p>And the wise Leader: "Now I see the net<br/>
    That snares you here, and how ye are set free,<br/>
    Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice.</p>
<p>Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know;<br/>
    And why so many centuries thou hast here<br/>
    Been lying, let me gather from thy words."</p>
<p>"In days when the good Titus, with the aid<br/>
    Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds<br/>
    Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold,</p>
<p>Under the name that most endures and honours,<br/>
    Was I on earth," that spirit made reply,<br/>
    "Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet.</p>
<p>My vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome<br/>
    Me, a Thoulousian, drew unto herself,<br/>
    Where I deserved to deck my brows with myrtle.</p>
<p>Statius the people name me still on earth;<br/>
    I sang of Thebes, and then of great Achilles;<br/>
    But on the way fell with my second burden.</p>
<p>The seeds unto my ardour were the sparks<br/>
    Of that celestial flame which heated me,<br/>
    Whereby more than a thousand have been fired;</p>
<p>Of the Aeneid speak I, which to me<br/>
    A mother was, and was my nurse in song;<br/>
    Without this weighed I not a drachma's weight.</p>
<p>And to have lived upon the earth what time<br/>
    Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun<br/>
    More than I must ere issuing from my ban."</p>
<p>These words towards me made Virgilius turn<br/>
    With looks that in their silence said, "Be silent!"<br/>
    But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;</p>
<p>For tears and laughter are such pursuivants<br/>
    Unto the passion from which each springs forth,<br/>
    In the most truthful least the will they follow.</p>
<p>I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;<br/>
    Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed<br/>
    Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;</p>
<p>And, "As thou well mayst consummate a labour<br/>
    So great," it said, "why did thy face just now<br/>
    Display to me the lightning of a smile?"</p>
<p>Now am I caught on this side and on that;<br/>
    One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,<br/>
    Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.</p>
<p>"Speak," said my Master, "and be not afraid<br/>
    Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him<br/>
    What he demands with such solicitude."</p>
<p>Whence I: "Thou peradventure marvellest,<br/>
    O antique spirit, at the smile I gave;<br/>
    But I will have more wonder seize upon thee.</p>
<p>This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,<br/>
    Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn<br/>
    To sing aloud of men and of the Gods.</p>
<p>If other cause thou to my smile imputedst,<br/>
    Abandon it as false, and trust it was<br/>
    Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him."</p>
<p>Already he was stooping to embrace<br/>
    My Teacher's feet; but he said to him: "Brother,<br/>
    Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest."</p>
<p>And he uprising: "Now canst thou the sum<br/>
    Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,<br/>
    When this our vanity I disremember,</p>
<p>Treating a shadow as substantial thing."</p>

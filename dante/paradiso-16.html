<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XVI</h3>
<p>O thou our poor nobility of blood,<br/>
    If thou dost make the people glory in thee<br/>
    Down here where our affection languishes,</p>
<p>A marvellous thing it ne'er will be to me;<br/>
    For there where appetite is not perverted,<br/>
    I say in Heaven, of thee I made a boast!</p>
<p>Truly thou art a cloak that quickly shortens,<br/>
    So that unless we piece thee day by day<br/>
    Time goeth round about thee with his shears!</p>
<p>With 'You,' which Rome was first to tolerate,<br/>
    (Wherein her family less perseveres,)<br/>
    Yet once again my words beginning made;</p>
<p>Whence Beatrice, who stood somewhat apart,<br/>
    Smiling, appeared like unto her who coughed<br/>
    At the first failing writ of Guenever.</p>
<p>And I began: "You are my ancestor,<br/>
    You give to me all hardihood to speak,<br/>
    You lift me so that I am more than I.</p>
<p>So many rivulets with gladness fill<br/>
    My mind, that of itself it makes a joy<br/>
    Because it can endure this and not burst.</p>
<p>Then tell me, my beloved root ancestral,<br/>
    Who were your ancestors, and what the years<br/>
    That in your boyhood chronicled themselves?</p>
<p>Tell me about the sheepfold of Saint John,<br/>
    How large it was, and who the people were<br/>
    Within it worthy of the highest seats."</p>
<p>As at the blowing of the winds a coal<br/>
    Quickens to flame, so I beheld that light<br/>
    Become resplendent at my blandishments.</p>
<p>And as unto mine eyes it grew more fair,<br/>
    With voice more sweet and tender, but not in<br/>
    This modern dialect, it said to me:</p>
<p>"From uttering of the 'Ave,' till the birth<br/>
    In which my mother, who is now a saint,<br/>
    Of me was lightened who had been her burden,</p>
<p>Unto its Lion had this fire returned<br/>
    Five hundred fifty times and thirty more,<br/>
    To reinflame itself beneath his paw.</p>
<p>My ancestors and I our birthplace had<br/>
    Where first is found the last ward of the city<br/>
    By him who runneth in your annual game.</p>
<p>Suffice it of my elders to hear this;<br/>
    But who they were, and whence they thither came,<br/>
    Silence is more considerate than speech.</p>
<p>All those who at that time were there between<br/>
    Mars and the Baptist, fit for bearing arms,<br/>
    Were a fifth part of those who now are living;</p>
<p>But the community, that now is mixed<br/>
    With Campi and Certaldo and Figghine,<br/>
    Pure in the lowest artisan was seen.</p>
<p>O how much better 'twere to have as neighbours<br/>
    The folk of whom I speak, and at Galluzzo<br/>
    And at Trespiano have your boundary,</p>
<p>Than have them in the town, and bear the stench<br/>
    Of Aguglione's churl, and him of Signa<br/>
    Who has sharp eyes for trickery already.</p>
<p>Had not the folk, which most of all the world<br/>
    Degenerates, been a step-dame unto Caesar,<br/>
    But as a mother to her son benignant,</p>
<p>Some who turn Florentines, and trade and discount,<br/>
    Would have gone back again to Simifonte<br/>
    There where their grandsires went about as beggars.</p>
<p>At Montemurlo still would be the Counts,<br/>
    The Cerchi in the parish of Acone,<br/>
    Perhaps in Valdigrieve the Buondelmonti.</p>
<p>Ever the intermingling of the people<br/>
    Has been the source of malady in cities,<br/>
    As in the body food it surfeits on;</p>
<p>And a blind bull more headlong plunges down<br/>
    Than a blind lamb; and very often cuts<br/>
    Better and more a single sword than five.</p>
<p>If Luni thou regard, and Urbisaglia,<br/>
    How they have passed away, and how are passing<br/>
    Chiusi and Sinigaglia after them,</p>
<p>To hear how races waste themselves away,<br/>
    Will seem to thee no novel thing nor hard,<br/>
    Seeing that even cities have an end.</p>
<p>All things of yours have their mortality,<br/>
    Even as yourselves; but it is hidden in some<br/>
    That a long while endure, and lives are short;</p>
<p>And as the turning of the lunar heaven<br/>
    Covers and bares the shores without a pause,<br/>
    In the like manner fortune does with Florence.</p>
<p>Therefore should not appear a marvellous thing<br/>
    What I shall say of the great Florentines<br/>
    Of whom the fame is hidden in the Past.</p>
<p>I saw the Ughi, saw the Catellini,<br/>
    Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi,<br/>
    Even in their fall illustrious citizens;</p>
<p>And saw, as mighty as they ancient were,<br/>
    With him of La Sannella him of Arca,<br/>
    And Soldanier, Ardinghi, and Bostichi.</p>
<p>Near to the gate that is at present laden<br/>
    With a new felony of so much weight<br/>
    That soon it shall be jetsam from the bark,</p>
<p>The Ravignani were, from whom descended<br/>
    The County Guido, and whoe'er the name<br/>
    Of the great Bellincione since hath taken.</p>
<p>He of La Pressa knew the art of ruling<br/>
    Already, and already Galigajo<br/>
    Had hilt and pommel gilded in his house.</p>
<p>Mighty already was the Column Vair,<br/>
    Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifant, and Barucci,<br/>
    And Galli, and they who for the bushel blush.</p>
<p>The stock from which were the Calfucci born<br/>
    Was great already, and already chosen<br/>
    To curule chairs the Sizii and Arrigucci.</p>
<p>O how beheld I those who are undone<br/>
    By their own pride! and how the Balls of Gold<br/>
    Florence enflowered in all their mighty deeds!</p>
<p>So likewise did the ancestors of those<br/>
    Who evermore, when vacant is your church,<br/>
    Fatten by staying in consistory.</p>
<p>The insolent race, that like a dragon follows<br/>
    Whoever flees, and unto him that shows<br/>
    His teeth or purse is gentle as a lamb,</p>
<p>Already rising was, but from low people;<br/>
    So that it pleased not Ubertin Donato<br/>
    That his wife's father should make him their kin.</p>
<p>Already had Caponsacco to the Market<br/>
    From Fesole descended, and already<br/>
    Giuda and Infangato were good burghers.</p>
<p>I'll tell a thing incredible, but true;<br/>
    One entered the small circuit by a gate<br/>
    Which from the Della Pera took its name!</p>
<p>Each one that bears the beautiful escutcheon<br/>
    Of the great baron whose renown and name<br/>
    The festival of Thomas keepeth fresh,</p>
<p>Knighthood and privilege from him received;<br/>
    Though with the populace unites himself<br/>
    To-day the man who binds it with a border.</p>
<p>Already were Gualterotti and Importuni;<br/>
    And still more quiet would the Borgo be<br/>
    If with new neighbours it remained unfed.</p>
<p>The house from which is born your lamentation,<br/>
    Through just disdain that death among you brought<br/>
    And put an end unto your joyous life,</p>
<p>Was honoured in itself and its companions.<br/>
    O Buondelmonte, how in evil hour<br/>
    Thou fled'st the bridal at another's promptings!</p>
<p>Many would be rejoicing who are sad,<br/>
    If God had thee surrendered to the Ema<br/>
    The first time that thou camest to the city.</p>
<p>But it behoved the mutilated stone<br/>
    Which guards the bridge, that Florence should provide<br/>
    A victim in her latest hour of peace.</p>
<p>With all these families, and others with them,<br/>
    Florence beheld I in so great repose,<br/>
    That no occasion had she whence to weep;</p>
<p>With all these families beheld so just<br/>
    And glorious her people, that the lily<br/>
    Never upon the spear was placed reversed,</p>
<p>Nor by division was vermilion made."</p>

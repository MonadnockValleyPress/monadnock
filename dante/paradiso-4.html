<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto IV</h3>
<p>Between two viands, equally removed<br/>
    And tempting, a free man would die of hunger<br/>
    Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.</p>
<p>So would a lamb between the ravenings<br/>
    Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;<br/>
    And so would stand a dog between two does.</p>
<p>Hence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,<br/>
    Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,<br/>
    Since it must be so, nor do I commend.</p>
<p>I held my peace; but my desire was painted<br/>
    Upon my face, and questioning with that<br/>
    More fervent far than by articulate speech.</p>
<p>Beatrice did as Daniel had done<br/>
    Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath<br/>
    Which rendered him unjustly merciless,</p>
<p>And said: "Well see I how attracteth thee<br/>
    One and the other wish, so that thy care<br/>
    Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.</p>
<p>Thou arguest, if good will be permanent,<br/>
    The violence of others, for what reason<br/>
    Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?</p>
<p>Again for doubting furnish thee occasion<br/>
    Souls seeming to return unto the stars,<br/>
    According to the sentiment of Plato.</p>
<p>These are the questions which upon thy wish<br/>
    Are thrusting equally; and therefore first<br/>
    Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.</p>
<p>He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,<br/>
    Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John<br/>
    Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,</p>
<p>Have not in any other heaven their seats,<br/>
    Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,<br/>
    Nor of existence more or fewer years;</p>
<p>But all make beautiful the primal circle,<br/>
    And have sweet life in different degrees,<br/>
    By feeling more or less the eternal breath.</p>
<p>They showed themselves here, not because allotted<br/>
    This sphere has been to them, but to give sign<br/>
    Of the celestial which is least exalted.</p>
<p>To speak thus is adapted to your mind,<br/>
    Since only through the sense it apprehendeth<br/>
    What then it worthy makes of intellect.</p>
<p>On this account the Scripture condescends<br/>
    Unto your faculties, and feet and hands<br/>
    To God attributes, and means something else;</p>
<p>And Holy Church under an aspect human<br/>
    Gabriel and Michael represent to you,<br/>
    And him who made Tobias whole again.</p>
<p>That which Timaeus argues of the soul<br/>
    Doth not resemble that which here is seen,<br/>
    Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.</p>
<p>He says the soul unto its star returns,<br/>
    Believing it to have been severed thence<br/>
    Whenever nature gave it as a form.</p>
<p>Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise<br/>
    Than the words sound, and possibly may be<br/>
    With meaning that is not to be derided.</p>
<p>If he doth mean that to these wheels return<br/>
    The honour of their influence and the blame,<br/>
    Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.</p>
<p>This principle ill understood once warped<br/>
    The whole world nearly, till it went astray<br/>
    Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.</p>
<p>The other doubt which doth disquiet thee<br/>
    Less venom has, for its malevolence<br/>
    Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.</p>
<p>That as unjust our justice should appear<br/>
    In eyes of mortals, is an argument<br/>
    Of faith, and not of sin heretical.</p>
<p>But still, that your perception may be able<br/>
    To thoroughly penetrate this verity,<br/>
    As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.</p>
<p>If it be violence when he who suffers<br/>
    Co-operates not with him who uses force,<br/>
    These souls were not on that account excused;</p>
<p>For will is never quenched unless it will,<br/>
    But operates as nature doth in fire<br/>
    If violence a thousand times distort it.</p>
<p>Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds<br/>
    The force; and these have done so, having power<br/>
    Of turning back unto the holy place.</p>
<p>If their will had been perfect, like to that<br/>
    Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,<br/>
    And Mutius made severe to his own hand,</p>
<p>It would have urged them back along the road<br/>
    Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;<br/>
    But such a solid will is all too rare.</p>
<p>And by these words, if thou hast gathered them<br/>
    As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted<br/>
    That would have still annoyed thee many times.</p>
<p>But now another passage runs across<br/>
    Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself<br/>
    Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.</p>
<p>I have for certain put into thy mind<br/>
    That soul beatified could never lie,<br/>
    For it is near the primal Truth,</p>
<p>And then thou from Piccarda might'st have heard<br/>
    Costanza kept affection for the veil,<br/>
    So that she seemeth here to contradict me.</p>
<p>Many times, brother, has it come to pass,<br/>
    That, to escape from peril, with reluctance<br/>
    That has been done it was not right to do,</p>
<p>E'en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father<br/>
    Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)<br/>
    Not to lose pity pitiless became.</p>
<p>At this point I desire thee to remember<br/>
    That force with will commingles, and they cause<br/>
    That the offences cannot be excused.</p>
<p>Will absolute consenteth not to evil;<br/>
    But in so far consenteth as it fears,<br/>
    If it refrain, to fall into more harm.</p>
<p>Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,<br/>
    She meaneth the will absolute, and I<br/>
    The other, so that both of us speak truth."</p>
<p>Such was the flowing of the holy river<br/>
    That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;<br/>
    This put to rest my wishes one and all.</p>
<p>"O love of the first lover, O divine,"<br/>
    Said I forthwith, "whose speech inundates me<br/>
    And warms me so, it more and more revives me,</p>
<p>My own affection is not so profound<br/>
    As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;<br/>
    Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.</p>
<p>Well I perceive that never sated is<br/>
    Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,<br/>
    Beyond which nothing true expands itself.</p>
<p>It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,<br/>
    When it attains it; and it can attain it;<br/>
    If not, then each desire would frustrate be.</p>
<p>Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,<br/>
    Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,<br/>
    Which to the top from height to height impels us.</p>
<p>This doth invite me, this assurance give me<br/>
    With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you<br/>
    Another truth, which is obscure to me.</p>
<p>I wish to know if man can satisfy you<br/>
    For broken vows with other good deeds, so<br/>
    That in your balance they will not be light."</p>
<p>Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes<br/>
    Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,<br/>
    That, overcome my power, I turned my back</p>
<p>And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.</p>

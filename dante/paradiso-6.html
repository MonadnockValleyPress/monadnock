<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto VI</h3>
<p>"After that Constantine the eagle turned<br/>
    Against the course of heaven, which it had followed<br/>
    Behind the ancient who Lavinia took,</p>
<p>Two hundred years and more the bird of God<br/>
    In the extreme of Europe held itself,<br/>
    Near to the mountains whence it issued first;</p>
<p>And under shadow of the sacred plumes<br/>
    It governed there the world from hand to hand,<br/>
    And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted.</p>
<p>Caesar I was, and am Justinian,<br/>
    Who, by the will of primal Love I feel,<br/>
    Took from the laws the useless and redundant;</p>
<p>And ere unto the work I was attent,<br/>
    One nature to exist in Christ, not more,<br/>
    Believed, and with such faith was I contented.</p>
<p>But blessed Agapetus, he who was<br/>
    The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere<br/>
    Pointed me out the way by words of his.</p>
<p>Him I believed, and what was his assertion<br/>
    I now see clearly, even as thou seest<br/>
    Each contradiction to be false and true.</p>
<p>As soon as with the Church I moved my feet,<br/>
    God in his grace it pleased with this high task<br/>
    To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it,</p>
<p>And to my Belisarius I commended<br/>
    The arms, to which was heaven's right hand so joined<br/>
    It was a signal that I should repose.</p>
<p>Now here to the first question terminates<br/>
    My answer; but the character thereof<br/>
    Constrains me to continue with a sequel,</p>
<p>In order that thou see with how great reason<br/>
    Men move against the standard sacrosanct,<br/>
    Both who appropriate and who oppose it.</p>
<p>Behold how great a power has made it worthy<br/>
    Of reverence, beginning from the hour<br/>
    When Pallas died to give it sovereignty.</p>
<p>Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode<br/>
    Three hundred years and upward, till at last<br/>
    The three to three fought for it yet again.</p>
<p>Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong<br/>
    Down to Lucretia's sorrow, in seven kings<br/>
    O'ercoming round about the neighboring nations;</p>
<p>Thou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans<br/>
    Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,<br/>
    Against the other princes and confederates.</p>
<p>Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks<br/>
    Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,<br/>
    Received the fame I willingly embalm;</p>
<p>It struck to earth the pride of the Arabians,<br/>
    Who, following Hannibal, had passed across<br/>
    The Alpine ridges, Po, from which thou glidest;</p>
<p>Beneath it triumphed while they yet were young<br/>
    Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill<br/>
    Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;</p>
<p>Then, near unto the time when heaven had willed<br/>
    To bring the whole world to its mood serene,<br/>
    Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it.</p>
<p>What it achieved from Var unto the Rhine,<br/>
    Isere beheld and Saone, beheld the Seine,<br/>
    And every valley whence the Rhone is filled;</p>
<p>What it achieved when it had left Ravenna,<br/>
    And leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight<br/>
    That neither tongue nor pen could follow it.</p>
<p>Round towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then<br/>
    Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote<br/>
    That to the calid Nile was felt the pain.</p>
<p>Antandros and the Simois, whence it started,<br/>
    It saw again, and there where Hector lies,<br/>
    And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself.</p>
<p>From thence it came like lightning upon Juba;<br/>
    Then wheeled itself again into your West,<br/>
    Where the Pompeian clarion it heard.</p>
<p>From what it wrought with the next standard-bearer<br/>
    Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together,<br/>
    And Modena and Perugia dolent were;</p>
<p>Still doth the mournful Cleopatra weep<br/>
    Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it,<br/>
    Took from the adder sudden and black death.</p>
<p>With him it ran even to the Red Sea shore;<br/>
    With him it placed the world in so great peace,<br/>
    That unto Janus was his temple closed.</p>
<p>But what the standard that has made me speak<br/>
    Achieved before, and after should achieve<br/>
    Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it,</p>
<p>Becometh in appearance mean and dim,<br/>
    If in the hand of the third Caesar seen<br/>
    With eye unclouded and affection pure,</p>
<p>Because the living Justice that inspires me<br/>
    Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,<br/>
    The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath.</p>
<p>Now here attend to what I answer thee;<br/>
    Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance<br/>
    Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin.</p>
<p>And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten<br/>
    The Holy Church, then underneath its wings<br/>
    Did Charlemagne victorious succor her.</p>
<p>Now hast thou power to judge of such as those<br/>
    Whom I accused above, and of their crimes,<br/>
    Which are the cause of all your miseries.</p>
<p>To the public standard one the yellow lilies<br/>
    Opposes, the other claims it for a party,<br/>
    So that 'tis hard to see which sins the most.</p>
<p>Let, let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft<br/>
    Beneath some other standard; for this ever<br/>
    Ill follows he who it and justice parts.</p>
<p>And let not this new Charles e'er strike it down,<br/>
    He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons<br/>
    That from a nobler lion stripped the fell.</p>
<p>Already oftentimes the sons have wept<br/>
    The father's crime; and let him not believe<br/>
    That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies.</p>
<p>This little planet doth adorn itself<br/>
    With the good spirits that have active been,<br/>
    That fame and honour might come after them;</p>
<p>And whensoever the desires mount thither,<br/>
    Thus deviating, must perforce the rays<br/>
    Of the true love less vividly mount upward.</p>
<p>But in commensuration of our wages<br/>
    With our desert is portion of our joy,<br/>
    Because we see them neither less nor greater.</p>
<p>Herein doth living Justice sweeten so<br/>
    Affection in us, that for evermore<br/>
    It cannot warp to any iniquity.</p>
<p>Voices diverse make up sweet melodies;<br/>
    So in this life of ours the seats diverse<br/>
    Render sweet harmony among these spheres;</p>
<p>And in the compass of this present pearl<br/>
    Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom<br/>
    The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded.</p>
<p>But the Provencals who against him wrought,<br/>
    They have not laughed, and therefore ill goes he<br/>
    Who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others.</p>
<p>Four daughters, and each one of them a queen,<br/>
    Had Raymond Berenger, and this for him<br/>
    Did Romeo, a poor man and a pilgrim;</p>
<p>And then malicious words incited him<br/>
    To summon to a reckoning this just man,<br/>
    Who rendered to him seven and five for ten.</p>
<p>Then he departed poor and stricken in years,<br/>
    And if the world could know the heart he had,<br/>
    In begging bit by bit his livelihood,</p>
<p>Though much it laud him, it would laud him more."</p>

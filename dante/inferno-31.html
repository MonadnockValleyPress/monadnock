<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXXI</h3>
<p>One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,<br/>
    So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,<br/>
    And then held out to me the medicine;</p>
<p>Thus do I hear that once Achilles' spear,<br/>
    His and his father's, used to be the cause<br/>
    First of a sad and then a gracious boon.</p>
<p>We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,<br/>
    Upon the bank that girds it round about,<br/>
    Going across it without any speech.</p>
<p>There it was less than night, and less than day,<br/>
    So that my sight went little in advance;<br/>
    But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,</p>
<p>So loud it would have made each thunder faint,<br/>
    Which, counter to it following its way,<br/>
    Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.</p>
<p>After the dolorous discomfiture<br/>
    When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,<br/>
    So terribly Orlando sounded not.</p>
<p>Short while my head turned thitherward I held<br/>
    When many lofty towers I seemed to see,<br/>
    Whereat I: "Master, say, what town is this?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "Because thou peerest forth<br/>
    Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,<br/>
    It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.</p>
<p>Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,<br/>
    How much the sense deceives itself by distance;<br/>
    Therefore a little faster spur thee on."</p>
<p>Then tenderly he took me by the hand,<br/>
    And said: "Before we farther have advanced,<br/>
    That the reality may seem to thee</p>
<p>Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,<br/>
    And they are in the well, around the bank,<br/>
    From navel downward, one and all of them."</p>
<p>As, when the fog is vanishing away,<br/>
    Little by little doth the sight refigure<br/>
    Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals,</p>
<p>So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,<br/>
    More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge,<br/>
    My error fled, and fear came over me;</p>
<p>Because as on its circular parapets<br/>
    Montereggione crowns itself with towers,<br/>
    E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well</p>
<p>With one half of their bodies turreted<br/>
    The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces<br/>
    E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.</p>
<p>And I of one already saw the face,<br/>
    Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,<br/>
    And down along his sides both of the arms.</p>
<p>Certainly Nature, when she left the making<br/>
    Of animals like these, did well indeed,<br/>
    By taking such executors from Mars;</p>
<p>And if of elephants and whales she doth not<br/>
    Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly<br/>
    More just and more discreet will hold her for it;</p>
<p>For where the argument of intellect<br/>
    Is added unto evil will and power,<br/>
    No rampart can the people make against it.</p>
<p>His face appeared to me as long and large<br/>
    As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's,<br/>
    And in proportion were the other bones;</p>
<p>So that the margin, which an apron was<br/>
    Down from the middle, showed so much of him<br/>
    Above it, that to reach up to his hair</p>
<p>Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;<br/>
    For I beheld thirty great palms of him<br/>
    Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.</p>
<p>"Raphael mai amech izabi almi,"<br/>
    Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,<br/>
    To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.</p>
<p>And unto him my Guide: "Soul idiotic,<br/>
    Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,<br/>
    When wrath or other passion touches thee.</p>
<p>Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt<br/>
    Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,<br/>
    And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast."</p>
<p>Then said to me: "He doth himself accuse;<br/>
    This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought<br/>
    One language in the world is not still used.</p>
<p>Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;<br/>
    For even such to him is every language<br/>
    As his to others, which to none is known."</p>
<p>Therefore a longer journey did we make,<br/>
    Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft<br/>
    We found another far more fierce and large.</p>
<p>In binding him, who might the master be<br/>
    I cannot say; but he had pinioned close<br/>
    Behind the right arm, and in front the other,</p>
<p>With chains, that held him so begirt about<br/>
    From the neck down, that on the part uncovered<br/>
    It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.</p>
<p>"This proud one wished to make experiment<br/>
    Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,"<br/>
    My Leader said, "whence he has such a guerdon.</p>
<p>Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.<br/>
    What time the giants terrified the gods;<br/>
    The arms he wielded never more he moves."</p>
<p>And I to him: "If possible, I should wish<br/>
    That of the measureless Briareus<br/>
    These eyes of mine might have experience."</p>
<p>Whence he replied: "Thou shalt behold Antaeus<br/>
    Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,<br/>
    Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.</p>
<p>Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,<br/>
    And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,<br/>
    Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious."</p>
<p>There never was an earthquake of such might<br/>
    That it could shake a tower so violently,<br/>
    As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.</p>
<p>Then was I more afraid of death than ever,<br/>
    For nothing more was needful than the fear,<br/>
    If I had not beheld the manacles.</p>
<p>Then we proceeded farther in advance,<br/>
    And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells<br/>
    Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.</p>
<p>"O thou, who in the valley fortunate,<br/>
    Which Scipio the heir of glory made,<br/>
    When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,</p>
<p>Once brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey,<br/>
    And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war<br/>
    Among thy brothers, some it seems still think</p>
<p>The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:<br/>
    Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,<br/>
    There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.</p>
<p>Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;<br/>
    This one can give of that which here is longed for;<br/>
    Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.</p>
<p>Still in the world can he restore thy fame;<br/>
    Because he lives, and still expects long life,<br/>
    If to itself Grace call him not untimely."</p>
<p>So said the Master; and in haste the other<br/>
    His hands extended and took up my Guide,&mdash;<br/>
    Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.</p>
<p>Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,<br/>
    Said unto me: "Draw nigh, that I may take thee;"<br/>
    Then of himself and me one bundle made.</p>
<p>As seems the Carisenda, to behold<br/>
    Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud<br/>
    Above it so that opposite it hangs;</p>
<p>Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood<br/>
    Watching to see him stoop, and then it was<br/>
    I could have wished to go some other way.</p>
<p>But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up<br/>
    Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;<br/>
    Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,</p>
<p>But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.</p>

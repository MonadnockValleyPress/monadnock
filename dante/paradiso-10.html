<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto X</h3>
<p>Looking into his Son with all the Love<br/>
    Which each of them eternally breathes forth,<br/>
    The Primal and unutterable Power</p>
<p>Whate'er before the mind or eye revolves<br/>
    With so much order made, there can be none<br/>
    Who this beholds without enjoying Him.</p>
<p>Lift up then, Reader, to the lofty wheels<br/>
    With me thy vision straight unto that part<br/>
    Where the one motion on the other strikes,</p>
<p>And there begin to contemplate with joy<br/>
    That Master's art, who in himself so loves it<br/>
    That never doth his eye depart therefrom.</p>
<p>Behold how from that point goes branching off<br/>
    The oblique circle, which conveys the planets,<br/>
    To satisfy the world that calls upon them;</p>
<p>And if their pathway were not thus inflected,<br/>
    Much virtue in the heavens would be in vain,<br/>
    And almost every power below here dead.</p>
<p>If from the straight line distant more or less<br/>
    Were the departure, much would wanting be<br/>
    Above and underneath of mundane order.</p>
<p>Remain now, Reader, still upon thy bench,<br/>
    In thought pursuing that which is foretasted,<br/>
    If thou wouldst jocund be instead of weary.</p>
<p>I've set before thee; henceforth feed thyself,<br/>
    For to itself diverteth all my care<br/>
    That theme whereof I have been made the scribe.</p>
<p>The greatest of the ministers of nature,<br/>
    Who with the power of heaven the world imprints<br/>
    And measures with his light the time for us,</p>
<p>With that part which above is called to mind<br/>
    Conjoined, along the spirals was revolving,<br/>
    Where each time earlier he presents himself;</p>
<p>And I was with him; but of the ascending<br/>
    I was not conscious, saving as a man<br/>
    Of a first thought is conscious ere it come;</p>
<p>And Beatrice, she who is seen to pass<br/>
    From good to better, and so suddenly<br/>
    That not by time her action is expressed,</p>
<p>How lucent in herself must she have been!<br/>
    And what was in the sun, wherein I entered,<br/>
    Apparent not by colour but by light,</p>
<p>I, though I call on genius, art, and practice,<br/>
    Cannot so tell that it could be imagined;<br/>
    Believe one can, and let him long to see it.</p>
<p>And if our fantasies too lowly are<br/>
    For altitude so great, it is no marvel,<br/>
    Since o'er the sun was never eye could go.</p>
<p>Such in this place was the fourth family<br/>
    Of the high Father, who forever sates it,<br/>
    Showing how he breathes forth and how begets.</p>
<p>And Beatrice began: "Give thanks, give thanks<br/>
    Unto the Sun of Angels, who to this<br/>
    Sensible one has raised thee by his grace!"</p>
<p>Never was heart of mortal so disposed<br/>
    To worship, nor to give itself to God<br/>
    With all its gratitude was it so ready,</p>
<p>As at those words did I myself become;<br/>
    And all my love was so absorbed in Him,<br/>
    That in oblivion Beatrice was eclipsed.</p>
<p>Nor this displeased her; but she smiled at it<br/>
    So that the splendour of her laughing eyes<br/>
    My single mind on many things divided.</p>
<p>Lights many saw I, vivid and triumphant,<br/>
    Make us a centre and themselves a circle,<br/>
    More sweet in voice than luminous in aspect.</p>
<p>Thus girt about the daughter of Latona<br/>
    We sometimes see, when pregnant is the air,<br/>
    So that it holds the thread which makes her zone.</p>
<p>Within the court of Heaven, whence I return,<br/>
    Are many jewels found, so fair and precious<br/>
    They cannot be transported from the realm;</p>
<p>And of them was the singing of those lights.<br/>
    Who takes not wings that he may fly up thither,<br/>
    The tidings thence may from the dumb await!</p>
<p>As soon as singing thus those burning suns<br/>
    Had round about us whirled themselves three times,<br/>
    Like unto stars neighbouring the steadfast poles,</p>
<p>Ladies they seemed, not from the dance released,<br/>
    But who stop short, in silence listening<br/>
    Till they have gathered the new melody.</p>
<p>And within one I heard beginning: "When<br/>
    The radiance of grace, by which is kindled<br/>
    True love, and which thereafter grows by loving,</p>
<p>Within thee multiplied is so resplendent<br/>
    That it conducts thee upward by that stair,<br/>
    Where without reascending none descends,</p>
<p>Who should deny the wine out of his vial<br/>
    Unto thy thirst, in liberty were not<br/>
    Except as water which descends not seaward.</p>
<p>Fain wouldst thou know with what plants is enflowered<br/>
    This garland that encircles with delight<br/>
    The Lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven.</p>
<p>Of the lambs was I of the holy flock<br/>
    Which Dominic conducteth by a road<br/>
    Where well one fattens if he strayeth not.</p>
<p>He who is nearest to me on the right<br/>
    My brother and master was; and he Albertus<br/>
    Is of Cologne, I Thomas of Aquinum.</p>
<p>If thou of all the others wouldst be certain,<br/>
    Follow behind my speaking with thy sight<br/>
    Upward along the blessed garland turning.</p>
<p>That next effulgence issues from the smile<br/>
    Of Gratian, who assisted both the courts<br/>
    In such wise that it pleased in Paradise.</p>
<p>The other which near by adorns our choir<br/>
    That Peter was who, e'en as the poor widow,<br/>
    Offered his treasure unto Holy Church.</p>
<p>The fifth light, that among us is the fairest,<br/>
    Breathes forth from such a love, that all the world<br/>
    Below is greedy to learn tidings of it.</p>
<p>Within it is the lofty mind, where knowledge<br/>
    So deep was put, that, if the true be true,<br/>
    To see so much there never rose a second.</p>
<p>Thou seest next the lustre of that taper,<br/>
    Which in the flesh below looked most within<br/>
    The angelic nature and its ministry.</p>
<p>Within that other little light is smiling<br/>
    The advocate of the Christian centuries,<br/>
    Out of whose rhetoric Augustine was furnished.</p>
<p>Now if thou trainest thy mind's eye along<br/>
    From light to light pursuant of my praise,<br/>
    With thirst already of the eighth thou waitest.</p>
<p>By seeing every good therein exults<br/>
    The sainted soul, which the fallacious world<br/>
    Makes manifest to him who listeneth well;</p>
<p>The body whence 'twas hunted forth is lying<br/>
    Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom<br/>
    And banishment it came unto this peace.</p>
<p>See farther onward flame the burning breath<br/>
    Of Isidore, of Beda, and of Richard<br/>
    Who was in contemplation more than man.</p>
<p>This, whence to me returneth thy regard,<br/>
    The light is of a spirit unto whom<br/>
    In his grave meditations death seemed slow.</p>
<p>It is the light eternal of Sigier,<br/>
    Who, reading lectures in the Street of Straw,<br/>
    Did syllogize invidious verities."</p>
<p>Then, as a horologe that calleth us<br/>
    What time the Bride of God is rising up<br/>
    With matins to her Spouse that he may love her,</p>
<p>Wherein one part the other draws and urges,<br/>
    Ting! ting! resounding with so sweet a note,<br/>
    That swells with love the spirit well disposed,</p>
<p>Thus I beheld the glorious wheel move round,<br/>
    And render voice to voice, in modulation<br/>
    And sweetness that can not be comprehended,</p>
<p>Excepting there where joy is made eternal.</p>

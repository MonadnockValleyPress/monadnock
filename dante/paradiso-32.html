<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXXII</h3>
<p>Absorbed in his delight, that contemplator<br/>
    Assumed the willing office of a teacher,<br/>
    And gave beginning to these holy words:</p>
<p>"The wound that Mary closed up and anointed,<br/>
    She at her feet who is so beautiful,<br/>
    She is the one who opened it and pierced it.</p>
<p>Within that order which the third seats make<br/>
    Is seated Rachel, lower than the other,<br/>
    With Beatrice, in manner as thou seest.</p>
<p>Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was<br/>
    Ancestress of the Singer, who for dole<br/>
    Of the misdeed said, 'Miserere mei,'</p>
<p>Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending<br/>
    Down in gradation, as with each one's name<br/>
    I through the Rose go down from leaf to leaf.</p>
<p>And downward from the seventh row, even as<br/>
    Above the same, succeed the Hebrew women,<br/>
    Dividing all the tresses of the flower;</p>
<p>Because, according to the view which Faith<br/>
    In Christ had taken, these are the partition<br/>
    By which the sacred stairways are divided.</p>
<p>Upon this side, where perfect is the flower<br/>
    With each one of its petals, seated are<br/>
    Those who believed in Christ who was to come.</p>
<p>Upon the other side, where intersected<br/>
    With vacant spaces are the semicircles,<br/>
    Are those who looked to Christ already come.</p>
<p>And as, upon this side, the glorious seat<br/>
    Of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats<br/>
    Below it, such a great division make,</p>
<p>So opposite doth that of the great John,<br/>
    Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom<br/>
    Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell.</p>
<p>And under him thus to divide were chosen<br/>
    Francis, and Benedict, and Augustine,<br/>
    And down to us the rest from round to round.</p>
<p>Behold now the high providence divine;<br/>
    For one and other aspect of the Faith<br/>
    In equal measure shall this garden fill.</p>
<p>And know that downward from that rank which cleaves<br/>
    Midway the sequence of the two divisions,<br/>
    Not by their proper merit are they seated;</p>
<p>But by another's under fixed conditions;<br/>
    For these are spirits one and all assoiled<br/>
    Before they any true election had.</p>
<p>Well canst thou recognise it in their faces,<br/>
    And also in their voices puerile,<br/>
    If thou regard them well and hearken to them.</p>
<p>Now doubtest thou, and doubting thou art silent;<br/>
    But I will loosen for thee the strong bond<br/>
    In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast.</p>
<p>Within the amplitude of this domain<br/>
    No casual point can possibly find place,<br/>
    No more than sadness can, or thirst, or hunger;</p>
<p>For by eternal law has been established<br/>
    Whatever thou beholdest, so that closely<br/>
    The ring is fitted to the finger here.</p>
<p>And therefore are these people, festinate<br/>
    Unto true life, not 'sine causa' here<br/>
    More and less excellent among themselves.</p>
<p>The King, by means of whom this realm reposes<br/>
    In so great love and in so great delight<br/>
    That no will ventureth to ask for more,</p>
<p>In his own joyous aspect every mind<br/>
    Creating, at his pleasure dowers with grace<br/>
    Diversely; and let here the effect suffice.</p>
<p>And this is clearly and expressly noted<br/>
    For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins<br/>
    Who in their mother had their anger roused.</p>
<p>According to the colour of the hair,<br/>
    Therefore, with such a grace the light supreme<br/>
    Consenteth that they worthily be crowned.</p>
<p>Without, then, any merit of their deeds,<br/>
    Stationed are they in different gradations,<br/>
    Differing only in their first acuteness.</p>
<p>'Tis true that in the early centuries,<br/>
    With innocence, to work out their salvation<br/>
    Sufficient was the faith of parents only.</p>
<p>After the earlier ages were completed,<br/>
    Behoved it that the males by circumcision<br/>
    Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;</p>
<p>But after that the time of grace had come<br/>
    Without the baptism absolute of Christ,<br/>
    Such innocence below there was retained.</p>
<p>Look now into the face that unto Christ<br/>
    Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only<br/>
    Is able to prepare thee to see Christ."</p>
<p>On her did I behold so great a gladness<br/>
    Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds<br/>
    Created through that altitude to fly,</p>
<p>That whatsoever I had seen before<br/>
    Did not suspend me in such admiration,<br/>
    Nor show me such similitude of God.</p>
<p>And the same Love that first descended there,<br/>
    "Ave Maria, gratia plena," singing,<br/>
    In front of her his wings expanded wide.</p>
<p>Unto the canticle divine responded<br/>
    From every part the court beatified,<br/>
    So that each sight became serener for it.</p>
<p>"O holy father, who for me endurest<br/>
    To be below here, leaving the sweet place<br/>
    In which thou sittest by eternal lot,</p>
<p>Who is the Angel that with so much joy<br/>
    Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,<br/>
    Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?"</p>
<p>Thus I again recourse had to the teaching<br/>
    Of that one who delighted him in Mary<br/>
    As doth the star of morning in the sun.</p>
<p>And he to me: "Such gallantry and grace<br/>
    As there can be in Angel and in soul,<br/>
    All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;</p>
<p>Because he is the one who bore the palm<br/>
    Down unto Mary, when the Son of God<br/>
    To take our burden on himself decreed.</p>
<p>But now come onward with thine eyes, as I<br/>
    Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians<br/>
    Of this most just and merciful of empires.</p>
<p>Those two that sit above there most enrapture<br/>
    As being very near unto Augusta,<br/>
    Are as it were the two roots of this Rose.</p>
<p>He who upon the left is near her placed<br/>
    The father is, by whose audacious taste<br/>
    The human species so much bitter tastes.</p>
<p>Upon the right thou seest that ancient father<br/>
    Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ<br/>
    The keys committed of this lovely flower.</p>
<p>And he who all the evil days beheld,<br/>
    Before his death, of her the beauteous bride<br/>
    Who with the spear and with the nails was won,</p>
<p>Beside him sits, and by the other rests<br/>
    That leader under whom on manna lived<br/>
    The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.</p>
<p>Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,<br/>
    So well content to look upon her daughter,<br/>
    Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.</p>
<p>And opposite the eldest household father<br/>
    Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved<br/>
    When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.</p>
<p>But since the moments of thy vision fly,<br/>
    Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor<br/>
    Who makes the gown according to his cloth,</p>
<p>And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,<br/>
    That looking upon Him thou penetrate<br/>
    As far as possible through his effulgence.</p>
<p>Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,<br/>
    Moving thy wings believing to advance,<br/>
    By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;</p>
<p>Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;<br/>
    And thou shalt follow me with thy affection<br/>
    That from my words thy heart turn not aside."</p>
<p>And he began this holy orison.</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto V</h3>
<p>Thus I descended out of the first circle<br/>
    Down to the second, that less space begirds,<br/>
    And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.</p>
<p>There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;<br/>
    Examines the transgressions at the entrance;<br/>
    Judges, and sends according as he girds him.</p>
<p>I say, that when the spirit evil-born<br/>
    Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;<br/>
    And this discriminator of transgressions</p>
<p>Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;<br/>
    Girds himself with his tail as many times<br/>
    As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.</p>
<p>Always before him many of them stand;<br/>
    They go by turns each one unto the judgment;<br/>
    They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.</p>
<p>"O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry<br/>
    Comest," said Minos to me, when he saw me,<br/>
    Leaving the practice of so great an office,</p>
<p>"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;<br/>
    Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee."<br/>
    And unto him my Guide: "Why criest thou too?</p>
<p>Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;<br/>
    It is so willed there where is power to do<br/>
    That which is willed; and ask no further question."</p>
<p>And now begin the dolesome notes to grow<br/>
    Audible unto me; now am I come<br/>
    There where much lamentation strikes upon me.</p>
<p>I came into a place mute of all light,<br/>
    Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,<br/>
    If by opposing winds 't is combated.</p>
<p>The infernal hurricane that never rests<br/>
    Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;<br/>
    Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.</p>
<p>When they arrive before the precipice,<br/>
    There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,<br/>
    There they blaspheme the puissance divine.</p>
<p>I understood that unto such a torment<br/>
    The carnal malefactors were condemned,<br/>
    Who reason subjugate to appetite.</p>
<p>And as the wings of starlings bear them on<br/>
    In the cold season in large band and full,<br/>
    So doth that blast the spirits maledict;</p>
<p>It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;<br/>
    No hope doth comfort them for evermore,<br/>
    Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.</p>
<p>And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,<br/>
    Making in air a long line of themselves,<br/>
    So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,</p>
<p>Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.<br/>
    Whereupon said I: "Master, who are those<br/>
    People, whom the black air so castigates?"</p>
<p>"The first of those, of whom intelligence<br/>
    Thou fain wouldst have," then said he unto me,<br/>
    "The empress was of many languages.</p>
<p>To sensual vices she was so abandoned,<br/>
    That lustful she made licit in her law,<br/>
    To remove the blame to which she had been led.</p>
<p>She is Semiramis, of whom we read<br/>
    That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;<br/>
    She held the land which now the Sultan rules.</p>
<p>The next is she who killed herself for love,<br/>
    And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;<br/>
    Then Cleopatra the voluptuous."</p>
<p>Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless<br/>
    Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,<br/>
    Who at the last hour combated with Love.</p>
<p>Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand<br/>
    Shades did he name and point out with his finger,<br/>
    Whom Love had separated from our life.</p>
<p>After that I had listened to my Teacher,<br/>
    Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,<br/>
    Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.</p>
<p>And I began: "O Poet, willingly<br/>
    Speak would I to those two, who go together,<br/>
    And seem upon the wind to be so light."</p>
<p>And, he to me: "Thou'lt mark, when they shall be<br/>
    Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them<br/>
    By love which leadeth them, and they will come."</p>
<p>Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,<br/>
    My voice uplift I: "O ye weary souls!<br/>
    Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it."</p>
<p>As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,<br/>
    With open and steady wings to the sweet nest<br/>
    Fly through the air by their volition borne,</p>
<p>So came they from the band where Dido is,<br/>
    Approaching us athwart the air malign,<br/>
    So strong was the affectionate appeal.</p>
<p>"O living creature gracious and benignant,<br/>
    Who visiting goest through the purple air<br/>
    Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,</p>
<p>If were the King of the Universe our friend,<br/>
    We would pray unto him to give thee peace,<br/>
    Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.</p>
<p>Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,<br/>
    That will we hear, and we will speak to you,<br/>
    While silent is the wind, as it is now.</p>
<p>Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,<br/>
    Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends<br/>
    To rest in peace with all his retinue.</p>
<p>Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,<br/>
    Seized this man for the person beautiful<br/>
    That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.</p>
<p>Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,<br/>
    Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,<br/>
    That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;</p>
<p>Love has conducted us unto one death;<br/>
    Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!"<br/>
    These words were borne along from them to us.</p>
<p>As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,<br/>
    I bowed my face, and so long held it down<br/>
    Until the Poet said to me: "What thinkest?"</p>
<p>When I made answer, I began: "Alas!<br/>
    How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,<br/>
    Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!"</p>
<p>Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,<br/>
    And I began: "Thine agonies, Francesca,<br/>
    Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.</p>
<p>But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,<br/>
    By what and in what manner Love conceded,<br/>
    That you should know your dubious desires?"</p>
<p>And she to me: "There is no greater sorrow<br/>
    Than to be mindful of the happy time<br/>
    In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.</p>
<p>But, if to recognise the earliest root<br/>
    Of love in us thou hast so great desire,<br/>
    I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.</p>
<p>One day we reading were for our delight<br/>
    Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.<br/>
    Alone we were and without any fear.</p>
<p>Full many a time our eyes together drew<br/>
    That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;<br/>
    But one point only was it that o'ercame us.</p>
<p>When as we read of the much-longed-for smile<br/>
    Being by such a noble lover kissed,<br/>
    This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,</p>
<p>Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.<br/>
    Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.<br/>
    That day no farther did we read therein."</p>
<p>And all the while one spirit uttered this,<br/>
    The other one did weep so, that, for pity,<br/>
    I swooned away as if I had been dying,</p>
<p>And fell, even as a dead body falls.</p>

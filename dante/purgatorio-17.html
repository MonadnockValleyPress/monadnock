<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XVII</h3>
<p>Remember, Reader, if e'er in the Alps<br/>
    A mist o'ertook thee, through which thou couldst see<br/>
    Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,</p>
<p>How, when the vapours humid and condensed<br/>
    Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere<br/>
    Of the sun feebly enters in among them,</p>
<p>And thy imagination will be swift<br/>
    In coming to perceive how I re-saw<br/>
    The sun at first, that was already setting.</p>
<p>Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master<br/>
    Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud<br/>
    To rays already dead on the low shores.</p>
<p>O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us<br/>
    So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,<br/>
    Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,</p>
<p>Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?<br/>
    Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,<br/>
    By self, or by a will that downward guides it.</p>
<p>Of her impiety, who changed her form<br/>
    Into the bird that most delights in singing,<br/>
    In my imagining appeared the trace;</p>
<p>And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn<br/>
    Within itself, that from without there came<br/>
    Nothing that then might be received by it.</p>
<p>Then reigned within my lofty fantasy<br/>
    One crucified, disdainful and ferocious<br/>
    In countenance, and even thus was dying.</p>
<p>Around him were the great Ahasuerus,<br/>
    Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,<br/>
    Who was in word and action so entire.</p>
<p>And even as this image burst asunder<br/>
    Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble<br/>
    In which the water it was made of fails,</p>
<p>There rose up in my vision a young maiden<br/>
    Bitterly weeping, and she said: "O queen,<br/>
    Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?</p>
<p>Thou'st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;<br/>
    Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,<br/>
    Mother, at thine ere at another's ruin."</p>
<p>As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden<br/>
    New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,<br/>
    And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,</p>
<p>So this imagining of mine fell down<br/>
    As soon as the effulgence smote my face,<br/>
    Greater by far than what is in our wont.</p>
<p>I turned me round to see where I might be,<br/>
    When said a voice, "Here is the passage up;"<br/>
    Which from all other purposes removed me,</p>
<p>And made my wish so full of eagerness<br/>
    To look and see who was it that was speaking,<br/>
    It never rests till meeting face to face;</p>
<p>But as before the sun, which quells the sight,<br/>
    And in its own excess its figure veils,<br/>
    Even so my power was insufficient here.</p>
<p>"This is a spirit divine, who in the way<br/>
    Of going up directs us without asking,<br/>
    And who with his own light himself conceals.</p>
<p>He does with us as man doth with himself;<br/>
    For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,<br/>
    Malignly leans already tow'rds denial.</p>
<p>Accord we now our feet to such inviting,<br/>
    Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;<br/>
    For then we could not till the day return."</p>
<p>Thus my Conductor said; and I and he<br/>
    Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;<br/>
    And I, as soon as the first step I reached,</p>
<p>Near me perceived a motion as of wings,<br/>
    And fanning in the face, and saying, "'Beati<br/>
    Pacifici,' who are without ill anger."</p>
<p>Already over us were so uplifted<br/>
    The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,<br/>
    That upon many sides the stars appeared.</p>
<p>"O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?"<br/>
    I said within myself; for I perceived<br/>
    The vigour of my legs was put in truce.</p>
<p>We at the point were where no more ascends<br/>
    The stairway upward, and were motionless,<br/>
    Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;</p>
<p>And I gave heed a little, if I might hear<br/>
    Aught whatsoever in the circle new;<br/>
    Then to my Master turned me round and said:</p>
<p>"Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency<br/>
    Is purged here in the circle where we are?<br/>
    Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech."</p>
<p>And he to me: "The love of good, remiss<br/>
    In what it should have done, is here restored;<br/>
    Here plied again the ill-belated oar;</p>
<p>But still more openly to understand,<br/>
    Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather<br/>
    Some profitable fruit from our delay.</p>
<p>Neither Creator nor a creature ever,<br/>
    Son," he began, "was destitute of love<br/>
    Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.</p>
<p>The natural was ever without error;<br/>
    But err the other may by evil object,<br/>
    Or by too much, or by too little vigour.</p>
<p>While in the first it well directed is,<br/>
    And in the second moderates itself,<br/>
    It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;</p>
<p>But when to ill it turns, and, with more care<br/>
    Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,<br/>
    'Gainst the Creator works his own creation.</p>
<p>Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be<br/>
    The seed within yourselves of every virtue,<br/>
    And every act that merits punishment.</p>
<p>Now inasmuch as never from the welfare<br/>
    Of its own subject can love turn its sight,<br/>
    From their own hatred all things are secure;</p>
<p>And since we cannot think of any being<br/>
    Standing alone, nor from the First divided,<br/>
    Of hating Him is all desire cut off.</p>
<p>Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,<br/>
    The evil that one loves is of one's neighbour,<br/>
    And this is born in three modes in your clay.</p>
<p>There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,<br/>
    Hope to excel, and therefore only long<br/>
    That from his greatness he may be cast down;</p>
<p>There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown<br/>
    Fear they may lose because another rises,<br/>
    Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;</p>
<p>And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,<br/>
    So that it makes them greedy for revenge,<br/>
    And such must needs shape out another's harm.</p>
<p>This threefold love is wept for down below;<br/>
    Now of the other will I have thee hear,<br/>
    That runneth after good with measure faulty.</p>
<p>Each one confusedly a good conceives<br/>
    Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;<br/>
    Therefore to overtake it each one strives.</p>
<p>If languid love to look on this attract you,<br/>
    Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,<br/>
    After just penitence, torments you for it.</p>
<p>There's other good that does not make man happy;<br/>
    'Tis not felicity, 'tis not the good<br/>
    Essence, of every good the fruit and root.</p>
<p>The love that yields itself too much to this<br/>
    Above us is lamented in three circles;<br/>
    But how tripartite it may be described,</p>
<p>I say not, that thou seek it for thyself."</p>

<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto VI</h3>
<p>Whene'er is broken up the game of Zara,<br/>
    He who has lost remains behind despondent,<br/>
    The throws repeating, and in sadness learns;</p>
<p>The people with the other all depart;<br/>
    One goes in front, and one behind doth pluck him,<br/>
    And at his side one brings himself to mind;</p>
<p>He pauses not, and this and that one hears;<br/>
    They crowd no more to whom his hand he stretches,<br/>
    And from the throng he thus defends himself.</p>
<p>Even such was I in that dense multitude,<br/>
    Turning to them this way and that my face,<br/>
    And, promising, I freed myself therefrom.</p>
<p>There was the Aretine, who from the arms<br/>
    Untamed of Ghin di Tacco had his death,<br/>
    And he who fleeing from pursuit was drowned.</p>
<p>There was imploring with his hands outstretched<br/>
    Frederick Novello, and that one of Pisa<br/>
    Who made the good Marzucco seem so strong.</p>
<p>I saw Count Orso; and the soul divided<br/>
    By hatred and by envy from its body,<br/>
    As it declared, and not for crime committed,</p>
<p>Pierre de la Brosse I say; and here provide<br/>
    While still on earth the Lady of Brabant,<br/>
    So that for this she be of no worse flock!</p>
<p>As soon as I was free from all those shades<br/>
    Who only prayed that some one else may pray,<br/>
    So as to hasten their becoming holy,</p>
<p>Began I: "It appears that thou deniest,<br/>
    O light of mine, expressly in some text,<br/>
    That orison can bend decree of Heaven;</p>
<p>And ne'ertheless these people pray for this.<br/>
    Might then their expectation bootless be?<br/>
    Or is to me thy saying not quite clear?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "My writing is explicit,<br/>
    And not fallacious is the hope of these,<br/>
    If with sane intellect 'tis well regarded;</p>
<p>For top of judgment doth not vail itself,<br/>
    Because the fire of love fulfils at once<br/>
    What he must satisfy who here installs him.</p>
<p>And there, where I affirmed that proposition,<br/>
    Defect was not amended by a prayer,<br/>
    Because the prayer from God was separate.</p>
<p>Verily, in so deep a questioning<br/>
    Do not decide, unless she tell it thee,<br/>
    Who light 'twixt truth and intellect shall be.</p>
<p>I know not if thou understand; I speak<br/>
    Of Beatrice; her shalt thou see above,<br/>
    Smiling and happy, on this mountain's top."</p>
<p>And I: "Good Leader, let us make more haste,<br/>
    For I no longer tire me as before;<br/>
    And see, e'en now the hill a shadow casts."</p>
<p>"We will go forward with this day" he answered,<br/>
    "As far as now is possible for us;<br/>
    But otherwise the fact is than thou thinkest.</p>
<p>Ere thou art up there, thou shalt see return<br/>
    Him, who now hides himself behind the hill,<br/>
    So that thou dost not interrupt his rays.</p>
<p>But yonder there behold! a soul that stationed<br/>
    All, all alone is looking hitherward;<br/>
    It will point out to us the quickest way."</p>
<p>We came up unto it; O Lombard soul,<br/>
    How lofty and disdainful thou didst bear thee,<br/>
    And grand and slow in moving of thine eyes!</p>
<p>Nothing whatever did it say to us,<br/>
    But let us go our way, eying us only<br/>
    After the manner of a couchant lion;</p>
<p>Still near to it Virgilius drew, entreating<br/>
    That it would point us out the best ascent;<br/>
    And it replied not unto his demand,</p>
<p>But of our native land and of our life<br/>
    It questioned us; and the sweet Guide began:<br/>
    "Mantua,"&mdash;and the shade, all in itself recluse,</p>
<p>Rose tow'rds him from the place where first it was,<br/>
    Saying: "O Mantuan, I am Sordello<br/>
    Of thine own land!" and one embraced the other.</p>
<p>Ah! servile Italy, grief's hostelry!<br/>
    A ship without a pilot in great tempest!<br/>
    No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel!</p>
<p>That noble soul was so impatient, only<br/>
    At the sweet sound of his own native land,<br/>
    To make its citizen glad welcome there;</p>
<p>And now within thee are not without war<br/>
    Thy living ones, and one doth gnaw the other<br/>
    Of those whom one wall and one fosse shut in!</p>
<p>Search, wretched one, all round about the shores<br/>
    Thy seaboard, and then look within thy bosom,<br/>
    If any part of thee enjoyeth peace!</p>
<p>What boots it, that for thee Justinian<br/>
    The bridle mend, if empty be the saddle?<br/>
    Withouten this the shame would be the less.</p>
<p>Ah! people, thou that oughtest to be devout,<br/>
    And to let Caesar sit upon the saddle,<br/>
    If well thou hearest what God teacheth thee,</p>
<p>Behold how fell this wild beast has become,<br/>
    Being no longer by the spur corrected,<br/>
    Since thou hast laid thy hand upon the bridle.</p>
<p>O German Albert! who abandonest<br/>
    Her that has grown recalcitrant and savage,<br/>
    And oughtest to bestride her saddle-bow,</p>
<p>May a just judgment from the stars down fall<br/>
    Upon thy blood, and be it new and open,<br/>
    That thy successor may have fear thereof;</p>
<p>Because thy father and thyself have suffered,<br/>
    By greed of those transalpine lands distrained,<br/>
    The garden of the empire to be waste.</p>
<p>Come and behold Montecchi and Cappelletti,<br/>
    Monaldi and Fillippeschi, careless man!<br/>
    Those sad already, and these doubt-depressed!</p>
<p>Come, cruel one! come and behold the oppression<br/>
    Of thy nobility, and cure their wounds,<br/>
    And thou shalt see how safe is Santafiore!</p>
<p>Come and behold thy Rome, that is lamenting,<br/>
    Widowed, alone, and day and night exclaims,<br/>
    "My Caesar, why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>
<p>Come and behold how loving are the people;<br/>
    And if for us no pity moveth thee,<br/>
    Come and be made ashamed of thy renown!</p>
<p>And if it lawful be, O Jove Supreme!<br/>
    Who upon earth for us wast crucified,<br/>
    Are thy just eyes averted otherwhere?</p>
<p>Or preparation is 't, that, in the abyss<br/>
    Of thine own counsel, for some good thou makest<br/>
    From our perception utterly cut off?</p>
<p>For all the towns of Italy are full<br/>
    Of tyrants, and becometh a Marcellus<br/>
    Each peasant churl who plays the partisan!</p>
<p>My Florence! well mayst thou contented be<br/>
    With this digression, which concerns thee not,<br/>
    Thanks to thy people who such forethought take!</p>
<p>Many at heart have justice, but shoot slowly,<br/>
    That unadvised they come not to the bow,<br/>
    But on their very lips thy people have it!</p>
<p>Many refuse to bear the common burden;<br/>
    But thy solicitous people answereth<br/>
    Without being asked, and crieth: "I submit."</p>
<p>Now be thou joyful, for thou hast good reason;<br/>
    Thou affluent, thou in peace, thou full of wisdom!<br/>
    If I speak true, the event conceals it not.</p>
<p>Athens and Lacedaemon, they who made<br/>
    The ancient laws, and were so civilized,<br/>
    Made towards living well a little sign</p>
<p>Compared with thee, who makest such fine-spun<br/>
    Provisions, that to middle of November<br/>
    Reaches not what thou in October spinnest.</p>
<p>How oft, within the time of thy remembrance,<br/>
    Laws, money, offices, and usages<br/>
    Hast thou remodelled, and renewed thy members?</p>
<p>And if thou mind thee well, and see the light,<br/>
    Thou shalt behold thyself like a sick woman,<br/>
    Who cannot find repose upon her down,</p>
<p>But by her tossing wardeth off her pain.</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto I</h3>
<p>Midway upon the journey of our life<br/>
    I found myself within a forest dark,<br/>
    For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</p>
<p>Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say<br/>
    What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,<br/>
    Which in the very thought renews the fear.</p>
<p>So bitter is it, death is little more;<br/>
    But of the good to treat, which there I found,<br/>
    Speak will I of the other things I saw there.</p>
<p>I cannot well repeat how there I entered,<br/>
    So full was I of slumber at the moment<br/>
    In which I had abandoned the true way.</p>
<p>But after I had reached a mountain's foot,<br/>
    At that point where the valley terminated,<br/>
    Which had with consternation pierced my heart,</p>
<p>Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,<br/>
    Vested already with that planet's rays<br/>
    Which leadeth others right by every road.</p>
<p>Then was the fear a little quieted<br/>
    That in my heart's lake had endured throughout<br/>
    The night, which I had passed so piteously.</p>
<p>And even as he, who, with distressful breath,<br/>
    Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,<br/>
    Turns to the water perilous and gazes;</p>
<p>So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,<br/>
    Turn itself back to re-behold the pass<br/>
    Which never yet a living person left.</p>
<p>After my weary body I had rested,<br/>
    The way resumed I on the desert slope,<br/>
    So that the firm foot ever was the lower.</p>
<p>And lo! almost where the ascent began,<br/>
    A panther light and swift exceedingly,<br/>
    Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!</p>
<p>And never moved she from before my face,<br/>
    Nay, rather did impede so much my way,<br/>
    That many times I to return had turned.</p>
<p>The time was the beginning of the morning,<br/>
    And up the sun was mounting with those stars<br/>
    That with him were, what time the Love Divine</p>
<p>At first in motion set those beauteous things;<br/>
    So were to me occasion of good hope,<br/>
    The variegated skin of that wild beast,</p>
<p>The hour of time, and the delicious season;<br/>
    But not so much, that did not give me fear<br/>
    A lion's aspect which appeared to me.</p>
<p>He seemed as if against me he were coming<br/>
    With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,<br/>
    So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;</p>
<p>And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings<br/>
    Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,<br/>
    And many folk has caused to live forlorn!</p>
<p>She brought upon me so much heaviness,<br/>
    With the affright that from her aspect came,<br/>
    That I the hope relinquished of the height.</p>
<p>And as he is who willingly acquires,<br/>
    And the time comes that causes him to lose,<br/>
    Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,</p>
<p>E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,<br/>
    Which, coming on against me by degrees<br/>
    Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.</p>
<p>While I was rushing downward to the lowland,<br/>
    Before mine eyes did one present himself,<br/>
    Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.</p>
<p>When I beheld him in the desert vast,<br/>
    "Have pity on me," unto him I cried,<br/>
    "Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!"</p>
<p>He answered me: "Not man; man once I was,<br/>
    And both my parents were of Lombardy,<br/>
    And Mantuans by country both of them.</p>
<p>'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,<br/>
    And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,<br/>
    During the time of false and lying gods.</p>
<p>A poet was I, and I sang that just<br/>
    Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,<br/>
    After that Ilion the superb was burned.</p>
<p>But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?<br/>
    Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,<br/>
    Which is the source and cause of every joy?"</p>
<p>"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain<br/>
    Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?"<br/>
    I made response to him with bashful forehead.</p>
<p>"O, of the other poets honour and light,<br/>
    Avail me the long study and great love<br/>
    That have impelled me to explore thy volume!</p>
<p>Thou art my master, and my author thou,<br/>
    Thou art alone the one from whom I took<br/>
    The beautiful style that has done honour to me.</p>
<p>Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;<br/>
    Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,<br/>
    For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble."</p>
<p>"Thee it behoves to take another road,"<br/>
    Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,<br/>
    "If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;</p>
<p>Because this beast, at which thou criest out,<br/>
    Suffers not any one to pass her way,<br/>
    But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;</p>
<p>And has a nature so malign and ruthless,<br/>
    That never doth she glut her greedy will,<br/>
    And after food is hungrier than before.</p>
<p>Many the animals with whom she weds,<br/>
    And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound<br/>
    Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.</p>
<p>He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,<br/>
    But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;<br/>
    'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;</p>
<p>Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,<br/>
    On whose account the maid Camilla died,<br/>
    Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;</p>
<p>Through every city shall he hunt her down,<br/>
    Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,<br/>
    There from whence envy first did let her loose.</p>
<p>Therefore I think and judge it for thy best<br/>
    Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,<br/>
    And lead thee hence through the eternal place,</p>
<p>Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,<br/>
    Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,<br/>
    Who cry out each one for the second death;</p>
<p>And thou shalt see those who contented are<br/>
    Within the fire, because they hope to come,<br/>
    Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;</p>
<p>To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,<br/>
    A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;<br/>
    With her at my departure I will leave thee;</p>
<p>Because that Emperor, who reigns above,<br/>
    In that I was rebellious to his law,<br/>
    Wills that through me none come into his city.</p>
<p>He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;<br/>
    There is his city and his lofty throne;<br/>
    O happy he whom thereto he elects!"</p>
<p>And I to him: "Poet, I thee entreat,<br/>
    By that same God whom thou didst never know,<br/>
    So that I may escape this woe and worse,</p>
<p>Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,<br/>
    That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,<br/>
    And those thou makest so disconsolate."</p>
<p>Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</p>

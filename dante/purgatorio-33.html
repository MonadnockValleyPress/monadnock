<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXXIII</h3>
<p>"Deus venerunt gentes," alternating<br/>
    Now three, now four, melodious psalmody<br/>
    The maidens in the midst of tears began;</p>
<p>And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,<br/>
    Listened to them with such a countenance,<br/>
    That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.</p>
<p>But when the other virgins place had given<br/>
    For her to speak, uprisen to her feet<br/>
    With colour as of fire, she made response:</p>
<p>"'Modicum, et non videbitis me;<br/>
    Et iterum,' my sisters predilect,<br/>
    'Modicum, et vos videbitis me.'"</p>
<p>Then all the seven in front of her she placed;<br/>
    And after her, by beckoning only, moved<br/>
    Me and the lady and the sage who stayed.</p>
<p>So she moved onward; and I do not think<br/>
    That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,<br/>
    When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote,</p>
<p>And with a tranquil aspect, "Come more quickly,"<br/>
    To me she said, "that, if I speak with thee,<br/>
    To listen to me thou mayst be well placed."</p>
<p>As soon as I was with her as I should be,<br/>
    She said to me: "Why, brother, dost thou not<br/>
    Venture to question now, in coming with me?"</p>
<p>As unto those who are too reverential,<br/>
    Speaking in presence of superiors,<br/>
    Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,</p>
<p>It me befell, that without perfect sound<br/>
    Began I: "My necessity, Madonna,<br/>
    You know, and that which thereunto is good."</p>
<p>And she to me: "Of fear and bashfulness<br/>
    Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,<br/>
    So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.</p>
<p>Know that the vessel which the serpent broke<br/>
    Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty<br/>
    Think that God's vengeance does not fear a sop.</p>
<p>Without an heir shall not for ever be<br/>
    The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,<br/>
    Whence it became a monster, then a prey;</p>
<p>For verily I see, and hence narrate it,<br/>
    The stars already near to bring the time,<br/>
    From every hindrance safe, and every bar,</p>
<p>Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,<br/>
    One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman<br/>
    And that same giant who is sinning with her.</p>
<p>And peradventure my dark utterance,<br/>
    Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,<br/>
    Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;</p>
<p>But soon the facts shall be the Naiades<br/>
    Who shall this difficult enigma solve,<br/>
    Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.</p>
<p>Note thou; and even as by me are uttered<br/>
    These words, so teach them unto those who live<br/>
    That life which is a running unto death;</p>
<p>And bear in mind, whene'er thou writest them,<br/>
    Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,<br/>
    That twice already has been pillaged here.</p>
<p>Whoever pillages or shatters it,<br/>
    With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,<br/>
    Who made it holy for his use alone.</p>
<p>For biting that, in pain and in desire<br/>
    Five thousand years and more the first-born soul<br/>
    Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.</p>
<p>Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not<br/>
    For special reason so pre-eminent<br/>
    In height, and so inverted in its summit.</p>
<p>And if thy vain imaginings had not been<br/>
    Water of Elsa round about thy mind,<br/>
    And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,</p>
<p>Thou by so many circumstances only<br/>
    The justice of the interdict of God<br/>
    Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.</p>
<p>But since I see thee in thine intellect<br/>
    Converted into stone and stained with sin,<br/>
    So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,</p>
<p>I will too, if not written, at least painted,<br/>
    Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason<br/>
    That cinct with palm the pilgrim's staff is borne."</p>
<p>And I: "As by a signet is the wax<br/>
    Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,<br/>
    My brain is now imprinted by yourself.</p>
<p>But wherefore so beyond my power of sight<br/>
    Soars your desirable discourse, that aye<br/>
    The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?"</p>
<p>"That thou mayst recognize," she said, "the school<br/>
    Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far<br/>
    Its doctrine follows after my discourse,</p>
<p>And mayst behold your path from the divine<br/>
    Distant as far as separated is<br/>
    From earth the heaven that highest hastens on."</p>
<p>Whence her I answered: "I do not remember<br/>
    That ever I estranged myself from you,<br/>
    Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me."</p>
<p>"And if thou art not able to remember,"<br/>
    Smiling she answered, "recollect thee now<br/>
    That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;</p>
<p>And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,<br/>
    Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates<br/>
    Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.</p>
<p>Truly from this time forward shall my words<br/>
    Be naked, so far as it is befitting<br/>
    To lay them open unto thy rude gaze."</p>
<p>And more coruscant and with slower steps<br/>
    The sun was holding the meridian circle,<br/>
    Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there</p>
<p>When halted (as he cometh to a halt,<br/>
    Who goes before a squadron as its escort,<br/>
    If something new he find upon his way)</p>
<p>The ladies seven at a dark shadow's edge,<br/>
    Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,<br/>
    The Alp upon its frigid border wears.</p>
<p>In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates<br/>
    Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,<br/>
    And slowly part, like friends, from one another.</p>
<p>"O light, O glory of the human race!<br/>
    What stream is this which here unfolds itself<br/>
    From out one source, and from itself withdraws?"</p>
<p>For such a prayer, 'twas said unto me, "Pray<br/>
    Matilda that she tell thee;" and here answered,<br/>
    As one does who doth free himself from blame,</p>
<p>The beautiful lady: "This and other things<br/>
    Were told to him by me; and sure I am<br/>
    The water of Lethe has not hid them from him."</p>
<p>And Beatrice: "Perhaps a greater care,<br/>
    Which oftentimes our memory takes away,<br/>
    Has made the vision of his mind obscure.</p>
<p>But Eunoe behold, that yonder rises;<br/>
    Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,<br/>
    Revive again the half-dead virtue in him."</p>
<p>Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,<br/>
    But makes its own will of another's will<br/>
    As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,</p>
<p>Even so, when she had taken hold of me,<br/>
    The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius<br/>
    Said, in her womanly manner, "Come with him."</p>
<p>If, Reader, I possessed a longer space<br/>
    For writing it, I yet would sing in part<br/>
    Of the sweet draught that ne'er would satiate me;</p>
<p>But inasmuch as full are all the leaves<br/>
    Made ready for this second canticle,<br/>
    The curb of art no farther lets me go.</p>
<p>From the most holy water I returned<br/>
    Regenerate, in the manner of new trees<br/>
    That are renewed with a new foliage,</p>
<p>Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.</p>

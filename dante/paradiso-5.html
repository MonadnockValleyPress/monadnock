<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto V</h3>
<p>"If in the heat of love I flame upon thee<br/>
    Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,<br/>
    So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,</p>
<p>Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds<br/>
    From perfect sight, which as it apprehends<br/>
    To the good apprehended moves its feet.</p>
<p>Well I perceive how is already shining<br/>
    Into thine intellect the eternal light,<br/>
    That only seen enkindles always love;</p>
<p>And if some other thing your love seduce,<br/>
    'Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,<br/>
    Ill understood, which there is shining through.</p>
<p>Thou fain wouldst know if with another service<br/>
    For broken vow can such return be made<br/>
    As to secure the soul from further claim."</p>
<p>This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;<br/>
    And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,<br/>
    Continued thus her holy argument:</p>
<p>"The greatest gift that in his largess God<br/>
    Creating made, and unto his own goodness<br/>
    Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize</p>
<p>Most highly, is the freedom of the will,<br/>
    Wherewith the creatures of intelligence<br/>
    Both all and only were and are endowed.</p>
<p>Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,<br/>
    The high worth of a vow, if it he made<br/>
    So that when thou consentest God consents:</p>
<p>For, closing between God and man the compact,<br/>
    A sacrifice is of this treasure made,<br/>
    Such as I say, and made by its own act.</p>
<p>What can be rendered then as compensation?<br/>
    Think'st thou to make good use of what thou'st offered,<br/>
    With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.</p>
<p>Now art thou certain of the greater point;<br/>
    But because Holy Church in this dispenses,<br/>
    Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,</p>
<p>Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,<br/>
    Because the solid food which thou hast taken<br/>
    Requireth further aid for thy digestion.</p>
<p>Open thy mind to that which I reveal,<br/>
    And fix it there within; for 'tis not knowledge,<br/>
    The having heard without retaining it.</p>
<p>In the essence of this sacrifice two things<br/>
    Convene together; and the one is that<br/>
    Of which 'tis made, the other is the agreement.</p>
<p>This last for evermore is cancelled not<br/>
    Unless complied with, and concerning this<br/>
    With such precision has above been spoken.</p>
<p>Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews<br/>
    To offer still, though sometimes what was offered<br/>
    Might be commuted, as thou ought'st to know.</p>
<p>The other, which is known to thee as matter,<br/>
    May well indeed be such that one errs not<br/>
    If it for other matter be exchanged.</p>
<p>But let none shift the burden on his shoulder<br/>
    At his arbitrament, without the turning<br/>
    Both of the white and of the yellow key;</p>
<p>And every permutation deem as foolish,<br/>
    If in the substitute the thing relinquished,<br/>
    As the four is in six, be not contained.</p>
<p>Therefore whatever thing has so great weight<br/>
    In value that it drags down every balance,<br/>
    Cannot be satisfied with other spending.</p>
<p>Let mortals never take a vow in jest;<br/>
    Be faithful and not blind in doing that,<br/>
    As Jephthah was in his first offering,</p>
<p>Whom more beseemed to say, 'I have done wrong,<br/>
    Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish<br/>
    Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,</p>
<p>Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,<br/>
    And made for her both wise and simple weep,<br/>
    Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.'</p>
<p>Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;<br/>
    Be ye not like a feather at each wind,<br/>
    And think not every water washes you.</p>
<p>Ye have the Old and the New Testament,<br/>
    And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you<br/>
    Let this suffice you unto your salvation.</p>
<p>If evil appetite cry aught else to you,<br/>
    Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,<br/>
    So that the Jew among you may not mock you.</p>
<p>Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon<br/>
    Its mother's milk, and frolicsome and simple<br/>
    Combats at its own pleasure with itself."</p>
<p>Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;<br/>
    Then all desireful turned herself again<br/>
    To that part where the world is most alive.</p>
<p>Her silence and her change of countenance<br/>
    Silence imposed upon my eager mind,<br/>
    That had already in advance new questions;</p>
<p>And as an arrow that upon the mark<br/>
    Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,<br/>
    So did we speed into the second realm.</p>
<p>My Lady there so joyful I beheld,<br/>
    As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,<br/>
    More luminous thereat the planet grew;</p>
<p>And if the star itself was changed and smiled,<br/>
    What became I, who by my nature am<br/>
    Exceeding mutable in every guise!</p>
<p>As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,<br/>
    The fishes draw to that which from without<br/>
    Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;</p>
<p>So I beheld more than a thousand splendours<br/>
    Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:<br/>
    "Lo, this is she who shall increase our love."</p>
<p>And as each one was coming unto us,<br/>
    Full of beatitude the shade was seen,<br/>
    By the effulgence clear that issued from it.</p>
<p>Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning<br/>
    No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have<br/>
    An agonizing need of knowing more;</p>
<p>And of thyself thou'lt see how I from these<br/>
    Was in desire of hearing their conditions,<br/>
    As they unto mine eyes were manifest.</p>
<p>"O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes<br/>
    To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,<br/>
    Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned</p>
<p>With light that through the whole of heaven is spread<br/>
    Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest<br/>
    To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee."</p>
<p>Thus by some one among those holy spirits<br/>
    Was spoken, and by Beatrice: "Speak, speak<br/>
    Securely, and believe them even as Gods."</p>
<p>"Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself<br/>
    In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,<br/>
    Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,</p>
<p>But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,<br/>
    Spirit august, thy station in the sphere<br/>
    That veils itself to men in alien rays."</p>
<p>This said I in direction of the light<br/>
    Which first had spoken to me; whence it became<br/>
    By far more lucent than it was before.</p>
<p>Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself<br/>
    By too much light, when heat has worn away<br/>
    The tempering influence of the vapours dense,</p>
<p>By greater rapture thus concealed itself<br/>
    In its own radiance the figure saintly,<br/>
    And thus close, close enfolded answered me</p>
<p>In fashion as the following Canto sings.</p>

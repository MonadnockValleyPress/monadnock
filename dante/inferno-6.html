<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto VI</h3>
<p>At the return of consciousness, that closed<br/>
    Before the pity of those two relations,<br/>
    Which utterly with sadness had confused me,</p>
<p>New torments I behold, and new tormented<br/>
    Around me, whichsoever way I move,<br/>
    And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.</p>
<p>In the third circle am I of the rain<br/>
    Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;<br/>
    Its law and quality are never new.</p>
<p>Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,<br/>
    Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;<br/>
    Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.</p>
<p>Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,<br/>
    With his three gullets like a dog is barking<br/>
    Over the people that are there submerged.</p>
<p>Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,<br/>
    And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;<br/>
    He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.</p>
<p>Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;<br/>
    One side they make a shelter for the other;<br/>
    Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.</p>
<p>When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!<br/>
     His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;<br/>
     Not a limb had he that was motionless.</p>
<p>And my Conductor, with his spans extended,<br/>
    Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,<br/>
    He threw it into those rapacious gullets.</p>
<p>Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,<br/>
    And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,<br/>
    For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,</p>
<p>The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed<br/>
    Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders<br/>
    Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.</p>
<p>We passed across the shadows, which subdues<br/>
    The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet<br/>
    Upon their vanity that person seems.</p>
<p>They all were lying prone upon the earth,<br/>
    Excepting one, who sat upright as soon<br/>
    As he beheld us passing on before him.</p>
<p>"O thou that art conducted through this Hell,"<br/>
    He said to me, "recall me, if thou canst;<br/>
    Thyself wast made before I was unmade."</p>
<p>And I to him: "The anguish which thou hast<br/>
    Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,<br/>
    So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.</p>
<p>But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful<br/>
    A place art put, and in such punishment,<br/>
    If some are greater, none is so displeasing."</p>
<p>And he to me: "Thy city, which is full<br/>
    Of envy so that now the sack runs over,<br/>
    Held me within it in the life serene.</p>
<p>You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;<br/>
    For the pernicious sin of gluttony<br/>
    I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.</p>
<p>And I, sad soul, am not the only one,<br/>
    For all these suffer the like penalty<br/>
    For the like sin;" and word no more spake he.</p>
<p>I answered him: "Ciacco, thy wretchedness<br/>
    Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;<br/>
    But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come</p>
<p>The citizens of the divided city;<br/>
    If any there be just; and the occasion<br/>
    Tell me why so much discord has assailed it."</p>
<p>And he to me: "They, after long contention,<br/>
    Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party<br/>
    Will drive the other out with much offence.</p>
<p>Then afterwards behoves it this one fall<br/>
    Within three suns, and rise again the other<br/>
    By force of him who now is on the coast.</p>
<p>High will it hold its forehead a long while,<br/>
    Keeping the other under heavy burdens,<br/>
    Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.</p>
<p>The just are two, and are not understood there;<br/>
    Envy and Arrogance and Avarice<br/>
    Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled."</p>
<p>Here ended he his tearful utterance;<br/>
    And I to him: "I wish thee still to teach me,<br/>
    And make a gift to me of further speech.</p>
<p>Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,<br/>
    Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,<br/>
    And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,</p>
<p>Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;<br/>
    For great desire constraineth me to learn<br/>
    If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom."</p>
<p>And he: "They are among the blacker souls;<br/>
    A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;<br/>
    If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.</p>
<p>But when thou art again in the sweet world,<br/>
    I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;<br/>
    No more I tell thee and no more I answer."</p>
<p>Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,<br/>
    Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;<br/>
    He fell therewith prone like the other blind.</p>
<p>And the Guide said to me: "He wakes no more<br/>
    This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;<br/>
    When shall approach the hostile Potentate,</p>
<p>Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,<br/>
    Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,<br/>
    Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes."</p>
<p>So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture<br/>
    Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,<br/>
    Touching a little on the future life.</p>
<p>Wherefore I said: "Master, these torments here,<br/>
    Will they increase after the mighty sentence,<br/>
    Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "Return unto thy science,<br/>
    Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,<br/>
    The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.</p>
<p>Albeit that this people maledict<br/>
    To true perfection never can attain,<br/>
    Hereafter more than now they look to be."</p>
<p>Round in a circle by that road we went,<br/>
    Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;<br/>
    We came unto the point where the descent is;</p>
<p>There we found Plutus the great enemy.</p>

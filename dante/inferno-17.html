<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XVII</h3>
<p>"Behold the monster with the pointed tail,<br/>
    Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,<br/>
    Behold him who infecteth all the world."</p>
<p>Thus unto me my Guide began to say,<br/>
    And beckoned him that he should come to shore,<br/>
    Near to the confine of the trodden marble;</p>
<p>And that uncleanly image of deceit<br/>
    Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,<br/>
    But on the border did not drag its tail.</p>
<p>The face was as the face of a just man,<br/>
    Its semblance outwardly was so benign,<br/>
    And of a serpent all the trunk beside.</p>
<p>Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;<br/>
    The back, and breast, and both the sides it had<br/>
    Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.</p>
<p>With colours more, groundwork or broidery<br/>
    Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,<br/>
    Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.</p>
<p>As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,<br/>
    That part are in the water, part on land;<br/>
    And as among the guzzling Germans there,</p>
<p>The beaver plants himself to wage his war;<br/>
    So that vile monster lay upon the border,<br/>
    Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.</p>
<p>His tail was wholly quivering in the void,<br/>
    Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,<br/>
    That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.</p>
<p>The Guide said: "Now perforce must turn aside<br/>
    Our way a little, even to that beast<br/>
    Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him."</p>
<p>We therefore on the right side descended,<br/>
    And made ten steps upon the outer verge,<br/>
    Completely to avoid the sand and flame;</p>
<p>And after we are come to him, I see<br/>
    A little farther off upon the sand<br/>
    A people sitting near the hollow place.</p>
<p>Then said to me the Master: "So that full<br/>
    Experience of this round thou bear away,<br/>
    Now go and see what their condition is.</p>
<p>There let thy conversation be concise;<br/>
    Till thou returnest I will speak with him,<br/>
    That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders."</p>
<p>Thus farther still upon the outermost<br/>
    Head of that seventh circle all alone<br/>
    I went, where sat the melancholy folk.</p>
<p>Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;<br/>
    This way, that way, they helped them with their hands<br/>
    Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.</p>
<p>Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,<br/>
    Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when<br/>
    By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.</p>
<p>When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces<br/>
    Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,<br/>
    Not one of them I knew; but I perceived</p>
<p>That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,<br/>
    Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;<br/>
    And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.</p>
<p>And as I gazing round me come among them,<br/>
    Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw<br/>
    That had the face and posture of a lion.</p>
<p>Proceeding then the current of my sight,<br/>
    Another of them saw I, red as blood,<br/>
    Display a goose more white than butter is.</p>
<p>And one, who with an azure sow and gravid<br/>
    Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,<br/>
    Said unto me: "What dost thou in this moat?</p>
<p>Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,<br/>
    Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,<br/>
    Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.</p>
<p>A Paduan am I with these Florentines;<br/>
    Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,<br/>
    Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,</p>
<p>He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'"<br/>
    Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust<br/>
    His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.</p>
<p>And fearing lest my longer stay might vex<br/>
    Him who had warned me not to tarry long,<br/>
    Backward I turned me from those weary souls.</p>
<p>I found my Guide, who had already mounted<br/>
    Upon the back of that wild animal,<br/>
    And said to me: "Now be both strong and bold.</p>
<p>Now we descend by stairways such as these;<br/>
    Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,<br/>
    So that the tail may have no power to harm thee."</p>
<p>Such as he is who has so near the ague<br/>
    Of quartan that his nails are blue already,<br/>
    And trembles all, but looking at the shade;</p>
<p>Even such became I at those proffered words;<br/>
    But shame in me his menaces produced,<br/>
    Which maketh servant strong before good master.</p>
<p>I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;<br/>
    I wished to say, and yet the voice came not<br/>
    As I believed, "Take heed that thou embrace me."</p>
<p>But he, who other times had rescued me<br/>
    In other peril, soon as I had mounted,<br/>
    Within his arms encircled and sustained me,</p>
<p>And said: "Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;<br/>
    The circles large, and the descent be little;<br/>
    Think of the novel burden which thou hast."</p>
<p>Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,<br/>
    Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;<br/>
    And when he wholly felt himself afloat,</p>
<p>There where his breast had been he turned his tail,<br/>
    And that extended like an eel he moved,<br/>
    And with his paws drew to himself the air.</p>
<p>A greater fear I do not think there was<br/>
    What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,<br/>
    Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;</p>
<p>Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks<br/>
    Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,<br/>
    His father crying, "An ill way thou takest!"</p>
<p>Than was my own, when I perceived myself<br/>
    On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished<br/>
    The sight of everything but of the monster.</p>
<p>Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;<br/>
    Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only<br/>
    By wind upon my face and from below.</p>
<p>I heard already on the right the whirlpool<br/>
    Making a horrible crashing under us;<br/>
    Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.</p>
<p>Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;<br/>
    Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,<br/>
    Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.</p>
<p>I saw then, for before I had not seen it,<br/>
    The turning and descending, by great horrors<br/>
    That were approaching upon divers sides.</p>
<p>As falcon who has long been on the wing,<br/>
    Who, without seeing either lure or bird,<br/>
    Maketh the falconer say, "Ah me, thou stoopest,"</p>
<p>Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,<br/>
    Thorough a hundred circles, and alights<br/>
    Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;</p>
<p>Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,<br/>
    Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,<br/>
    And being disencumbered of our persons,</p>
<p>He sped away as arrow from the string.</p>

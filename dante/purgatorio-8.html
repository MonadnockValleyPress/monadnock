<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto VIII</h3>
<p>'Twas now the hour that turneth back desire<br/>
    In those who sail the sea, and melts the heart,<br/>
    The day they've said to their sweet friends farewell,</p>
<p>And the new pilgrim penetrates with love,<br/>
    If he doth hear from far away a bell<br/>
    That seemeth to deplore the dying day,</p>
<p>When I began to make of no avail<br/>
    My hearing, and to watch one of the souls<br/>
    Uprisen, that begged attention with its hand.</p>
<p>It joined and lifted upward both its palms,<br/>
    Fixing its eyes upon the orient,<br/>
    As if it said to God, "Naught else I care for."</p>
<p>"Te lucis ante" so devoutly issued<br/>
    Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes,<br/>
    It made me issue forth from my own mind.</p>
<p>And then the others, sweetly and devoutly,<br/>
    Accompanied it through all the hymn entire,<br/>
    Having their eyes on the supernal wheels.</p>
<p>Here, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth,<br/>
    For now indeed so subtile is the veil,<br/>
    Surely to penetrate within is easy.</p>
<p>I saw that army of the gentle-born<br/>
    Thereafterward in silence upward gaze,<br/>
    As if in expectation, pale and humble;</p>
<p>And from on high come forth and down descend,<br/>
    I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,<br/>
    Truncated and deprived of their points.</p>
<p>Green as the little leaflets just now born<br/>
    Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions<br/>
    Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.</p>
<p>One just above us came to take his station,<br/>
    And one descended to the opposite bank,<br/>
    So that the people were contained between them.</p>
<p>Clearly in them discerned I the blond head;<br/>
    But in their faces was the eye bewildered,<br/>
    As faculty confounded by excess.</p>
<p>"From Mary's bosom both of them have come,"<br/>
    Sordello said, "as guardians of the valley<br/>
    Against the serpent, that will come anon."</p>
<p>Whereupon I, who knew not by what road,<br/>
    Turned round about, and closely drew myself,<br/>
    Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.</p>
<p>And once again Sordello: "Now descend we<br/>
    'Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;<br/>
    Right pleasant will it be for them to see you."</p>
<p>Only three steps I think that I descended,<br/>
    And was below, and saw one who was looking<br/>
    Only at me, as if he fain would know me.</p>
<p>Already now the air was growing dark,<br/>
    But not so that between his eyes and mine<br/>
    It did not show what it before locked up.</p>
<p>Tow'rds me he moved, and I tow'rds him did move;<br/>
    Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,<br/>
    When I beheld thee not among the damned!</p>
<p>No greeting fair was left unsaid between us;<br/>
    Then asked he: "How long is it since thou camest<br/>
    O'er the far waters to the mountain's foot?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" said I to him, "through the dismal places<br/>
    I came this morn; and am in the first life,<br/>
    Albeit the other, going thus, I gain."</p>
<p>And on the instant my reply was heard,<br/>
    He and Sordello both shrank back from me,<br/>
    Like people who are suddenly bewildered.</p>
<p>One to Virgilius, and the other turned<br/>
    To one who sat there, crying, "Up, Currado!<br/>
    Come and behold what God in grace has willed!"</p>
<p>Then, turned to me: "By that especial grace<br/>
    Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals<br/>
    His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,</p>
<p>When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,<br/>
    Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,<br/>
    Where answer to the innocent is made.</p>
<p>I do not think her mother loves me more,<br/>
    Since she has laid aside her wimple white,<br/>
    Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.</p>
<p>Through her full easily is comprehended<br/>
    How long in woman lasts the fire of love,<br/>
    If eye or touch do not relight it often.</p>
<p>So fair a hatchment will not make for her<br/>
    The Viper marshalling the Milanese<br/>
    A-field, as would have made Gallura's Cock."</p>
<p>In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed<br/>
    Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal<br/>
    Which measurably burneth in the heart.</p>
<p>My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,<br/>
    Still to that point where slowest are the stars,<br/>
    Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.</p>
<p>And my Conductor: "Son, what dost thou gaze at<br/>
    Up there?" And I to him: "At those three torches<br/>
    With which this hither pole is all on fire."</p>
<p>And he to me: "The four resplendent stars<br/>
    Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,<br/>
    And these have mounted up to where those were."</p>
<p>As he was speaking, to himself Sordello<br/>
    Drew him, and said, "Lo there our Adversary!"<br/>
    And pointed with his finger to look thither.</p>
<p>Upon the side on which the little valley<br/>
    No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance<br/>
    The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.</p>
<p>'Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,<br/>
    Turning at times its head about, and licking<br/>
    Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.</p>
<p>I did not see, and therefore cannot say<br/>
    How the celestial falcons 'gan to move,<br/>
    But well I saw that they were both in motion.</p>
<p>Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,<br/>
    The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,<br/>
    Up to their stations flying back alike.</p>
<p>The shade that to the Judge had near approached<br/>
    When he had called, throughout that whole assault<br/>
    Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.</p>
<p>"So may the light that leadeth thee on high<br/>
    Find in thine own free-will as much of wax<br/>
    As needful is up to the highest azure,"</p>
<p>Began it, "if some true intelligence<br/>
    Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood<br/>
    Thou knowest, tell it me, who once was great there.</p>
<p>Currado Malaspina was I called;<br/>
    I'm not the elder, but from him descended;<br/>
    To mine I bore the love which here refineth."</p>
<p>"O," said I unto him, "through your domains<br/>
    I never passed, but where is there a dwelling<br/>
    Throughout all Europe, where they are not known?</p>
<p>That fame, which doeth honour to your house,<br/>
    Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,<br/>
    So that he knows of them who ne'er was there.</p>
<p>And, as I hope for heaven, I swear to you<br/>
    Your honoured family in naught abates<br/>
    The glory of the purse and of the sword.</p>
<p>It is so privileged by use and nature,<br/>
    That though a guilty head misguide the world,<br/>
    Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way."</p>
<p>And he: "Now go; for the sun shall not lie<br/>
    Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram<br/>
    With all his four feet covers and bestrides,</p>
<p>Before that such a courteous opinion<br/>
    Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed<br/>
    With greater nails than of another's speech,</p>
<p>Unless the course of justice standeth still."</p>

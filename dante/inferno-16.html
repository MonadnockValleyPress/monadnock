<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XVI</h3>
<p>Now was I where was heard the reverberation<br/>
    Of water falling into the next round,<br/>
    Like to that humming which the beehives make,</p>
<p>When shadows three together started forth,<br/>
    Running, from out a company that passed<br/>
    Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.</p>
<p>Towards us came they, and each one cried out:<br/>
    "Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest<br/>
    To be some one of our depraved city."</p>
<p>Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,<br/>
    Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!<br/>
    It pains me still but to remember it.</p>
<p>Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;<br/>
    He turned his face towards me, and "Now wait,"<br/>
    He said; "to these we should be courteous.</p>
<p>And if it were not for the fire that darts<br/>
    The nature of this region, I should say<br/>
    That haste were more becoming thee than them."</p>
<p>As soon as we stood still, they recommenced<br/>
    The old refrain, and when they overtook us,<br/>
    Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.</p>
<p>As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,<br/>
    Watching for their advantage and their hold,<br/>
    Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,</p>
<p>Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage<br/>
    Direct to me, so that in opposite wise<br/>
    His neck and feet continual journey made.</p>
<p>And, "If the misery of this soft place<br/>
    Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,"<br/>
    Began one, "and our aspect black and blistered,</p>
<p>Let the renown of us thy mind incline<br/>
    To tell us who thou art, who thus securely<br/>
    Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.</p>
<p>He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,<br/>
    Naked and skinless though he now may go,<br/>
    Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;</p>
<p>He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;<br/>
    His name was Guidoguerra, and in life<br/>
    Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.</p>
<p>The other, who close by me treads the sand,<br/>
    Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame<br/>
    Above there in the world should welcome be.</p>
<p>And I, who with them on the cross am placed,<br/>
    Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly<br/>
    My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me."</p>
<p>Could I have been protected from the fire,<br/>
    Below I should have thrown myself among them,<br/>
    And think the Teacher would have suffered it;</p>
<p>But as I should have burned and baked myself,<br/>
    My terror overmastered my good will,<br/>
    Which made me greedy of embracing them.</p>
<p>Then I began: "Sorrow and not disdain<br/>
    Did your condition fix within me so,<br/>
    That tardily it wholly is stripped off,</p>
<p>As soon as this my Lord said unto me<br/>
    Words, on account of which I thought within me<br/>
    That people such as you are were approaching.</p>
<p>I of your city am; and evermore<br/>
    Your labours and your honourable names<br/>
    I with affection have retraced and heard.</p>
<p>I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits<br/>
    Promised to me by the veracious Leader;<br/>
    But to the centre first I needs must plunge."</p>
<p>"So may the soul for a long while conduct<br/>
    Those limbs of thine," did he make answer then,<br/>
    "And so may thy renown shine after thee,</p>
<p>Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell<br/>
    Within our city, as they used to do,<br/>
    Or if they wholly have gone out of it;</p>
<p>For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment<br/>
    With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,<br/>
    Doth greatly mortify us with his words."</p>
<p>"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,<br/>
    Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,<br/>
    Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!"</p>
<p>In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;<br/>
    And the three, taking that for my reply,<br/>
    Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.</p>
<p>"If other times so little it doth cost thee,"<br/>
    Replied they all, "to satisfy another,<br/>
    Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!</p>
<p>Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,<br/>
    And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,<br/>
    When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'</p>
<p>See that thou speak of us unto the people."<br/>
    Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight<br/>
    It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.</p>
<p>Not an Amen could possibly be said<br/>
    So rapidly as they had disappeared;<br/>
    Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.</p>
<p>I followed him, and little had we gone,<br/>
    Before the sound of water was so near us,<br/>
    That speaking we should hardly have been heard.</p>
<p>Even as that stream which holdeth its own course<br/>
    The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,<br/>
    Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,</p>
<p>Which is above called Acquacheta, ere<br/>
    It down descendeth into its low bed,<br/>
    And at Forli is vacant of that name,</p>
<p>Reverberates there above San Benedetto<br/>
    From Alps, by falling at a single leap,<br/>
    Where for a thousand there were room enough;</p>
<p>Thus downward from a bank precipitate,<br/>
    We found resounding that dark-tinted water,<br/>
    So that it soon the ear would have offended.</p>
<p>I had a cord around about me girt,<br/>
    And therewithal I whilom had designed<br/>
    To take the panther with the painted skin.</p>
<p>After I this had all from me unloosed,<br/>
    As my Conductor had commanded me,<br/>
    I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,</p>
<p>Whereat he turned himself to the right side,<br/>
    And at a little distance from the verge,<br/>
    He cast it down into that deep abyss.</p>
<p>"It must needs be some novelty respond,"<br/>
    I said within myself, "to the new signal<br/>
    The Master with his eye is following so."</p>
<p>Ah me! how very cautious men should be<br/>
    With those who not alone behold the act,<br/>
    But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!</p>
<p>He said to me: "Soon there will upward come<br/>
    What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming<br/>
    Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight."</p>
<p>Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,<br/>
    A man should close his lips as far as may be,<br/>
    Because without his fault it causes shame;</p>
<p>But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes<br/>
    Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,<br/>
    So may they not be void of lasting favour,</p>
<p>Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere<br/>
    I saw a figure swimming upward come,<br/>
    Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,</p>
<p>Even as he returns who goeth down<br/>
    Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled<br/>
    Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,</p>
<p>Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXI</h3>
<p>From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things<br/>
    Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,<br/>
    We came along, and held the summit, when</p>
<p>We halted to behold another fissure<br/>
    Of Malebolge and other vain laments;<br/>
    And I beheld it marvellously dark.</p>
<p>As in the Arsenal of the Venetians<br/>
    Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch<br/>
    To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,</p>
<p>For sail they cannot; and instead thereof<br/>
    One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks<br/>
    The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;</p>
<p>One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,<br/>
    This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,<br/>
    Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;</p>
<p>Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,<br/>
    Was boiling down below there a dense pitch<br/>
    Which upon every side the bank belimed.</p>
<p>I saw it, but I did not see within it<br/>
    Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,<br/>
    And all swell up and resubside compressed.</p>
<p>The while below there fixedly I gazed,<br/>
    My Leader, crying out: "Beware, beware!"<br/>
    Drew me unto himself from where I stood.</p>
<p>Then I turned round, as one who is impatient<br/>
    To see what it behoves him to escape,<br/>
    And whom a sudden terror doth unman,</p>
<p>Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;<br/>
    And I beheld behind us a black devil,<br/>
    Running along upon the crag, approach.</p>
<p>Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!<br/>
    And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,<br/>
    With open wings and light upon his feet!</p>
<p>His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,<br/>
    A sinner did encumber with both haunches,<br/>
    And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.</p>
<p>From off our bridge, he said: "O Malebranche,<br/>
    Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;<br/>
    Plunge him beneath, for I return for others</p>
<p>Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.<br/>
    All there are barrators, except Bonturo;<br/>
    No into Yes for money there is changed."</p>
<p>He hurled him down, and over the hard crag<br/>
    Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened<br/>
    In so much hurry to pursue a thief.</p>
<p>The other sank, and rose again face downward;<br/>
    But the demons, under cover of the bridge,<br/>
    Cried: "Here the Santo Volto has no place!</p>
<p>Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;<br/>
    Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,<br/>
    Do not uplift thyself above the pitch."</p>
<p>They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;<br/>
    They said: "It here behoves thee to dance covered,<br/>
    That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer."</p>
<p>Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make<br/>
    Immerse into the middle of the caldron<br/>
    The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.</p>
<p>Said the good Master to me: "That it be not<br/>
    Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down<br/>
    Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;</p>
<p>And for no outrage that is done to me<br/>
    Be thou afraid, because these things I know,<br/>
    For once before was I in such a scuffle."</p>
<p>Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head,<br/>
    And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,<br/>
    Need was for him to have a steadfast front.</p>
<p>With the same fury, and the same uproar,<br/>
    As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,<br/>
    Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,</p>
<p>They issued from beneath the little bridge,<br/>
    And turned against him all their grappling-irons;<br/>
    But he cried out: "Be none of you malignant!</p>
<p>Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,<br/>
    Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,<br/>
    And then take counsel as to grappling me."</p>
<p>They all cried out: "Let Malacoda go;"<br/>
    Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,<br/>
    And he came to him, saying: "What avails it?"</p>
<p>"Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me<br/>
    Advanced into this place," my Master said,<br/>
    "Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,</p>
<p>Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?<br/>
    Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed<br/>
    That I another show this savage road."</p>
<p>Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,<br/>
    That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,<br/>
    And to the others said: "Now strike him not."</p>
<p>And unto me my Guide: "O thou, who sittest<br/>
    Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,<br/>
    Securely now return to me again."</p>
<p>Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;<br/>
    And all the devils forward thrust themselves,<br/>
    So that I feared they would not keep their compact.</p>
<p>And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers<br/>
    Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,<br/>
    Seeing themselves among so many foes.</p>
<p>Close did I press myself with all my person<br/>
    Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes<br/>
    From off their countenance, which was not good.</p>
<p>They lowered their rakes, and "Wilt thou have me hit him,"<br/>
    They said to one another, "on the rump?"<br/>
    And answered: "Yes; see that thou nick him with it."</p>
<p>But the same demon who was holding parley<br/>
    With my Conductor turned him very quickly,<br/>
    And said: "Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;"</p>
<p>Then said to us: "You can no farther go<br/>
    Forward upon this crag, because is lying<br/>
    All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.</p>
<p>And if it still doth please you to go onward,<br/>
    Pursue your way along upon this rock;<br/>
    Near is another crag that yields a path.</p>
<p>Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,<br/>
    One thousand and two hundred sixty-six<br/>
    Years were complete, that here the way was broken.</p>
<p>I send in that direction some of mine<br/>
    To see if any one doth air himself;<br/>
    Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.</p>
<p>Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,"<br/>
    Began he to cry out, "and thou, Cagnazzo;<br/>
    And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.</p>
<p>Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,<br/>
    And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,<br/>
    And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;</p>
<p>Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;<br/>
    Let these be safe as far as the next crag,<br/>
    That all unbroken passes o'er the dens."</p>
<p>"O me! what is it, Master, that I see?<br/>
    Pray let us go," I said, "without an escort,<br/>
    If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.</p>
<p>If thou art as observant as thy wont is,<br/>
    Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,<br/>
    And with their brows are threatening woe to us?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "I will not have thee fear;<br/>
    Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,<br/>
    Because they do it for those boiling wretches."</p>
<p>Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;<br/>
    But first had each one thrust his tongue between<br/>
    His teeth towards their leader for a signal;</p>
<p>And he had made a trumpet of his rump.</p>

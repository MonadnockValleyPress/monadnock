<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto VII</h3>
<p>After the gracious and glad salutations<br/>
    Had three and four times been reiterated,<br/>
    Sordello backward drew and said, "Who are you?"</p>
<p>"Or ever to this mountain were directed<br/>
    The souls deserving to ascend to God,<br/>
    My bones were buried by Octavian.</p>
<p>I am Virgilius; and for no crime else<br/>
    Did I lose heaven, than for not having faith;"<br/>
    In this wise then my Leader made reply.</p>
<p>As one who suddenly before him sees<br/>
    Something whereat he marvels, who believes<br/>
    And yet does not, saying, "It is! it is not!"</p>
<p>So he appeared; and then bowed down his brow,<br/>
    And with humility returned towards him,<br/>
    And, where inferiors embrace, embraced him.</p>
<p>"O glory of the Latians, thou," he said,<br/>
    "Through whom our language showed what it could do<br/>
    O pride eternal of the place I came from,</p>
<p>What merit or what grace to me reveals thee?<br/>
    If I to hear thy words be worthy, tell me<br/>
    If thou dost come from Hell, and from what cloister."</p>
<p>"Through all the circles of the doleful realm,"<br/>
    Responded he, "have I come hitherward;<br/>
    Heaven's power impelled me, and with that I come.</p>
<p>I by not doing, not by doing, lost<br/>
    The sight of that high sun which thou desirest,<br/>
    And which too late by me was recognized.</p>
<p>A place there is below not sad with torments,<br/>
    But darkness only, where the lamentations<br/>
    Have not the sound of wailing, but are sighs.</p>
<p>There dwell I with the little innocents<br/>
    Snatched by the teeth of Death, or ever they<br/>
    Were from our human sinfulness exempt.</p>
<p>There dwell I among those who the three saintly<br/>
    Virtues did not put on, and without vice<br/>
    The others knew and followed all of them.</p>
<p>But if thou know and can, some indication<br/>
    Give us by which we may the sooner come<br/>
    Where Purgatory has its right beginning."</p>
<p>He answered: "No fixed place has been assigned us;<br/>
    'Tis lawful for me to go up and round;<br/>
    So far as I can go, as guide I join thee.</p>
<p>But see already how the day declines,<br/>
    And to go up by night we are not able;<br/>
    Therefore 'tis well to think of some fair sojourn.</p>
<p>Souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn;<br/>
    If thou permit me I will lead thee to them,<br/>
    And thou shalt know them not without delight."</p>
<p>"How is this?" was the answer; "should one wish<br/>
    To mount by night would he prevented be<br/>
    By others? or mayhap would not have power?"</p>
<p>And on the ground the good Sordello drew<br/>
    His finger, saying, "See, this line alone<br/>
    Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone;</p>
<p>Not that aught else would hindrance give, however,<br/>
    To going up, save the nocturnal darkness;<br/>
    This with the want of power the will perplexes.</p>
<p>We might indeed therewith return below,<br/>
    And, wandering, walk the hill-side round about,<br/>
    While the horizon holds the day imprisoned."</p>
<p>Thereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said:<br/>
    "Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest<br/>
    That we can take delight in tarrying."</p>
<p>Little had we withdrawn us from that place,<br/>
    When I perceived the mount was hollowed out<br/>
    In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed.</p>
<p>"Thitherward," said that shade, "will we repair,<br/>
    Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap,<br/>
    And there for the new day will we await."</p>
<p>'Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path<br/>
    Which led us to the margin of that dell,<br/>
    Where dies the border more than half away.</p>
<p>Gold and fine silver, and scarlet and pearl-white,<br/>
    The Indian wood resplendent and serene,<br/>
    Fresh emerald the moment it is broken,</p>
<p>By herbage and by flowers within that hollow<br/>
    Planted, each one in colour would be vanquished,<br/>
    As by its greater vanquished is the less.</p>
<p>Nor in that place had nature painted only,<br/>
    But of the sweetness of a thousand odours<br/>
    Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown.</p>
<p>"Salve Regina," on the green and flowers<br/>
    There seated, singing, spirits I beheld,<br/>
    Which were not visible outside the valley.</p>
<p>"Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest,"<br/>
    Began the Mantuan who had led us thither,<br/>
    "Among them do not wish me to conduct you.</p>
<p>Better from off this ledge the acts and faces<br/>
    Of all of them will you discriminate,<br/>
    Than in the plain below received among them.</p>
<p>He who sits highest, and the semblance bears<br/>
    Of having what he should have done neglected,<br/>
    And to the others' song moves not his lips,</p>
<p>Rudolph the Emperor was, who had the power<br/>
    To heal the wounds that Italy have slain,<br/>
    So that through others slowly she revives.</p>
<p>The other, who in look doth comfort him,<br/>
    Governed the region where the water springs,<br/>
    The Moldau bears the Elbe, and Elbe the sea.</p>
<p>His name was Ottocar; and in swaddling-clothes<br/>
    Far better he than bearded Winceslaus<br/>
    His son, who feeds in luxury and ease.</p>
<p>And the small-nosed, who close in council seems<br/>
    With him that has an aspect so benign,<br/>
    Died fleeing and disflowering the lily;</p>
<p>Look there, how he is beating at his breast!<br/>
    Behold the other one, who for his cheek<br/>
    Sighing has made of his own palm a bed;</p>
<p>Father and father-in-law of France's Pest<br/>
    Are they, and know his vicious life and lewd,<br/>
    And hence proceeds the grief that so doth pierce them.</p>
<p>He who appears so stalwart, and chimes in,<br/>
    Singing, with that one of the manly nose,<br/>
    The cord of every valour wore begirt;</p>
<p>And if as King had after him remained<br/>
    The stripling who in rear of him is sitting,<br/>
    Well had the valour passed from vase to vase,</p>
<p>Which cannot of the other heirs be said.<br/>
    Frederick and Jacomo possess the realms,<br/>
    But none the better heritage possesses.</p>
<p>Not oftentimes upriseth through the branches<br/>
    The probity of man; and this He wills<br/>
    Who gives it, so that we may ask of Him.</p>
<p>Eke to the large-nosed reach my words, no less<br/>
    Than to the other, Pier, who with him sings;<br/>
    Whence Provence and Apulia grieve already</p>
<p>The plant is as inferior to its seed,<br/>
    As more than Beatrice and Margaret<br/>
    Costanza boasteth of her husband still.</p>
<p>Behold the monarch of the simple life,<br/>
    Harry of England, sitting there alone;<br/>
    He in his branches has a better issue.</p>
<p>He who the lowest on the ground among them<br/>
    Sits looking upward, is the Marquis William,<br/>
    For whose sake Alessandria and her war</p>
<p>Make Monferrat and Canavese weep."</p>

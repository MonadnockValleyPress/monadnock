<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXVII</h3>
<p>"Glory be to the Father, to the Son,<br/>
    And Holy Ghost!" all Paradise began,<br/>
    So that the melody inebriate made me.</p>
<p>What I beheld seemed unto me a smile<br/>
    Of the universe; for my inebriation<br/>
    Found entrance through the hearing and the sight.</p>
<p>O joy! O gladness inexpressible!<br/>
    O perfect life of love and peacefulness!<br/>
    O riches without hankering secure!</p>
<p>Before mine eyes were standing the four torches<br/>
    Enkindled, and the one that first had come<br/>
    Began to make itself more luminous;</p>
<p>And even such in semblance it became<br/>
    As Jupiter would become, if he and Mars<br/>
    Were birds, and they should interchange their feathers.</p>
<p>That Providence, which here distributeth<br/>
    Season and service, in the blessed choir<br/>
    Had silence upon every side imposed.</p>
<p>When I heard say: "If I my colour change,<br/>
    Marvel not at it; for while I am speaking<br/>
    Thou shalt behold all these their colour change.</p>
<p>He who usurps upon the earth my place,<br/>
    My place, my place, which vacant has become<br/>
    Before the presence of the Son of God,</p>
<p>Has of my cemetery made a sewer<br/>
    Of blood and stench, whereby the Perverse One,<br/>
    Who fell from here, below there is appeased!"</p>
<p>With the same colour which, through sun adverse,<br/>
    Painteth the clouds at evening or at morn,<br/>
    Beheld I then the whole of heaven suffused.</p>
<p>And as a modest woman, who abides<br/>
    Sure of herself, and at another's failing,<br/>
    From listening only, timorous becomes,</p>
<p>Even thus did Beatrice change countenance;<br/>
    And I believe in heaven was such eclipse,<br/>
    When suffered the supreme Omnipotence;</p>
<p>Thereafterward proceeded forth his words<br/>
    With voice so much transmuted from itself,<br/>
    The very countenance was not more changed.</p>
<p>"The spouse of Christ has never nurtured been<br/>
    On blood of mine, of Linus and of Cletus,<br/>
    To be made use of in acquest of gold;</p>
<p>But in acquest of this delightful life<br/>
    Sixtus and Pius, Urban and Calixtus,<br/>
    After much lamentation, shed their blood.</p>
<p>Our purpose was not, that on the right hand<br/>
    Of our successors should in part be seated<br/>
    The Christian folk, in part upon the other;</p>
<p>Nor that the keys which were to me confided<br/>
    Should e'er become the escutcheon on a banner,<br/>
    That should wage war on those who are baptized;</p>
<p>Nor I be made the figure of a seal<br/>
    To privileges venal and mendacious,<br/>
    Whereat I often redden and flash with fire.</p>
<p>In garb of shepherds the rapacious wolves<br/>
    Are seen from here above o'er all the pastures!<br/>
    O wrath of God, why dost thou slumber still?</p>
<p>To drink our blood the Caorsines and Gascons<br/>
    Are making ready. O thou good beginning,<br/>
    Unto how vile an end must thou needs fall!</p>
<p>But the high Providence, that with Scipio<br/>
    At Rome the glory of the world defended,<br/>
    Will speedily bring aid, as I conceive;</p>
<p>And thou, my son, who by thy mortal weight<br/>
    Shalt down return again, open thy mouth;<br/>
    What I conceal not, do not thou conceal."</p>
<p>As with its frozen vapours downward falls<br/>
    In flakes our atmosphere, what time the horn<br/>
    Of the celestial Goat doth touch the sun,</p>
<p>Upward in such array saw I the ether<br/>
    Become, and flaked with the triumphant vapours,<br/>
    Which there together with us had remained.</p>
<p>My sight was following up their semblances,<br/>
    And followed till the medium, by excess,<br/>
    The passing farther onward took from it;</p>
<p>Whereat the Lady, who beheld me freed<br/>
    From gazing upward, said to me: "Cast down<br/>
    Thy sight, and see how far thou art turned round."</p>
<p>Since the first time that I had downward looked,<br/>
    I saw that I had moved through the whole arc<br/>
    Which the first climate makes from midst to end;</p>
<p>So that I saw the mad track of Ulysses<br/>
    Past Gades, and this side, well nigh the shore<br/>
    Whereon became Europa a sweet burden.</p>
<p>And of this threshing-floor the site to me<br/>
    Were more unveiled, but the sun was proceeding<br/>
    Under my feet, a sign and more removed.</p>
<p>My mind enamoured, which is dallying<br/>
    At all times with my Lady, to bring back<br/>
    To her mine eyes was more than ever ardent.</p>
<p>And if or Art or Nature has made bait<br/>
    To catch the eyes and so possess the mind,<br/>
    In human flesh or in its portraiture,</p>
<p>All joined together would appear as nought<br/>
    To the divine delight which shone upon me<br/>
    When to her smiling face I turned me round.</p>
<p>The virtue that her look endowed me with<br/>
    From the fair nest of Leda tore me forth,<br/>
    And up into the swiftest heaven impelled me.</p>
<p>Its parts exceeding full of life and lofty<br/>
    Are all so uniform, I cannot say<br/>
    Which Beatrice selected for my place.</p>
<p>But she, who was aware of my desire,<br/>
    Began, the while she smiled so joyously<br/>
    That God seemed in her countenance to rejoice:</p>
<p>"The nature of that motion, which keeps quiet<br/>
    The centre and all the rest about it moves,<br/>
    From hence begins as from its starting point.</p>
<p>And in this heaven there is no other Where<br/>
    Than in the Mind Divine, wherein is kindled<br/>
    The love that turns it, and the power it rains.</p>
<p>Within a circle light and love embrace it,<br/>
    Even as this doth the others, and that precinct<br/>
    He who encircles it alone controls.</p>
<p>Its motion is not by another meted,<br/>
    But all the others measured are by this,<br/>
    As ten is by the half and by the fifth.</p>
<p>And in what manner time in such a pot<br/>
    May have its roots, and in the rest its leaves,<br/>
    Now unto thee can manifest be made.</p>
<p>O Covetousness, that mortals dost ingulf<br/>
    Beneath thee so, that no one hath the power<br/>
    Of drawing back his eyes from out thy waves!</p>
<p>Full fairly blossoms in mankind the will;<br/>
    But the uninterrupted rain converts<br/>
    Into abortive wildings the true plums.</p>
<p>Fidelity and innocence are found<br/>
    Only in children; afterwards they both<br/>
    Take flight or e'er the cheeks with down are covered.</p>
<p>One, while he prattles still, observes the fasts,<br/>
    Who, when his tongue is loosed, forthwith devours<br/>
    Whatever food under whatever moon;</p>
<p>Another, while he prattles, loves and listens<br/>
    Unto his mother, who when speech is perfect<br/>
    Forthwith desires to see her in her grave.</p>
<p>Even thus is swarthy made the skin so white<br/>
    In its first aspect of the daughter fair<br/>
    Of him who brings the morn, and leaves the night.</p>
<p>Thou, that it may not be a marvel to thee,<br/>
    Think that on earth there is no one who governs;<br/>
    Whence goes astray the human family.</p>
<p>Ere January be unwintered wholly<br/>
    By the centesimal on earth neglected,<br/>
    Shall these supernal circles roar so loud</p>
<p>The tempest that has been so long awaited<br/>
    Shall whirl the poops about where are the prows;<br/>
    So that the fleet shall run its course direct,</p>
<p>And the true fruit shall follow on the flower."</p>

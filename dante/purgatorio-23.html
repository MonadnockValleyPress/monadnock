<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXIII</h3>
<p>The while among the verdant leaves mine eyes<br/>
    I riveted, as he is wont to do<br/>
    Who wastes his life pursuing little birds,</p>
<p>My more than Father said unto me: "Son,<br/>
    Come now; because the time that is ordained us<br/>
    More usefully should be apportioned out."</p>
<p>I turned my face and no less soon my steps<br/>
    Unto the Sages, who were speaking so<br/>
    They made the going of no cost to me;</p>
<p>And lo! were heard a song and a lament,<br/>
    "Labia mea, Domine," in fashion<br/>
    Such that delight and dolence it brought forth.</p>
<p>"O my sweet Father, what is this I hear?"<br/>
    Began I; and he answered: "Shades that go<br/>
    Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt."</p>
<p>In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do,<br/>
    Who, unknown people on the road o'ertaking,<br/>
    Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop,</p>
<p>Even thus, behind us with a swifter motion<br/>
    Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us<br/>
    A crowd of spirits silent and devout.</p>
<p>Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous,<br/>
    Pallid in face, and so emaciate<br/>
    That from the bones the skin did shape itself.</p>
<p>I do not think that so to merest rind<br/>
    Could Erisichthon have been withered up<br/>
    By famine, when most fear he had of it.</p>
<p>Thinking within myself I said: "Behold,<br/>
    This is the folk who lost Jerusalem,<br/>
    When Mary made a prey of her own son."</p>
<p>Their sockets were like rings without the gems;<br/>
    Whoever in the face of men reads 'omo'<br/>
    Might well in these have recognised the 'm.'</p>
<p>Who would believe the odour of an apple,<br/>
    Begetting longing, could consume them so,<br/>
    And that of water, without knowing how?</p>
<p>I still was wondering what so famished them,<br/>
    For the occasion not yet manifest<br/>
    Of their emaciation and sad squalor;</p>
<p>And lo! from out the hollow of his head<br/>
    His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;<br/>
    Then cried aloud: "What grace to me is this?"</p>
<p>Never should I have known him by his look;<br/>
    But in his voice was evident to me<br/>
    That which his aspect had suppressed within it.</p>
<p>This spark within me wholly re-enkindled<br/>
    My recognition of his altered face,<br/>
    And I recalled the features of Forese.</p>
<p>"Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,"<br/>
    Entreated he, "which doth my skin discolour,<br/>
    Nor at default of flesh that I may have;</p>
<p>But tell me truth of thee, and who are those<br/>
    Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;<br/>
    Do not delay in speaking unto me."</p>
<p>"That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,<br/>
    Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,"<br/>
    I answered him, "beholding it so changed!</p>
<p>But tell me, for God's sake, what thus denudes you?<br/>
    Make me not speak while I am marvelling,<br/>
    For ill speaks he who's full of other longings."</p>
<p>And he to me: "From the eternal council<br/>
    Falls power into the water and the tree<br/>
    Behind us left, whereby I grow so thin.</p>
<p>All of this people who lamenting sing,<br/>
    For following beyond measure appetite<br/>
    In hunger and thirst are here re-sanctified.</p>
<p>Desire to eat and drink enkindles in us<br/>
    The scent that issues from the apple-tree,<br/>
    And from the spray that sprinkles o'er the verdure;</p>
<p>And not a single time alone, this ground<br/>
    Encompassing, is refreshed our pain,&mdash;<br/>
    I say our pain, and ought to say our solace,&mdash;</p>
<p>For the same wish doth lead us to the tree<br/>
    Which led the Christ rejoicing to say 'Eli,'<br/>
    When with his veins he liberated us."</p>
<p>And I to him: "Forese, from that day<br/>
    When for a better life thou changedst worlds,<br/>
    Up to this time five years have not rolled round.</p>
<p>If sooner were the power exhausted in thee<br/>
    Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised<br/>
    Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us,</p>
<p>How hast thou come up hitherward already?<br/>
    I thought to find thee down there underneath,<br/>
    Where time for time doth restitution make."</p>
<p>And he to me: "Thus speedily has led me<br/>
    To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments,<br/>
    My Nella with her overflowing tears;</p>
<p>She with her prayers devout and with her sighs<br/>
    Has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits,<br/>
    And from the other circles set me free.</p>
<p>So much more dear and pleasing is to God<br/>
    My little widow, whom so much I loved,<br/>
    As in good works she is the more alone;</p>
<p>For the Barbagia of Sardinia<br/>
    By far more modest in its women is<br/>
    Than the Barbagia I have left her in.</p>
<p>O brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say?<br/>
    A future time is in my sight already,<br/>
    To which this hour will not be very old,</p>
<p>When from the pulpit shall be interdicted<br/>
    To the unblushing womankind of Florence<br/>
    To go about displaying breast and paps.</p>
<p>What savages were e'er, what Saracens,<br/>
    Who stood in need, to make them covered go,<br/>
    Of spiritual or other discipline?</p>
<p>But if the shameless women were assured<br/>
    Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already<br/>
    Wide open would they have their mouths to howl;</p>
<p>For if my foresight here deceive me not,<br/>
    They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks<br/>
    Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby.</p>
<p>O brother, now no longer hide thee from me;<br/>
    See that not only I, but all these people<br/>
    Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun."</p>
<p>Whence I to him: "If thou bring back to mind<br/>
    What thou with me hast been and I with thee,<br/>
    The present memory will be grievous still.</p>
<p>Out of that life he turned me back who goes<br/>
    In front of me, two days agone when round<br/>
    The sister of him yonder showed herself,"</p>
<p>And to the sun I pointed. "Through the deep<br/>
    Night of the truly dead has this one led me,<br/>
    With this true flesh, that follows after him.</p>
<p>Thence his encouragements have led me up,<br/>
    Ascending and still circling round the mount<br/>
    That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked.</p>
<p>He says that he will bear me company,<br/>
    Till I shall be where Beatrice will be;<br/>
    There it behoves me to remain without him.</p>
<p>This is Virgilius, who thus says to me,"<br/>
    And him I pointed at; "the other is<br/>
    That shade for whom just now shook every slope</p>
<p>Your realm, that from itself discharges him."</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXVI</h3>
<p>Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,<br/>
    That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,<br/>
    And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!</p>
<p>Among the thieves five citizens of thine<br/>
    Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,<br/>
    And thou thereby to no great honour risest.</p>
<p>But if when morn is near our dreams are true,<br/>
    Feel shalt thou in a little time from now<br/>
    What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.</p>
<p>And if it now were, it were not too soon;<br/>
    Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,<br/>
    For 'twill aggrieve me more the more I age.</p>
<p>We went our way, and up along the stairs<br/>
    The bourns had made us to descend before,<br/>
    Remounted my Conductor and drew me.</p>
<p>And following the solitary path<br/>
    Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,<br/>
    The foot without the hand sped not at all.</p>
<p>Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,<br/>
    When I direct my mind to what I saw,<br/>
    And more my genius curb than I am wont,</p>
<p>That it may run not unless virtue guide it;<br/>
    So that if some good star, or better thing,<br/>
    Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.</p>
<p>As many as the hind (who on the hill<br/>
    Rests at the time when he who lights the world<br/>
    His countenance keeps least concealed from us,</p>
<p>While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)<br/>
    Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,<br/>
    Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;</p>
<p>With flames as manifold resplendent all<br/>
    Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware<br/>
    As soon as I was where the depth appeared.</p>
<p>And such as he who with the bears avenged him<br/>
    Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,<br/>
    What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,</p>
<p>For with his eye he could not follow it<br/>
    So as to see aught else than flame alone,<br/>
    Even as a little cloud ascending upward,</p>
<p>Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment<br/>
    Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,<br/>
    And every flame a sinner steals away.</p>
<p>I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,<br/>
    So that, if I had seized not on a rock,<br/>
    Down had I fallen without being pushed.</p>
<p>And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,<br/>
    Exclaimed: "Within the fires the spirits are;<br/>
    Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns."</p>
<p>"My Master," I replied, "by hearing thee<br/>
    I am more sure; but I surmised already<br/>
    It might be so, and already wished to ask thee</p>
<p>Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft<br/>
    At top, it seems uprising from the pyre<br/>
    Where was Eteocles with his brother placed."</p>
<p>He answered me: "Within there are tormented<br/>
    Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together<br/>
    They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.</p>
<p>And there within their flame do they lament<br/>
    The ambush of the horse, which made the door<br/>
    Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed;</p>
<p>Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead<br/>
    Deidamia still deplores Achilles,<br/>
    And pain for the Palladium there is borne."</p>
<p>"If they within those sparks possess the power<br/>
    To speak," I said, "thee, Master, much I pray,<br/>
    And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,</p>
<p>That thou make no denial of awaiting<br/>
    Until the horned flame shall hither come;<br/>
    Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it."</p>
<p>And he to me: "Worthy is thy entreaty<br/>
    Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;<br/>
    But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.</p>
<p>Leave me to speak, because I have conceived<br/>
    That which thou wishest; for they might disdain<br/>
    Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine."</p>
<p>When now the flame had come unto that point,<br/>
    Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,<br/>
    After this fashion did I hear him speak:</p>
<p>"O ye, who are twofold within one fire,<br/>
    If I deserved of you, while I was living,<br/>
    If I deserved of you or much or little</p>
<p>When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,<br/>
    Do not move on, but one of you declare<br/>
    Whither, being lost, he went away to die."</p>
<p>Then of the antique flame the greater horn,<br/>
    Murmuring, began to wave itself about<br/>
    Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.</p>
<p>Thereafterward, the summit to and fro<br/>
    Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,<br/>
    It uttered forth a voice, and said: "When I</p>
<p>From Circe had departed, who concealed me<br/>
    More than a year there near unto Gaeta,<br/>
    Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,</p>
<p>Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence<br/>
    For my old father, nor the due affection<br/>
    Which joyous should have made Penelope,</p>
<p>Could overcome within me the desire<br/>
    I had to be experienced of the world,<br/>
    And of the vice and virtue of mankind;</p>
<p>But I put forth on the high open sea<br/>
    With one sole ship, and that small company<br/>
    By which I never had deserted been.</p>
<p>Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,<br/>
    Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,<br/>
    And the others which that sea bathes round about.</p>
<p>I and my company were old and slow<br/>
    When at that narrow passage we arrived<br/>
    Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,</p>
<p>That man no farther onward should adventure.<br/>
    On the right hand behind me left I Seville,<br/>
    And on the other already had left Ceuta.</p>
<p>'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand<br/>
    Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,<br/>
    To this so inconsiderable vigil</p>
<p>Which is remaining of your senses still<br/>
    Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,<br/>
    Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.</p>
<p>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;<br/>
    Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,<br/>
    But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'</p>
<p>So eager did I render my companions,<br/>
    With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,<br/>
    That then I hardly could have held them back.</p>
<p>And having turned our stern unto the morning,<br/>
    We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,<br/>
    Evermore gaining on the larboard side.</p>
<p>Already all the stars of the other pole<br/>
    The night beheld, and ours so very low<br/>
    It did not rise above the ocean floor.</p>
<p>Five times rekindled and as many quenched<br/>
    Had been the splendour underneath the moon,<br/>
    Since we had entered into the deep pass,</p>
<p>When there appeared to us a mountain, dim<br/>
    From distance, and it seemed to me so high<br/>
    As I had never any one beheld.</p>
<p>Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;<br/>
    For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,<br/>
    And smote upon the fore part of the ship.</p>
<p>Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,<br/>
    At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,<br/>
    And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,</p>
<p>Until the sea above us closed again."</p>

<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXVIII</h3>
<p>Eager already to search in and round<br/>
    The heavenly forest, dense and living-green,<br/>
    Which tempered to the eyes the new-born day,</p>
<p>Withouten more delay I left the bank,<br/>
    Taking the level country slowly, slowly<br/>
    Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance.</p>
<p>A softly-breathing air, that no mutation<br/>
    Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me<br/>
    No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,</p>
<p>Whereat the branches, lightly tremulous,<br/>
    Did all of them bow downward toward that side<br/>
    Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain;</p>
<p>Yet not from their upright direction swayed,<br/>
    So that the little birds upon their tops<br/>
    Should leave the practice of each art of theirs;</p>
<p>But with full ravishment the hours of prime,<br/>
    Singing, received they in the midst of leaves,<br/>
    That ever bore a burden to their rhymes,</p>
<p>Such as from branch to branch goes gathering on<br/>
    Through the pine forest on the shore of Chiassi,<br/>
    When Eolus unlooses the Sirocco.</p>
<p>Already my slow steps had carried me<br/>
    Into the ancient wood so far, that I<br/>
    Could not perceive where I had entered it.</p>
<p>And lo! my further course a stream cut off,<br/>
    Which tow'rd the left hand with its little waves<br/>
    Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang.</p>
<p>All waters that on earth most limpid are<br/>
    Would seem to have within themselves some mixture<br/>
    Compared with that which nothing doth conceal,</p>
<p>Although it moves on with a brown, brown current<br/>
    Under the shade perpetual, that never<br/>
    Ray of the sun lets in, nor of the moon.</p>
<p>With feet I stayed, and with mine eyes I passed<br/>
    Beyond the rivulet, to look upon<br/>
    The great variety of the fresh may.</p>
<p>And there appeared to me (even as appears<br/>
    Suddenly something that doth turn aside<br/>
    Through very wonder every other thought)</p>
<p>A lady all alone, who went along<br/>
    Singing and culling floweret after floweret,<br/>
    With which her pathway was all painted over.</p>
<p>"Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love<br/>
    Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,<br/>
    Which the heart's witnesses are wont to be,</p>
<p>May the desire come unto thee to draw<br/>
    Near to this river's bank," I said to her,<br/>
    "So much that I might hear what thou art singing.</p>
<p>Thou makest me remember where and what<br/>
    Proserpina that moment was when lost<br/>
    Her mother her, and she herself the Spring."</p>
<p>As turns herself, with feet together pressed<br/>
    And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,<br/>
    And hardly puts one foot before the other,</p>
<p>On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets<br/>
    She turned towards me, not in other wise<br/>
    Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;</p>
<p>And my entreaties made to be content,<br/>
    So near approaching, that the dulcet sound<br/>
    Came unto me together with its meaning</p>
<p>As soon as she was where the grasses are.<br/>
    Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,<br/>
    To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.</p>
<p>I do not think there shone so great a light<br/>
    Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed<br/>
    By her own son, beyond his usual custom!</p>
<p>Erect upon the other bank she smiled,<br/>
    Bearing full many colours in her hands,<br/>
    Which that high land produces without seed.</p>
<p>Apart three paces did the river make us;<br/>
    But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,<br/>
    (A curb still to all human arrogance,)</p>
<p>More hatred from Leander did not suffer<br/>
    For rolling between Sestos and Abydos,<br/>
    Than that from me, because it oped not then.</p>
<p>"Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,"<br/>
    Began she, "peradventure, in this place<br/>
    Elect to human nature for its nest,</p>
<p>Some apprehension keeps you marvelling;<br/>
    But the psalm 'Delectasti' giveth light<br/>
    Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.</p>
<p>And thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me,<br/>
    Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready<br/>
    To all thy questionings, as far as needful."</p>
<p>"The water," said I, "and the forest's sound,<br/>
    Are combating within me my new faith<br/>
    In something which I heard opposed to this."</p>
<p>Whence she: "I will relate how from its cause<br/>
    Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder,<br/>
    And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee.</p>
<p>The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting,<br/>
    Created man good, and this goodly place<br/>
    Gave him as hansel of eternal peace.</p>
<p>By his default short while he sojourned here;<br/>
    By his default to weeping and to toil<br/>
    He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.</p>
<p>That the disturbance which below is made<br/>
    By exhalations of the land and water,<br/>
    (Which far as may be follow after heat,)</p>
<p>Might not upon mankind wage any war,<br/>
    This mount ascended tow'rds the heaven so high,<br/>
    And is exempt, from there where it is locked.</p>
<p>Now since the universal atmosphere<br/>
    Turns in a circuit with the primal motion<br/>
    Unless the circle is broken on some side,</p>
<p>Upon this height, that all is disengaged<br/>
    In living ether, doth this motion strike<br/>
    And make the forest sound, for it is dense;</p>
<p>And so much power the stricken plant possesses<br/>
    That with its virtue it impregns the air,<br/>
    And this, revolving, scatters it around;</p>
<p>And yonder earth, according as 'tis worthy<br/>
    In self or in its clime, conceives and bears<br/>
    Of divers qualities the divers trees;</p>
<p>It should not seem a marvel then on earth,<br/>
    This being heard, whenever any plant<br/>
    Without seed manifest there taketh root.</p>
<p>And thou must know, this holy table-land<br/>
    In which thou art is full of every seed,<br/>
    And fruit has in it never gathered there.</p>
<p>The water which thou seest springs not from vein<br/>
    Restored by vapour that the cold condenses,<br/>
    Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;</p>
<p>But issues from a fountain safe and certain,<br/>
    Which by the will of God as much regains<br/>
    As it discharges, open on two sides.</p>
<p>Upon this side with virtue it descends,<br/>
    Which takes away all memory of sin;<br/>
    On that, of every good deed done restores it.</p>
<p>Here Lethe, as upon the other side<br/>
    Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not<br/>
    If first on either side it be not tasted.</p>
<p>This every other savour doth transcend;<br/>
    And notwithstanding slaked so far may be<br/>
    Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,</p>
<p>I'll give thee a corollary still in grace,<br/>
    Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear<br/>
    If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.</p>
<p>Those who in ancient times have feigned in song<br/>
    The Age of Gold and its felicity,<br/>
    Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.</p>
<p>Here was the human race in innocence;<br/>
    Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;<br/>
    This is the nectar of which each one speaks."</p>
<p>Then backward did I turn me wholly round<br/>
    Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile<br/>
    They had been listening to these closing words;</p>
<p>Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.</p>

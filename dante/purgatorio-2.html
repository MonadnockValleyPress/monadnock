<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto II</h3>
<p>Already had the sun the horizon reached<br/>
    Whose circle of meridian covers o'er<br/>
    Jerusalem with its most lofty point,</p>
<p>And night that opposite to him revolves<br/>
    Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales<br/>
    That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;</p>
<p>So that the white and the vermilion cheeks<br/>
    Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,<br/>
    By too great age were changing into orange.</p>
<p>We still were on the border of the sea,<br/>
    Like people who are thinking of their road,<br/>
    Who go in heart and with the body stay;</p>
<p>And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,<br/>
    Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red<br/>
    Down in the West upon the ocean floor,</p>
<p>Appeared to me&mdash;may I again behold it!&mdash;<br/>
    A light along the sea so swiftly coming,<br/>
    Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;</p>
<p>From which when I a little had withdrawn<br/>
    Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,<br/>
    Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.</p>
<p>Then on each side of it appeared to me<br/>
    I knew not what of white, and underneath it<br/>
    Little by little there came forth another.</p>
<p>My Master yet had uttered not a word<br/>
    While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;<br/>
    But when he clearly recognised the pilot,</p>
<p>He cried: "Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!<br/>
    Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!<br/>
    Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!</p>
<p>See how he scorneth human arguments,<br/>
    So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail<br/>
    Than his own wings, between so distant shores.</p>
<p>See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,<br/>
    Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,<br/>
    That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!"</p>
<p>Then as still nearer and more near us came<br/>
    The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,<br/>
    So that near by the eye could not endure him,</p>
<p>But down I cast it; and he came to shore<br/>
    With a small vessel, very swift and light,<br/>
    So that the water swallowed naught thereof.</p>
<p>Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;<br/>
    Beatitude seemed written in his face,<br/>
    And more than a hundred spirits sat within.</p>
<p>"In exitu Israel de Aegypto!"<br/>
    They chanted all together in one voice,<br/>
    With whatso in that psalm is after written.</p>
<p>Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,<br/>
    Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,<br/>
    And he departed swiftly as he came.</p>
<p>The throng which still remained there unfamiliar<br/>
    Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,<br/>
    As one who in new matters makes essay.</p>
<p>On every side was darting forth the day.<br/>
    The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts<br/>
    From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,</p>
<p>When the new people lifted up their faces<br/>
    Towards us, saying to us: "If ye know,<br/>
    Show us the way to go unto the mountain."</p>
<p>And answer made Virgilius: "Ye believe<br/>
    Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,<br/>
    But we are strangers even as yourselves.</p>
<p>Just now we came, a little while before you,<br/>
    Another way, which was so rough and steep,<br/>
    That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us."</p>
<p>The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,<br/>
    Become aware that I was still alive,<br/>
    Pallid in their astonishment became;</p>
<p>And as to messenger who bears the olive<br/>
    The people throng to listen to the news,<br/>
    And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,</p>
<p>So at the sight of me stood motionless<br/>
    Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if<br/>
    Oblivious to go and make them fair.</p>
<p>One from among them saw I coming forward,<br/>
    As to embrace me, with such great affection,<br/>
    That it incited me to do the like.</p>
<p>O empty shadows, save in aspect only!<br/>
    Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,<br/>
    As oft returned with them to my own breast!</p>
<p>I think with wonder I depicted me;<br/>
    Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;<br/>
    And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.</p>
<p>Gently it said that I should stay my steps;<br/>
    Then knew I who it was, and I entreated<br/>
    That it would stop awhile to speak with me.</p>
<p>It made reply to me: "Even as I loved thee<br/>
    In mortal body, so I love thee free;<br/>
    Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?"</p>
<p>"My own Casella! to return once more<br/>
    There where I am, I make this journey," said I;<br/>
    "But how from thee has so much time be taken?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "No outrage has been done me,<br/>
    If he who takes both when and whom he pleases<br/>
    Has many times denied to me this passage,</p>
<p>For of a righteous will his own is made.<br/>
    He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken<br/>
    Whoever wished to enter with all peace;</p>
<p>Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore<br/>
    Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,<br/>
    Benignantly by him have been received.</p>
<p>Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,<br/>
    Because for evermore assemble there<br/>
    Those who tow'rds Acheron do not descend."</p>
<p>And I: "If some new law take not from thee<br/>
    Memory or practice of the song of love,<br/>
    Which used to quiet in me all my longings,</p>
<p>Thee may it please to comfort therewithal<br/>
    Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body<br/>
    Hitherward coming is so much distressed."</p>
<p>"Love, that within my mind discourses with me,"<br/>
    Forthwith began he so melodiously,<br/>
    The melody within me still is sounding.</p>
<p>My Master, and myself, and all that people<br/>
    Which with him were, appeared as satisfied<br/>
    As if naught else might touch the mind of any.</p>
<p>We all of us were moveless and attentive<br/>
    Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,<br/>
    Exclaiming: "What is this, ye laggard spirits?</p>
<p>What negligence, what standing still is this?<br/>
    Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,<br/>
    That lets not God be manifest to you."</p>
<p>Even as when, collecting grain or tares,<br/>
    The doves, together at their pasture met,<br/>
    Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,</p>
<p>If aught appear of which they are afraid,<br/>
    Upon a sudden leave their food alone,<br/>
    Because they are assailed by greater care;</p>
<p>So that fresh company did I behold<br/>
    The song relinquish, and go tow'rds the hill,<br/>
    As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;</p>
<p>Nor was our own departure less in haste.</p>

<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXXII</h3>
<p>So steadfast and attentive were mine eyes<br/>
    In satisfying their decennial thirst,<br/>
    That all my other senses were extinct,</p>
<p>And upon this side and on that they had<br/>
    Walls of indifference, so the holy smile<br/>
    Drew them unto itself with the old net</p>
<p>When forcibly my sight was turned away<br/>
    Towards my left hand by those goddesses,<br/>
    Because I heard from them a "Too intently!"</p>
<p>And that condition of the sight which is<br/>
    In eyes but lately smitten by the sun<br/>
    Bereft me of my vision some short while;</p>
<p>But to the less when sight re-shaped itself,<br/>
    I say the less in reference to the greater<br/>
    Splendour from which perforce I had withdrawn,</p>
<p>I saw upon its right wing wheeled about<br/>
    The glorious host returning with the sun<br/>
    And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.</p>
<p>As underneath its shields, to save itself,<br/>
    A squadron turns, and with its banner wheels,<br/>
    Before the whole thereof can change its front,</p>
<p>That soldiery of the celestial kingdom<br/>
    Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us<br/>
    Before the chariot had turned its pole.</p>
<p>Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,<br/>
    And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,<br/>
    But so that not a feather of him fluttered.</p>
<p>The lady fair who drew me through the ford<br/>
    Followed with Statius and myself the wheel<br/>
    Which made its orbit with the lesser arc.</p>
<p>So passing through the lofty forest, vacant<br/>
    By fault of her who in the serpent trusted,<br/>
    Angelic music made our steps keep time.</p>
<p>Perchance as great a space had in three flights<br/>
    An arrow loosened from the string o'erpassed,<br/>
    As we had moved when Beatrice descended.</p>
<p>I heard them murmur altogether, "Adam!"<br/>
    Then circled they about a tree despoiled<br/>
    Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.</p>
<p>Its tresses, which so much the more dilate<br/>
    As higher they ascend, had been by Indians<br/>
    Among their forests marvelled at for height.</p>
<p>"Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not<br/>
    Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,<br/>
    Since appetite by this was turned to evil."</p>
<p>After this fashion round the tree robust<br/>
    The others shouted; and the twofold creature:<br/>
    "Thus is preserved the seed of all the just."</p>
<p>And turning to the pole which he had dragged,<br/>
    He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,<br/>
    And what was of it unto it left bound.</p>
<p>In the same manner as our trees (when downward<br/>
    Falls the great light, with that together mingled<br/>
    Which after the celestial Lasca shines)</p>
<p>Begin to swell, and then renew themselves,<br/>
    Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun<br/>
    Harness his steeds beneath another star:</p>
<p>Less than of rose and more than violet<br/>
    A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree<br/>
    That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.</p>
<p>I never heard, nor here below is sung,<br/>
    The hymn which afterward that people sang,<br/>
    Nor did I bear the melody throughout.</p>
<p>Had I the power to paint how fell asleep<br/>
    Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,<br/>
    Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,</p>
<p>Even as a painter who from model paints<br/>
    I would portray how I was lulled asleep;<br/>
    He may, who well can picture drowsihood.</p>
<p>Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,<br/>
    And say a splendour rent from me the veil<br/>
    Of slumber, and a calling: "Rise, what dost thou?"</p>
<p>As to behold the apple-tree in blossom<br/>
    Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,<br/>
    And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,</p>
<p>Peter and John and James conducted were,<br/>
    And, overcome, recovered at the word<br/>
    By which still greater slumbers have been broken,</p>
<p>And saw their school diminished by the loss<br/>
    Not only of Elias, but of Moses,<br/>
    And the apparel of their Master changed;</p>
<p>So I revived, and saw that piteous one<br/>
    Above me standing, who had been conductress<br/>
    Aforetime of my steps beside the river,</p>
<p>And all in doubt I said, "Where's Beatrice?"<br/>
    And she: "Behold her seated underneath<br/>
    The leafage new, upon the root of it.</p>
<p>Behold the company that circles her;<br/>
    The rest behind the Griffin are ascending<br/>
    With more melodious song, and more profound."</p>
<p>And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,<br/>
    Because already in my sight was she<br/>
    Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.</p>
<p>Alone she sat upon the very earth,<br/>
    Left there as guardian of the chariot<br/>
    Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.</p>
<p>Encircling her, a cloister made themselves<br/>
    The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands<br/>
    Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.</p>
<p>"Short while shalt thou be here a forester,<br/>
    And thou shalt be with me for evermore<br/>
    A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.</p>
<p>Therefore, for that world's good which liveth ill,<br/>
    Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,<br/>
    Having returned to earth, take heed thou write."</p>
<p>Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet<br/>
    Of her commandments all devoted was,<br/>
    My mind and eyes directed where she willed.</p>
<p>Never descended with so swift a motion<br/>
    Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining<br/>
    From out the region which is most remote,</p>
<p>As I beheld the bird of Jove descend<br/>
    Down through the tree, rending away the bark,<br/>
    As well as blossoms and the foliage new,</p>
<p>And he with all his might the chariot smote,<br/>
    Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest<br/>
    Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.</p>
<p>Thereafter saw I leap into the body<br/>
    Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,<br/>
    That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.</p>
<p>But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,<br/>
    My Lady put him to as swift a flight<br/>
    As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.</p>
<p>Then by the way that it before had come,<br/>
    Into the chariot's chest I saw the Eagle<br/>
    Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.</p>
<p>And such as issues from a heart that mourns,<br/>
    A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:<br/>
    "My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!"</p>
<p>Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between<br/>
    Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,<br/>
    Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,</p>
<p>And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,<br/>
    Drawing unto himself his tail malign,<br/>
    Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.</p>
<p>That which remained behind, even as with grass<br/>
    A fertile region, with the feathers, offered<br/>
    Perhaps with pure intention and benign,</p>
<p>Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed<br/>
    The pole and both the wheels so speedily,<br/>
    A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.</p>
<p>Transfigured thus the holy edifice<br/>
    Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,<br/>
    Three on the pole and one at either corner.</p>
<p>The first were horned like oxen; but the four<br/>
    Had but a single horn upon the forehead;<br/>
    A monster such had never yet been seen!</p>
<p>Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,<br/>
    Seated upon it, there appeared to me<br/>
    A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,</p>
<p>And, as if not to have her taken from him,<br/>
    Upright beside her I beheld a giant;<br/>
    And ever and anon they kissed each other.</p>
<p>But because she her wanton, roving eye<br/>
    Turned upon me, her angry paramour<br/>
    Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.</p>
<p>Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,<br/>
    He loosed the monster, and across the forest<br/>
    Dragged it so far, he made of that alone</p>
<p>A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.</p>

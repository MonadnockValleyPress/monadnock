<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XX</h3>
<p>Of a new pain behoves me to make verses<br/>
    And give material to the twentieth canto<br/>
    Of the first song, which is of the submerged.</p>
<p>I was already thoroughly disposed<br/>
    To peer down into the uncovered depth,<br/>
    Which bathed itself with tears of agony;</p>
<p>And people saw I through the circular valley,<br/>
    Silent and weeping, coming at the pace<br/>
    Which in this world the Litanies assume.</p>
<p>As lower down my sight descended on them,<br/>
    Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted<br/>
    From chin to the beginning of the chest;</p>
<p>For tow'rds the reins the countenance was turned,<br/>
    And backward it behoved them to advance,<br/>
    As to look forward had been taken from them.</p>
<p>Perchance indeed by violence of palsy<br/>
    Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;<br/>
    But I ne'er saw it, nor believe it can be.</p>
<p>As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit<br/>
    From this thy reading, think now for thyself<br/>
    How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,</p>
<p>When our own image near me I beheld<br/>
    Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes<br/>
    Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.</p>
<p>Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak<br/>
    Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said<br/>
    To me: "Art thou, too, of the other fools?</p>
<p>Here pity lives when it is wholly dead;<br/>
    Who is a greater reprobate than he<br/>
    Who feels compassion at the doom divine?</p>
<p>Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom<br/>
    Opened the earth before the Thebans' eyes;<br/>
    Wherefore they all cried: 'Whither rushest thou,</p>
<p>Amphiaraus? Why dost leave the war?'<br/>
    And downward ceased he not to fall amain<br/>
    As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.</p>
<p>See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!<br/>
    Because he wished to see too far before him<br/>
    Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:</p>
<p>Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,<br/>
    When from a male a female he became,<br/>
    His members being all of them transformed;</p>
<p>And afterwards was forced to strike once more<br/>
    The two entangled serpents with his rod,<br/>
    Ere he could have again his manly plumes.</p>
<p>That Aruns is, who backs the other's belly,<br/>
    Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs<br/>
    The Carrarese who houses underneath,</p>
<p>Among the marbles white a cavern had<br/>
    For his abode; whence to behold the stars<br/>
    And sea, the view was not cut off from him.</p>
<p>And she there, who is covering up her breasts,<br/>
    Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,<br/>
    And on that side has all the hairy skin,</p>
<p>Was Manto, who made quest through many lands,<br/>
    Afterwards tarried there where I was born;<br/>
    Whereof I would thou list to me a little.</p>
<p>After her father had from life departed,<br/>
    And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,<br/>
    She a long season wandered through the world.</p>
<p>Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake<br/>
    At the Alp's foot that shuts in Germany<br/>
    Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.</p>
<p>By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,<br/>
    'Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,<br/>
    With water that grows stagnant in that lake.</p>
<p>Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,<br/>
    And he of Brescia, and the Veronese<br/>
    Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.</p>
<p>Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,<br/>
    To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,<br/>
    Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.</p>
<p>There of necessity must fall whatever<br/>
    In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,<br/>
    And grows a river down through verdant pastures.</p>
<p>Soon as the water doth begin to run,<br/>
    No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,<br/>
    Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.</p>
<p>Not far it runs before it finds a plain<br/>
    In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,<br/>
    And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly.</p>
<p>Passing that way the virgin pitiless<br/>
    Land in the middle of the fen descried,<br/>
    Untilled and naked of inhabitants;</p>
<p>There to escape all human intercourse,<br/>
    She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise<br/>
    And lived, and left her empty body there.</p>
<p>The men, thereafter, who were scattered round,<br/>
    Collected in that place, which was made strong<br/>
    By the lagoon it had on every side;</p>
<p>They built their city over those dead bones,<br/>
    And, after her who first the place selected,<br/>
    Mantua named it, without other omen.</p>
<p>Its people once within more crowded were,<br/>
    Ere the stupidity of Casalodi<br/>
    From Pinamonte had received deceit.</p>
<p>Therefore I caution thee, if e'er thou hearest<br/>
    Originate my city otherwise,<br/>
    No falsehood may the verity defraud."</p>
<p>And I: "My Master, thy discourses are<br/>
    To me so certain, and so take my faith,<br/>
    That unto me the rest would be spent coals.</p>
<p>But tell me of the people who are passing,<br/>
    If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,<br/>
    For only unto that my mind reverts."</p>
<p>Then said he to me: "He who from the cheek<br/>
    Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders<br/>
    Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,</p>
<p>So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,<br/>
    An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,<br/>
    In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.</p>
<p>Eryphylus his name was, and so sings<br/>
    My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;<br/>
    That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.</p>
<p>The next, who is so slender in the flanks,<br/>
    Was Michael Scott, who of a verity<br/>
    Of magical illusions knew the game.</p>
<p>Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,<br/>
    Who now unto his leather and his thread<br/>
    Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.</p>
<p>Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,<br/>
    The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;<br/>
    They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.</p>
<p>But come now, for already holds the confines<br/>
    Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville<br/>
    Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,</p>
<p>And yesternight the moon was round already;<br/>
    Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee<br/>
    From time to time within the forest deep."</p>
<p>Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.</p>

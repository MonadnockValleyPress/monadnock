<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto V</h3>
<p>I had already from those shades departed,<br/>
    And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,<br/>
    When from behind, pointing his finger at me,</p>
<p>One shouted: "See, it seems as if shone not<br/>
    The sunshine on the left of him below,<br/>
    And like one living seems he to conduct him."</p>
<p>Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,<br/>
    And saw them watching with astonishment<br/>
    But me, but me, and the light which was broken!</p>
<p>"Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,"<br/>
    The Master said, "that thou thy pace dost slacken?<br/>
    What matters it to thee what here is whispered?</p>
<p>Come after me, and let the people talk;<br/>
    Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags<br/>
    Its top for all the blowing of the winds;</p>
<p>For evermore the man in whom is springing<br/>
    Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,<br/>
    Because the force of one the other weakens."</p>
<p>What could I say in answer but "I come"?<br/>
    I said it somewhat with that colour tinged<br/>
    Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile along the mountain-side across<br/>
    Came people in advance of us a little,<br/>
    Singing the Miserere verse by verse.</p>
<p>When they became aware I gave no place<br/>
    For passage of the sunshine through my body,<br/>
    They changed their song into a long, hoarse "Oh!"</p>
<p>And two of them, in form of messengers,<br/>
    Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,<br/>
    "Of your condition make us cognisant."</p>
<p>And said my Master: "Ye can go your way<br/>
    And carry back again to those who sent you,<br/>
    That this one's body is of very flesh.</p>
<p>If they stood still because they saw his shadow,<br/>
    As I suppose, enough is answered them;<br/>
    Him let them honour, it may profit them."</p>
<p>Vapours enkindled saw I ne'er so swiftly<br/>
    At early nightfall cleave the air serene,<br/>
    Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,</p>
<p>But upward they returned in briefer time,<br/>
    And, on arriving, with the others wheeled<br/>
    Tow'rds us, like troops that run without a rein.</p>
<p>"This folk that presses unto us is great,<br/>
    And cometh to implore thee," said the Poet;<br/>
    "So still go onward, and in going listen."</p>
<p>"O soul that goest to beatitude<br/>
    With the same members wherewith thou wast born,"<br/>
    Shouting they came, "a little stay thy steps,</p>
<p>Look, if thou e'er hast any of us seen,<br/>
    So that o'er yonder thou bear news of him;<br/>
    Ah, why dost thou go on? Ah, why not stay?</p>
<p>Long since we all were slain by violence,<br/>
    And sinners even to the latest hour;<br/>
    Then did a light from heaven admonish us,</p>
<p>So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth<br/>
    From life we issued reconciled to God,<br/>
    Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts."</p>
<p>And I: "Although I gaze into your faces,<br/>
    No one I recognize; but if may please you<br/>
    Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,</p>
<p>Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace<br/>
    Which, following the feet of such a Guide,<br/>
    From world to world makes itself sought by me."</p>
<p>And one began: "Each one has confidence<br/>
    In thy good offices without an oath,<br/>
    Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;</p>
<p>Whence I, who speak alone before the others,<br/>
    Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land<br/>
    That 'twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,</p>
<p>Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers<br/>
    In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,<br/>
    That I may purge away my grave offences.</p>
<p>From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which<br/>
    Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,<br/>
    Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,</p>
<p>There where I thought to be the most secure;<br/>
    'Twas he of Este had it done, who held me<br/>
    In hatred far beyond what justice willed.</p>
<p>But if towards the Mira I had fled,<br/>
    When I was overtaken at Oriaco,<br/>
    I still should be o'er yonder where men breathe.</p>
<p>I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire<br/>
    Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there<br/>
    A lake made from my veins upon the ground."</p>
<p>Then said another: "Ah, be that desire<br/>
    Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,<br/>
    As thou with pious pity aidest mine.</p>
<p>I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;<br/>
    Giovanna, nor none other cares for me;<br/>
    Hence among these I go with downcast front."</p>
<p>And I to him: "What violence or what chance<br/>
    Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,<br/>
    That never has thy sepulture been known?"</p>
<p>"Oh," he replied, "at Casentino's foot<br/>
    A river crosses named Archiano, born<br/>
    Above the Hermitage in Apennine.</p>
<p>There where the name thereof becometh void<br/>
    Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,<br/>
    Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;</p>
<p>There my sight lost I, and my utterance<br/>
    Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat<br/>
    I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.</p>
<p>Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;<br/>
    God's Angel took me up, and he of hell<br/>
    Shouted: 'O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?</p>
<p>Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,<br/>
    For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;<br/>
    But with the rest I'll deal in other fashion!'</p>
<p>Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered<br/>
    That humid vapour which to water turns,<br/>
    Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.</p>
<p>He joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,<br/>
    To intellect, and moved the mist and wind<br/>
    By means of power, which his own nature gave;</p>
<p>Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley<br/>
    From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered<br/>
    With fog, and made the heaven above intent,</p>
<p>So that the pregnant air to water changed;<br/>
    Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came<br/>
    Whate'er of it earth tolerated not;</p>
<p>And as it mingled with the mighty torrents,<br/>
    Towards the royal river with such speed<br/>
    It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.</p>
<p>My frozen body near unto its outlet<br/>
    The robust Archian found, and into Arno<br/>
    Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross</p>
<p>I made of me, when agony o'ercame me;<br/>
    It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,<br/>
    Then with its booty covered and begirt me."</p>
<p>"Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,<br/>
    And rested thee from thy long journeying,"<br/>
    After the second followed the third spirit,</p>
<p>"Do thou remember me who am the Pia;<br/>
    Siena made me, unmade me Maremma;<br/>
    He knoweth it, who had encircled first,</p>
<p>Espousing me, my finger with his gem."</p>

<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XII</h3>
<p>Soon as the blessed flame had taken up<br/>
    The final word to give it utterance,<br/>
    Began the holy millstone to revolve,</p>
<p>And in its gyre had not turned wholly round,<br/>
    Before another in a ring enclosed it,<br/>
    And motion joined to motion, song to song;</p>
<p>Song that as greatly doth transcend our Muses,<br/>
    Our Sirens, in those dulcet clarions,<br/>
    As primal splendour that which is reflected.</p>
<p>And as are spanned athwart a tender cloud<br/>
    Two rainbows parallel and like in colour,<br/>
    When Juno to her handmaid gives command,</p>
<p>(The one without born of the one within,<br/>
    Like to the speaking of that vagrant one<br/>
    Whom love consumed as doth the sun the vapours,)</p>
<p>And make the people here, through covenant<br/>
    God set with Noah, presageful of the world<br/>
    That shall no more be covered with a flood,</p>
<p>In such wise of those sempiternal roses<br/>
    The garlands twain encompassed us about,<br/>
    And thus the outer to the inner answered.</p>
<p>After the dance, and other grand rejoicings,<br/>
    Both of the singing, and the flaming forth<br/>
    Effulgence with effulgence blithe and tender,</p>
<p>Together, at once, with one accord had stopped,<br/>
    (Even as the eyes, that, as volition moves them,<br/>
    Must needs together shut and lift themselves,)</p>
<p>Out of the heart of one of the new lights<br/>
    There came a voice, that needle to the star<br/>
    Made me appear in turning thitherward.</p>
<p>And it began: "The love that makes me fair<br/>
    Draws me to speak about the other leader,<br/>
    By whom so well is spoken here of mine.</p>
<p>'Tis right, where one is, to bring in the other,<br/>
    That, as they were united in their warfare,<br/>
    Together likewise may their glory shine.</p>
<p>The soldiery of Christ, which it had cost<br/>
    So dear to arm again, behind the standard<br/>
    Moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few,</p>
<p>When the Emperor who reigneth evermore<br/>
    Provided for the host that was in peril,<br/>
    Through grace alone and not that it was worthy;</p>
<p>And, as was said, he to his Bride brought succour<br/>
    With champions twain, at whose deed, at whose word<br/>
    The straggling people were together drawn.</p>
<p>Within that region where the sweet west wind<br/>
    Rises to open the new leaves, wherewith<br/>
    Europe is seen to clothe herself afresh,</p>
<p>Not far off from the beating of the waves,<br/>
    Behind which in his long career the sun<br/>
    Sometimes conceals himself from every man,</p>
<p>Is situate the fortunate Calahorra,<br/>
    Under protection of the mighty shield<br/>
    In which the Lion subject is and sovereign.</p>
<p>Therein was born the amorous paramour<br/>
    Of Christian Faith, the athlete consecrate,<br/>
    Kind to his own and cruel to his foes;</p>
<p>And when it was created was his mind<br/>
    Replete with such a living energy,<br/>
    That in his mother her it made prophetic.</p>
<p>As soon as the espousals were complete<br/>
    Between him and the Faith at holy font,<br/>
    Where they with mutual safety dowered each other,</p>
<p>The woman, who for him had given assent,<br/>
    Saw in a dream the admirable fruit<br/>
    That issue would from him and from his heirs;</p>
<p>And that he might be construed as he was,<br/>
    A spirit from this place went forth to name him<br/>
    With His possessive whose he wholly was.</p>
<p>Dominic was he called; and him I speak of<br/>
    Even as of the husbandman whom Christ<br/>
    Elected to his garden to assist him.</p>
<p>Envoy and servant sooth he seemed of Christ,<br/>
    For the first love made manifest in him<br/>
    Was the first counsel that was given by Christ.</p>
<p>Silent and wakeful many a time was he<br/>
    Discovered by his nurse upon the ground,<br/>
    As if he would have said, 'For this I came.'</p>
<p>O thou his father, Felix verily!<br/>
    O thou his mother, verily Joanna,<br/>
    If this, interpreted, means as is said!</p>
<p>Not for the world which people toil for now<br/>
    In following Ostiense and Taddeo,<br/>
    But through his longing after the true manna,</p>
<p>He in short time became so great a teacher,<br/>
    That he began to go about the vineyard,<br/>
    Which fadeth soon, if faithless be the dresser;</p>
<p>And of the See, (that once was more benignant<br/>
    Unto the righteous poor, not through itself,<br/>
    But him who sits there and degenerates,)</p>
<p>Not to dispense or two or three for six,<br/>
    Not any fortune of first vacancy,<br/>
    'Non decimas quae sunt pauperum Dei,'</p>
<p>He asked for, but against the errant world<br/>
    Permission to do battle for the seed,<br/>
    Of which these four and twenty plants surround thee.</p>
<p>Then with the doctrine and the will together,<br/>
    With office apostolical he moved,<br/>
    Like torrent which some lofty vein out-presses;</p>
<p>And in among the shoots heretical<br/>
    His impetus with greater fury smote,<br/>
    Wherever the resistance was the greatest.</p>
<p>Of him were made thereafter divers runnels,<br/>
    Whereby the garden catholic is watered,<br/>
    So that more living its plantations stand.</p>
<p>If such the one wheel of the Biga was,<br/>
    In which the Holy Church itself defended<br/>
    And in the field its civic battle won,</p>
<p>Truly full manifest should be to thee<br/>
    The excellence of the other, unto whom<br/>
    Thomas so courteous was before my coming.</p>
<p>But still the orbit, which the highest part<br/>
    Of its circumference made, is derelict,<br/>
    So that the mould is where was once the crust.</p>
<p>His family, that had straight forward moved<br/>
    With feet upon his footprints, are turned round<br/>
    So that they set the point upon the heel.</p>
<p>And soon aware they will be of the harvest<br/>
    Of this bad husbandry, when shall the tares<br/>
    Complain the granary is taken from them.</p>
<p>Yet say I, he who searcheth leaf by leaf<br/>
    Our volume through, would still some page discover<br/>
    Where he could read, 'I am as I am wont.'</p>
<p>'Twill not be from Casal nor Acquasparta,<br/>
    From whence come such unto the written word<br/>
    That one avoids it, and the other narrows.</p>
<p>Bonaventura of Bagnoregio's life<br/>
    Am I, who always in great offices<br/>
    Postponed considerations sinister.</p>
<p>Here are Illuminato and Agostino,<br/>
    Who of the first barefooted beggars were<br/>
    That with the cord the friends of God became.</p>
<p>Hugh of Saint Victor is among them here,<br/>
    And Peter Mangiador, and Peter of Spain,<br/>
    Who down below in volumes twelve is shining;</p>
<p>Nathan the seer, and metropolitan<br/>
    Chrysostom, and Anselmus, and Donatus<br/>
    Who deigned to lay his hand to the first art;</p>
<p>Here is Rabanus, and beside me here<br/>
    Shines the Calabrian Abbot Joachim,<br/>
    He with the spirit of prophecy endowed.</p>
<p>To celebrate so great a paladin<br/>
    Have moved me the impassioned courtesy<br/>
    And the discreet discourses of Friar Thomas,</p>
<p>And with me they have moved this company."</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XVIII</h3>
<p>There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,<br/>
    Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,<br/>
    As is the circle that around it turns.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of the field malign<br/>
    There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,<br/>
    Of which its place the structure will recount.</p>
<p>Round, then, is that enclosure which remains<br/>
    Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,<br/>
    And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.</p>
<p>As where for the protection of the walls<br/>
    Many and many moats surround the castles,<br/>
    The part in which they are a figure forms,</p>
<p>Just such an image those presented there;<br/>
    And as about such strongholds from their gates<br/>
    Unto the outer bank are little bridges,</p>
<p>So from the precipice's base did crags<br/>
    Project, which intersected dikes and moats,<br/>
    Unto the well that truncates and collects them.</p>
<p>Within this place, down shaken from the back<br/>
    Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet<br/>
    Held to the left, and I moved on behind.</p>
<p>Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,<br/>
    New torments, and new wielders of the lash,<br/>
    Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.</p>
<p>Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;<br/>
    This side the middle came they facing us,<br/>
    Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;</p>
<p>Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,<br/>
    The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,<br/>
    Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;</p>
<p>For all upon one side towards the Castle<br/>
    Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;<br/>
    On the other side they go towards the Mountain.</p>
<p>This side and that, along the livid stone<br/>
    Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,<br/>
    Who cruelly were beating them behind.</p>
<p>Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs<br/>
    At the first blows! and sooth not any one<br/>
    The second waited for, nor for the third.</p>
<p>While I was going on, mine eyes by one<br/>
    Encountered were; and straight I said: "Already<br/>
    With sight of this one I am not unfed."</p>
<p>Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,<br/>
    And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,<br/>
    And to my going somewhat back assented;</p>
<p>And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,<br/>
    Lowering his face, but little it availed him;<br/>
    For said I: "Thou that castest down thine eyes,</p>
<p>If false are not the features which thou bearest,<br/>
    Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;<br/>
    But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "Unwillingly I tell it;<br/>
    But forces me thine utterance distinct,<br/>
    Which makes me recollect the ancient world.</p>
<p>I was the one who the fair Ghisola<br/>
    Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,<br/>
    Howe'er the shameless story may be told.</p>
<p>Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;<br/>
    Nay, rather is this place so full of them,<br/>
    That not so many tongues to-day are taught</p>
<p>'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'<br/>
    And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,<br/>
    Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart."</p>
<p>While speaking in this manner, with his scourge<br/>
    A demon smote him, and said: "Get thee gone<br/>
    Pander, there are no women here for coin."</p>
<p>I joined myself again unto mine Escort;<br/>
    Thereafterward with footsteps few we came<br/>
    To where a crag projected from the bank.</p>
<p>This very easily did we ascend,<br/>
    And turning to the right along its ridge,<br/>
    From those eternal circles we departed.</p>
<p>When we were there, where it is hollowed out<br/>
    Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,<br/>
    The Guide said: "Wait, and see that on thee strike</p>
<p>The vision of those others evil-born,<br/>
    Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,<br/>
    Because together with us they have gone."</p>
<p>From the old bridge we looked upon the train<br/>
    Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,<br/>
    And which the scourges in like manner smite.</p>
<p>And the good Master, without my inquiring,<br/>
    Said to me: "See that tall one who is coming,<br/>
    And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;</p>
<p>Still what a royal aspect he retains!<br/>
    That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning<br/>
    The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.</p>
<p>He by the isle of Lemnos passed along<br/>
    After the daring women pitiless<br/>
    Had unto death devoted all their males.</p>
<p>There with his tokens and with ornate words<br/>
    Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden<br/>
    Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.</p>
<p>There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;<br/>
    Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,<br/>
    And also for Medea is vengeance done.</p>
<p>With him go those who in such wise deceive;<br/>
    And this sufficient be of the first valley<br/>
    To know, and those that in its jaws it holds."</p>
<p>We were already where the narrow path<br/>
    Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms<br/>
    Of that a buttress for another arch.</p>
<p>Thence we heard people, who are making moan<br/>
    In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,<br/>
    And with their palms beating upon themselves</p>
<p>The margins were incrusted with a mould<br/>
    By exhalation from below, that sticks there,<br/>
    And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.</p>
<p>The bottom is so deep, no place suffices<br/>
    To give us sight of it, without ascending<br/>
    The arch's back, where most the crag impends.</p>
<p>Thither we came, and thence down in the moat<br/>
    I saw a people smothered in a filth<br/>
    That out of human privies seemed to flow;</p>
<p>And whilst below there with mine eye I search,<br/>
    I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,<br/>
    It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.</p>
<p>He screamed to me: "Wherefore art thou so eager<br/>
    To look at me more than the other foul ones?"<br/>
    And I to him: "Because, if I remember,</p>
<p>I have already seen thee with dry hair,<br/>
    And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;<br/>
    Therefore I eye thee more than all the others."</p>
<p>And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:<br/>
    "The flatteries have submerged me here below,<br/>
    Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited."</p>
<p>Then said to me the Guide: "See that thou thrust<br/>
    Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,<br/>
    That with thine eyes thou well the face attain</p>
<p>Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,<br/>
    Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,<br/>
    And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.</p>
<p>Thais the harlot is it, who replied<br/>
    Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I<br/>
    Great gratitude from thee?'&mdash;'Nay, marvellous;'</p>
<p>And herewith let our sight be satisfied."</p>

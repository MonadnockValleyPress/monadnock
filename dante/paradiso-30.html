<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXX</h3>
<p>Perchance six thousand miles remote from us<br/>
    Is glowing the sixth hour, and now this world<br/>
    Inclines its shadow almost to a level,</p>
<p>When the mid-heaven begins to make itself<br/>
    So deep to us, that here and there a star<br/>
    Ceases to shine so far down as this depth,</p>
<p>And as advances bright exceedingly<br/>
    The handmaid of the sun, the heaven is closed<br/>
    Light after light to the most beautiful;</p>
<p>Not otherwise the Triumph, which for ever<br/>
    Plays round about the point that vanquished me,<br/>
    Seeming enclosed by what itself encloses,</p>
<p>Little by little from my vision faded;<br/>
    Whereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice<br/>
    My seeing nothing and my love constrained me.</p>
<p>If what has hitherto been said of her<br/>
    Were all concluded in a single praise,<br/>
    Scant would it be to serve the present turn.</p>
<p>Not only does the beauty I beheld<br/>
    Transcend ourselves, but truly I believe<br/>
    Its Maker only may enjoy it all.</p>
<p>Vanquished do I confess me by this passage<br/>
    More than by problem of his theme was ever<br/>
    O'ercome the comic or the tragic poet;</p>
<p>For as the sun the sight that trembles most,<br/>
    Even so the memory of that sweet smile<br/>
    My mind depriveth of its very self.</p>
<p>From the first day that I beheld her face<br/>
    In this life, to the moment of this look,<br/>
    The sequence of my song has ne'er been severed;</p>
<p>But now perforce this sequence must desist<br/>
    From following her beauty with my verse,<br/>
    As every artist at his uttermost.</p>
<p>Such as I leave her to a greater fame<br/>
    Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing<br/>
    Its arduous matter to a final close,</p>
<p>With voice and gesture of a perfect leader<br/>
    She recommenced: "We from the greatest body<br/>
    Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;</p>
<p>Light intellectual replete with love,<br/>
    Love of true good replete with ecstasy,<br/>
    Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness.</p>
<p>Here shalt thou see the one host and the other<br/>
    Of Paradise, and one in the same aspects<br/>
    Which at the final judgment thou shalt see."</p>
<p>Even as a sudden lightning that disperses<br/>
    The visual spirits, so that it deprives<br/>
    The eye of impress from the strongest objects,</p>
<p>Thus round about me flashed a living light,<br/>
    And left me swathed around with such a veil<br/>
    Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw.</p>
<p>"Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven<br/>
    Welcomes into itself with such salute,<br/>
    To make the candle ready for its flame."</p>
<p>No sooner had within me these brief words<br/>
    An entrance found, than I perceived myself<br/>
    To be uplifted over my own power,</p>
<p>And I with vision new rekindled me,<br/>
    Such that no light whatever is so pure<br/>
    But that mine eyes were fortified against it.</p>
<p>And light I saw in fashion of a river<br/>
    Fulvid with its effulgence, 'twixt two banks<br/>
    Depicted with an admirable Spring.</p>
<p>Out of this river issued living sparks,<br/>
    And on all sides sank down into the flowers,<br/>
    Like unto rubies that are set in gold;</p>
<p>And then, as if inebriate with the odours,<br/>
    They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,<br/>
    And as one entered issued forth another.</p>
<p>"The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee<br/>
    To have intelligence of what thou seest,<br/>
    Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells.</p>
<p>But of this water it behoves thee drink<br/>
    Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked."<br/>
    Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;</p>
<p>And added: "The river and the topazes<br/>
    Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,<br/>
    Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;</p>
<p>Not that these things are difficult in themselves,<br/>
    But the deficiency is on thy side,<br/>
    For yet thou hast not vision so exalted."</p>
<p>There is no babe that leaps so suddenly<br/>
    With face towards the milk, if he awake<br/>
    Much later than his usual custom is,</p>
<p>As I did, that I might make better mirrors<br/>
    Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave<br/>
    Which flows that we therein be better made.</p>
<p>And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids<br/>
    Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me<br/>
    Out of its length to be transformed to round.</p>
<p>Then as a folk who have been under masks<br/>
    Seem other than before, if they divest<br/>
    The semblance not their own they disappeared in,</p>
<p>Thus into greater pomp were changed for me<br/>
    The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw<br/>
    Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.</p>
<p>O splendour of God! by means of which I saw<br/>
    The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,<br/>
    Give me the power to say how it I saw!</p>
<p>There is a light above, which visible<br/>
    Makes the Creator unto every creature,<br/>
    Who only in beholding Him has peace,</p>
<p>And it expands itself in circular form<br/>
    To such extent, that its circumference<br/>
    Would be too large a girdle for the sun.</p>
<p>The semblance of it is all made of rays<br/>
    Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,<br/>
    Which takes therefrom vitality and power.</p>
<p>And as a hill in water at its base<br/>
    Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty<br/>
    When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,</p>
<p>So, ranged aloft all round about the light,<br/>
    Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand<br/>
    All who above there have from us returned.</p>
<p>And if the lowest row collect within it<br/>
    So great a light, how vast the amplitude<br/>
    Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves!</p>
<p>My vision in the vastness and the height<br/>
    Lost not itself, but comprehended all<br/>
    The quantity and quality of that gladness.</p>
<p>There near and far nor add nor take away;<br/>
    For there where God immediately doth govern,<br/>
    The natural law in naught is relevant.</p>
<p>Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal<br/>
    That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odour<br/>
    Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun,</p>
<p>As one who silent is and fain would speak,<br/>
    Me Beatrice drew on, and said: "Behold<br/>
    Of the white stoles how vast the convent is!</p>
<p>Behold how vast the circuit of our city!<br/>
    Behold our seats so filled to overflowing,<br/>
    That here henceforward are few people wanting!</p>
<p>On that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed<br/>
    For the crown's sake already placed upon it,<br/>
    Before thou suppest at this wedding feast</p>
<p>Shall sit the soul (that is to be Augustus<br/>
    On earth) of noble Henry, who shall come<br/>
    To redress Italy ere she be ready.</p>
<p>Blind covetousness, that casts its spell upon you,<br/>
    Has made you like unto the little child,<br/>
    Who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse.</p>
<p>And in the sacred forum then shall be<br/>
    A Prefect such, that openly or covert<br/>
    On the same road he will not walk with him.</p>
<p>But long of God he will not be endured<br/>
    In holy office; he shall be thrust down<br/>
    Where Simon Magus is for his deserts,</p>
<p>And make him of Alagna lower go!"</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto IV</h3>
<p>Broke the deep lethargy within my head<br/>
    A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,<br/>
    Like to a person who by force is wakened;</p>
<p>And round about I moved my rested eyes,<br/>
    Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,<br/>
    To recognise the place wherein I was.</p>
<p>True is it, that upon the verge I found me<br/>
    Of the abysmal valley dolorous,<br/>
    That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.</p>
<p>Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,<br/>
    So that by fixing on its depths my sight<br/>
    Nothing whatever I discerned therein.</p>
<p>"Let us descend now into the blind world,"<br/>
    Began the Poet, pallid utterly;<br/>
    "I will be first, and thou shalt second be."</p>
<p>And I, who of his colour was aware,<br/>
    Said: "How shall I come, if thou art afraid,<br/>
    Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "The anguish of the people<br/>
    Who are below here in my face depicts<br/>
    That pity which for terror thou hast taken.</p>
<p>Let us go on, for the long way impels us."<br/>
    Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter<br/>
    The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.</p>
<p>There, as it seemed to me from listening,<br/>
    Were lamentations none, but only sighs,<br/>
    That tremble made the everlasting air.</p>
<p>And this arose from sorrow without torment,<br/>
    Which the crowds had, that many were and great,<br/>
    Of infants and of women and of men.</p>
<p>To me the Master good: "Thou dost not ask<br/>
    What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?<br/>
    Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,</p>
<p>That they sinned not; and if they merit had,<br/>
    'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism<br/>
    Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;</p>
<p>And if they were before Christianity,<br/>
    In the right manner they adored not God;<br/>
    And among such as these am I myself.</p>
<p>For such defects, and not for other guilt,<br/>
    Lost are we and are only so far punished,<br/>
    That without hope we live on in desire."</p>
<p>Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,<br/>
    Because some people of much worthiness<br/>
    I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.</p>
<p>"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,"<br/>
    Began I, with desire of being certain<br/>
    Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,</p>
<p>"Came any one by his own merit hence,<br/>
    Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?"<br/>
    And he, who understood my covert speech,</p>
<p>Replied: "I was a novice in this state,<br/>
    When I saw hither come a Mighty One,<br/>
    With sign of victory incoronate.</p>
<p>Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,<br/>
    And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,<br/>
    Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient</p>
<p>Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,<br/>
    Israel with his father and his children,<br/>
    And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,</p>
<p>And others many, and he made them blessed;<br/>
    And thou must know, that earlier than these<br/>
    Never were any human spirits saved."</p>
<p>We ceased not to advance because he spake,<br/>
    But still were passing onward through the forest,<br/>
    The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.</p>
<p>Not very far as yet our way had gone<br/>
    This side the summit, when I saw a fire<br/>
    That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.</p>
<p>We were a little distant from it still,<br/>
    But not so far that I in part discerned not<br/>
    That honourable people held that place.</p>
<p>"O thou who honourest every art and science,<br/>
    Who may these be, which such great honour have,<br/>
    That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "The honourable name,<br/>
    That sounds of them above there in thy life,<br/>
    Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them."</p>
<p>In the mean time a voice was heard by me:<br/>
    "All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;<br/>
    His shade returns again, that was departed."</p>
<p>After the voice had ceased and quiet was,<br/>
    Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;<br/>
    Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.</p>
<p>To say to me began my gracious Master:<br/>
    "Him with that falchion in his hand behold,<br/>
    Who comes before the three, even as their lord.</p>
<p>That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;<br/>
    He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;<br/>
    The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.</p>
<p>Because to each of these with me applies<br/>
    The name that solitary voice proclaimed,<br/>
    They do me honour, and in that do well."</p>
<p>Thus I beheld assemble the fair school<br/>
    Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,<br/>
    Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.</p>
<p>When they together had discoursed somewhat,<br/>
    They turned to me with signs of salutation,<br/>
    And on beholding this, my Master smiled;</p>
<p>And more of honour still, much more, they did me,<br/>
    In that they made me one of their own band;<br/>
    So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.</p>
<p>Thus we went on as far as to the light,<br/>
    Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,<br/>
    As was the saying of them where I was.</p>
<p>We came unto a noble castle's foot,<br/>
    Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,<br/>
    Defended round by a fair rivulet;</p>
<p>This we passed over even as firm ground;<br/>
    Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;<br/>
    We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.</p>
<p>People were there with solemn eyes and slow,<br/>
    Of great authority in their countenance;<br/>
    They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.</p>
<p>Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side<br/>
    Into an opening luminous and lofty,<br/>
    So that they all of them were visible.</p>
<p>There opposite, upon the green enamel,<br/>
    Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,<br/>
    Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.</p>
<p>I saw Electra with companions many,<br/>
    'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,<br/>
    Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;</p>
<p>I saw Camilla and Penthesilea<br/>
    On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,<br/>
    Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;</p>
<p>I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,<br/>
    Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,<br/>
    And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.</p>
<p>When I had lifted up my brows a little,<br/>
    The Master I beheld of those who know,<br/>
    Sit with his philosophic family.</p>
<p>All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.<br/>
    There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,<br/>
    Who nearer him before the others stand;</p>
<p>Democritus, who puts the world on chance,<br/>
    Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,<br/>
    Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;</p>
<p>Of qualities I saw the good collector,<br/>
    Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,<br/>
    Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,</p>
<p>Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,<br/>
    Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,<br/>
    Averroes, who the great Comment made.</p>
<p>I cannot all of them pourtray in full,<br/>
    Because so drives me onward the long theme,<br/>
    That many times the word comes short of fact.</p>
<p>The sixfold company in two divides;<br/>
    Another way my sapient Guide conducts me<br/>
    Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;</p>
<p>And to a place I come where nothing shines.</p>

<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXIV</h3>
<p>Nor speech the going, nor the going that<br/>
    Slackened; but talking we went bravely on,<br/>
    Even as a vessel urged by a good wind.</p>
<p>And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,<br/>
    From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed<br/>
    Wonder at me, aware that I was living.</p>
<p>And I, continuing my colloquy,<br/>
    Said: "Peradventure he goes up more slowly<br/>
    Than he would do, for other people's sake.</p>
<p>But tell me, if thou knowest, where is Piccarda;<br/>
    Tell me if any one of note I see<br/>
    Among this folk that gazes at me so."</p>
<p>"My sister, who, 'twixt beautiful and good,<br/>
    I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing<br/>
    Already in her crown on high Olympus."</p>
<p>So said he first, and then: "'Tis not forbidden<br/>
    To name each other here, so milked away<br/>
    Is our resemblance by our dieting.</p>
<p>This," pointing with his finger, "is Buonagiunta,<br/>
    Buonagiunta, of Lucca; and that face<br/>
    Beyond him there, more peaked than the others,</p>
<p>Has held the holy Church within his arms;<br/>
    From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting<br/>
    Bolsena's eels and the Vernaccia wine."</p>
<p>He named me many others one by one;<br/>
    And all contented seemed at being named,<br/>
    So that for this I saw not one dark look.</p>
<p>I saw for hunger bite the empty air<br/>
    Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,<br/>
    Who with his crook had pastured many people.</p>
<p>I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure<br/>
    Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,<br/>
    And he was one who ne'er felt satisfied.</p>
<p>But as he does who scans, and then doth prize<br/>
    One more than others, did I him of Lucca,<br/>
    Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.</p>
<p>He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca<br/>
    From that place heard I, where he felt the wound<br/>
    Of justice, that doth macerate them so.</p>
<p>"O soul," I said, "that seemest so desirous<br/>
    To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,<br/>
    And with thy speech appease thyself and me."</p>
<p>"A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,"<br/>
    Began he, "who to thee shall pleasant make<br/>
    My city, howsoever men may blame it.</p>
<p>Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;<br/>
    If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,<br/>
    True things hereafter will declare it to thee.</p>
<p>But say if him I here behold, who forth<br/>
    Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,<br/>
    'Ladies, that have intelligence of love?'"</p>
<p>And I to him: "One am I, who, whenever<br/>
    Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure<br/>
    Which he within me dictates, singing go."</p>
<p>"O brother, now I see," he said, "the knot<br/>
    Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held<br/>
    Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.</p>
<p>I do perceive full clearly how your pens<br/>
    Go closely following after him who dictates,<br/>
    Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;</p>
<p>And he who sets himself to go beyond,<br/>
    No difference sees from one style to another;"<br/>
    And as if satisfied, he held his peace.</p>
<p>Even as the birds, that winter tow'rds the Nile,<br/>
    Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,<br/>
    Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;</p>
<p>In such wise all the people who were there,<br/>
    Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,<br/>
    Both by their leanness and their wishes light.</p>
<p>And as a man, who weary is with trotting,<br/>
    Lets his companions onward go, and walks,<br/>
    Until he vents the panting of his chest;</p>
<p>So did Forese let the holy flock<br/>
    Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,<br/>
    "When will it be that I again shall see thee?"</p>
<p>"How long," I answered, "I may live, I know not;<br/>
    Yet my return will not so speedy be,<br/>
    But I shall sooner in desire arrive;</p>
<p>Because the place where I was set to live<br/>
    From day to day of good is more depleted,<br/>
    And unto dismal ruin seems ordained."</p>
<p>"Now go," he said, "for him most guilty of it<br/>
    At a beast's tail behold I dragged along<br/>
    Towards the valley where is no repentance.</p>
<p>Faster at every step the beast is going,<br/>
    Increasing evermore until it smites him,<br/>
    And leaves the body vilely mutilated.</p>
<p>Not long those wheels shall turn," and he uplifted<br/>
    His eyes to heaven, "ere shall be clear to thee<br/>
    That which my speech no farther can declare.</p>
<p>Now stay behind; because the time so precious<br/>
    Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much<br/>
    By coming onward thus abreast with thee."</p>
<p>As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop<br/>
    A cavalier from out a troop that ride,<br/>
    And seeks the honour of the first encounter,</p>
<p>So he with greater strides departed from us;<br/>
    And on the road remained I with those two,<br/>
    Who were such mighty marshals of the world.</p>
<p>And when before us he had gone so far<br/>
    Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants<br/>
    As was my understanding to his words,</p>
<p>Appeared to me with laden and living boughs<br/>
    Another apple-tree, and not far distant,<br/>
    From having but just then turned thitherward.</p>
<p>People I saw beneath it lift their hands,<br/>
    And cry I know not what towards the leaves,<br/>
    Like little children eager and deluded,</p>
<p>Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,<br/>
    But, to make very keen their appetite,<br/>
    Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.</p>
<p>Then they departed as if undeceived;<br/>
    And now we came unto the mighty tree<br/>
    Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.</p>
<p>"Pass farther onward without drawing near;<br/>
    The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,<br/>
    And out of that one has this tree been raised."</p>
<p>Thus said I know not who among the branches;<br/>
    Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself<br/>
    Went crowding forward on the side that rises.</p>
<p>"Be mindful," said he, "of the accursed ones<br/>
    Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate<br/>
    Combated Theseus with their double breasts;</p>
<p>And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,<br/>
    Whence Gideon would not have them for companions<br/>
    When he tow'rds Midian the hills descended."</p>
<p>Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,<br/>
    On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,<br/>
    Followed forsooth by miserable gains;</p>
<p>Then set at large upon the lonely road,<br/>
    A thousand steps and more we onward went,<br/>
    In contemplation, each without a word.</p>
<p>"What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?"<br/>
    Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started<br/>
    As terrified and timid beasts are wont.</p>
<p>I raised my head to see who this might be,<br/>
    And never in a furnace was there seen<br/>
    Metals or glass so lucent and so red</p>
<p>As one I saw who said: "If it may please you<br/>
    To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;<br/>
    This way goes he who goeth after peace."</p>
<p>His aspect had bereft me of my sight,<br/>
    So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,<br/>
    Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.</p>
<p>And as, the harbinger of early dawn,<br/>
    The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,<br/>
    Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,</p>
<p>So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst<br/>
    My front, and felt the moving of the plumes<br/>
    That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;</p>
<p>And heard it said: "Blessed are they whom grace<br/>
    So much illumines, that the love of taste<br/>
    Excites not in their breasts too great desire,</p>
<p>Hungering at all times so far as is just."</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XV</h3>
<p>Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,<br/>
    And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it,<br/>
    From fire it saves the water and the dikes.</p>
<p>Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,<br/>
    Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,<br/>
    Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;</p>
<p>And as the Paduans along the Brenta,<br/>
    To guard their villas and their villages,<br/>
    Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;</p>
<p>In such similitude had those been made,<br/>
    Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,<br/>
    Whoever he might be, the master made them.</p>
<p>Now were we from the forest so remote,<br/>
    I could not have discovered where it was,<br/>
    Even if backward I had turned myself,</p>
<p>When we a company of souls encountered,<br/>
    Who came beside the dike, and every one<br/>
    Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont</p>
<p>To eye each other under a new moon,<br/>
    And so towards us sharpened they their brows<br/>
    As an old tailor at the needle's eye.</p>
<p>Thus scrutinised by such a family,<br/>
    By some one I was recognised, who seized<br/>
    My garment's hem, and cried out, "What a marvel!"</p>
<p>And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,<br/>
    On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,<br/>
    That the scorched countenance prevented not</p>
<p>His recognition by my intellect;<br/>
    And bowing down my face unto his own,<br/>
    I made reply, "Are you here, Ser Brunetto?"</p>
<p>And he: "May't not displease thee, O my son,<br/>
    If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini<br/>
    Backward return and let the trail go on."</p>
<p>I said to him: "With all my power I ask it;<br/>
    And if you wish me to sit down with you,<br/>
    I will, if he please, for I go with him."</p>
<p>"O son," he said, "whoever of this herd<br/>
    A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,<br/>
    Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.</p>
<p>Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,<br/>
    And afterward will I rejoin my band,<br/>
    Which goes lamenting its eternal doom."</p>
<p>I did not dare to go down from the road<br/>
    Level to walk with him; but my head bowed<br/>
    I held as one who goeth reverently.</p>
<p>And he began: "What fortune or what fate<br/>
    Before the last day leadeth thee down here?<br/>
    And who is this that showeth thee the way?"</p>
<p>"Up there above us in the life serene,"<br/>
    I answered him, "I lost me in a valley,<br/>
    Or ever yet my age had been completed.</p>
<p>But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;<br/>
    This one appeared to me, returning thither,<br/>
    And homeward leadeth me along this road."</p>
<p>And he to me: "If thou thy star do follow,<br/>
    Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,<br/>
    If well I judged in the life beautiful.</p>
<p>And if I had not died so prematurely,<br/>
    Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,<br/>
    I would have given thee comfort in the work.</p>
<p>But that ungrateful and malignant people,<br/>
    Which of old time from Fesole descended,<br/>
    And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,</p>
<p>Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;<br/>
    And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs<br/>
    It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;<br/>
    A people avaricious, envious, proud;<br/>
    Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.</p>
<p>Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,<br/>
    One party and the other shall be hungry<br/>
    For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.</p>
<p>Their litter let the beasts of Fesole<br/>
    Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,<br/>
    If any still upon their dunghill rise,</p>
<p>In which may yet revive the consecrated<br/>
    Seed of those Romans, who remained there when<br/>
    The nest of such great malice it became."</p>
<p>"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,"<br/>
    Replied I to him, "not yet would you be<br/>
    In banishment from human nature placed;</p>
<p>For in my mind is fixed, and touches now<br/>
    My heart the dear and good paternal image<br/>
    Of you, when in the world from hour to hour</p>
<p>You taught me how a man becomes eternal;<br/>
    And how much I am grateful, while I live<br/>
    Behoves that in my language be discerned.</p>
<p>What you narrate of my career I write,<br/>
    And keep it to be glossed with other text<br/>
    By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.</p>
<p>This much will I have manifest to you;<br/>
    Provided that my conscience do not chide me,<br/>
    For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.</p>
<p>Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;<br/>
    Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around<br/>
    As it may please her, and the churl his mattock."</p>
<p>My Master thereupon on his right cheek<br/>
    Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;<br/>
    Then said: "He listeneth well who noteth it."</p>
<p>Nor speaking less on that account, I go<br/>
    With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are<br/>
    His most known and most eminent companions.</p>
<p>And he to me: "To know of some is well;<br/>
    Of others it were laudable to be silent,<br/>
    For short would be the time for so much speech.</p>
<p>Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,<br/>
    And men of letters great and of great fame,<br/>
    In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.</p>
<p>Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,<br/>
    And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there<br/>
    If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,</p>
<p>That one, who by the Servant of the Servants<br/>
    From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,<br/>
    Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.</p>
<p>More would I say, but coming and discoursing<br/>
    Can be no longer; for that I behold<br/>
    New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.</p>
<p>A people comes with whom I may not be;<br/>
    Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,<br/>
    In which I still live, and no more I ask."</p>
<p>Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those<br/>
    Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle<br/>
    Across the plain; and seemed to be among them</p>
<p>The one who wins, and not the one who loses.</p>

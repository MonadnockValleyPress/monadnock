<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXIII</h3>
<p>Silent, alone, and without company<br/>
    We went, the one in front, the other after,<br/>
    As go the Minor Friars along their way.</p>
<p>Upon the fable of Aesop was directed<br/>
    My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,<br/>
    Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;</p>
<p>For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike<br/>
    Than this one is to that, if well we couple<br/>
    End and beginning with a steadfast mind.</p>
<p>And even as one thought from another springs,<br/>
    So afterward from that was born another,<br/>
    Which the first fear within me double made.</p>
<p>Thus did I ponder: "These on our account<br/>
    Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff<br/>
    So great, that much I think it must annoy them.</p>
<p>If anger be engrafted on ill-will,<br/>
    They will come after us more merciless<br/>
    Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,"</p>
<p>I felt my hair stand all on end already<br/>
    With terror, and stood backwardly intent,<br/>
    When said I: "Master, if thou hidest not</p>
<p>Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche<br/>
    I am in dread; we have them now behind us;<br/>
    I so imagine them, I already feel them."</p>
<p>And he: "If I were made of leaded glass,<br/>
    Thine outward image I should not attract<br/>
    Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.</p>
<p>Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,<br/>
    With similar attitude and similar face,<br/>
    So that of both one counsel sole I made.</p>
<p>If peradventure the right bank so slope<br/>
    That we to the next Bolgia can descend,<br/>
    We shall escape from the imagined chase."</p>
<p>Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,<br/>
    When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,<br/>
    Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.</p>
<p>My Leader on a sudden seized me up,<br/>
    Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,<br/>
    And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,</p>
<p>Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,<br/>
    Having more care of him than of herself,<br/>
    So that she clothes her only with a shift;</p>
<p>And downward from the top of the hard bank<br/>
    Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,<br/>
    That one side of the other Bolgia walls.</p>
<p>Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice<br/>
    To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,<br/>
    When nearest to the paddles it approaches,</p>
<p>As did my Master down along that border,<br/>
    Bearing me with him on his breast away,<br/>
    As his own son, and not as a companion.</p>
<p>Hardly the bed of the ravine below<br/>
    His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill<br/>
    Right over us; but he was not afraid;</p>
<p>For the high Providence, which had ordained<br/>
    To place them ministers of the fifth moat,<br/>
    The power of thence departing took from all.</p>
<p>A painted people there below we found,<br/>
    Who went about with footsteps very slow,<br/>
    Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.</p>
<p>They had on mantles with the hoods low down<br/>
    Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut<br/>
    That in Cologne they for the monks are made.</p>
<p>Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;<br/>
    But inwardly all leaden and so heavy<br/>
    That Frederick used to put them on of straw.</p>
<p>O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!<br/>
    Again we turned us, still to the left hand<br/>
    Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;</p>
<p>But owing to the weight, that weary folk<br/>
    Came on so tardily, that we were new<br/>
    In company at each motion of the haunch.</p>
<p>Whence I unto my Leader: "See thou find<br/>
    Some one who may by deed or name be known,<br/>
    And thus in going move thine eye about."</p>
<p>And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,<br/>
    Cried to us from behind: "Stay ye your feet,<br/>
    Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!</p>
<p>Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest."<br/>
    Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: "Wait,<br/>
    And then according to his pace proceed."</p>
<p>I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste<br/>
    Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;<br/>
    But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.</p>
<p>When they came up, long with an eye askance<br/>
    They scanned me without uttering a word.<br/>
    Then to each other turned, and said together:</p>
<p>"He by the action of his throat seems living;<br/>
    And if they dead are, by what privilege<br/>
    Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?"</p>
<p>Then said to me: "Tuscan, who to the college<br/>
    Of miserable hypocrites art come,<br/>
    Do not disdain to tell us who thou art."</p>
<p>And I to them: "Born was I, and grew up<br/>
    In the great town on the fair river of Arno,<br/>
    And with the body am I've always had.</p>
<p>But who are ye, in whom there trickles down<br/>
    Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?<br/>
    And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?"</p>
<p>And one replied to me: "These orange cloaks<br/>
    Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights<br/>
    Cause in this way their balances to creak.</p>
<p>Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;<br/>
    I Catalano, and he Loderingo<br/>
    Named, and together taken by thy city,</p>
<p>As the wont is to take one man alone,<br/>
    For maintenance of its peace; and we were such<br/>
    That still it is apparent round Gardingo."</p>
<p>"O Friars," began I, "your iniquitous. . ."<br/>
    But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed<br/>
    One crucified with three stakes on the ground.</p>
<p>When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,<br/>
    Blowing into his beard with suspirations;<br/>
    And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,</p>
<p>Said to me: "This transfixed one, whom thou seest,<br/>
    Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet<br/>
    To put one man to torture for the people.</p>
<p>Crosswise and naked is he on the path,<br/>
    As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,<br/>
    Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;</p>
<p>And in like mode his father-in-law is punished<br/>
    Within this moat, and the others of the council,<br/>
    Which for the Jews was a malignant seed."</p>
<p>And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel<br/>
    O'er him who was extended on the cross<br/>
    So vilely in eternal banishment.</p>
<p>Then he directed to the Friar this voice:<br/>
    "Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us<br/>
    If to the right hand any pass slope down</p>
<p>By which we two may issue forth from here,<br/>
    Without constraining some of the black angels<br/>
    To come and extricate us from this deep."</p>
<p>Then he made answer: "Nearer than thou hopest<br/>
    There is a rock, that forth from the great circle<br/>
    Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,</p>
<p>Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;<br/>
    You will be able to mount up the ruin,<br/>
    That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises."</p>
<p>The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;<br/>
    Then said: "The business badly he recounted<br/>
    Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder."</p>
<p>And the Friar: "Many of the Devil's vices<br/>
    Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,<br/>
    That he's a liar and the father of lies."</p>
<p>Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,<br/>
    Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;<br/>
    Whence from the heavy-laden I departed</p>
<p>After the prints of his beloved feet.</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXXII</h3>
<p>If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,<br/>
    As were appropriate to the dismal hole<br/>
    Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,</p>
<p>I would press out the juice of my conception<br/>
    More fully; but because I have them not,<br/>
    Not without fear I bring myself to speak;</p>
<p>For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest,<br/>
    To sketch the bottom of all the universe,<br/>
    Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.</p>
<p>But may those Ladies help this verse of mine,<br/>
    Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,<br/>
    That from the fact the word be not diverse.</p>
<p>O rabble ill-begotten above all,<br/>
    Who're in the place to speak of which is hard,<br/>
    'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!</p>
<p>When we were down within the darksome well,<br/>
    Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,<br/>
    And I was scanning still the lofty wall,</p>
<p>I heard it said to me: "Look how thou steppest!<br/>
    Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet<br/>
    The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!"</p>
<p>Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me<br/>
    And underfoot a lake, that from the frost<br/>
    The semblance had of glass, and not of water.</p>
<p>So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current<br/>
    In winter-time Danube in Austria,<br/>
    Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,</p>
<p>As there was here; so that if Tambernich<br/>
    Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,<br/>
    E'en at the edge 'twould not have given a creak.</p>
<p>And as to croak the frog doth place himself<br/>
    With muzzle out of water,&mdash;when is dreaming<br/>
    Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,&mdash;</p>
<p>Livid, as far down as where shame appears,<br/>
    Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,<br/>
    Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.</p>
<p>Each one his countenance held downward bent;<br/>
    From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart<br/>
    Among them witness of itself procures.</p>
<p>When round about me somewhat I had looked,<br/>
    I downward turned me, and saw two so close,<br/>
    The hair upon their heads together mingled.</p>
<p>"Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,"<br/>
    I said, "who are you;" and they bent their necks,<br/>
    And when to me their faces they had lifted,</p>
<p>Their eyes, which first were only moist within,<br/>
    Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed<br/>
    The tears between, and locked them up again.</p>
<p>Clamp never bound together wood with wood<br/>
    So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,<br/>
    Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them.</p>
<p>And one, who had by reason of the cold<br/>
    Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,<br/>
    Said: "Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?</p>
<p>If thou desire to know who these two are,<br/>
    The valley whence Bisenzio descends<br/>
    Belonged to them and to their father Albert.</p>
<p>They from one body came, and all Caina<br/>
    Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade<br/>
    More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;</p>
<p>Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow<br/>
    At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand;<br/>
    Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers</p>
<p>So with his head I see no farther forward,<br/>
    And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;<br/>
    Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.</p>
<p>And that thou put me not to further speech,<br/>
    Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was,<br/>
    And wait Carlino to exonerate me."</p>
<p>Then I beheld a thousand faces, made<br/>
    Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder,<br/>
    And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.</p>
<p>And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle,<br/>
    Where everything of weight unites together,<br/>
    And I was shivering in the eternal shade,</p>
<p>Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance,<br/>
    I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads<br/>
    I struck my foot hard in the face of one.</p>
<p>Weeping he growled: "Why dost thou trample me?<br/>
    Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance<br/>
    of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?"</p>
<p>And I: "My Master, now wait here for me,<br/>
    That I through him may issue from a doubt;<br/>
    Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish."</p>
<p>The Leader stopped; and to that one I said<br/>
    Who was blaspheming vehemently still:<br/>
    "Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?"</p>
<p>"Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora<br/>
    Smiting," replied he, "other people's cheeks,<br/>
    So that, if thou wert living, 'twere too much?"</p>
<p>"Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,"<br/>
    Was my response, "if thou demandest fame,<br/>
    That 'mid the other notes thy name I place."</p>
<p>And he to me: "For the reverse I long;<br/>
    Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;<br/>
    For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow."</p>
<p>Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,<br/>
    And said: "It must needs be thou name thyself,<br/>
    Or not a hair remain upon thee here."</p>
<p>Whence he to me: "Though thou strip off my hair,<br/>
    I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,<br/>
    If on my head a thousand times thou fall."</p>
<p>I had his hair in hand already twisted,<br/>
    And more than one shock of it had pulled out,<br/>
    He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,</p>
<p>When cried another: "What doth ail thee, Bocca?<br/>
    Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws,<br/>
    But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?"</p>
<p>"Now," said I, "I care not to have thee speak,<br/>
    Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame<br/>
    I will report of thee veracious news."</p>
<p>"Begone," replied he, "and tell what thou wilt,<br/>
    But be not silent, if thou issue hence,<br/>
    Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;</p>
<p>He weepeth here the silver of the French;<br/>
    'I saw,' thus canst thou phrase it, 'him of Duera<br/>
    There where the sinners stand out in the cold.'</p>
<p>If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,<br/>
    Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,<br/>
    Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;</p>
<p>Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be<br/>
    Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello<br/>
    Who oped Faenza when the people slep."</p>
<p>Already we had gone away from him,<br/>
    When I beheld two frozen in one hole,<br/>
    So that one head a hood was to the other;</p>
<p>And even as bread through hunger is devoured,<br/>
    The uppermost on the other set his teeth,<br/>
    There where the brain is to the nape united.</p>
<p>Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed<br/>
    The temples of Menalippus in disdain,<br/>
    Than that one did the skull and the other things.</p>
<p>"O thou, who showest by such bestial sign<br/>
    Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,<br/>
    Tell me the wherefore," said I, "with this compact,</p>
<p>That if thou rightfully of him complain,<br/>
    In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,<br/>
    I in the world above repay thee for it,</p>
<p>If that wherewith I speak be not dried up."</p>

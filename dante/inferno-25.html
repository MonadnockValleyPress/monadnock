<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXV</h3>
<p>At the conclusion of his words, the thief<br/>
    Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,<br/>
    Crying: "Take that, God, for at thee I aim them."</p>
<p>From that time forth the serpents were my friends;<br/>
    For one entwined itself about his neck<br/>
    As if it said: "I will not thou speak more;"</p>
<p>And round his arms another, and rebound him,<br/>
    Clinching itself together so in front,<br/>
    That with them he could not a motion make.</p>
<p>Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not<br/>
    To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,<br/>
    Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?</p>
<p>Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,<br/>
    Spirit I saw not against God so proud,<br/>
    Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!</p>
<p>He fled away, and spake no further word;<br/>
    And I beheld a Centaur full of rage<br/>
    Come crying out: "Where is, where is the scoffer?"</p>
<p>I do not think Maremma has so many<br/>
    Serpents as he had all along his back,<br/>
    As far as where our countenance begins.</p>
<p>Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,<br/>
    With wings wide open was a dragon lying,<br/>
    And he sets fire to all that he encounters.</p>
<p>My Master said: "That one is Cacus, who<br/>
    Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine<br/>
    Created oftentimes a lake of blood.</p>
<p>He goes not on the same road with his brothers,<br/>
    By reason of the fraudulent theft he made<br/>
    Of the great herd, which he had near to him;</p>
<p>Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath<br/>
    The mace of Hercules, who peradventure<br/>
    Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten."</p>
<p>While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,<br/>
    And spirits three had underneath us come,<br/>
    Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,</p>
<p>Until what time they shouted: "Who are you?"<br/>
    On which account our story made a halt,<br/>
    And then we were intent on them alone.</p>
<p>I did not know them; but it came to pass,<br/>
    As it is wont to happen by some chance,<br/>
    That one to name the other was compelled,</p>
<p>Exclaiming: "Where can Cianfa have remained?"<br/>
    Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,<br/>
    Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.</p>
<p>If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe<br/>
    What I shall say, it will no marvel be,<br/>
    For I who saw it hardly can admit it.</p>
<p>As I was holding raised on them my brows,<br/>
    Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth<br/>
    In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.</p>
<p>With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,<br/>
    And with the forward ones his arms it seized;<br/>
    Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;</p>
<p>The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,<br/>
    And put its tail through in between the two,<br/>
    And up behind along the reins outspread it.</p>
<p>Ivy was never fastened by its barbs<br/>
    Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile<br/>
    Upon the other's limbs entwined its own.</p>
<p>Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax<br/>
    They had been made, and intermixed their colour;<br/>
    Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;</p>
<p>E'en as proceedeth on before the flame<br/>
    Upward along the paper a brown colour,<br/>
    Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.</p>
<p>The other two looked on, and each of them<br/>
    Cried out: "O me, Agnello, how thou changest!<br/>
    Behold, thou now art neither two nor one."</p>
<p>Already the two heads had one become,<br/>
    When there appeared to us two figures mingled<br/>
    Into one face, wherein the two were lost.</p>
<p>Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,<br/>
    The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest<br/>
    Members became that never yet were seen.</p>
<p>Every original aspect there was cancelled;<br/>
    Two and yet none did the perverted image<br/>
    Appear, and such departed with slow pace.</p>
<p>Even as a lizard, under the great scourge<br/>
    Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,<br/>
    Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;</p>
<p>Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies<br/>
    Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,<br/>
    Livid and black as is a peppercorn.</p>
<p>And in that part whereat is first received<br/>
    Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;<br/>
    Then downward fell in front of him extended.</p>
<p>The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;<br/>
    Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,<br/>
    Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.</p>
<p>He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;<br/>
    One through the wound, the other through the mouth<br/>
    Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.</p>
<p>Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions<br/>
    Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,<br/>
    And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.</p>
<p>Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;<br/>
    For if him to a snake, her to fountain,<br/>
    Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;</p>
<p>Because two natures never front to front<br/>
    Has he transmuted, so that both the forms<br/>
    To interchange their matter ready were.</p>
<p>Together they responded in such wise,<br/>
    That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,<br/>
    And eke the wounded drew his feet together.</p>
<p>The legs together with the thighs themselves<br/>
    Adhered so, that in little time the juncture<br/>
    No sign whatever made that was apparent.</p>
<p>He with the cloven tail assumed the figure<br/>
    The other one was losing, and his skin<br/>
    Became elastic, and the other's hard.</p>
<p>I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,<br/>
    And both feet of the reptile, that were short,<br/>
    Lengthen as much as those contracted were.</p>
<p>Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,<br/>
    Became the member that a man conceals,<br/>
    And of his own the wretch had two created.</p>
<p>While both of them the exhalation veils<br/>
    With a new colour, and engenders hair<br/>
    On one of them and depilates the other,</p>
<p>The one uprose and down the other fell,<br/>
    Though turning not away their impious lamps,<br/>
    Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.</p>
<p>He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,<br/>
    And from excess of matter, which came thither,<br/>
    Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;</p>
<p>What did not backward run and was retained<br/>
    Of that excess made to the face a nose,<br/>
    And the lips thickened far as was befitting.</p>
<p>He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,<br/>
    And backward draws the ears into his head,<br/>
    In the same manner as the snail its horns;</p>
<p>And so the tongue, which was entire and apt<br/>
    For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked<br/>
    In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.</p>
<p>The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,<br/>
    Along the valley hissing takes to flight,<br/>
    And after him the other speaking sputters.</p>
<p>Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,<br/>
    And said to the other: "I'll have Buoso run,<br/>
    Crawling as I have done, along this road."</p>
<p>In this way I beheld the seventh ballast<br/>
    Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse<br/>
    The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.</p>
<p>And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be<br/>
    Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,<br/>
    They could not flee away so secretly</p>
<p>But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;<br/>
    And he it was who sole of three companions,<br/>
    Which came in the beginning, was not changed;</p>
<p>The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.</p>

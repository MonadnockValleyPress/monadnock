<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XI</h3>
<p>Upon the margin of a lofty bank<br/>
    Which great rocks broken in a circle made,<br/>
    We came upon a still more cruel throng;</p>
<p>And there, by reason of the horrible<br/>
    Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,<br/>
    We drew ourselves aside behind the cover</p>
<p>Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,<br/>
    Which said: "Pope Anastasius I hold,<br/>
    Whom out of the right way Photinus drew."</p>
<p>"Slow it behoveth our descent to be,<br/>
    So that the sense be first a little used<br/>
    To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it."</p>
<p>The Master thus; and unto him I said,<br/>
    "Some compensation find, that the time pass not<br/>
    Idly;" and he: "Thou seest I think of that.</p>
<p>My son, upon the inside of these rocks,"<br/>
    Began he then to say, "are three small circles,<br/>
    From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.</p>
<p>They all are full of spirits maledict;<br/>
    But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,<br/>
    Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.</p>
<p>Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,<br/>
    Injury is the end; and all such end<br/>
    Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.</p>
<p>But because fraud is man's peculiar vice,<br/>
    More it displeases God; and so stand lowest<br/>
    The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.</p>
<p>All the first circle of the Violent is;<br/>
    But since force may be used against three persons,<br/>
    In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed.</p>
<p>To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we<br/>
    Use force; I say on them and on their things,<br/>
    As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.</p>
<p>A death by violence, and painful wounds,<br/>
    Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance<br/>
    Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;</p>
<p>Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,<br/>
    Marauders, and freebooters, the first round<br/>
    Tormenteth all in companies diverse.</p>
<p>Man may lay violent hands upon himself<br/>
    And his own goods; and therefore in the second<br/>
    Round must perforce without avail repent</p>
<p>Whoever of your world deprives himself,<br/>
    Who games, and dissipates his property,<br/>
    And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.</p>
<p>Violence can be done the Deity,<br/>
    In heart denying and blaspheming Him,<br/>
    And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.</p>
<p>And for this reason doth the smallest round<br/>
    Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,<br/>
    And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.</p>
<p>Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,<br/>
    A man may practise upon him who trusts,<br/>
    And him who doth no confidence imburse.</p>
<p>This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers<br/>
    Only the bond of love which Nature makes;<br/>
    Wherefore within the second circle nestle</p>
<p>Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,<br/>
    Falsification, theft, and simony,<br/>
    Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.</p>
<p>By the other mode, forgotten is that love<br/>
    Which Nature makes, and what is after added,<br/>
    From which there is a special faith engendered.</p>
<p>Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is<br/>
    Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,<br/>
    Whoe'er betrays for ever is consumed."</p>
<p>And I: "My Master, clear enough proceeds<br/>
    Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes<br/>
    This cavern and the people who possess it.</p>
<p>But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,<br/>
    Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,<br/>
    And who encounter with such bitter tongues,</p>
<p>Wherefore are they inside of the red city<br/>
    Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,<br/>
    And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?"</p>
<p>And unto me he said: "Why wanders so<br/>
    Thine intellect from that which it is wont?<br/>
    Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?</p>
<p>Hast thou no recollection of those words<br/>
    With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses<br/>
    The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,&mdash;</p>
<p>Incontinence, and Malice, and insane<br/>
    Bestiality? and how Incontinence<br/>
    Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?</p>
<p>If thou regardest this conclusion well,<br/>
    And to thy mind recallest who they are<br/>
    That up outside are undergoing penance,</p>
<p>Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons<br/>
    They separated are, and why less wroth<br/>
    Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer."</p>
<p>"O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,<br/>
    Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,<br/>
    That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!</p>
<p>Once more a little backward turn thee," said I,<br/>
    "There where thou sayest that usury offends<br/>
    Goodness divine, and disengage the knot."</p>
<p>"Philosophy," he said, "to him who heeds it,<br/>
    Noteth, not only in one place alone,<br/>
    After what manner Nature takes her course</p>
<p>From Intellect Divine, and from its art;<br/>
    And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,<br/>
    After not many pages shalt thou find,</p>
<p>That this your art as far as possible<br/>
    Follows, as the disciple doth the master;<br/>
    So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild.</p>
<p>From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind<br/>
    Genesis at the beginning, it behoves<br/>
    Mankind to gain their life and to advance;</p>
<p>And since the usurer takes another way,<br/>
    Nature herself and in her follower<br/>
    Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.</p>
<p>But follow, now, as I would fain go on,<br/>
    For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,<br/>
    And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,</p>
<p>And far beyond there we descend the crag."</p>

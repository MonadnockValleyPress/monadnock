<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto X</h3>
<p>Now onward goes, along a narrow path<br/>
    Between the torments and the city wall,<br/>
    My Master, and I follow at his back.</p>
<p>"O power supreme, that through these impious circles<br/>
    Turnest me," I began, "as pleases thee,<br/>
    Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;</p>
<p>The people who are lying in these tombs,<br/>
    Might they be seen? already are uplifted<br/>
    The covers all, and no one keepeth guard."</p>
<p>And he to me: "They all will be closed up<br/>
    When from Jehoshaphat they shall return<br/>
    Here with the bodies they have left above.</p>
<p>Their cemetery have upon this side<br/>
    With Epicurus all his followers,<br/>
    Who with the body mortal make the soul;</p>
<p>But in the question thou dost put to me,<br/>
    Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,<br/>
    And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent."</p>
<p>And I: "Good Leader, I but keep concealed<br/>
    From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,<br/>
    Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me."</p>
<p>"O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire<br/>
    Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,<br/>
    Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.</p>
<p>Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest<br/>
    A native of that noble fatherland,<br/>
    To which perhaps I too molestful was."</p>
<p>Upon a sudden issued forth this sound<br/>
    From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,<br/>
    Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.</p>
<p>And unto me he said: "Turn thee; what dost thou?<br/>
    Behold there Farinata who has risen;<br/>
    From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him."</p>
<p>I had already fixed mine eyes on his,<br/>
    And he uprose erect with breast and front<br/>
    E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.</p>
<p>And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader<br/>
    Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,<br/>
    Exclaiming, "Let thy words explicit be."</p>
<p>As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb<br/>
    Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,<br/>
    Then asked of me, "Who were thine ancestors?"</p>
<p>I, who desirous of obeying was,<br/>
    Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;<br/>
    Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.</p>
<p>Then said he: "Fiercely adverse have they been<br/>
    To me, and to my fathers, and my party;<br/>
    So that two several times I scattered them."</p>
<p>"If they were banished, they returned on all sides,"<br/>
    I answered him, "the first time and the second;<br/>
    But yours have not acquired that art aright."</p>
<p>Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered<br/>
    Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;<br/>
    I think that he had risen on his knees.</p>
<p>Round me he gazed, as if solicitude<br/>
    He had to see if some one else were with me,<br/>
    But after his suspicion was all spent,</p>
<p>Weeping, he said to me: "If through this blind<br/>
    Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,<br/>
    Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?"</p>
<p>And I to him: "I come not of myself;<br/>
    He who is waiting yonder leads me here,<br/>
    Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had."</p>
<p>His language and the mode of punishment<br/>
    Already unto me had read his name;<br/>
    On that account my answer was so full.</p>
<p>Up starting suddenly, he cried out: "How<br/>
    Saidst thou,&mdash;he had? Is he not still alive?<br/>
    Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?"</p>
<p>When he became aware of some delay,<br/>
    Which I before my answer made, supine<br/>
    He fell again, and forth appeared no more.</p>
<p>But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire<br/>
    I had remained, did not his aspect change,<br/>
    Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.</p>
<p>"And if," continuing his first discourse,<br/>
    "They have that art," he said, "not learned aright,<br/>
    That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.</p>
<p>But fifty times shall not rekindled be<br/>
    The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,<br/>
    Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;</p>
<p>And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,<br/>
    Say why that people is so pitiless<br/>
    Against my race in each one of its laws?"</p>
<p>Whence I to him: "The slaughter and great carnage<br/>
    Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause<br/>
    Such orisons in our temple to be made."</p>
<p>After his head he with a sigh had shaken,<br/>
    "There I was not alone," he said, "nor surely<br/>
    Without a cause had with the others moved.</p>
<p>But there I was alone, where every one<br/>
    Consented to the laying waste of Florence,<br/>
    He who defended her with open face."</p>
<p>"Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,"<br/>
    I him entreated, "solve for me that knot,<br/>
    Which has entangled my conceptions here.</p>
<p>It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,<br/>
    Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,<br/>
    And in the present have another mode."</p>
<p>"We see, like those who have imperfect sight,<br/>
    The things," he said, "that distant are from us;<br/>
    So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.</p>
<p>When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain<br/>
    Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,<br/>
    Not anything know we of your human state.</p>
<p>Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead<br/>
    Will be our knowledge from the moment when<br/>
    The portal of the future shall be closed."</p>
<p>Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,<br/>
    Said: "Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,<br/>
    That still his son is with the living joined.</p>
<p>And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,<br/>
    Tell him I did it because I was thinking<br/>
    Already of the error you have solved me."</p>
<p>And now my Master was recalling me,<br/>
    Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit<br/>
    That he would tell me who was with him there.</p>
<p>He said: "With more than a thousand here I lie;<br/>
    Within here is the second Frederick,<br/>
    And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not."</p>
<p>Thereon he hid himself; and I towards<br/>
    The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting<br/>
    Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.</p>
<p>He moved along; and afterward thus going,<br/>
    He said to me, "Why art thou so bewildered?"<br/>
    And I in his inquiry satisfied him.</p>
<p>"Let memory preserve what thou hast heard<br/>
    Against thyself," that Sage commanded me,<br/>
    "And now attend here;" and he raised his finger.</p>
<p>"When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet<br/>
    Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,<br/>
    From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life."</p>
<p>Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;<br/>
    We left the wall, and went towards the middle,<br/>
    Along a path that strikes into a valley,</p>
<p>Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</p>

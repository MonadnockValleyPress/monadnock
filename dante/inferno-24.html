<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXIV</h3>
<p>In that part of the youthful year wherein<br/>
    The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,<br/>
    And now the nights draw near to half the day,</p>
<p>What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground<br/>
    The outward semblance of her sister white,<br/>
    But little lasts the temper of her pen,</p>
<p>The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,<br/>
    Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign<br/>
    All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,</p>
<p>Returns in doors, and up and down laments,<br/>
    Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;<br/>
    Then he returns and hope revives again,</p>
<p>Seeing the world has changed its countenance<br/>
    In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,<br/>
    And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.</p>
<p>Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,<br/>
    When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,<br/>
    And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.</p>
<p>For as we came unto the ruined bridge,<br/>
    The Leader turned to me with that sweet look<br/>
    Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.</p>
<p>His arms he opened, after some advisement<br/>
    Within himself elected, looking first<br/>
    Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.</p>
<p>And even as he who acts and meditates,<br/>
    For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,<br/>
    So upward lifting me towards the summit</p>
<p>Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,<br/>
    Saying: "To that one grapple afterwards,<br/>
    But try first if 'tis such that it will hold thee."</p>
<p>This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;<br/>
    For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,<br/>
    Were able to ascend from jag to jag.</p>
<p>And had it not been, that upon that precinct<br/>
    Shorter was the ascent than on the other,<br/>
    He I know not, but I had been dead beat.</p>
<p>But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth<br/>
    Of the profoundest well is all inclining,<br/>
    The structure of each valley doth import</p>
<p>That one bank rises and the other sinks.<br/>
    Still we arrived at length upon the point<br/>
    Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.</p>
<p>The breath was from my lungs so milked away,<br/>
    When I was up, that I could go no farther,<br/>
    Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.</p>
<p>"Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,"<br/>
    My Master said; "for sitting upon down,<br/>
    Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,</p>
<p>Withouten which whoso his life consumes<br/>
    Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,<br/>
    As smoke in air or in the water foam.</p>
<p>And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish<br/>
    With spirit that o'ercometh every battle,<br/>
    If with its heavy body it sink not.</p>
<p>A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;<br/>
    'Tis not enough from these to have departed;<br/>
    Let it avail thee, if thou understand me."</p>
<p>Then I uprose, showing myself provided<br/>
    Better with breath than I did feel myself,<br/>
    And said: "Go on, for I am strong and bold."</p>
<p>Upward we took our way along the crag,<br/>
    Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,<br/>
    And more precipitous far than that before.</p>
<p>Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;<br/>
    Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,<br/>
    Not well adapted to articulate words.</p>
<p>I know not what it said, though o'er the back<br/>
    I now was of the arch that passes there;<br/>
    But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.</p>
<p>I was bent downward, but my living eyes<br/>
    Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;<br/>
    Wherefore I: "Master, see that thou arrive</p>
<p>At the next round, and let us descend the wall;<br/>
    For as from hence I hear and understand not,<br/>
    So I look down and nothing I distinguish."</p>
<p>"Other response," he said, "I make thee not,<br/>
    Except the doing; for the modest asking<br/>
    Ought to be followed by the deed in silence."</p>
<p>We from the bridge descended at its head,<br/>
    Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,<br/>
    And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;</p>
<p>And I beheld therein a terrible throng<br/>
    Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,<br/>
    That the remembrance still congeals my blood</p>
<p>Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;<br/>
    For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae<br/>
    She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,</p>
<p>Neither so many plagues nor so malignant<br/>
    E'er showed she with all Ethiopia,<br/>
    Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!</p>
<p>Among this cruel and most dismal throng<br/>
    People were running naked and affrighted.<br/>
    Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.</p>
<p>They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;<br/>
    These riveted upon their reins the tail<br/>
    And head, and were in front of them entwined.</p>
<p>And lo! at one who was upon our side<br/>
    There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him<br/>
    There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.</p>
<p>Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,<br/>
    As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly<br/>
    Behoved it that in falling he became.</p>
<p>And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,<br/>
    The ashes drew together, and of themselves<br/>
    Into himself they instantly returned.</p>
<p>Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed<br/>
    The phoenix dies, and then is born again,<br/>
    When it approaches its five-hundredth year;</p>
<p>On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,<br/>
    But only on tears of incense and amomum,<br/>
    And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.</p>
<p>And as he is who falls, and knows not how,<br/>
    By force of demons who to earth down drag him,<br/>
    Or other oppilation that binds man,</p>
<p>When he arises and around him looks,<br/>
    Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish<br/>
    Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;</p>
<p>Such was that sinner after he had risen.<br/>
    Justice of God! O how severe it is,<br/>
    That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!</p>
<p>The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;<br/>
    Whence he replied: "I rained from Tuscany<br/>
    A short time since into this cruel gorge.</p>
<p>A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,<br/>
    Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,<br/>
    Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den."</p>
<p>And I unto the Guide: "Tell him to stir not,<br/>
    And ask what crime has thrust him here below,<br/>
    For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him."</p>
<p>And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,<br/>
    But unto me directed mind and face,<br/>
    And with a melancholy shame was painted.</p>
<p>Then said: "It pains me more that thou hast caught me<br/>
    Amid this misery where thou seest me,<br/>
    Than when I from the other life was taken.</p>
<p>What thou demandest I cannot deny;<br/>
    So low am I put down because I robbed<br/>
    The sacristy of the fair ornaments,</p>
<p>And falsely once 'twas laid upon another;<br/>
    But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,<br/>
    If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,</p>
<p>Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:<br/>
    Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;<br/>
    Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;</p>
<p>Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,<br/>
    Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,<br/>
    And with impetuous and bitter tempest</p>
<p>Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;<br/>
    When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,<br/>
    So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.</p>
<p>And this I've said that it may give thee pain."</p>

<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXII</h3>
<p>Already was the Angel left behind us,<br/>
    The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us,<br/>
    Having erased one mark from off my face;</p>
<p>And those who have in justice their desire<br/>
    Had said to us, "Beati," in their voices,<br/>
    With "sitio," and without more ended it.</p>
<p>And I, more light than through the other passes,<br/>
    Went onward so, that without any labour<br/>
    I followed upward the swift-footed spirits;</p>
<p>When thus Virgilius began: "The love<br/>
    Kindled by virtue aye another kindles,<br/>
    Provided outwardly its flame appear.</p>
<p>Hence from the hour that Juvenal descended<br/>
    Among us into the infernal Limbo,<br/>
    Who made apparent to me thy affection,</p>
<p>My kindliness towards thee was as great<br/>
    As ever bound one to an unseen person,<br/>
    So that these stairs will now seem short to me.</p>
<p>But tell me, and forgive me as a friend,<br/>
    If too great confidence let loose the rein,<br/>
    And as a friend now hold discourse with me;</p>
<p>How was it possible within thy breast<br/>
    For avarice to find place, 'mid so much wisdom<br/>
    As thou wast filled with by thy diligence?"</p>
<p>These words excited Statius at first<br/>
    Somewhat to laughter; afterward he answered:<br/>
    "Each word of thine is love's dear sign to me.</p>
<p>Verily oftentimes do things appear<br/>
    Which give fallacious matter to our doubts,<br/>
    Instead of the true causes which are hidden!</p>
<p>Thy question shows me thy belief to be<br/>
    That I was niggard in the other life,<br/>
    It may be from the circle where I was;</p>
<p>Therefore know thou, that avarice was removed<br/>
    Too far from me; and this extravagance<br/>
    Thousands of lunar periods have punished.</p>
<p>And were it not that I my thoughts uplifted,<br/>
    When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest,<br/>
    As if indignant, unto human nature,</p>
<p>'To what impellest thou not, O cursed hunger<br/>
    Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?'<br/>
    Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings.</p>
<p>Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide<br/>
    Their wings in spending, and repented me<br/>
    As well of that as of my other sins;</p>
<p>How many with shorn hair shall rise again<br/>
    Because of ignorance, which from this sin<br/>
    Cuts off repentance living and in death!</p>
<p>And know that the transgression which rebuts<br/>
    By direct opposition any sin<br/>
    Together with it here its verdure dries.</p>
<p>Therefore if I have been among that folk<br/>
    Which mourns its avarice, to purify me,<br/>
    For its opposite has this befallen me."</p>
<p>"Now when thou sangest the relentless weapons<br/>
    Of the twofold affliction of Jocasta,"<br/>
    The singer of the Songs Bucolic said,</p>
<p>"From that which Clio there with thee preludes,<br/>
    It does not seem that yet had made thee faithful<br/>
    That faith without which no good works suffice.</p>
<p>If this be so, what candles or what sun<br/>
    Scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim<br/>
    Thy sails behind the Fisherman thereafter?"</p>
<p>And he to him: "Thou first directedst me<br/>
    Towards Parnassus, in its grots to drink,<br/>
    And first concerning God didst me enlighten.</p>
<p>Thou didst as he who walketh in the night,<br/>
    Who bears his light behind, which helps him not,<br/>
    But wary makes the persons after him,</p>
<p>When thou didst say: 'The age renews itself,<br/>
    Justice returns, and man's primeval time,<br/>
    And a new progeny descends from heaven.'</p>
<p>Through thee I Poet was, through thee a Christian;<br/>
    But that thou better see what I design,<br/>
    To colour it will I extend my hand.</p>
<p>Already was the world in every part<br/>
    Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated<br/>
    By messengers of the eternal kingdom;</p>
<p>And thy assertion, spoken of above,<br/>
    With the new preachers was in unison;<br/>
    Whence I to visit them the custom took.</p>
<p>Then they became so holy in my sight,<br/>
    That, when Domitian persecuted them,<br/>
    Not without tears of mine were their laments;</p>
<p>And all the while that I on earth remained,<br/>
    Them I befriended, and their upright customs<br/>
    Made me disparage all the other sects.</p>
<p>And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers<br/>
    Of Thebes, in poetry, I was baptized,<br/>
    But out of fear was covertly a Christian,</p>
<p>For a long time professing paganism;<br/>
    And this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle<br/>
    To circuit round more than four centuries.</p>
<p>Thou, therefore, who hast raised the covering<br/>
    That hid from me whatever good I speak of,<br/>
    While in ascending we have time to spare,</p>
<p>Tell me, in what place is our friend Terentius,<br/>
    Caecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou knowest;<br/>
    Tell me if they are damned, and in what alley."</p>
<p>"These, Persius and myself, and others many,"<br/>
    Replied my Leader, "with that Grecian are<br/>
    Whom more than all the rest the Muses suckled,</p>
<p>In the first circle of the prison blind;<br/>
    Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse<br/>
    Which has our nurses ever with itself.</p>
<p>Euripides is with us, Antiphon,<br/>
    Simonides, Agatho, and many other<br/>
    Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked.</p>
<p>There some of thine own people may be seen,<br/>
    Antigone, Deiphile and Argia,<br/>
    And there Ismene mournful as of old.</p>
<p>There she is seen who pointed out Langia;<br/>
    There is Tiresias' daughter, and there Thetis,<br/>
    And there Deidamia with her sisters."</p>
<p>Silent already were the poets both,<br/>
    Attent once more in looking round about,<br/>
    From the ascent and from the walls released;</p>
<p>And four handmaidens of the day already<br/>
    Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth<br/>
    Was pointing upward still its burning horn,</p>
<p>What time my Guide: "I think that tow'rds the edge<br/>
    Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn,<br/>
    Circling the mount as we are wont to do."</p>
<p>Thus in that region custom was our ensign;<br/>
    And we resumed our way with less suspicion<br/>
    For the assenting of that worthy soul</p>
<p>They in advance went on, and I alone<br/>
    Behind them, and I listened to their speech,<br/>
    Which gave me lessons in the art of song.</p>
<p>But soon their sweet discourses interrupted<br/>
    A tree which midway in the road we found,<br/>
    With apples sweet and grateful to the smell.</p>
<p>And even as a fir-tree tapers upward<br/>
    From bough to bough, so downwardly did that;<br/>
    I think in order that no one might climb it.</p>
<p>On that side where our pathway was enclosed<br/>
    Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water,<br/>
    And spread itself abroad upon the leaves.</p>
<p>The Poets twain unto the tree drew near,<br/>
    And from among the foliage a voice<br/>
    Cried: "Of this food ye shall have scarcity."</p>
<p>Then said: "More thoughtful Mary was of making<br/>
    The marriage feast complete and honourable,<br/>
    Than of her mouth which now for you responds;</p>
<p>And for their drink the ancient Roman women<br/>
    With water were content; and Daniel<br/>
    Disparaged food, and understanding won.</p>
<p>The primal age was beautiful as gold;<br/>
    Acorns it made with hunger savorous,<br/>
    And nectar every rivulet with thirst.</p>
<p>Honey and locusts were the aliments<br/>
    That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;<br/>
    Whence he is glorious, and so magnified</p>
<p>As by the Evangel is revealed to you."</p>

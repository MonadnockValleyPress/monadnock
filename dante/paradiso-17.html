<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XVII</h3>
<p>As came to Clymene, to be made certain<br/>
    Of that which he had heard against himself,<br/>
    He who makes fathers chary still to children,</p>
<p>Even such was I, and such was I perceived<br/>
    By Beatrice and by the holy light<br/>
    That first on my account had changed its place.</p>
<p>Therefore my Lady said to me: "Send forth<br/>
    The flame of thy desire, so that it issue<br/>
    Imprinted well with the internal stamp;</p>
<p>Not that our knowledge may be greater made<br/>
    By speech of thine, but to accustom thee<br/>
    To tell thy thirst, that we may give thee drink."</p>
<p>"O my beloved tree, (that so dost lift thee,<br/>
    That even as minds terrestrial perceive<br/>
    No triangle containeth two obtuse,</p>
<p>So thou beholdest the contingent things<br/>
    Ere in themselves they are, fixing thine eyes<br/>
    Upon the point in which all times are present,)</p>
<p>While I was with Virgilius conjoined<br/>
    Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal,<br/>
    And when descending into the dead world,</p>
<p>Were spoken to me of my future life<br/>
    Some grievous words; although I feel myself<br/>
    In sooth foursquare against the blows of chance.</p>
<p>On this account my wish would be content<br/>
    To hear what fortune is approaching me,<br/>
    Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly."</p>
<p>Thus did I say unto that selfsame light<br/>
    That unto me had spoken before; and even<br/>
    As Beatrice willed was my own will confessed.</p>
<p>Not in vague phrase, in which the foolish folk<br/>
    Ensnared themselves of old, ere yet was slain<br/>
    The Lamb of God who taketh sins away,</p>
<p>But with clear words and unambiguous<br/>
    Language responded that paternal love,<br/>
    Hid and revealed by its own proper smile:</p>
<p>"Contingency, that outside of the volume<br/>
    Of your materiality extends not,<br/>
    Is all depicted in the eternal aspect.</p>
<p>Necessity however thence it takes not,<br/>
    Except as from the eye, in which 'tis mirrored,<br/>
    A ship that with the current down descends.</p>
<p>From thence, e'en as there cometh to the ear<br/>
    Sweet harmony from an organ, comes in sight<br/>
    To me the time that is preparing for thee.</p>
<p>As forth from Athens went Hippolytus,<br/>
    By reason of his step-dame false and cruel,<br/>
    So thou from Florence must perforce depart.</p>
<p>Already this is willed, and this is sought for;<br/>
    And soon it shall be done by him who thinks it,<br/>
    Where every day the Christ is bought and sold.</p>
<p>The blame shall follow the offended party<br/>
    In outcry as is usual; but the vengeance<br/>
    Shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it.</p>
<p>Thou shalt abandon everything beloved<br/>
    Most tenderly, and this the arrow is<br/>
    Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth.</p>
<p>Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt<br/>
    The bread of others, and how hard a road<br/>
    The going down and up another's stairs.</p>
<p>And that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders<br/>
    Will be the bad and foolish company<br/>
    With which into this valley thou shalt fall;</p>
<p>For all ingrate, all mad and impious<br/>
    Will they become against thee; but soon after<br/>
    They, and not thou, shall have the forehead scarlet.</p>
<p>Of their bestiality their own proceedings<br/>
    Shall furnish proof; so 'twill be well for thee<br/>
    A party to have made thee by thyself.</p>
<p>Thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn<br/>
    Shall be the mighty Lombard's courtesy,<br/>
    Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird,</p>
<p>Who such benign regard shall have for thee<br/>
    That 'twixt you twain, in doing and in asking,<br/>
    That shall be first which is with others last.</p>
<p>With him shalt thou see one who at his birth<br/>
    Has by this star of strength been so impressed,<br/>
    That notable shall his achievements be.</p>
<p>Not yet the people are aware of him<br/>
    Through his young age, since only nine years yet<br/>
    Around about him have these wheels revolved.</p>
<p>But ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry,<br/>
    Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear<br/>
    In caring not for silver nor for toil.</p>
<p>So recognized shall his magnificence<br/>
    Become hereafter, that his enemies<br/>
    Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it.</p>
<p>On him rely, and on his benefits;<br/>
    By him shall many people be transformed,<br/>
    Changing condition rich and mendicant;</p>
<p>And written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear<br/>
    Of him, but shalt not say it"&mdash;and things said he<br/>
    Incredible to those who shall be present.</p>
<p>Then added: "Son, these are the commentaries<br/>
    On what was said to thee; behold the snares<br/>
    That are concealed behind few revolutions;</p>
<p>Yet would I not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy,<br/>
    Because thy life into the future reaches<br/>
    Beyond the punishment of their perfidies."</p>
<p>When by its silence showed that sainted soul<br/>
    That it had finished putting in the woof<br/>
    Into that web which I had given it warped,</p>
<p>Began I, even as he who yearneth after,<br/>
    Being in doubt, some counsel from a person<br/>
    Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves:</p>
<p>"Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on<br/>
    The time towards me such a blow to deal me<br/>
    As heaviest is to him who most gives way.</p>
<p>Therefore with foresight it is well I arm me,<br/>
    That, if the dearest place be taken from me,<br/>
    I may not lose the others by my songs.</p>
<p>Down through the world of infinite bitterness,<br/>
    And o'er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit<br/>
    The eyes of my own Lady lifted me,</p>
<p>And afterward through heaven from light to light,<br/>
    I have learned that which, if I tell again,<br/>
    Will be a savour of strong herbs to many.</p>
<p>And if I am a timid friend to truth,<br/>
    I fear lest I may lose my life with those<br/>
    Who will hereafter call this time the olden."</p>
<p>The light in which was smiling my own treasure<br/>
    Which there I had discovered, flashed at first<br/>
    As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror;</p>
<p>Then made reply: "A conscience overcast<br/>
    Or with its own or with another's shame,<br/>
    Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word;</p>
<p>But ne'ertheless, all falsehood laid aside,<br/>
    Make manifest thy vision utterly,<br/>
    And let them scratch wherever is the itch;</p>
<p>For if thine utterance shall offensive be<br/>
    At the first taste, a vital nutriment<br/>
    'Twill leave thereafter, when it is digested.</p>
<p>This cry of thine shall do as doth the wind,<br/>
    Which smiteth most the most exalted summits,<br/>
    And that is no slight argument of honour.</p>
<p>Therefore are shown to thee within these wheels,<br/>
    Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley,<br/>
    Only the souls that unto fame are known;</p>
<p>Because the spirit of the hearer rests not,<br/>
    Nor doth confirm its faith by an example<br/>
    Which has the root of it unknown and hidden,</p>
<p>Or other reason that is not apparent."</p>

<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XX</h3>
<p>When he who all the world illuminates<br/>
    Out of our hemisphere so far descends<br/>
    That on all sides the daylight is consumed,</p>
<p>The heaven, that erst by him alone was kindled,<br/>
    Doth suddenly reveal itself again<br/>
    By many lights, wherein is one resplendent.</p>
<p>And came into my mind this act of heaven,<br/>
    When the ensign of the world and of its leaders<br/>
    Had silent in the blessed beak become;</p>
<p>Because those living luminaries all,<br/>
    By far more luminous, did songs begin<br/>
    Lapsing and falling from my memory.</p>
<p>O gentle Love, that with a smile dost cloak thee,<br/>
    How ardent in those sparks didst thou appear,<br/>
    That had the breath alone of holy thoughts!</p>
<p>After the precious and pellucid crystals,<br/>
    With which begemmed the sixth light I beheld,<br/>
    Silence imposed on the angelic bells,</p>
<p>I seemed to hear the murmuring of a river<br/>
    That clear descendeth down from rock to rock,<br/>
    Showing the affluence of its mountain-top.</p>
<p>And as the sound upon the cithern's neck<br/>
    Taketh its form, and as upon the vent<br/>
    Of rustic pipe the wind that enters it,</p>
<p>Even thus, relieved from the delay of waiting,<br/>
    That murmuring of the eagle mounted up<br/>
    Along its neck, as if it had been hollow.</p>
<p>There it became a voice, and issued thence<br/>
    From out its beak, in such a form of words<br/>
    As the heart waited for wherein I wrote them.</p>
<p>"The part in me which sees and bears the sun<br/>
    In mortal eagles," it began to me,<br/>
    "Now fixedly must needs be looked upon;</p>
<p>For of the fires of which I make my figure,<br/>
    Those whence the eye doth sparkle in my head<br/>
    Of all their orders the supremest are.</p>
<p>He who is shining in the midst as pupil<br/>
    Was once the singer of the Holy Spirit,<br/>
    Who bore the ark from city unto city;</p>
<p>Now knoweth he the merit of his song,<br/>
    In so far as effect of his own counsel,<br/>
    By the reward which is commensurate.</p>
<p>Of five, that make a circle for my brow,<br/>
    He that approacheth nearest to my beak<br/>
    Did the poor widow for her son console;</p>
<p>Now knoweth he how dearly it doth cost<br/>
    Not following Christ, by the experience<br/>
    Of this sweet life and of its opposite.</p>
<p>He who comes next in the circumference<br/>
    Of which I speak, upon its highest arc,<br/>
    Did death postpone by penitence sincere;</p>
<p>Now knoweth he that the eternal judgment<br/>
    Suffers no change, albeit worthy prayer<br/>
    Maketh below to-morrow of to-day.</p>
<p>The next who follows, with the laws and me,<br/>
    Under the good intent that bore bad fruit<br/>
    Became a Greek by ceding to the pastor;</p>
<p>Now knoweth he how all the ill deduced<br/>
    From his good action is not harmful to him,<br/>
    Although the world thereby may be destroyed.</p>
<p>And he, whom in the downward arc thou seest,<br/>
    Guglielmo was, whom the same land deplores<br/>
    That weepeth Charles and Frederick yet alive;</p>
<p>Now knoweth he how heaven enamoured is<br/>
    With a just king; and in the outward show<br/>
    Of his effulgence he reveals it still.</p>
<p>Who would believe, down in the errant world,<br/>
    That e'er the Trojan Ripheus in this round<br/>
    Could be the fifth one of the holy lights?</p>
<p>Now knoweth he enough of what the world<br/>
    Has not the power to see of grace divine,<br/>
    Although his sight may not discern the bottom."</p>
<p>Like as a lark that in the air expatiates,<br/>
    First singing and then silent with content<br/>
    Of the last sweetness that doth satisfy her,</p>
<p>Such seemed to me the image of the imprint<br/>
    Of the eternal pleasure, by whose will<br/>
    Doth everything become the thing it is.</p>
<p>And notwithstanding to my doubt I was<br/>
    As glass is to the colour that invests it,<br/>
    To wait the time in silence it endured not,</p>
<p>But forth from out my mouth, "What things are these?"<br/>
    Extorted with the force of its own weight;<br/>
    Whereat I saw great joy of coruscation.</p>
<p>Thereafterward with eye still more enkindled<br/>
    The blessed standard made to me reply,<br/>
    To keep me not in wonderment suspended:</p>
<p>"I see that thou believest in these things<br/>
    Because I say them, but thou seest not how;<br/>
    So that, although believed in, they are hidden.</p>
<p>Thou doest as he doth who a thing by name<br/>
    Well apprehendeth, but its quiddity<br/>
    Cannot perceive, unless another show it.</p>
<p>'Regnum coelorum' suffereth violence<br/>
    From fervent love, and from that living hope<br/>
    That overcometh the Divine volition;</p>
<p>Not in the guise that man o'ercometh man,<br/>
    But conquers it because it will be conquered,<br/>
    And conquered conquers by benignity.</p>
<p>The first life of the eyebrow and the fifth<br/>
    Cause thee astonishment, because with them<br/>
    Thou seest the region of the angels painted.</p>
<p>They passed not from their bodies, as thou thinkest,<br/>
    Gentiles, but Christians in the steadfast faith<br/>
    Of feet that were to suffer and had suffered.</p>
<p>For one from Hell, where no one e'er turns back<br/>
    Unto good will, returned unto his bones,<br/>
    And that of living hope was the reward,&mdash;</p>
<p>Of living hope, that placed its efficacy<br/>
    In prayers to God made to resuscitate him,<br/>
    So that 'twere possible to move his will.</p>
<p>The glorious soul concerning which I speak,<br/>
    Returning to the flesh, where brief its stay,<br/>
    Believed in Him who had the power to aid it;</p>
<p>And, in believing, kindled to such fire<br/>
    Of genuine love, that at the second death<br/>
    Worthy it was to come unto this joy.</p>
<p>The other one, through grace, that from so deep<br/>
    A fountain wells that never hath the eye<br/>
    Of any creature reached its primal wave,</p>
<p>Set all his love below on righteousness;<br/>
    Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose<br/>
    His eye to our redemption yet to be,</p>
<p>Whence he believed therein, and suffered not<br/>
    From that day forth the stench of paganism,<br/>
    And he reproved therefor the folk perverse.</p>
<p>Those Maidens three, whom at the right-hand wheel<br/>
    Thou didst behold, were unto him for baptism<br/>
    More than a thousand years before baptizing.</p>
<p>O thou predestination, how remote<br/>
    Thy root is from the aspect of all those<br/>
    Who the First Cause do not behold entire!</p>
<p>And you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained<br/>
    In judging; for ourselves, who look on God,<br/>
    We do not know as yet all the elect;</p>
<p>And sweet to us is such a deprivation,<br/>
    Because our good in this good is made perfect,<br/>
    That whatsoe'er God wills, we also will."</p>
<p>After this manner by that shape divine,<br/>
    To make clear in me my short-sightedness,<br/>
    Was given to me a pleasant medicine;</p>
<p>And as good singer a good lutanist<br/>
    Accompanies with vibrations of the chords,<br/>
    Whereby more pleasantness the song acquires,</p>
<p>So, while it spake, do I remember me<br/>
    That I beheld both of those blessed lights,<br/>
    Even as the winking of the eyes concords,</p>
<p>Moving unto the words their little flames.</p>

<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto III</h3>
<p>Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight<br/>
    Had scattered them asunder o'er the plain,<br/>
    Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,</p>
<p>I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,<br/>
    And how without him had I kept my course?<br/>
    Who would have led me up along the mountain?</p>
<p>He seemed to me within himself remorseful;<br/>
    O noble conscience, and without a stain,<br/>
    How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!</p>
<p>After his feet had laid aside the haste<br/>
    Which mars the dignity of every act,<br/>
    My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,</p>
<p>Let loose its faculties as if delighted,<br/>
    And I my sight directed to the hill<br/>
    That highest tow'rds the heaven uplifts itself.</p>
<p>The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,<br/>
    Was broken in front of me into the figure<br/>
    Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;</p>
<p>Unto one side I turned me, with the fear<br/>
    Of being left alone, when I beheld<br/>
    Only in front of me the ground obscured.</p>
<p>"Why dost thou still mistrust?" my Comforter<br/>
    Began to say to me turned wholly round;<br/>
    "Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?</p>
<p>'Tis evening there already where is buried<br/>
    The body within which I cast a shadow;<br/>
    'Tis from Brundusium ta'en, and Naples has it.</p>
<p>Now if in front of me no shadow fall,<br/>
    Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,<br/>
    Because one ray impedeth not another</p>
<p>To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,<br/>
    Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills<br/>
    That how it works be not unveiled to us.</p>
<p>Insane is he who hopeth that our reason<br/>
    Can traverse the illimitable way,<br/>
    Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!</p>
<p>Mortals, remain contented at the 'Quia;'<br/>
    For if ye had been able to see all,<br/>
    No need there were for Mary to give birth;</p>
<p>And ye have seen desiring without fruit,<br/>
    Those whose desire would have been quieted,<br/>
    Which evermore is given them for a grief.</p>
<p>I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,<br/>
    And many others;"&mdash;and here bowed his head,<br/>
    And more he said not, and remained disturbed.</p>
<p>We came meanwhile unto the mountain's foot;<br/>
    There so precipitate we found the rock,<br/>
    That nimble legs would there have been in vain.</p>
<p>'Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,<br/>
    The most secluded pathway is a stair<br/>
    Easy and open, if compared with that.</p>
<p>"Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill<br/>
    Slopes down," my Master said, his footsteps staying,<br/>
    "So that who goeth without wings may mount?"</p>
<p>And while he held his eyes upon the ground<br/>
    Examining the nature of the path,<br/>
    And I was looking up around the rock,</p>
<p>On the left hand appeared to me a throng<br/>
    Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,<br/>
    And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.</p>
<p>"Lift up thine eyes," I to the Master said;<br/>
    "Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,<br/>
    If thou of thine own self can have it not."</p>
<p>Then he looked at me, and with frank expression<br/>
    Replied: "Let us go there, for they come slowly,<br/>
    And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son."</p>
<p>Still was that people as far off from us,<br/>
    After a thousand steps of ours I say,<br/>
    As a good thrower with his hand would reach,</p>
<p>When they all crowded unto the hard masses<br/>
    Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,<br/>
    As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.</p>
<p>"O happy dead! O spirits elect already!"<br/>
    Virgilius made beginning, "by that peace<br/>
    Which I believe is waiting for you all,</p>
<p>Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,<br/>
    So that the going up be possible,<br/>
    For to lose time irks him most who most knows."</p>
<p>As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold<br/>
    By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand<br/>
    Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,</p>
<p>And what the foremost does the others do,<br/>
    Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,<br/>
    Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;</p>
<p>So moving to approach us thereupon<br/>
    I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,<br/>
    Modest in face and dignified in gait.</p>
<p>As soon as those in the advance saw broken<br/>
    The light upon the ground at my right side,<br/>
    So that from me the shadow reached the rock,</p>
<p>They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;<br/>
    And all the others, who came after them,<br/>
    Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.</p>
<p>"Without your asking, I confess to you<br/>
    This is a human body which you see,<br/>
    Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.</p>
<p>Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded<br/>
    That not without a power which comes from Heaven<br/>
    Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall."</p>
<p>The Master thus; and said those worthy people:<br/>
    "Return ye then, and enter in before us,"<br/>
    Making a signal with the back o' the hand</p>
<p>And one of them began: "Whoe'er thou art,<br/>
    Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well<br/>
    If e'er thou saw me in the other world."</p>
<p>I turned me tow'rds him, and looked at him closely;<br/>
    Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,<br/>
    But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.</p>
<p>When with humility I had disclaimed<br/>
    E'er having seen him, "Now behold!" he said,<br/>
    And showed me high upon his breast a wound.</p>
<p>Then said he with a smile: "I am Manfredi,<br/>
    The grandson of the Empress Costanza;<br/>
    Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee</p>
<p>Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother<br/>
    Of Sicily's honour and of Aragon's,<br/>
    And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.</p>
<p>After I had my body lacerated<br/>
    By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself<br/>
    Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.</p>
<p>Horrible my iniquities had been;<br/>
    But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,<br/>
    That it receives whatever turns to it.</p>
<p>Had but Cosenza's pastor, who in chase<br/>
    Of me was sent by Clement at that time,<br/>
    In God read understandingly this page,</p>
<p>The bones of my dead body still would be<br/>
    At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,<br/>
    Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.</p>
<p>Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,<br/>
    Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,<br/>
    Where he transported them with tapers quenched.</p>
<p>By malison of theirs is not so lost<br/>
    Eternal Love, that it cannot return,<br/>
    So long as hope has anything of green.</p>
<p>True is it, who in contumacy dies<br/>
    Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,<br/>
    Must wait upon the outside this bank</p>
<p>Thirty times told the time that he has been<br/>
    In his presumption, unless such decree<br/>
    Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.</p>
<p>See now if thou hast power to make me happy,<br/>
    By making known unto my good Costanza<br/>
    How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,</p>
<p>For those on earth can much advance us here."</p>

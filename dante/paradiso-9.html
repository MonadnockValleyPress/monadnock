<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto IX</h3>
<p>Beautiful Clemence, after that thy Charles<br/>
    Had me enlightened, he narrated to me<br/>
    The treacheries his seed should undergo;</p>
<p>But said: "Be still and let the years roll round;"<br/>
    So I can only say, that lamentation<br/>
    Legitimate shall follow on your wrongs.</p>
<p>And of that holy light the life already<br/>
    Had to the Sun which fills it turned again,<br/>
    As to that good which for each thing sufficeth.</p>
<p>Ah, souls deceived, and creatures impious,<br/>
    Who from such good do turn away your hearts,<br/>
    Directing upon vanity your foreheads!</p>
<p>And now, behold, another of those splendours<br/>
    Approached me, and its will to pleasure me<br/>
    It signified by brightening outwardly.</p>
<p>The eyes of Beatrice, that fastened were<br/>
    Upon me, as before, of dear assent<br/>
    To my desire assurance gave to me.</p>
<p>"Ah, bring swift compensation to my wish,<br/>
    Thou blessed spirit," I said, "and give me proof<br/>
    That what I think in thee I can reflect!"</p>
<p>Whereat the light, that still was new to me,<br/>
    Out of its depths, whence it before was singing,<br/>
    As one delighted to do good, continued:</p>
<p>"Within that region of the land depraved<br/>
    Of Italy, that lies between Rialto<br/>
    And fountain-heads of Brenta and of Piava,</p>
<p>Rises a hill, and mounts not very high,<br/>
    Wherefrom descended formerly a torch<br/>
    That made upon that region great assault.</p>
<p>Out of one root were born both I and it;<br/>
    Cunizza was I called, and here I shine<br/>
    Because the splendour of this star o'ercame me.</p>
<p>But gladly to myself the cause I pardon<br/>
    Of my allotment, and it does not grieve me;<br/>
    Which would perhaps seem strong unto your vulgar.</p>
<p>Of this so luculent and precious jewel,<br/>
    Which of our heaven is nearest unto me,<br/>
    Great fame remained; and ere it die away</p>
<p>This hundredth year shall yet quintupled be.<br/>
    See if man ought to make him excellent,<br/>
    So that another life the first may leave!</p>
<p>And thus thinks not the present multitude<br/>
    Shut in by Adige and Tagliamento,<br/>
    Nor yet for being scourged is penitent.</p>
<p>But soon 'twill be that Padua in the marsh<br/>
    Will change the water that Vicenza bathes,<br/>
    Because the folk are stubborn against duty;</p>
<p>And where the Sile and Cagnano join<br/>
    One lordeth it, and goes with lofty head,<br/>
    For catching whom e'en now the net is making.</p>
<p>Feltro moreover of her impious pastor<br/>
    Shall weep the crime, which shall so monstrous be<br/>
    That for the like none ever entered Malta.</p>
<p>Ample exceedingly would be the vat<br/>
    That of the Ferrarese could hold the blood,<br/>
    And weary who should weigh it ounce by ounce,</p>
<p>Of which this courteous priest shall make a gift<br/>
    To show himself a partisan; and such gifts<br/>
    Will to the living of the land conform.</p>
<p>Above us there are mirrors, Thrones you call them,<br/>
    From which shines out on us God Judicant,<br/>
    So that this utterance seems good to us."</p>
<p>Here it was silent, and it had the semblance<br/>
    Of being turned elsewhither, by the wheel<br/>
    On which it entered as it was before.</p>
<p>The other joy, already known to me,<br/>
    Became a thing transplendent in my sight,<br/>
    As a fine ruby smitten by the sun.</p>
<p>Through joy effulgence is acquired above,<br/>
    As here a smile; but down below, the shade<br/>
    Outwardly darkens, as the mind is sad.</p>
<p>"God seeth all things, and in Him, blest spirit,<br/>
    Thy sight is," said I, "so that never will<br/>
    Of his can possibly from thee be hidden;</p>
<p>Thy voice, then, that for ever makes the heavens<br/>
    Glad, with the singing of those holy fires<br/>
    Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl,</p>
<p>Wherefore does it not satisfy my longings?<br/>
    Indeed, I would not wait thy questioning<br/>
    If I in thee were as thou art in me."</p>
<p>"The greatest of the valleys where the water<br/>
    Expands itself," forthwith its words began,<br/>
    "That sea excepted which the earth engarlands,</p>
<p>Between discordant shores against the sun<br/>
    Extends so far, that it meridian makes<br/>
    Where it was wont before to make the horizon.</p>
<p>I was a dweller on that valley's shore<br/>
    'Twixt Ebro and Magra that with journey short<br/>
    Doth from the Tuscan part the Genoese.</p>
<p>With the same sunset and same sunrise nearly<br/>
    Sit Buggia and the city whence I was,<br/>
    That with its blood once made the harbour hot.</p>
<p>Folco that people called me unto whom<br/>
    My name was known; and now with me this heaven<br/>
    Imprints itself, as I did once with it;</p>
<p>For more the daughter of Belus never burned,<br/>
    Offending both Sichaeus and Creusa,<br/>
    Than I, so long as it became my locks,</p>
<p>Nor yet that Rodophean, who deluded<br/>
    was by Demophoon, nor yet Alcides,<br/>
    When Iole he in his heart had locked.</p>
<p>Yet here is no repenting, but we smile,<br/>
    Not at the fault, which comes not back to mind,<br/>
    But at the power which ordered and foresaw.</p>
<p>Here we behold the art that doth adorn<br/>
    With such affection, and the good discover<br/>
    Whereby the world above turns that below.</p>
<p>But that thou wholly satisfied mayst bear<br/>
    Thy wishes hence which in this sphere are born,<br/>
    Still farther to proceed behoveth me.</p>
<p>Thou fain wouldst know who is within this light<br/>
    That here beside me thus is scintillating,<br/>
    Even as a sunbeam in the limpid water.</p>
<p>Then know thou, that within there is at rest<br/>
    Rahab, and being to our order joined,<br/>
    With her in its supremest grade 'tis sealed.</p>
<p>Into this heaven, where ends the shadowy cone<br/>
    Cast by your world, before all other souls<br/>
    First of Christ's triumph was she taken up.</p>
<p>Full meet it was to leave her in some heaven,<br/>
    Even as a palm of the high victory<br/>
    Which he acquired with one palm and the other,</p>
<p>Because she favoured the first glorious deed<br/>
    Of Joshua upon the Holy Land,<br/>
    That little stirs the memory of the Pope.</p>
<p>Thy city, which an offshoot is of him<br/>
    Who first upon his Maker turned his back,<br/>
    And whose ambition is so sorely wept,</p>
<p>Brings forth and scatters the accursed flower<br/>
    Which both the sheep and lambs hath led astray<br/>
    Since it has turned the shepherd to a wolf.</p>
<p>For this the Evangel and the mighty Doctors<br/>
    Are derelict, and only the Decretals<br/>
    So studied that it shows upon their margins.</p>
<p>On this are Pope and Cardinals intent;<br/>
    Their meditations reach not Nazareth,<br/>
    There where his pinions Gabriel unfolded;</p>
<p>But Vatican and the other parts elect<br/>
    Of Rome, which have a cemetery been<br/>
    Unto the soldiery that followed Peter</p>
<p>Shall soon be free from this adultery."</p>

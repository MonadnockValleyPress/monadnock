<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XI</h3>
<p>"Our Father, thou who dwellest in the heavens,<br/>
    Not circumscribed, but from the greater love<br/>
    Thou bearest to the first effects on high,</p>
<p>Praised be thy name and thine omnipotence<br/>
    By every creature, as befitting is<br/>
    To render thanks to thy sweet effluence.</p>
<p>Come unto us the peace of thy dominion,<br/>
    For unto it we cannot of ourselves,<br/>
    If it come not, with all our intellect.</p>
<p>Even as thine own Angels of their will<br/>
    Make sacrifice to thee, Hosanna singing,<br/>
    So may all men make sacrifice of theirs.</p>
<p>Give unto us this day our daily manna,<br/>
    Withouten which in this rough wilderness<br/>
    Backward goes he who toils most to advance.</p>
<p>And even as we the trespass we have suffered<br/>
    Pardon in one another, pardon thou<br/>
    Benignly, and regard not our desert.</p>
<p>Our virtue, which is easily o'ercome,<br/>
    Put not to proof with the old Adversary,<br/>
    But thou from him who spurs it so, deliver.</p>
<p>This last petition verily, dear Lord,<br/>
    Not for ourselves is made, who need it not,<br/>
    But for their sake who have remained behind us."</p>
<p>Thus for themselves and us good furtherance<br/>
    Those shades imploring, went beneath a weight<br/>
    Like unto that of which we sometimes dream,</p>
<p>Unequally in anguish round and round<br/>
    And weary all, upon that foremost cornice,<br/>
    Purging away the smoke-stains of the world.</p>
<p>If there good words are always said for us,<br/>
    What may not here be said and done for them,<br/>
    By those who have a good root to their will?</p>
<p>Well may we help them wash away the marks<br/>
    That hence they carried, so that clean and light<br/>
    They may ascend unto the starry wheels!</p>
<p>"Ah! so may pity and justice you disburden<br/>
    Soon, that ye may have power to move the wing,<br/>
    That shall uplift you after your desire,</p>
<p>Show us on which hand tow'rd the stairs the way<br/>
    Is shortest, and if more than one the passes,<br/>
    Point us out that which least abruptly falls;</p>
<p>For he who cometh with me, through the burden<br/>
    Of Adam's flesh wherewith he is invested,<br/>
    Against his will is chary of his climbing."</p>
<p>The words of theirs which they returned to those<br/>
    That he whom I was following had spoken,<br/>
    It was not manifest from whom they came,</p>
<p>But it was said: "To the right hand come with us<br/>
    Along the bank, and ye shall find a pass<br/>
    Possible for living person to ascend.</p>
<p>And were I not impeded by the stone,<br/>
    Which this proud neck of mine doth subjugate,<br/>
    Whence I am forced to hold my visage down,</p>
<p>Him, who still lives and does not name himself,<br/>
    Would I regard, to see if I may know him<br/>
    And make him piteous unto this burden.</p>
<p>A Latian was I, and born of a great Tuscan;<br/>
    Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father;<br/>
    I know not if his name were ever with you.</p>
<p>The ancient blood and deeds of gallantry<br/>
    Of my progenitors so arrogant made me<br/>
    That, thinking not upon the common mother,</p>
<p>All men I held in scorn to such extent<br/>
    I died therefor, as know the Sienese,<br/>
    And every child in Campagnatico.</p>
<p>I am Omberto; and not to me alone<br/>
    Has pride done harm, but all my kith and kin<br/>
    Has with it dragged into adversity.</p>
<p>And here must I this burden bear for it<br/>
    Till God be satisfied, since I did not<br/>
    Among the living, here among the dead."</p>
<p>Listening I downward bent my countenance;<br/>
    And one of them, not this one who was speaking,<br/>
    Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him,</p>
<p>And looked at me, and knew me, and called out,<br/>
    Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed<br/>
    On me, who all bowed down was going with them.</p>
<p>"O," asked I him, "art thou not Oderisi,<br/>
    Agobbio's honour, and honour of that art<br/>
    Which is in Paris called illuminating?"</p>
<p>"Brother," said he, "more laughing are the leaves<br/>
    Touched by the brush of Franco Bolognese;<br/>
    All his the honour now, and mine in part.</p>
<p>In sooth I had not been so courteous<br/>
    While I was living, for the great desire<br/>
    Of excellence, on which my heart was bent.</p>
<p>Here of such pride is paid the forfeiture;<br/>
    And yet I should not be here, were it not<br/>
    That, having power to sin, I turned to God.</p>
<p>O thou vain glory of the human powers,<br/>
    How little green upon thy summit lingers,<br/>
    If't be not followed by an age of grossness!</p>
<p>In painting Cimabue thought that he<br/>
    Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry,<br/>
    So that the other's fame is growing dim.</p>
<p>So has one Guido from the other taken<br/>
    The glory of our tongue, and he perchance<br/>
    Is born, who from the nest shall chase them both.</p>
<p>Naught is this mundane rumour but a breath<br/>
    Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,<br/>
    And changes name, because it changes side.</p>
<p>What fame shalt thou have more, if old peel off<br/>
    From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead<br/>
    Before thou left the 'pappo' and the 'dindi,'</p>
<p>Ere pass a thousand years? which is a shorter<br/>
    Space to the eterne, than twinkling of an eye<br/>
    Unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest.</p>
<p>With him, who takes so little of the road<br/>
    In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;<br/>
    And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,</p>
<p>Where he was lord, what time was overthrown<br/>
    The Florentine delirium, that superb<br/>
    Was at that day as now 'tis prostitute.</p>
<p>Your reputation is the colour of grass<br/>
    Which comes and goes, and that discolours it<br/>
    By which it issues green from out the earth."</p>
<p>And I: "Thy true speech fills my heart with good<br/>
    Humility, and great tumour thou assuagest;<br/>
    But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?"</p>
<p>"That," he replied, "is Provenzan Salvani,<br/>
    And he is here because he had presumed<br/>
    To bring Siena all into his hands.</p>
<p>He has gone thus, and goeth without rest<br/>
    E'er since he died; such money renders back<br/>
    In payment he who is on earth too daring."</p>
<p>And I: "If every spirit who awaits<br/>
    The verge of life before that he repent,<br/>
    Remains below there and ascends not hither,</p>
<p>(Unless good orison shall him bestead,)<br/>
    Until as much time as he lived be passed,<br/>
    How was the coming granted him in largess?"</p>
<p>"When he in greatest splendour lived," said he,<br/>
    "Freely upon the Campo of Siena,<br/>
    All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;</p>
<p>And there to draw his friend from the duress<br/>
    Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,<br/>
    He brought himself to tremble in each vein.</p>
<p>I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;<br/>
    Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours<br/>
    Will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it.</p>
<p>This action has released him from those confines."</p>

<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XIII</h3>
<p>Let him imagine, who would well conceive<br/>
    What now I saw, and let him while I speak<br/>
    Retain the image as a steadfast rock,</p>
<p>The fifteen stars, that in their divers regions<br/>
    The sky enliven with a light so great<br/>
    That it transcends all clusters of the air;</p>
<p>Let him the Wain imagine unto which<br/>
    Our vault of heaven sufficeth night and day,<br/>
    So that in turning of its pole it fails not;</p>
<p>Let him the mouth imagine of the horn<br/>
    That in the point beginneth of the axis<br/>
    Round about which the primal wheel revolves,&mdash;</p>
<p>To have fashioned of themselves two signs in heaven,<br/>
    Like unto that which Minos' daughter made,<br/>
    The moment when she felt the frost of death;</p>
<p>And one to have its rays within the other,<br/>
    And both to whirl themselves in such a manner<br/>
    That one should forward go, the other backward;</p>
<p>And he will have some shadowing forth of that<br/>
    True constellation and the double dance<br/>
    That circled round the point at which I was;</p>
<p>Because it is as much beyond our wont,<br/>
    As swifter than the motion of the Chiana<br/>
    Moveth the heaven that all the rest outspeeds.</p>
<p>There sang they neither Bacchus, nor Apollo,<br/>
    But in the divine nature Persons three,<br/>
    And in one person the divine and human.</p>
<p>The singing and the dance fulfilled their measure,<br/>
    And unto us those holy lights gave need,<br/>
    Growing in happiness from care to care.</p>
<p>Then broke the silence of those saints concordant<br/>
    The light in which the admirable life<br/>
    Of God's own mendicant was told to me,</p>
<p>And said: "Now that one straw is trodden out<br/>
    Now that its seed is garnered up already,<br/>
    Sweet love invites me to thresh out the other.</p>
<p>Into that bosom, thou believest, whence<br/>
    Was drawn the rib to form the beauteous cheek<br/>
    Whose taste to all the world is costing dear,</p>
<p>And into that which, by the lance transfixed,<br/>
    Before and since, such satisfaction made<br/>
    That it weighs down the balance of all sin,</p>
<p>Whate'er of light it has to human nature<br/>
    Been lawful to possess was all infused<br/>
    By the same power that both of them created;</p>
<p>And hence at what I said above dost wonder,<br/>
    When I narrated that no second had<br/>
    The good which in the fifth light is enclosed.</p>
<p>Now ope thine eyes to what I answer thee,<br/>
    And thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse<br/>
    Fit in the truth as centre in a circle.</p>
<p>That which can die, and that which dieth not,<br/>
    Are nothing but the splendour of the idea<br/>
    Which by his love our Lord brings into being;</p>
<p>Because that living Light, which from its fount<br/>
    Effulgent flows, so that it disunites not<br/>
    From Him nor from the Love in them intrined,</p>
<p>Through its own goodness reunites its rays<br/>
    In nine subsistences, as in a mirror,<br/>
    Itself eternally remaining One.</p>
<p>Thence it descends to the last potencies,<br/>
    Downward from act to act becoming such<br/>
    That only brief contingencies it makes;</p>
<p>And these contingencies I hold to be<br/>
    Things generated, which the heaven produces<br/>
    By its own motion, with seed and without.</p>
<p>Neither their wax, nor that which tempers it,<br/>
    Remains immutable, and hence beneath<br/>
    The ideal signet more and less shines through;</p>
<p>Therefore it happens, that the selfsame tree<br/>
    After its kind bears worse and better fruit,<br/>
    And ye are born with characters diverse.</p>
<p>If in perfection tempered were the wax,<br/>
    And were the heaven in its supremest virtue,<br/>
    The brilliance of the seal would all appear;</p>
<p>But nature gives it evermore deficient,<br/>
    In the like manner working as the artist,<br/>
    Who has the skill of art and hand that trembles.</p>
<p>If then the fervent Love, the Vision clear,<br/>
    Of primal Virtue do dispose and seal,<br/>
    Perfection absolute is there acquired.</p>
<p>Thus was of old the earth created worthy<br/>
    Of all and every animal perfection;<br/>
    And thus the Virgin was impregnate made;</p>
<p>So that thine own opinion I commend,<br/>
    That human nature never yet has been,<br/>
    Nor will be, what it was in those two persons.</p>
<p>Now if no farther forth I should proceed,<br/>
    'Then in what way was he without a peer?'<br/>
    Would be the first beginning of thy words.</p>
<p>But, that may well appear what now appears not,<br/>
    Think who he was, and what occasion moved him<br/>
    To make request, when it was told him, 'Ask.'</p>
<p>I've not so spoken that thou canst not see<br/>
    Clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom,<br/>
    That he might be sufficiently a king;</p>
<p>'Twas not to know the number in which are<br/>
    The motors here above, or if 'necesse'<br/>
    With a contingent e'er 'necesse' make,</p>
<p>'Non si est dare primum motum esse,'<br/>
    Or if in semicircle can be made<br/>
    Triangle so that it have no right angle.</p>
<p>Whence, if thou notest this and what I said,<br/>
    A regal prudence is that peerless seeing<br/>
    In which the shaft of my intention strikes.</p>
<p>And if on 'rose' thou turnest thy clear eyes,<br/>
    Thou'lt see that it has reference alone<br/>
    To kings who're many, and the good are rare.</p>
<p>With this distinction take thou what I said,<br/>
    And thus it can consist with thy belief<br/>
    Of the first father and of our Delight.</p>
<p>And lead shall this be always to thy feet,<br/>
    To make thee, like a weary man, move slowly<br/>
    Both to the Yes and No thou seest not;</p>
<p>For very low among the fools is he<br/>
    Who affirms without distinction, or denies,<br/>
    As well in one as in the other case;</p>
<p>Because it happens that full often bends<br/>
    Current opinion in the false direction,<br/>
    And then the feelings bind the intellect.</p>
<p>Far more than uselessly he leaves the shore,<br/>
    (Since he returneth not the same he went,)<br/>
    Who fishes for the truth, and has no skill;</p>
<p>And in the world proofs manifest thereof<br/>
    Parmenides, Melissus, Brissus are,<br/>
    And many who went on and knew not whither;</p>
<p>Thus did Sabellius, Arius, and those fools<br/>
    Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures<br/>
    In rendering distorted their straight faces.</p>
<p>Nor yet shall people be too confident<br/>
    In judging, even as he is who doth count<br/>
    The corn in field or ever it be ripe.</p>
<p>For I have seen all winter long the thorn<br/>
    First show itself intractable and fierce,<br/>
    And after bear the rose upon its top;</p>
<p>And I have seen a ship direct and swift<br/>
    Run o'er the sea throughout its course entire,<br/>
    To perish at the harbour's mouth at last.</p>
<p>Let not Dame Bertha nor Ser Martin think,<br/>
    Seeing one steal, another offering make,<br/>
    To see them in the arbitrament divine;</p>
<p>For one may rise, and fall the other may."</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XIV</h3>
<p>Because the charity of my native place<br/>
    Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,<br/>
    And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.</p>
<p>Then came we to the confine, where disparted<br/>
    The second round is from the third, and where<br/>
    A horrible form of Justice is beheld.</p>
<p>Clearly to manifest these novel things,<br/>
    I say that we arrived upon a plain,<br/>
    Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;</p>
<p>The dolorous forest is a garland to it<br/>
    All round about, as the sad moat to that;<br/>
    There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.</p>
<p>The soil was of an arid and thick sand,<br/>
    Not of another fashion made than that<br/>
    Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.</p>
<p>Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou<br/>
    By each one to be dreaded, who doth read<br/>
    That which was manifest unto mine eyes!</p>
<p>Of naked souls beheld I many herds,<br/>
    Who all were weeping very miserably,<br/>
    And over them seemed set a law diverse.</p>
<p>Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;<br/>
    And some were sitting all drawn up together,<br/>
    And others went about continually.</p>
<p>Those who were going round were far the more,<br/>
    And those were less who lay down to their torment,<br/>
    But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.</p>
<p>O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,<br/>
    Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,<br/>
    As of the snow on Alp without a wind.</p>
<p>As Alexander, in those torrid parts<br/>
    Of India, beheld upon his host<br/>
    Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.</p>
<p>Whence he provided with his phalanxes<br/>
    To trample down the soil, because the vapour<br/>
    Better extinguished was while it was single;</p>
<p>Thus was descending the eternal heat,<br/>
    Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder<br/>
    Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.</p>
<p>Without repose forever was the dance<br/>
    Of miserable hands, now there, now here,<br/>
    Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.</p>
<p>"Master," began I, "thou who overcomest<br/>
    All things except the demons dire, that issued<br/>
    Against us at the entrance of the gate,</p>
<p>Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not<br/>
    The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,<br/>
    So that the rain seems not to ripen him?"</p>
<p>And he himself, who had become aware<br/>
    That I was questioning my Guide about him,<br/>
    Cried: "Such as I was living, am I, dead.</p>
<p>If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom<br/>
    He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,<br/>
    Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,</p>
<p>And if he wearied out by turns the others<br/>
    In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,<br/>
    Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'</p>
<p>Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,<br/>
    And shot his bolts at me with all his might,<br/>
    He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance."</p>
<p>Then did my Leader speak with such great force,<br/>
    That I had never heard him speak so loud:<br/>
    "O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished</p>
<p>Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;<br/>
    Not any torment, saving thine own rage,<br/>
    Would be unto thy fury pain complete."</p>
<p>Then he turned round to me with better lip,<br/>
    Saying: "One of the Seven Kings was he<br/>
    Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold</p>
<p>God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;<br/>
    But, as I said to him, his own despites<br/>
    Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.</p>
<p>Now follow me, and mind thou do not place<br/>
    As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,<br/>
    But always keep them close unto the wood."</p>
<p>Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes<br/>
    Forth from the wood a little rivulet,<br/>
    Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.</p>
<p>As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,<br/>
    The sinful women later share among them,<br/>
    So downward through the sand it went its way.</p>
<p>The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,<br/>
    Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;<br/>
    Whence I perceived that there the passage was.</p>
<p>"In all the rest which I have shown to thee<br/>
    Since we have entered in within the gate<br/>
    Whose threshold unto no one is denied,</p>
<p>Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes<br/>
    So notable as is the present river,<br/>
    Which all the little flames above it quenches."</p>
<p>These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him<br/>
    That he would give me largess of the food,<br/>
    For which he had given me largess of desire.</p>
<p>"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,"<br/>
    Said he thereafterward, "whose name is Crete,<br/>
    Under whose king the world of old was chaste.</p>
<p>There is a mountain there, that once was glad<br/>
    With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;<br/>
    Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.</p>
<p>Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle<br/>
    Of her own son; and to conceal him better,<br/>
    Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.</p>
<p>A grand old man stands in the mount erect,<br/>
    Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,<br/>
    And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.</p>
<p>His head is fashioned of refined gold,<br/>
    And of pure silver are the arms and breast;<br/>
    Then he is brass as far down as the fork.</p>
<p>From that point downward all is chosen iron,<br/>
    Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,<br/>
    And more he stands on that than on the other.</p>
<p>Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure<br/>
    Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,<br/>
    Which gathered together perforate that cavern.</p>
<p>From rock to rock they fall into this valley;<br/>
    Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;<br/>
    Then downward go along this narrow sluice</p>
<p>Unto that point where is no more descending.<br/>
    They form Cocytus; what that pool may be<br/>
    Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated."</p>
<p>And I to him: "If so the present runnel<br/>
    Doth take its rise in this way from our world,<br/>
    Why only on this verge appears it to us?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "Thou knowest the place is round,<br/>
    And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,<br/>
    Still to the left descending to the bottom,</p>
<p>Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.<br/>
    Therefore if something new appear to us,<br/>
    It should not bring amazement to thy face."</p>
<p>And I again: "Master, where shall be found<br/>
    Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,<br/>
    And sayest the other of this rain is made?"</p>
<p>"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,"<br/>
    Replied he; "but the boiling of the red<br/>
    Water might well solve one of them thou makest.</p>
<p>Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,<br/>
    There where the souls repair to lave themselves,<br/>
    When sin repented of has been removed."</p>
<p>Then said he: "It is time now to abandon<br/>
    The wood; take heed that thou come after me;<br/>
    A way the margins make that are not burning,</p>
<p>And over them all vapours are extinguished."</p>

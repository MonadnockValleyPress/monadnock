<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXVIII</h3>
<p>Who ever could, e'en with untrammelled words,<br/>
    Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full<br/>
    Which now I saw, by many times narrating?</p>
<p>Each tongue would for a certainty fall short<br/>
    By reason of our speech and memory,<br/>
    That have small room to comprehend so much.</p>
<p>If were again assembled all the people<br/>
    Which formerly upon the fateful land<br/>
    Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood</p>
<p>Shed by the Romans and the lingering war<br/>
    That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,<br/>
    As Livy has recorded, who errs not,</p>
<p>With those who felt the agony of blows<br/>
    By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,<br/>
    And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still</p>
<p>At Ceperano, where a renegade<br/>
    Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,<br/>
    Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,</p>
<p>And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,<br/>
    Should show, it would be nothing to compare<br/>
    With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.</p>
<p>A cask by losing centre-piece or cant<br/>
    Was never shattered so, as I saw one<br/>
    Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.</p>
<p>Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;<br/>
    His heart was visible, and the dismal sack<br/>
    That maketh excrement of what is eaten.</p>
<p>While I was all absorbed in seeing him,<br/>
    He looked at me, and opened with his hands<br/>
    His bosom, saying: "See now how I rend me;</p>
<p>How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;<br/>
    In front of me doth Ali weeping go,<br/>
    Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;</p>
<p>And all the others whom thou here beholdest,<br/>
    Disseminators of scandal and of schism<br/>
    While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.</p>
<p>A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us<br/>
    Thus cruelly, unto the falchion's edge<br/>
    Putting again each one of all this ream,</p>
<p>When we have gone around the doleful road;<br/>
    By reason that our wounds are closed again<br/>
    Ere any one in front of him repass.</p>
<p>But who art thou, that musest on the crag,<br/>
    Perchance to postpone going to the pain<br/>
    That is adjudged upon thine accusations?"</p>
<p>"Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,"<br/>
    My Master made reply, "to be tormented;<br/>
    But to procure him full experience,</p>
<p>Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him<br/>
    Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;<br/>
    And this is true as that I speak to thee."</p>
<p>More than a hundred were there when they heard him,<br/>
    Who in the moat stood still to look at me,<br/>
    Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.</p>
<p>"Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,<br/>
    Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,<br/>
    If soon he wish not here to follow me,</p>
<p>So with provisions, that no stress of snow<br/>
    May give the victory to the Novarese,<br/>
    Which otherwise to gain would not be easy."</p>
<p>After one foot to go away he lifted,<br/>
    This word did Mahomet say unto me,<br/>
    Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.</p>
<p>Another one, who had his throat pierced through,<br/>
    And nose cut off close underneath the brows,<br/>
    And had no longer but a single ear,</p>
<p>Staying to look in wonder with the others,<br/>
    Before the others did his gullet open,<br/>
    Which outwardly was red in every part,</p>
<p>And said: "O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,<br/>
    And whom I once saw up in Latian land,<br/>
    Unless too great similitude deceive me,</p>
<p>Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,<br/>
    If e'er thou see again the lovely plain<br/>
    That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,</p>
<p>And make it known to the best two of Fano,<br/>
    To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,<br/>
    That if foreseeing here be not in vain,</p>
<p>Cast over from their vessel shall they be,<br/>
    And drowned near unto the Cattolica,<br/>
    By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.</p>
<p>Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca<br/>
    Neptune ne'er yet beheld so great a crime,<br/>
    Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.</p>
<p>That traitor, who sees only with one eye,<br/>
    And holds the land, which some one here with me<br/>
    Would fain be fasting from the vision of,</p>
<p>Will make them come unto a parley with him;<br/>
    Then will do so, that to Focara's wind<br/>
    They will not stand in need of vow or prayer."</p>
<p>And I to him: "Show to me and declare,<br/>
    If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,<br/>
    Who is this person of the bitter vision."</p>
<p>Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw<br/>
    Of one of his companions, and his mouth<br/>
    Oped, crying: "This is he, and he speaks not.</p>
<p>This one, being banished, every doubt submerged<br/>
    In Caesar by affirming the forearmed<br/>
    Always with detriment allowed delay."</p>
<p>O how bewildered unto me appeared,<br/>
    With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,<br/>
    Curio, who in speaking was so bold!</p>
<p>And one, who both his hands dissevered had,<br/>
    The stumps uplifting through the murky air,<br/>
    So that the blood made horrible his face,</p>
<p>Cried out: "Thou shalt remember Mosca also,<br/>
    Who said, alas! 'A thing done has an end!'<br/>
    Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people."</p>
<p>"And death unto thy race," thereto I added;<br/>
    Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,<br/>
    Departed, like a person sad and crazed.</p>
<p>But I remained to look upon the crowd;<br/>
    And saw a thing which I should be afraid,<br/>
    Without some further proof, even to recount,</p>
<p>If it were not that conscience reassures me,<br/>
    That good companion which emboldens man<br/>
    Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.</p>
<p>I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,<br/>
    A trunk without a head walk in like manner<br/>
    As walked the others of the mournful herd.</p>
<p>And by the hair it held the head dissevered,<br/>
    Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,<br/>
    And that upon us gazed and said: "O me!"</p>
<p>It of itself made to itself a lamp,<br/>
    And they were two in one, and one in two;<br/>
    How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.</p>
<p>When it was come close to the bridge's foot,<br/>
    It lifted high its arm with all the head,<br/>
    To bring more closely unto us its words,</p>
<p>Which were: "Behold now the sore penalty,<br/>
    Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;<br/>
    Behold if any be as great as this.</p>
<p>And so that thou may carry news of me,<br/>
    Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same<br/>
    Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.</p>
<p>I made the father and the son rebellious;<br/>
    Achitophel not more with Absalom<br/>
    And David did with his accursed goadings.</p>
<p>Because I parted persons so united,<br/>
    Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!<br/>
    From its beginning, which is in this trunk.</p>
<p>Thus is observed in me the counterpoise."</p>

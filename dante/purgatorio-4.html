<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto IV</h3>
<p>Whenever by delight or else by pain,<br/>
    That seizes any faculty of ours,<br/>
    Wholly to that the soul collects itself,</p>
<p>It seemeth that no other power it heeds;<br/>
    And this against that error is which thinks<br/>
    One soul above another kindles in us.</p>
<p>And hence, whenever aught is heard or seen<br/>
    Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,<br/>
    Time passes on, and we perceive it not,</p>
<p>Because one faculty is that which listens,<br/>
    And other that which the soul keeps entire;<br/>
    This is as if in bonds, and that is free.</p>
<p>Of this I had experience positive<br/>
    In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;<br/>
    For fifty full degrees uprisen was</p>
<p>The sun, and I had not perceived it, when<br/>
    We came to where those souls with one accord<br/>
    Cried out unto us: "Here is what you ask."</p>
<p>A greater opening ofttimes hedges up<br/>
    With but a little forkful of his thorns<br/>
    The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,</p>
<p>Than was the passage-way through which ascended<br/>
    Only my Leader and myself behind him,<br/>
    After that company departed from us.</p>
<p>One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,<br/>
    And mounts the summit of Bismantova,<br/>
    With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;</p>
<p>With the swift pinions and the plumes I say<br/>
    Of great desire, conducted after him<br/>
    Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.</p>
<p>We mounted upward through the rifted rock,<br/>
    And on each side the border pressed upon us,<br/>
    And feet and hands the ground beneath required.</p>
<p>When we were come upon the upper rim<br/>
    Of the high bank, out on the open slope,<br/>
    "My Master," said I, "what way shall we take?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "No step of thine descend;<br/>
    Still up the mount behind me win thy way,<br/>
    Till some sage escort shall appear to us."</p>
<p>The summit was so high it vanquished sight,<br/>
    And the hillside precipitous far more<br/>
    Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.</p>
<p>Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:<br/>
    "O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold<br/>
    How I remain alone, unless thou stay!"</p>
<p>"O son," he said, "up yonder drag thyself,"<br/>
    Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,<br/>
    Which on that side encircles all the hill.</p>
<p>These words of his so spurred me on, that I<br/>
    Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,<br/>
    Until the circle was beneath my feet.</p>
<p>Thereon ourselves we seated both of us<br/>
    Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,<br/>
    For all men are delighted to look back.</p>
<p>To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,<br/>
    Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered<br/>
    That on the left hand we were smitten by it.</p>
<p>The Poet well perceived that I was wholly<br/>
    Bewildered at the chariot of the light,<br/>
    Where 'twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.</p>
<p>Whereon he said to me: "If Castor and Pollux<br/>
    Were in the company of yonder mirror,<br/>
    That up and down conducteth with its light,</p>
<p>Thou wouldst behold the zodiac's jagged wheel<br/>
    Revolving still more near unto the Bears,<br/>
    Unless it swerved aside from its old track.</p>
<p>How that may be wouldst thou have power to think,<br/>
    Collected in thyself, imagine Zion<br/>
    Together with this mount on earth to stand,</p>
<p>So that they both one sole horizon have,<br/>
    And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road<br/>
    Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,</p>
<p>Thou'lt see how of necessity must pass<br/>
    This on one side, when that upon the other,<br/>
    If thine intelligence right clearly heed."</p>
<p>"Truly, my Master," said I, "never yet<br/>
    Saw I so clearly as I now discern,<br/>
    There where my wit appeared incompetent,</p>
<p>That the mid-circle of supernal motion,<br/>
    Which in some art is the Equator called,<br/>
    And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,</p>
<p>For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence<br/>
    Tow'rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews<br/>
    Beheld it tow'rds the region of the heat.</p>
<p>But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn<br/>
    How far we have to go; for the hill rises<br/>
    Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise."</p>
<p>And he to me: "This mount is such, that ever<br/>
    At the beginning down below 'tis tiresome,<br/>
    And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.</p>
<p>Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,<br/>
    That going up shall be to thee as easy<br/>
    As going down the current in a boat,</p>
<p>Then at this pathway's ending thou wilt be;<br/>
    There to repose thy panting breath expect;<br/>
    No more I answer; and this I know for true."</p>
<p>And as he finished uttering these words,<br/>
    A voice close by us sounded: "Peradventure<br/>
    Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that."</p>
<p>At sound thereof each one of us turned round,<br/>
    And saw upon the left hand a great rock,<br/>
    Which neither I nor he before had noticed.</p>
<p>Thither we drew; and there were persons there<br/>
    Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,<br/>
    As one through indolence is wont to stand.</p>
<p>And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,<br/>
    Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,<br/>
    Holding his face low down between them bowed.</p>
<p>"O my sweet Lord," I said, "do turn thine eye<br/>
    On him who shows himself more negligent<br/>
    Then even Sloth herself his sister were."</p>
<p>Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,<br/>
    Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,<br/>
    And said: "Now go thou up, for thou art valiant."</p>
<p>Then knew I who he was; and the distress,<br/>
    That still a little did my breathing quicken,<br/>
    My going to him hindered not; and after</p>
<p>I came to him he hardly raised his head,<br/>
    Saying: "Hast thou seen clearly how the sun<br/>
    O'er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?"</p>
<p>His sluggish attitude and his curt words<br/>
    A little unto laughter moved my lips;<br/>
    Then I began: "Belacqua, I grieve not</p>
<p>For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated<br/>
    In this place art thou? Waitest thou an escort?<br/>
    Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?"</p>
<p>And he: "O brother, what's the use of climbing?<br/>
    Since to my torment would not let me go<br/>
    The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.</p>
<p>First heaven must needs so long revolve me round<br/>
    Outside thereof, as in my life it did,<br/>
    Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,</p>
<p>Unless, e'er that, some prayer may bring me aid<br/>
    Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;<br/>
    What profit others that in heaven are heard not?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,<br/>
    And saying: "Come now; see the sun has touched<br/>
    Meridian, and from the shore the night</p>
<p>Covers already with her foot Morocco."</p>

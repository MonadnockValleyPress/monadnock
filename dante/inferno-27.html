<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXVII</h3>
<p>Already was the flame erect and quiet,<br/>
    To speak no more, and now departed from us<br/>
    With the permission of the gentle Poet;</p>
<p>When yet another, which behind it came,<br/>
    Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top<br/>
    By a confused sound that issued from it.</p>
<p>As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first<br/>
    With the lament of him, and that was right,<br/>
    Who with his file had modulated it)</p>
<p>Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,<br/>
    That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,<br/>
    Still it appeared with agony transfixed;</p>
<p>Thus, by not having any way or issue<br/>
    At first from out the fire, to its own language<br/>
    Converted were the melancholy words.</p>
<p>But afterwards, when they had gathered way<br/>
    Up through the point, giving it that vibration<br/>
    The tongue had given them in their passage out,</p>
<p>We heard it said: "O thou, at whom I aim<br/>
    My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,<br/>
    Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'</p>
<p>Because I come perchance a little late,<br/>
    To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;<br/>
    Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.</p>
<p>If thou but lately into this blind world<br/>
    Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,<br/>
    Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,</p>
<p>Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,<br/>
    For I was from the mountains there between<br/>
    Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts."</p>
<p>I still was downward bent and listening,<br/>
    When my Conductor touched me on the side,<br/>
    Saying: "Speak thou: this one a Latian is."</p>
<p>And I, who had beforehand my reply<br/>
    In readiness, forthwith began to speak:<br/>
    "O soul, that down below there art concealed,</p>
<p>Romagna thine is not and never has been<br/>
    Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;<br/>
    But open war I none have left there now.</p>
<p>Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;<br/>
    The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,<br/>
    So that she covers Cervia with her vans.</p>
<p>The city which once made the long resistance,<br/>
    And of the French a sanguinary heap,<br/>
    Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;</p>
<p>Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,<br/>
    Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,<br/>
    Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.</p>
<p>The cities of Lamone and Santerno<br/>
    Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,<br/>
    Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;</p>
<p>And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,<br/>
    Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,<br/>
    Lives between tyranny and a free state.</p>
<p>Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;<br/>
    Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,<br/>
    So may thy name hold front there in the world."</p>
<p>After the fire a little more had roared<br/>
    In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved<br/>
    This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:</p>
<p>"If I believed that my reply were made<br/>
    To one who to the world would e'er return,<br/>
    This flame without more flickering would stand still;</p>
<p>But inasmuch as never from this depth<br/>
    Did any one return, if I hear true,<br/>
    Without the fear of infamy I answer,</p>
<p>I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,<br/>
    Believing thus begirt to make amends;<br/>
    And truly my belief had been fulfilled</p>
<p>But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,<br/>
    Who put me back into my former sins;<br/>
    And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.</p>
<p>While I was still the form of bone and pulp<br/>
    My mother gave to me, the deeds I did<br/>
    Were not those of a lion, but a fox.</p>
<p>The machinations and the covert ways<br/>
    I knew them all, and practised so their craft,<br/>
    That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.</p>
<p>When now unto that portion of mine age<br/>
    I saw myself arrived, when each one ought<br/>
    To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,</p>
<p>That which before had pleased me then displeased me;<br/>
    And penitent and confessing I surrendered,<br/>
    Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;</p>
<p>The Leader of the modern Pharisees<br/>
    Having a war near unto Lateran,<br/>
    And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,</p>
<p>For each one of his enemies was Christian,<br/>
    And none of them had been to conquer Acre,<br/>
    Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,</p>
<p>Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,<br/>
    In him regarded, nor in me that cord<br/>
    Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;</p>
<p>But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester<br/>
    To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,<br/>
    So this one sought me out as an adept</p>
<p>To cure him of the fever of his pride.<br/>
    Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,<br/>
    Because his words appeared inebriate.</p>
<p>And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;<br/>
    Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me<br/>
    How to raze Palestrina to the ground.</p>
<p>Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,<br/>
    As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,<br/>
    The which my predecessor held not dear.'</p>
<p>Then urged me on his weighty arguments<br/>
    There, where my silence was the worst advice;<br/>
    And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me</p>
<p>Of that sin into which I now must fall,<br/>
    The promise long with the fulfilment short<br/>
    Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'</p>
<p>Francis came afterward, when I was dead,<br/>
    For me; but one of the black Cherubim<br/>
    Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;</p>
<p>He must come down among my servitors,<br/>
    Because he gave the fraudulent advice<br/>
    From which time forth I have been at his hair;</p>
<p>For who repents not cannot be absolved,<br/>
    Nor can one both repent and will at once,<br/>
    Because of the contradiction which consents not.'</p>
<p>O miserable me! how I did shudder<br/>
    When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure<br/>
    Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'</p>
<p>He bore me unto Minos, who entwined<br/>
    Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,<br/>
    And after he had bitten it in great rage,</p>
<p>Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'<br/>
    Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,<br/>
    And vested thus in going I bemoan me."</p>
<p>When it had thus completed its recital,<br/>
    The flame departed uttering lamentations,<br/>
    Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.</p>
<p>Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,<br/>
    Up o'er the crag above another arch,<br/>
    Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee</p>
<p>By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.</p>

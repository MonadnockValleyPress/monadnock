<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXV</h3>
<p>If e'er it happen that the Poem Sacred,<br/>
    To which both heaven and earth have set their hand,<br/>
    So that it many a year hath made me lean,</p>
<p>O'ercome the cruelty that bars me out<br/>
    From the fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered,<br/>
    An enemy to the wolves that war upon it,</p>
<p>With other voice forthwith, with other fleece<br/>
    Poet will I return, and at my font<br/>
    Baptismal will I take the laurel crown;</p>
<p>Because into the Faith that maketh known<br/>
    All souls to God there entered I, and then<br/>
    Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled.</p>
<p>Thereafterward towards us moved a light<br/>
    Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits<br/>
    Which of his vicars Christ behind him left,</p>
<p>And then my Lady, full of ecstasy,<br/>
    Said unto me: "Look, look! behold the Baron<br/>
    For whom below Galicia is frequented."</p>
<p>In the same way as, when a dove alights<br/>
    Near his companion, both of them pour forth,<br/>
    Circling about and murmuring, their affection,</p>
<p>So one beheld I by the other grand<br/>
    Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,<br/>
    Lauding the food that there above is eaten.</p>
<p>But when their gratulations were complete,<br/>
    Silently 'coram me' each one stood still,<br/>
    So incandescent it o'ercame my sight.</p>
<p>Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:<br/>
    "Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions<br/>
    Of our Basilica have been described,</p>
<p>Make Hope resound within this altitude;<br/>
    Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it<br/>
    As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness."&mdash;</p>
<p>"Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;<br/>
    For what comes hither from the mortal world<br/>
    Must needs be ripened in our radiance."</p>
<p>This comfort came to me from the second fire;<br/>
    Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,<br/>
    Which bent them down before with too great weight.</p>
<p>"Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou<br/>
    Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,<br/>
    In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,</p>
<p>So that, the truth beholden of this court,<br/>
    Hope, which below there rightfully enamours,<br/>
    Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others,</p>
<p>Say what it is, and how is flowering with it<br/>
    Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee."<br/>
    Thus did the second light again continue.</p>
<p>And the Compassionate, who piloted<br/>
    The plumage of my wings in such high flight,<br/>
    Did in reply anticipate me thus:</p>
<p>"No child whatever the Church Militant<br/>
    Of greater hope possesses, as is written<br/>
    In that Sun which irradiates all our band;</p>
<p>Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt<br/>
    To come into Jerusalem to see,<br/>
    Or ever yet his warfare be completed.</p>
<p>The two remaining points, that not for knowledge<br/>
    Have been demanded, but that he report<br/>
    How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,</p>
<p>To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,<br/>
    Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;<br/>
    And may the grace of God in this assist him!"</p>
<p>As a disciple, who his teacher follows,<br/>
    Ready and willing, where he is expert,<br/>
    That his proficiency may be displayed,</p>
<p>"Hope," said I, "is the certain expectation<br/>
    Of future glory, which is the effect<br/>
    Of grace divine and merit precedent.</p>
<p>From many stars this light comes unto me;<br/>
    But he instilled it first into my heart<br/>
    Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.</p>
<p>'Sperent in te,' in the high Theody<br/>
    He sayeth, 'those who know thy name;' and who<br/>
    Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?</p>
<p>Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling<br/>
    In the Epistle, so that I am full,<br/>
    And upon others rain again your rain."</p>
<p>While I was speaking, in the living bosom<br/>
    Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,<br/>
    Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;</p>
<p>Then breathed: "The love wherewith I am inflamed<br/>
    Towards the virtue still which followed me<br/>
    Unto the palm and issue of the field,</p>
<p>Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight<br/>
    In her; and grateful to me is thy telling<br/>
    Whatever things Hope promises to thee."</p>
<p>And I: "The ancient Scriptures and the new<br/>
    The mark establish, and this shows it me,<br/>
    Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.</p>
<p>Isaiah saith, that each one garmented<br/>
    In his own land shall be with twofold garments,<br/>
    And his own land is this delightful life.</p>
<p>Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,<br/>
    There where he treateth of the robes of white,<br/>
    This revelation manifests to us."</p>
<p>And first, and near the ending of these words,<br/>
    "Sperent in te" from over us was heard,<br/>
    To which responsive answered all the carols.</p>
<p>Thereafterward a light among them brightened,<br/>
    So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,<br/>
    Winter would have a month of one sole day.</p>
<p>And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance<br/>
    A winsome maiden, only to do honour<br/>
    To the new bride, and not from any failing,</p>
<p>Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour<br/>
    Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved<br/>
    As was beseeming to their ardent love.</p>
<p>Into the song and music there it entered;<br/>
    And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,<br/>
    Even as a bride silent and motionless.</p>
<p>"This is the one who lay upon the breast<br/>
    Of him our Pelican; and this is he<br/>
    To the great office from the cross elected."</p>
<p>My Lady thus; but therefore none the more<br/>
    Did move her sight from its attentive gaze<br/>
    Before or afterward these words of hers.</p>
<p>Even as a man who gazes, and endeavours<br/>
    To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,<br/>
    And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,</p>
<p>So I became before that latest fire,<br/>
    While it was said, "Why dost thou daze thyself<br/>
    To see a thing which here hath no existence?</p>
<p>Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be<br/>
    With all the others there, until our number<br/>
    With the eternal proposition tallies.</p>
<p>With the two garments in the blessed cloister<br/>
    Are the two lights alone that have ascended:<br/>
    And this shalt thou take back into your world."</p>
<p>And at this utterance the flaming circle<br/>
    Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling<br/>
    Of sound that by the trinal breath was made,</p>
<p>As to escape from danger or fatigue<br/>
    The oars that erst were in the water beaten<br/>
    Are all suspended at a whistle's sound.</p>
<p>Ah, how much in my mind was I disturbed,<br/>
    When I turned round to look on Beatrice,<br/>
    That her I could not see, although I was</p>
<p>Close at her side and in the Happy World!</p>

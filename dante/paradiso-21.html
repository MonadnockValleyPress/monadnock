<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXI</h3>
<p>Already on my Lady's face mine eyes<br/>
    Again were fastened, and with these my mind,<br/>
    And from all other purpose was withdrawn;</p>
<p>And she smiled not; but "If I were to smile,"<br/>
    She unto me began, "thou wouldst become<br/>
    Like Semele, when she was turned to ashes.</p>
<p>Because my beauty, that along the stairs<br/>
    Of the eternal palace more enkindles,<br/>
    As thou hast seen, the farther we ascend,</p>
<p>If it were tempered not, is so resplendent<br/>
    That all thy mortal power in its effulgence<br/>
    Would seem a leaflet that the thunder crushes.</p>
<p>We are uplifted to the seventh splendour,<br/>
    That underneath the burning Lion's breast<br/>
    Now radiates downward mingled with his power.</p>
<p>Fix in direction of thine eyes the mind,<br/>
    And make of them a mirror for the figure<br/>
    That in this mirror shall appear to thee."</p>
<p>He who could know what was the pasturage<br/>
    My sight had in that blessed countenance,<br/>
    When I transferred me to another care,</p>
<p>Would recognize how grateful was to me<br/>
    Obedience unto my celestial escort,<br/>
    By counterpoising one side with the other.</p>
<p>Within the crystal which, around the world<br/>
    Revolving, bears the name of its dear leader,<br/>
    Under whom every wickedness lay dead,</p>
<p>Coloured like gold, on which the sunshine gleams,<br/>
    A stairway I beheld to such a height<br/>
    Uplifted, that mine eye pursued it not.</p>
<p>Likewise beheld I down the steps descending<br/>
    So many splendours, that I thought each light<br/>
    That in the heaven appears was there diffused.</p>
<p>And as accordant with their natural custom<br/>
    The rooks together at the break of day<br/>
    Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold;</p>
<p>Then some of them fly off without return,<br/>
    Others come back to where they started from,<br/>
    And others, wheeling round, still keep at home;</p>
<p>Such fashion it appeared to me was there<br/>
    Within the sparkling that together came,<br/>
    As soon as on a certain step it struck,</p>
<p>And that which nearest unto us remained<br/>
    Became so clear, that in my thought I said,<br/>
    "Well I perceive the love thou showest me;</p>
<p>But she, from whom I wait the how and when<br/>
    Of speech and silence, standeth still; whence I<br/>
    Against desire do well if I ask not."</p>
<p>She thereupon, who saw my silentness<br/>
    In the sight of Him who seeth everything,<br/>
    Said unto me, "Let loose thy warm desire."</p>
<p>And I began: "No merit of my own<br/>
    Renders me worthy of response from thee;<br/>
    But for her sake who granteth me the asking,</p>
<p>Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed<br/>
    In thy beatitude, make known to me<br/>
    The cause which draweth thee so near my side;</p>
<p>And tell me why is silent in this wheel<br/>
    The dulcet symphony of Paradise,<br/>
    That through the rest below sounds so devoutly."</p>
<p>"Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight,"<br/>
    It answer made to me; "they sing not here,<br/>
    For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled.</p>
<p>Thus far adown the holy stairway's steps<br/>
    Have I descended but to give thee welcome<br/>
    With words, and with the light that mantles me;</p>
<p>Nor did more love cause me to be more ready,<br/>
    For love as much and more up there is burning,<br/>
    As doth the flaming manifest to thee.</p>
<p>But the high charity, that makes us servants<br/>
    Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,<br/>
    Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe."</p>
<p>"I see full well," said I, "O sacred lamp!<br/>
    How love unfettered in this court sufficeth<br/>
    To follow the eternal Providence;</p>
<p>But this is what seems hard for me to see,<br/>
    Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone<br/>
    Unto this office from among thy consorts."</p>
<p>No sooner had I come to the last word,<br/>
    Than of its middle made the light a centre,<br/>
    Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.</p>
<p>When answer made the love that was therein:<br/>
    "On me directed is a light divine,<br/>
    Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,</p>
<p>Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined<br/>
    Lifts me above myself so far, I see<br/>
    The supreme essence from which this is drawn.</p>
<p>Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,<br/>
    For to my sight, as far as it is clear,<br/>
    The clearness of the flame I equal make.</p>
<p>But that soul in the heaven which is most pure,<br/>
    That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,<br/>
    Could this demand of thine not satisfy;</p>
<p>Because so deeply sinks in the abyss<br/>
    Of the eternal statute what thou askest,<br/>
    From all created sight it is cut off.</p>
<p>And to the mortal world, when thou returnest,<br/>
    This carry back, that it may not presume<br/>
    Longer tow'rd such a goal to move its feet.</p>
<p>The mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke;<br/>
    From this observe how can it do below<br/>
    That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?"</p>
<p>Such limit did its words prescribe to me,<br/>
    The question I relinquished, and restricted<br/>
    Myself to ask it humbly who it was.</p>
<p>"Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs,<br/>
    And not far distant from thy native place,<br/>
    So high, the thunders far below them sound,</p>
<p>And form a ridge that Catria is called,<br/>
    'Neath which is consecrate a hermitage<br/>
    Wont to be dedicate to worship only."</p>
<p>Thus unto me the third speech recommenced,<br/>
    And then, continuing, it said: "Therein<br/>
    Unto God's service I became so steadfast,</p>
<p>That feeding only on the juice of olives<br/>
    Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,<br/>
    Contented in my thoughts contemplative.</p>
<p>That cloister used to render to these heavens<br/>
    Abundantly, and now is empty grown,<br/>
    So that perforce it soon must be revealed.</p>
<p>I in that place was Peter Damiano;<br/>
    And Peter the Sinner was I in the house<br/>
    Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.</p>
<p>Little of mortal life remained to me,<br/>
    When I was called and dragged forth to the hat<br/>
    Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.</p>
<p>Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came<br/>
    Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,<br/>
    Taking the food of any hostelry.</p>
<p>Now some one to support them on each side<br/>
    The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,<br/>
    So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.</p>
<p>They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,<br/>
    So that two beasts go underneath one skin;<br/>
    O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!"</p>
<p>At this voice saw I many little flames<br/>
    From step to step descending and revolving,<br/>
    And every revolution made them fairer.</p>
<p>Round about this one came they and stood still,<br/>
    And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,<br/>
    It here could find no parallel, nor I</p>
<p>Distinguished it, the thunder so o'ercame me.</p>

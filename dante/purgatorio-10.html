<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto X</h3>
<p>When we had crossed the threshold of the door<br/>
    Which the perverted love of souls disuses,<br/>
    Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,</p>
<p>Re-echoing I heard it closed again;<br/>
    And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,<br/>
    What for my failing had been fit excuse?</p>
<p>We mounted upward through a rifted rock,<br/>
    Which undulated to this side and that,<br/>
    Even as a wave receding and advancing.</p>
<p>"Here it behoves us use a little art,"<br/>
    Began my Leader, "to adapt ourselves<br/>
    Now here, now there, to the receding side."</p>
<p>And this our footsteps so infrequent made,<br/>
    That sooner had the moon's decreasing disk<br/>
    Regained its bed to sink again to rest,</p>
<p>Than we were forth from out that needle's eye;<br/>
    But when we free and in the open were,<br/>
    There where the mountain backward piles itself,</p>
<p>I wearied out, and both of us uncertain<br/>
    About our way, we stopped upon a plain<br/>
    More desolate than roads across the deserts.</p>
<p>From where its margin borders on the void,<br/>
    To foot of the high bank that ever rises,<br/>
    A human body three times told would measure;</p>
<p>And far as eye of mine could wing its flight,<br/>
    Now on the left, and on the right flank now,<br/>
    The same this cornice did appear to me.</p>
<p>Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet,<br/>
    When I perceived the embankment round about,<br/>
    Which all right of ascent had interdicted,</p>
<p>To be of marble white, and so adorned<br/>
    With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,<br/>
    But Nature's self, had there been put to shame.</p>
<p>The Angel, who came down to earth with tidings<br/>
    Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,<br/>
    And opened Heaven from its long interdict,</p>
<p>In front of us appeared so truthfully<br/>
    There sculptured in a gracious attitude,<br/>
    He did not seem an image that is silent.</p>
<p>One would have sworn that he was saying, "Ave;"<br/>
    For she was there in effigy portrayed<br/>
    Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,</p>
<p>And in her mien this language had impressed,<br/>
    "Ecce ancilla Dei," as distinctly<br/>
    As any figure stamps itself in wax.</p>
<p>"Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,"<br/>
    The gentle Master said, who had me standing<br/>
    Upon that side where people have their hearts;</p>
<p>Whereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld<br/>
    In rear of Mary, and upon that side<br/>
    Where he was standing who conducted me,</p>
<p>Another story on the rock imposed;<br/>
    Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,<br/>
    So that before mine eyes it might be set.</p>
<p>There sculptured in the self-same marble were<br/>
    The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,<br/>
    Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.</p>
<p>People appeared in front, and all of them<br/>
    In seven choirs divided, of two senses<br/>
    Made one say "No," the other, "Yes, they sing."</p>
<p>Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,<br/>
    Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose<br/>
    Were in the yes and no discordant made.</p>
<p>Preceded there the vessel benedight,<br/>
    Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,<br/>
    And more and less than King was he in this.</p>
<p>Opposite, represented at the window<br/>
    Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,<br/>
    Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.</p>
<p>I moved my feet from where I had been standing,<br/>
    To examine near at hand another story,<br/>
    Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.</p>
<p>There the high glory of the Roman Prince<br/>
    Was chronicled, whose great beneficence<br/>
    Moved Gregory to his great victory;</p>
<p>'Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;<br/>
    And a poor widow at his bridle stood,<br/>
    In attitude of weeping and of grief.</p>
<p>Around about him seemed it thronged and full<br/>
    Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold<br/>
    Above them visibly in the wind were moving.</p>
<p>The wretched woman in the midst of these<br/>
    Seemed to be saying: "Give me vengeance, Lord,<br/>
    For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking."</p>
<p>And he to answer her: "Now wait until<br/>
    I shall return." And she: "My Lord," like one<br/>
    In whom grief is impatient, "shouldst thou not</p>
<p>Return?" And he: "Who shall be where I am<br/>
    Will give it thee." And she: "Good deed of others<br/>
    What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?"</p>
<p>Whence he: "Now comfort thee, for it behoves me<br/>
    That I discharge my duty ere I move;<br/>
    Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me."</p>
<p>He who on no new thing has ever looked<br/>
    Was the creator of this visible language,<br/>
    Novel to us, for here it is not found.</p>
<p>While I delighted me in contemplating<br/>
    The images of such humility,<br/>
    And dear to look on for their Maker's sake,</p>
<p>"Behold, upon this side, but rare they make<br/>
    Their steps," the Poet murmured, "many people;<br/>
    These will direct us to the lofty stairs."</p>
<p>Mine eyes, that in beholding were intent<br/>
    To see new things, of which they curious are,<br/>
    In turning round towards him were not slow.</p>
<p>But still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve<br/>
    From thy good purposes, because thou hearest<br/>
    How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;</p>
<p>Attend not to the fashion of the torment,<br/>
    Think of what follows; think that at the worst<br/>
    It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.</p>
<p>"Master," began I, "that which I behold<br/>
    Moving towards us seems to me not persons,<br/>
    And what I know not, so in sight I waver."</p>
<p>And he to me: "The grievous quality<br/>
    Of this their torment bows them so to earth,<br/>
    That my own eyes at first contended with it;</p>
<p>But look there fixedly, and disentangle<br/>
    By sight what cometh underneath those stones;<br/>
    Already canst thou see how each is stricken."</p>
<p>O ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!<br/>
    Who, in the vision of the mind infirm<br/>
    Confidence have in your backsliding steps,</p>
<p>Do ye not comprehend that we are worms,<br/>
    Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly<br/>
    That flieth unto judgment without screen?</p>
<p>Why floats aloft your spirit high in air?<br/>
    Like are ye unto insects undeveloped,<br/>
    Even as the worm in whom formation fails!</p>
<p>As to sustain a ceiling or a roof,<br/>
    In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure<br/>
    Is seen to join its knees unto its breast,</p>
<p>Which makes of the unreal real anguish<br/>
    Arise in him who sees it, fashioned thus<br/>
    Beheld I those, when I had ta'en good heed.</p>
<p>True is it, they were more or less bent down,<br/>
    According as they more or less were laden;<br/>
    And he who had most patience in his looks</p>
<p>Weeping did seem to say, "I can no more!"</p>

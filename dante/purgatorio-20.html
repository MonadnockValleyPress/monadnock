<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XX</h3>
<p>Ill strives the will against a better will;<br/>
    Therefore, to pleasure him, against my pleasure<br/>
    I drew the sponge not saturate from the water.</p>
<p>Onward I moved, and onward moved my Leader,<br/>
    Through vacant places, skirting still the rock,<br/>
    As on a wall close to the battlements;</p>
<p>For they that through their eyes pour drop by drop<br/>
    The malady which all the world pervades,<br/>
    On the other side too near the verge approach.</p>
<p>Accursed mayst thou be, thou old she-wolf,<br/>
    That more than all the other beasts hast prey,<br/>
    Because of hunger infinitely hollow!</p>
<p>O heaven, in whose gyrations some appear<br/>
    To think conditions here below are changed,<br/>
    When will he come through whom she shall depart?</p>
<p>Onward we went with footsteps slow and scarce,<br/>
    And I attentive to the shades I heard<br/>
    Piteously weeping and bemoaning them;</p>
<p>And I by peradventure heard "Sweet Mary!"<br/>
    Uttered in front of us amid the weeping<br/>
    Even as a woman does who is in child-birth;</p>
<p>And in continuance: "How poor thou wast<br/>
    Is manifested by that hostelry<br/>
    Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down."</p>
<p>Thereafterward I heard: "O good Fabricius,<br/>
    Virtue with poverty didst thou prefer<br/>
    To the possession of great wealth with vice."</p>
<p>So pleasurable were these words to me<br/>
    That I drew farther onward to have knowledge<br/>
    Touching that spirit whence they seemed to come.</p>
<p>He furthermore was speaking of the largess<br/>
    Which Nicholas unto the maidens gave,<br/>
    In order to conduct their youth to honour.</p>
<p>"O soul that dost so excellently speak,<br/>
    Tell me who wast thou," said I, "and why only<br/>
    Thou dost renew these praises well deserved?</p>
<p>Not without recompense shall be thy word,<br/>
    If I return to finish the short journey<br/>
    Of that life which is flying to its end."</p>
<p>And he: "I'll tell thee, not for any comfort<br/>
    I may expect from earth, but that so much<br/>
    Grace shines in thee or ever thou art dead.</p>
<p>I was the root of that malignant plant<br/>
    Which overshadows all the Christian world,<br/>
    So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it;</p>
<p>But if Douay and Ghent, and Lille and Bruges<br/>
    Had Power, soon vengeance would be taken on it;<br/>
    And this I pray of Him who judges all.</p>
<p>Hugh Capet was I called upon the earth;<br/>
    From me were born the Louises and Philips,<br/>
    By whom in later days has France been governed.</p>
<p>I was the son of a Parisian butcher,<br/>
    What time the ancient kings had perished all,<br/>
    Excepting one, contrite in cloth of gray.</p>
<p>I found me grasping in my hands the rein<br/>
    Of the realm's government, and so great power<br/>
    Of new acquest, and so with friends abounding,</p>
<p>That to the widowed diadem promoted<br/>
    The head of mine own offspring was, from whom<br/>
    The consecrated bones of these began.</p>
<p>So long as the great dowry of Provence<br/>
    Out of my blood took not the sense of shame,<br/>
    'Twas little worth, but still it did no harm.</p>
<p>Then it began with falsehood and with force<br/>
    Its rapine; and thereafter, for amends,<br/>
    Took Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony.</p>
<p>Charles came to Italy, and for amends<br/>
    A victim made of Conradin, and then<br/>
    Thrust Thomas back to heaven, for amends.</p>
<p>A time I see, not very distant now,<br/>
    Which draweth forth another Charles from France,<br/>
    The better to make known both him and his.</p>
<p>Unarmed he goes, and only with the lance<br/>
    That Judas jousted with; and that he thrusts<br/>
    So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst.</p>
<p>He thence not land, but sin and infamy,<br/>
    Shall gain, so much more grievous to himself<br/>
    As the more light such damage he accounts.</p>
<p>The other, now gone forth, ta'en in his ship,<br/>
    See I his daughter sell, and chaffer for her<br/>
    As corsairs do with other female slaves.</p>
<p>What more, O Avarice, canst thou do to us,<br/>
    Since thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn,<br/>
    It careth not for its own proper flesh?</p>
<p>That less may seem the future ill and past,<br/>
    I see the flower-de-luce Alagna enter,<br/>
    And Christ in his own Vicar captive made.</p>
<p>I see him yet another time derided;<br/>
    I see renewed the vinegar and gall,<br/>
    And between living thieves I see him slain.</p>
<p>I see the modern Pilate so relentless,<br/>
    This does not sate him, but without decretal<br/>
    He to the temple bears his sordid sails!</p>
<p>When, O my Lord! shall I be joyful made<br/>
    By looking on the vengeance which, concealed,<br/>
    Makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy?</p>
<p>What I was saying of that only bride<br/>
    Of the Holy Ghost, and which occasioned thee<br/>
    To turn towards me for some commentary,</p>
<p>So long has been ordained to all our prayers<br/>
    As the day lasts; but when the night comes on,<br/>
    Contrary sound we take instead thereof.</p>
<p>At that time we repeat Pygmalion,<br/>
    Of whom a traitor, thief, and parricide<br/>
    Made his insatiable desire of gold;</p>
<p>And the misery of avaricious Midas,<br/>
    That followed his inordinate demand,<br/>
    At which forevermore one needs but laugh.</p>
<p>The foolish Achan each one then records,<br/>
    And how he stole the spoils; so that the wrath<br/>
    Of Joshua still appears to sting him here.</p>
<p>Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband,<br/>
    We laud the hoof-beats Heliodorus had,<br/>
    And the whole mount in infamy encircles</p>
<p>Polymnestor who murdered Polydorus.<br/>
    Here finally is cried: 'O Crassus, tell us,<br/>
    For thou dost know, what is the taste of gold?'</p>
<p>Sometimes we speak, one loud, another low,<br/>
    According to desire of speech, that spurs us<br/>
    To greater now and now to lesser pace.</p>
<p>But in the good that here by day is talked of,<br/>
    Erewhile alone I was not; yet near by<br/>
    No other person lifted up his voice."</p>
<p>From him already we departed were,<br/>
    And made endeavour to o'ercome the road<br/>
    As much as was permitted to our power,</p>
<p>When I perceived, like something that is falling,<br/>
    The mountain tremble, whence a chill seized on me,<br/>
    As seizes him who to his death is going.</p>
<p>Certes so violently shook not Delos,<br/>
    Before Latona made her nest therein<br/>
    To give birth to the two eyes of the heaven.</p>
<p>Then upon all sides there began a cry,<br/>
    Such that the Master drew himself towards me,<br/>
    Saying, "Fear not, while I am guiding thee."</p>
<p>"Gloria in excelsis Deo," all<br/>
    Were saying, from what near I comprehended,<br/>
    Where it was possible to hear the cry.</p>
<p>We paused immovable and in suspense,<br/>
    Even as the shepherds who first heard that song,<br/>
    Until the trembling ceased, and it was finished.</p>
<p>Then we resumed again our holy path,<br/>
    Watching the shades that lay upon the ground,<br/>
    Already turned to their accustomed plaint.</p>
<p>No ignorance ever with so great a strife<br/>
    Had rendered me importunate to know,<br/>
    If erreth not in this my memory,</p>
<p>As meditating then I seemed to have;<br/>
    Nor out of haste to question did I dare,<br/>
    Nor of myself I there could aught perceive;</p>
<p>So I went onward timorous and thoughtful.</p>

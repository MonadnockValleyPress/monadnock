<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto VIII</h3>
<p>I say, continuing, that long before<br/>
    We to the foot of that high tower had come,<br/>
    Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,</p>
<p>By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,<br/>
    And from afar another answer them,<br/>
    So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.</p>
<p>And, to the sea of all discernment turned,<br/>
    I said: "What sayeth this, and what respondeth<br/>
    That other fire? and who are they that made it?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "Across the turbid waves<br/>
    What is expected thou canst now discern,<br/>
    If reek of the morass conceal it not."</p>
<p>Cord never shot an arrow from itself<br/>
    That sped away athwart the air so swift,<br/>
    As I beheld a very little boat</p>
<p>Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,<br/>
    Under the guidance of a single pilot,<br/>
    Who shouted, "Now art thou arrived, fell soul?"</p>
<p>"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain<br/>
    For this once," said my Lord; "thou shalt not have us<br/>
    Longer than in the passing of the slough."</p>
<p>As he who listens to some great deceit<br/>
    That has been done to him, and then resents it,<br/>
    Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.</p>
<p>My Guide descended down into the boat,<br/>
    And then he made me enter after him,<br/>
    And only when I entered seemed it laden.</p>
<p>Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,<br/>
    The antique prow goes on its way, dividing<br/>
    More of the water than 'tis wont with others.</p>
<p>While we were running through the dead canal,<br/>
    Uprose in front of me one full of mire,<br/>
    And said, "Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?"</p>
<p>And I to him: "Although I come, I stay not;<br/>
    But who art thou that hast become so squalid?"<br/>
    "Thou seest that I am one who weeps," he answered.</p>
<p>And I to him: "With weeping and with wailing,<br/>
    Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;<br/>
    For thee I know, though thou art all defiled."</p>
<p>Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;<br/>
    Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,<br/>
    Saying, "Away there with the other dogs!"</p>
<p>Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;<br/>
    He kissed my face, and said: "Disdainful soul,<br/>
    Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.</p>
<p>That was an arrogant person in the world;<br/>
    Goodness is none, that decks his memory;<br/>
    So likewise here his shade is furious.</p>
<p>How many are esteemed great kings up there,<br/>
    Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,<br/>
    Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!"</p>
<p>And I: "My Master, much should I be pleased,<br/>
    If I could see him soused into this broth,<br/>
    Before we issue forth out of the lake."</p>
<p>And he to me: "Ere unto thee the shore<br/>
    Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;<br/>
    Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy."</p>
<p>A little after that, I saw such havoc<br/>
    Made of him by the people of the mire,<br/>
    That still I praise and thank my God for it.</p>
<p>They all were shouting, "At Philippo Argenti!"<br/>
    And that exasperate spirit Florentine<br/>
    Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.</p>
<p>We left him there, and more of him I tell not;<br/>
    But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,<br/>
    Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.</p>
<p>And the good Master said: "Even now, my Son,<br/>
    The city draweth near whose name is Dis,<br/>
    With the grave citizens, with the great throng."</p>
<p>And I: "Its mosques already, Master, clearly<br/>
    Within there in the valley I discern<br/>
    Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire</p>
<p>They were." And he to me: "The fire eternal<br/>
    That kindles them within makes them look red,<br/>
    As thou beholdest in this nether Hell."</p>
<p>Then we arrived within the moats profound,<br/>
    That circumvallate that disconsolate city;<br/>
    The walls appeared to me to be of iron.</p>
<p>Not without making first a circuit wide,<br/>
    We came unto a place where loud the pilot<br/>
    Cried out to us, "Debark, here is the entrance."</p>
<p>More than a thousand at the gates I saw<br/>
    Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily<br/>
    Were saying, "Who is this that without death</p>
<p>Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?"<br/>
    And my sagacious Master made a sign<br/>
    Of wishing secretly to speak with them.</p>
<p>A little then they quelled their great disdain,<br/>
    And said: "Come thou alone, and he begone<br/>
    Who has so boldly entered these dominions.</p>
<p>Let him return alone by his mad road;<br/>
    Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,<br/>
    Who hast escorted him through such dark regions."</p>
<p>Think, Reader, if I was discomforted<br/>
    At utterance of the accursed words;<br/>
    For never to return here I believed.</p>
<p>"O my dear Guide, who more than seven times<br/>
    Hast rendered me security, and drawn me<br/>
    From imminent peril that before me stood,</p>
<p>Do not desert me," said I, "thus undone;<br/>
    And if the going farther be denied us,<br/>
    Let us retrace our steps together swiftly."</p>
<p>And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,<br/>
    Said unto me: "Fear not; because our passage<br/>
    None can take from us, it by Such is given.</p>
<p>But here await me, and thy weary spirit<br/>
    Comfort and nourish with a better hope;<br/>
    For in this nether world I will not leave thee."</p>
<p>So onward goes and there abandons me<br/>
    My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,<br/>
    For No and Yes within my head contend.</p>
<p>I could not hear what he proposed to them;<br/>
    But with them there he did not linger long,<br/>
    Ere each within in rivalry ran back.</p>
<p>They closed the portals, those our adversaries,<br/>
    On my Lord's breast, who had remained without<br/>
    And turned to me with footsteps far between.</p>
<p>His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he<br/>
    Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,<br/>
    "Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?"</p>
<p>And unto me: "Thou, because I am angry,<br/>
    Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,<br/>
    Whatever for defence within be planned.</p>
<p>This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;<br/>
    For once they used it at less secret gate,<br/>
    Which finds itself without a fastening still.</p>
<p>O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;<br/>
    And now this side of it descends the steep,<br/>
    Passing across the circles without escort,</p>
<p>One by whose means the city shall be opened."</p>

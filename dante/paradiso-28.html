<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXVIII</h3>
<p>After the truth against the present life<br/>
    Of miserable mortals was unfolded<br/>
    By her who doth imparadise my mind,</p>
<p>As in a looking-glass a taper's flame<br/>
    He sees who from behind is lighted by it,<br/>
    Before he has it in his sight or thought,</p>
<p>And turns him round to see if so the glass<br/>
    Tell him the truth, and sees that it accords<br/>
    Therewith as doth a music with its metre,</p>
<p>In similar wise my memory recollecteth<br/>
    That I did, looking into those fair eyes,<br/>
    Of which Love made the springes to ensnare me.</p>
<p>And as I turned me round, and mine were touched<br/>
    By that which is apparent in that volume,<br/>
    Whenever on its gyre we gaze intent,</p>
<p>A point beheld I, that was raying out<br/>
    Light so acute, the sight which it enkindles<br/>
    Must close perforce before such great acuteness.</p>
<p>And whatsoever star seems smallest here<br/>
    Would seem to be a moon, if placed beside it.<br/>
    As one star with another star is placed.</p>
<p>Perhaps at such a distance as appears<br/>
    A halo cincturing the light that paints it,<br/>
    When densest is the vapour that sustains it,</p>
<p>Thus distant round the point a circle of fire<br/>
    So swiftly whirled, that it would have surpassed<br/>
    Whatever motion soonest girds the world;</p>
<p>And this was by another circumcinct,<br/>
    That by a third, the third then by a fourth,<br/>
    By a fifth the fourth, and then by a sixth the fifth;</p>
<p>The seventh followed thereupon in width<br/>
    So ample now, that Juno's messenger<br/>
    Entire would be too narrow to contain it.</p>
<p>Even so the eighth and ninth; and every one<br/>
    More slowly moved, according as it was<br/>
    In number distant farther from the first.</p>
<p>And that one had its flame most crystalline<br/>
    From which less distant was the stainless spark,<br/>
    I think because more with its truth imbued.</p>
<p>My Lady, who in my anxiety<br/>
    Beheld me much perplexed, said: "From that point<br/>
    Dependent is the heaven and nature all.</p>
<p>Behold that circle most conjoined to it,<br/>
    And know thou, that its motion is so swift<br/>
    Through burning love whereby it is spurred on."</p>
<p>And I to her: "If the world were arranged<br/>
    In the order which I see in yonder wheels,<br/>
    What's set before me would have satisfied me;</p>
<p>But in the world of sense we can perceive<br/>
    That evermore the circles are diviner<br/>
    As they are from the centre more remote</p>
<p>Wherefore if my desire is to be ended<br/>
    In this miraculous and angelic temple,<br/>
    That has for confines only love and light,</p>
<p>To hear behoves me still how the example<br/>
    And the exemplar go not in one fashion,<br/>
    Since for myself in vain I contemplate it."</p>
<p>"If thine own fingers unto such a knot<br/>
    Be insufficient, it is no great wonder,<br/>
    So hard hath it become for want of trying."</p>
<p>My Lady thus; then said she: "Do thou take<br/>
    What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated,<br/>
    And exercise on that thy subtlety.</p>
<p>The circles corporal are wide and narrow<br/>
    According to the more or less of virtue<br/>
    Which is distributed through all their parts.</p>
<p>The greater goodness works the greater weal,<br/>
    The greater weal the greater body holds,<br/>
    If perfect equally are all its parts.</p>
<p>Therefore this one which sweeps along with it<br/>
    The universe sublime, doth correspond<br/>
    Unto the circle which most loves and knows.</p>
<p>On which account, if thou unto the virtue<br/>
    Apply thy measure, not to the appearance<br/>
    Of substances that unto thee seem round,</p>
<p>Thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement,<br/>
    Of more to greater, and of less to smaller,<br/>
    In every heaven, with its Intelligence."</p>
<p>Even as remaineth splendid and serene<br/>
    The hemisphere of air, when Boreas<br/>
    Is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest,</p>
<p>Because is purified and resolved the rack<br/>
    That erst disturbed it, till the welkin laughs<br/>
    With all the beauties of its pageantry;</p>
<p>Thus did I likewise, after that my Lady<br/>
    Had me provided with her clear response,<br/>
    And like a star in heaven the truth was seen.</p>
<p>And soon as to a stop her words had come,<br/>
    Not otherwise does iron scintillate<br/>
    When molten, than those circles scintillated.</p>
<p>Their coruscation all the sparks repeated,<br/>
    And they so many were, their number makes<br/>
    More millions than the doubling of the chess.</p>
<p>I heard them sing hosanna choir by choir<br/>
    To the fixed point which holds them at the 'Ubi,'<br/>
    And ever will, where they have ever been.</p>
<p>And she, who saw the dubious meditations<br/>
    Within my mind, "The primal circles," said,<br/>
    "Have shown thee Seraphim and Cherubim.</p>
<p>Thus rapidly they follow their own bonds,<br/>
    To be as like the point as most they can,<br/>
    And can as far as they are high in vision.</p>
<p>Those other Loves, that round about them go,<br/>
    Thrones of the countenance divine are called,<br/>
    Because they terminate the primal Triad.</p>
<p>And thou shouldst know that they all have delight<br/>
    As much as their own vision penetrates<br/>
    The Truth, in which all intellect finds rest.</p>
<p>From this it may be seen how blessedness<br/>
    Is founded in the faculty which sees,<br/>
    And not in that which loves, and follows next;</p>
<p>And of this seeing merit is the measure,<br/>
    Which is brought forth by grace, and by good will;<br/>
    Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed.</p>
<p>The second Triad, which is germinating<br/>
    In such wise in this sempiternal spring,<br/>
    That no nocturnal Aries despoils,</p>
<p>Perpetually hosanna warbles forth<br/>
    With threefold melody, that sounds in three<br/>
    Orders of joy, with which it is intrined.</p>
<p>The three Divine are in this hierarchy,<br/>
    First the Dominions, and the Virtues next;<br/>
    And the third order is that of the Powers.</p>
<p>Then in the dances twain penultimate<br/>
    The Principalities and Archangels wheel;<br/>
    The last is wholly of angelic sports.</p>
<p>These orders upward all of them are gazing,<br/>
    And downward so prevail, that unto God<br/>
    They all attracted are and all attract.</p>
<p>And Dionysius with so great desire<br/>
    To contemplate these Orders set himself,<br/>
    He named them and distinguished them as I do.</p>
<p>But Gregory afterwards dissented from him;<br/>
    Wherefore, as soon as he unclosed his eyes<br/>
    Within this heaven, he at himself did smile.</p>
<p>And if so much of secret truth a mortal<br/>
    Proffered on earth, I would not have thee marvel,<br/>
    For he who saw it here revealed it to him,</p>
<p>With much more of the truth about these circles."</p>

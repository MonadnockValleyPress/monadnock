<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXVI</h3>
<p>While on the brink thus one before the other<br/>
    We went upon our way, oft the good Master<br/>
    Said: "Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee."</p>
<p>On the right shoulder smote me now the sun,<br/>
    That, raying out, already the whole west<br/>
    Changed from its azure aspect into white.</p>
<p>And with my shadow did I make the flame<br/>
    Appear more red; and even to such a sign<br/>
    Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed.</p>
<p>This was the cause that gave them a beginning<br/>
    To speak of me; and to themselves began they<br/>
    To say: "That seems not a factitious body!"</p>
<p>Then towards me, as far as they could come,<br/>
    Came certain of them, always with regard<br/>
    Not to step forth where they would not be burned.</p>
<p>"O thou who goest, not from being slower<br/>
    But reverent perhaps, behind the others,<br/>
    Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning.</p>
<p>Nor to me only is thine answer needful;<br/>
    For all of these have greater thirst for it<br/>
    Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian.</p>
<p>Tell us how is it that thou makest thyself<br/>
    A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not<br/>
    Entered as yet into the net of death."</p>
<p>Thus one of them addressed me, and I straight<br/>
    Should have revealed myself, were I not bent<br/>
    On other novelty that then appeared.</p>
<p>For through the middle of the burning road<br/>
    There came a people face to face with these,<br/>
    Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.</p>
<p>There see I hastening upon either side<br/>
    Each of the shades, and kissing one another<br/>
    Without a pause, content with brief salute.</p>
<p>Thus in the middle of their brown battalions<br/>
    Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another<br/>
    Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune.</p>
<p>No sooner is the friendly greeting ended,<br/>
    Or ever the first footstep passes onward,<br/>
    Each one endeavours to outcry the other;</p>
<p>The new-come people: "Sodom and Gomorrah!"<br/>
    The rest: "Into the cow Pasiphae enters,<br/>
    So that the bull unto her lust may run!"</p>
<p>Then as the cranes, that to Riphaean mountains<br/>
    Might fly in part, and part towards the sands,<br/>
    These of the frost, those of the sun avoidant,</p>
<p>One folk is going, and the other coming,<br/>
    And weeping they return to their first songs,<br/>
    And to the cry that most befitteth them;</p>
<p>And close to me approached, even as before,<br/>
    The very same who had entreated me,<br/>
    Attent to listen in their countenance.</p>
<p>I, who their inclination twice had seen,<br/>
    Began: "O souls secure in the possession,<br/>
    Whene'er it may be, of a state of peace,</p>
<p>Neither unripe nor ripened have remained<br/>
    My members upon earth, but here are with me<br/>
    With their own blood and their articulations.</p>
<p>I go up here to be no longer blind;<br/>
    A Lady is above, who wins this grace,<br/>
    Whereby the mortal through your world I bring.</p>
<p>But as your greatest longing satisfied<br/>
    May soon become, so that the Heaven may house you<br/>
    Which full of love is, and most amply spreads,</p>
<p>Tell me, that I again in books may write it,<br/>
    Who are you, and what is that multitude<br/>
    Which goes upon its way behind your backs?"</p>
<p>Not otherwise with wonder is bewildered<br/>
    The mountaineer, and staring round is dumb,<br/>
    When rough and rustic to the town he goes,</p>
<p>Than every shade became in its appearance;<br/>
    But when they of their stupor were disburdened,<br/>
    Which in high hearts is quickly quieted,</p>
<p>"Blessed be thou, who of our border-lands,"<br/>
    He recommenced who first had questioned us,<br/>
    "Experience freightest for a better life.</p>
<p>The folk that comes not with us have offended<br/>
    In that for which once Caesar, triumphing,<br/>
    Heard himself called in contumely, 'Queen.'</p>
<p>Therefore they separate, exclaiming, 'Sodom!'<br/>
    Themselves reproving, even as thou hast heard,<br/>
    And add unto their burning by their shame.</p>
<p>Our own transgression was hermaphrodite;<br/>
    But because we observed not human law,<br/>
    Following like unto beasts our appetite,</p>
<p>In our opprobrium by us is read,<br/>
    When we part company, the name of her<br/>
    Who bestialized herself in bestial wood.</p>
<p>Now knowest thou our acts, and what our crime was;<br/>
    Wouldst thou perchance by name know who we are,<br/>
    There is not time to tell, nor could I do it.</p>
<p>Thy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted;<br/>
    I'm Guido Guinicelli, and now purge me,<br/>
    Having repented ere the hour extreme."</p>
<p>The same that in the sadness of Lycurgus<br/>
    Two sons became, their mother re-beholding,<br/>
    Such I became, but rise not to such height,</p>
<p>The moment I heard name himself the father<br/>
    Of me and of my betters, who had ever<br/>
    Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love;</p>
<p>And without speech and hearing thoughtfully<br/>
    For a long time I went, beholding him,<br/>
    Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer.</p>
<p>When I was fed with looking, utterly<br/>
    Myself I offered ready for his service,<br/>
    With affirmation that compels belief.</p>
<p>And he to me: "Thou leavest footprints such<br/>
    In me, from what I hear, and so distinct,<br/>
    Lethe cannot efface them, nor make dim.</p>
<p>But if thy words just now the truth have sworn,<br/>
    Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest<br/>
    In word and look that dear thou holdest me?"</p>
<p>And I to him: "Those dulcet lays of yours<br/>
    Which, long as shall endure our modern fashion,<br/>
    Shall make for ever dear their very ink!"</p>
<p>"O brother," said he, "he whom I point out,"<br/>
    And here he pointed at a spirit in front,<br/>
    "Was of the mother tongue a better smith.</p>
<p>Verses of love and proses of romance,<br/>
    He mastered all; and let the idiots talk,<br/>
    Who think the Lemosin surpasses him.</p>
<p>To clamour more than truth they turn their faces,<br/>
    And in this way establish their opinion,<br/>
    Ere art or reason has by them been heard.</p>
<p>Thus many ancients with Guittone did,<br/>
    From cry to cry still giving him applause,<br/>
    Until the truth has conquered with most persons.</p>
<p>Now, if thou hast such ample privilege<br/>
    'Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister<br/>
    Wherein is Christ the abbot of the college,</p>
<p>To him repeat for me a Paternoster,<br/>
    So far as needful to us of this world,<br/>
    Where power of sinning is no longer ours."</p>
<p>Then, to give place perchance to one behind,<br/>
    Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire<br/>
    As fish in water going to the bottom.</p>
<p>I moved a little tow'rds him pointed out,<br/>
    And said that to his name my own desire<br/>
    An honourable place was making ready.</p>
<p>He of his own free will began to say:<br/>
    'Tan m' abellis vostre cortes deman,<br/>
    Que jeu nom' puesc ni vueill a vos cobrire;</p>
<p>Jeu sui Arnaut, que plor e vai chantan;<br/>
    Consiros vei la passada folor,<br/>
    E vei jauzen lo jorn qu' esper denan.</p>
<p>Ara vus prec per aquella valor,<br/>
    Que vus condus al som de la scalina,<br/>
    Sovenga vus a temprar ma dolor.'*</p>
<p>Then hid him in the fire that purifies them.</p>
<p>* So pleases me your courteous demand,<br/>
    I cannot and I will not hide me from you.<br/>
I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go;<br/>
    Contrite I see the folly of the past,<br/>
    And joyous see the hoped-for day before me.<br/>
Therefore do I implore you, by that power<br/>
    Which guides you to the summit of the stairs,<br/>
    Be mindful to assuage my suffering!</p>

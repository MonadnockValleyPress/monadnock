<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XIX</h3>
<p>It was the hour when the diurnal heat<br/>
    No more can warm the coldness of the moon,<br/>
    Vanquished by earth, or peradventure Saturn,</p>
<p>When geomancers their Fortuna Major<br/>
    See in the orient before the dawn<br/>
    Rise by a path that long remains not dim,</p>
<p>There came to me in dreams a stammering woman,<br/>
    Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,<br/>
    With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.</p>
<p>I looked at her; and as the sun restores<br/>
    The frigid members which the night benumbs,<br/>
    Even thus my gaze did render voluble</p>
<p>Her tongue, and made her all erect thereafter<br/>
    In little while, and the lost countenance<br/>
    As love desires it so in her did colour.</p>
<p>When in this wise she had her speech unloosed,<br/>
    She 'gan to sing so, that with difficulty<br/>
    Could I have turned my thoughts away from her.</p>
<p>"I am," she sang, "I am the Siren sweet<br/>
    Who mariners amid the main unman,<br/>
    So full am I of pleasantness to hear.</p>
<p>I drew Ulysses from his wandering way<br/>
    Unto my song, and he who dwells with me<br/>
    Seldom departs so wholly I content him."</p>
<p>Her mouth was not yet closed again, before<br/>
    Appeared a Lady saintly and alert<br/>
    Close at my side to put her to confusion.</p>
<p>"Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?"<br/>
    Sternly she said; and he was drawing near<br/>
    With eyes still fixed upon that modest one.</p>
<p>She seized the other and in front laid open,<br/>
    Rending her garments, and her belly showed me;<br/>
    This waked me with the stench that issued from it.</p>
<p>I turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said:<br/>
    "At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come;<br/>
    Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter."</p>
<p>I rose; and full already of high day<br/>
    Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain,<br/>
    And with the new sun at our back we went.</p>
<p>Following behind him, I my forehead bore<br/>
    Like unto one who has it laden with thought,<br/>
    Who makes himself the half arch of a bridge,</p>
<p>When I heard say, "Come, here the passage is,"<br/>
    Spoken in a manner gentle and benign,<br/>
    Such as we hear not in this mortal region.</p>
<p>With open wings, which of a swan appeared,<br/>
    Upward he turned us who thus spake to us,<br/>
    Between the two walls of the solid granite.</p>
<p>He moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us,<br/>
    Affirming those 'qui lugent' to be blessed,<br/>
    For they shall have their souls with comfort filled.</p>
<p>"What aileth thee, that aye to earth thou gazest?"<br/>
    To me my Guide began to say, we both<br/>
    Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted.</p>
<p>And I: "With such misgiving makes me go<br/>
    A vision new, which bends me to itself,<br/>
    So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me."</p>
<p>"Didst thou behold," he said, "that old enchantress,<br/>
    Who sole above us henceforth is lamented?<br/>
    Didst thou behold how man is freed from her?</p>
<p>Suffice it thee, and smite earth with thy heels,<br/>
    Thine eyes lift upward to the lure, that whirls<br/>
    The Eternal King with revolutions vast."</p>
<p>Even as the hawk, that first his feet surveys,<br/>
    Then turns him to the call and stretches forward,<br/>
    Through the desire of food that draws him thither,</p>
<p>Such I became, and such, as far as cleaves<br/>
    The rock to give a way to him who mounts,<br/>
    Went on to where the circling doth begin.</p>
<p>On the fifth circle when I had come forth,<br/>
    People I saw upon it who were weeping,<br/>
    Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned.</p>
<p>"Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,"<br/>
    I heard them say with sighings so profound,<br/>
    That hardly could the words be understood.</p>
<p>"O ye elect of God, whose sufferings<br/>
    Justice and Hope both render less severe,<br/>
    Direct ye us towards the high ascents."</p>
<p>"If ye are come secure from this prostration,<br/>
    And wish to find the way most speedily,<br/>
    Let your right hands be evermore outside."</p>
<p>Thus did the Poet ask, and thus was answered<br/>
    By them somewhat in front of us; whence I<br/>
    In what was spoken divined the rest concealed,</p>
<p>And unto my Lord's eyes mine eyes I turned;<br/>
    Whence he assented with a cheerful sign<br/>
    To what the sight of my desire implored.</p>
<p>When of myself I could dispose at will,<br/>
    Above that creature did I draw myself,<br/>
    Whose words before had caused me to take note,</p>
<p>Saying: "O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens<br/>
    That without which to God we cannot turn,<br/>
    Suspend awhile for me thy greater care.</p>
<p>Who wast thou, and why are your backs turned upwards,<br/>
    Tell me, and if thou wouldst that I procure thee<br/>
    Anything there whence living I departed."</p>
<p>And he to me: "Wherefore our backs the heaven<br/>
    Turns to itself, know shalt thou; but beforehand<br/>
    'Scias quod ego fui successor Petri.'</p>
<p>Between Siestri and Chiaveri descends<br/>
    A river beautiful, and of its name<br/>
    The title of my blood its summit makes.</p>
<p>A month and little more essayed I how<br/>
    Weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it,<br/>
    For all the other burdens seem a feather.</p>
<p>Tardy, ah woe is me! was my conversion;<br/>
    But when the Roman Shepherd I was made,<br/>
    Then I discovered life to be a lie.</p>
<p>I saw that there the heart was not at rest,<br/>
    Nor farther in that life could one ascend;<br/>
    Whereby the love of this was kindled in me.</p>
<p>Until that time a wretched soul and parted<br/>
    From God was I, and wholly avaricious;<br/>
    Now, as thou seest, I here am punished for it.</p>
<p>What avarice does is here made manifest<br/>
    In the purgation of these souls converted,<br/>
    And no more bitter pain the Mountain has.</p>
<p>Even as our eye did not uplift itself<br/>
    Aloft, being fastened upon earthly things,<br/>
    So justice here has merged it in the earth.</p>
<p>As avarice had extinguished our affection<br/>
    For every good, whereby was action lost,<br/>
    So justice here doth hold us in restraint,</p>
<p>Bound and imprisoned by the feet and hands;<br/>
    And so long as it pleases the just Lord<br/>
    Shall we remain immovable and prostrate."</p>
<p>I on my knees had fallen, and wished to speak;<br/>
    But even as I began, and he was 'ware,<br/>
    Only by listening, of my reverence,</p>
<p>"What cause," he said, "has downward bent thee thus?"<br/>
    And I to him: "For your own dignity,<br/>
    Standing, my conscience stung me with remorse."</p>
<p>"Straighten thy legs, and upward raise thee, brother,"<br/>
    He answered: "Err not, fellow-servant am I<br/>
    With thee and with the others to one power.</p>
<p>If e'er that holy, evangelic sound,<br/>
    Which sayeth 'neque nubent,' thou hast heard,<br/>
    Well canst thou see why in this wise I speak.</p>
<p>Now go; no longer will I have thee linger,<br/>
    Because thy stay doth incommode my weeping,<br/>
    With which I ripen that which thou hast said.</p>
<p>On earth I have a grandchild named Alagia,<br/>
    Good in herself, unless indeed our house<br/>
    Malevolent may make her by example,</p>
<p>And she alone remains to me on earth."</p>

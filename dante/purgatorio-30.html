<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXX</h3>
<p>When the Septentrion of the highest heaven<br/>
    (Which never either setting knew or rising,<br/>
    Nor veil of other cloud than that of sin,</p>
<p>And which made every one therein aware<br/>
    Of his own duty, as the lower makes<br/>
    Whoever turns the helm to come to port)</p>
<p>Motionless halted, the veracious people,<br/>
    That came at first between it and the Griffin,<br/>
    Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace.</p>
<p>And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned,<br/>
    Singing, "Veni, sponsa, de Libano"<br/>
    Shouted three times, and all the others after.</p>
<p>Even as the Blessed at the final summons<br/>
    Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern,<br/>
    Uplifting light the reinvested flesh,</p>
<p>So upon that celestial chariot<br/>
    A hundred rose 'ad vocem tanti senis,'<br/>
    Ministers and messengers of life eternal.</p>
<p>They all were saying, "Benedictus qui venis,"<br/>
    And, scattering flowers above and round about,<br/>
    "Manibus o date lilia plenis."</p>
<p>Ere now have I beheld, as day began,<br/>
    The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,<br/>
    And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;</p>
<p>And the sun's face, uprising, overshadowed<br/>
    So that by tempering influence of vapours<br/>
    For a long interval the eye sustained it;</p>
<p>Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers<br/>
    Which from those hands angelical ascended,<br/>
    And downward fell again inside and out,</p>
<p>Over her snow-white veil with olive cinct<br/>
    Appeared a lady under a green mantle,<br/>
    Vested in colour of the living flame.</p>
<p>And my own spirit, that already now<br/>
    So long a time had been, that in her presence<br/>
    Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,</p>
<p>Without more knowledge having by mine eyes,<br/>
    Through occult virtue that from her proceeded<br/>
    Of ancient love the mighty influence felt.</p>
<p>As soon as on my vision smote the power<br/>
    Sublime, that had already pierced me through<br/>
    Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,</p>
<p>To the left hand I turned with that reliance<br/>
    With which the little child runs to his mother,<br/>
    When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,</p>
<p>To say unto Virgilius: "Not a drachm<br/>
    Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;<br/>
    I know the traces of the ancient flame."</p>
<p>But us Virgilius of himself deprived<br/>
    Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,<br/>
    Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:</p>
<p>Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother<br/>
    Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,<br/>
    That weeping they should not again be darkened.</p>
<p>"Dante, because Virgilius has departed<br/>
    Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;<br/>
    For by another sword thou need'st must weep."</p>
<p>E'en as an admiral, who on poop and prow<br/>
    Comes to behold the people that are working<br/>
    In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,</p>
<p>Upon the left hand border of the car,<br/>
    When at the sound I turned of my own name,<br/>
    Which of necessity is here recorded,</p>
<p>I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared<br/>
    Veiled underneath the angelic festival,<br/>
    Direct her eyes to me across the river.</p>
<p>Although the veil, that from her head descended,<br/>
    Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,<br/>
    Did not permit her to appear distinctly,</p>
<p>In attitude still royally majestic<br/>
    Continued she, like unto one who speaks,<br/>
    And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:</p>
<p>"Look at me well; in sooth I'm Beatrice!<br/>
    How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?<br/>
    Didst thou not know that man is happy here?"</p>
<p>Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,<br/>
    But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,<br/>
    So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.</p>
<p>As to the son the mother seems superb,<br/>
    So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter<br/>
    Tasteth the savour of severe compassion.</p>
<p>Silent became she, and the Angels sang<br/>
    Suddenly, "In te, Domine, speravi:"<br/>
    But beyond 'pedes meos' did not pass.</p>
<p>Even as the snow among the living rafters<br/>
    Upon the back of Italy congeals,<br/>
    Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,</p>
<p>And then, dissolving, trickles through itself<br/>
    Whene'er the land that loses shadow breathes,<br/>
    So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;</p>
<p>E'en thus was I without a tear or sigh,<br/>
    Before the song of those who sing for ever<br/>
    After the music of the eternal spheres.</p>
<p>But when I heard in their sweet melodies<br/>
    Compassion for me, more than had they said,<br/>
    "O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?"</p>
<p>The ice, that was about my heart congealed,<br/>
    To air and water changed, and in my anguish<br/>
    Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.</p>
<p>She, on the right-hand border of the car<br/>
    Still firmly standing, to those holy beings<br/>
    Thus her discourse directed afterwards:</p>
<p>"Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,<br/>
    So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you<br/>
    One step the ages make upon their path;</p>
<p>Therefore my answer is with greater care,<br/>
    That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,<br/>
    So that the sin and dole be of one measure.</p>
<p>Not only by the work of those great wheels,<br/>
    That destine every seed unto some end,<br/>
    According as the stars are in conjunction,</p>
<p>But by the largess of celestial graces,<br/>
    Which have such lofty vapours for their rain<br/>
    That near to them our sight approaches not,</p>
<p>Such had this man become in his new life<br/>
    Potentially, that every righteous habit<br/>
    Would have made admirable proof in him;</p>
<p>But so much more malignant and more savage<br/>
    Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,<br/>
    The more good earthly vigour it possesses.</p>
<p>Some time did I sustain him with my look;<br/>
    Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,<br/>
    I led him with me turned in the right way.</p>
<p>As soon as ever of my second age<br/>
    I was upon the threshold and changed life,<br/>
    Himself from me he took and gave to others.</p>
<p>When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,<br/>
    And beauty and virtue were in me increased,<br/>
    I was to him less dear and less delightful;</p>
<p>And into ways untrue he turned his steps,<br/>
    Pursuing the false images of good,<br/>
    That never any promises fulfil;</p>
<p>Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,<br/>
    By means of which in dreams and otherwise<br/>
    I called him back, so little did he heed them.</p>
<p>So low he fell, that all appliances<br/>
    For his salvation were already short,<br/>
    Save showing him the people of perdition.</p>
<p>For this I visited the gates of death,<br/>
    And unto him, who so far up has led him,<br/>
    My intercessions were with weeping borne.</p>
<p>God's lofty fiat would be violated,<br/>
    If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands<br/>
    Should tasted be, withouten any scot</p>
<p>Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears."</p>

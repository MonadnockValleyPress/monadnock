<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXIII</h3>
<p>Even as a bird, 'mid the beloved leaves,<br/>
    Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood<br/>
    Throughout the night, that hideth all things from us,</p>
<p>Who, that she may behold their longed-for looks<br/>
    And find the food wherewith to nourish them,<br/>
    In which, to her, grave labours grateful are,</p>
<p>Anticipates the time on open spray<br/>
    And with an ardent longing waits the sun,<br/>
    Gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn:</p>
<p>Even thus my Lady standing was, erect<br/>
    And vigilant, turned round towards the zone<br/>
    Underneath which the sun displays less haste;</p>
<p>So that beholding her distraught and wistful,<br/>
    Such I became as he is who desiring<br/>
    For something yearns, and hoping is appeased.</p>
<p>But brief the space from one When to the other;<br/>
    Of my awaiting, say I, and the seeing<br/>
    The welkin grow resplendent more and more.</p>
<p>And Beatrice exclaimed: "Behold the hosts<br/>
    Of Christ's triumphal march, and all the fruit<br/>
    Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!"</p>
<p>It seemed to me her face was all aflame;<br/>
    And eyes she had so full of ecstasy<br/>
    That I must needs pass on without describing.</p>
<p>As when in nights serene of the full moon<br/>
    Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal<br/>
    Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs,</p>
<p>Saw I, above the myriads of lamps,<br/>
    A Sun that one and all of them enkindled,<br/>
    E'en as our own doth the supernal sights,</p>
<p>And through the living light transparent shone<br/>
    The lucent substance so intensely clear<br/>
    Into my sight, that I sustained it not.</p>
<p>O Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear!<br/>
    To me she said: "What overmasters thee<br/>
    A virtue is from which naught shields itself.</p>
<p>There are the wisdom and the omnipotence<br/>
    That oped the thoroughfares 'twixt heaven and earth,<br/>
    For which there erst had been so long a yearning."</p>
<p>As fire from out a cloud unlocks itself,<br/>
    Dilating so it finds not room therein,<br/>
    And down, against its nature, falls to earth,</p>
<p>So did my mind, among those aliments<br/>
    Becoming larger, issue from itself,<br/>
    And that which it became cannot remember.</p>
<p>"Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:<br/>
    Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough<br/>
    Hast thou become to tolerate my smile."</p>
<p>I was as one who still retains the feeling<br/>
    Of a forgotten vision, and endeavours<br/>
    In vain to bring it back into his mind,</p>
<p>When I this invitation heard, deserving<br/>
    Of so much gratitude, it never fades<br/>
    Out of the book that chronicles the past.</p>
<p>If at this moment sounded all the tongues<br/>
    That Polyhymnia and her sisters made<br/>
    Most lubrical with their delicious milk,</p>
<p>To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth<br/>
    It would not reach, singing the holy smile<br/>
    And how the holy aspect it illumed.</p>
<p>And therefore, representing Paradise,<br/>
    The sacred poem must perforce leap over,<br/>
    Even as a man who finds his way cut off;</p>
<p>But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,<br/>
    And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,<br/>
    Should blame it not, if under this it tremble.</p>
<p>It is no passage for a little boat<br/>
    This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,<br/>
    Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.</p>
<p>"Why doth my face so much enamour thee,<br/>
    That to the garden fair thou turnest not,<br/>
    Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?</p>
<p>There is the Rose in which the Word Divine<br/>
    Became incarnate; there the lilies are<br/>
    By whose perfume the good way was discovered."</p>
<p>Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels<br/>
    Was wholly ready, once again betook me<br/>
    Unto the battle of the feeble brows.</p>
<p>As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams<br/>
    Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers<br/>
    Mine eyes with shadow covered o'er have seen,</p>
<p>So troops of splendours manifold I saw<br/>
    Illumined from above with burning rays,<br/>
    Beholding not the source of the effulgence.</p>
<p>O power benignant that dost so imprint them!<br/>
    Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope<br/>
    There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough.</p>
<p>The name of that fair flower I e'er invoke<br/>
    Morning and evening utterly enthralled<br/>
    My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.</p>
<p>And when in both mine eyes depicted were<br/>
    The glory and greatness of the living star<br/>
    Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,</p>
<p>Athwart the heavens a little torch descended<br/>
    Formed in a circle like a coronal,<br/>
    And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it.</p>
<p>Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth<br/>
    On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,<br/>
    Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,</p>
<p>Compared unto the sounding of that lyre<br/>
    Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,<br/>
    Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.</p>
<p>"I am Angelic Love, that circle round<br/>
    The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb<br/>
    That was the hostelry of our Desire;</p>
<p>And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while<br/>
    Thou followest thy Son, and mak'st diviner<br/>
    The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there."</p>
<p>Thus did the circulated melody<br/>
    Seal itself up; and all the other lights<br/>
    Were making to resound the name of Mary.</p>
<p>The regal mantle of the volumes all<br/>
    Of that world, which most fervid is and living<br/>
    With breath of God and with his works and ways,</p>
<p>Extended over us its inner border,<br/>
    So very distant, that the semblance of it<br/>
    There where I was not yet appeared to me.</p>
<p>Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power<br/>
    Of following the incoronated flame,<br/>
    Which mounted upward near to its own seed.</p>
<p>And as a little child, that towards its mother<br/>
    Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,<br/>
    Through impulse kindled into outward flame,</p>
<p>Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached<br/>
    So with its summit, that the deep affection<br/>
    They had for Mary was revealed to me.</p>
<p>Thereafter they remained there in my sight,<br/>
    'Regina coeli' singing with such sweetness,<br/>
    That ne'er from me has the delight departed.</p>
<p>O, what exuberance is garnered up<br/>
    Within those richest coffers, which had been<br/>
    Good husbandmen for sowing here below!</p>
<p>There they enjoy and live upon the treasure<br/>
    Which was acquired while weeping in the exile<br/>
    Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left.</p>
<p>There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son<br/>
    Of God and Mary, in his victory,<br/>
    Both with the ancient council and the new,</p>
<p>He who doth keep the keys of such a glory.</p>

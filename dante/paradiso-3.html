<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto III</h3>
<p>That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,<br/>
    Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,<br/>
    By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.</p>
<p>And, that I might confess myself convinced<br/>
    And confident, so far as was befitting,<br/>
    I lifted more erect my head to speak.</p>
<p>But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me<br/>
    So close to it, in order to be seen,<br/>
    That my confession I remembered not.</p>
<p>Such as through polished and transparent glass,<br/>
    Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,<br/>
    But not so deep as that their bed be lost,</p>
<p>Come back again the outlines of our faces<br/>
    So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white<br/>
    Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;</p>
<p>Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,<br/>
    So that I ran in error opposite<br/>
    To that which kindled love 'twixt man and fountain.</p>
<p>As soon as I became aware of them,<br/>
    Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,<br/>
    To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,</p>
<p>And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward<br/>
    Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,<br/>
    Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.</p>
<p>"Marvel thou not," she said to me, "because<br/>
    I smile at this thy puerile conceit,<br/>
    Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,</p>
<p>But turns thee, as 'tis wont, on emptiness.<br/>
    True substances are these which thou beholdest,<br/>
    Here relegate for breaking of some vow.</p>
<p>Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;<br/>
    For the true light, which giveth peace to them,<br/>
    Permits them not to turn from it their feet."</p>
<p>And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful<br/>
    To speak directed me, and I began,<br/>
    As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:</p>
<p>"O well-created spirit, who in the rays<br/>
    Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste<br/>
    Which being untasted ne'er is comprehended,</p>
<p>Grateful 'twill be to me, if thou content me<br/>
    Both with thy name and with your destiny."<br/>
    Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:</p>
<p>"Our charity doth never shut the doors<br/>
    Against a just desire, except as one<br/>
    Who wills that all her court be like herself.</p>
<p>I was a virgin sister in the world;<br/>
    And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,<br/>
    The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,</p>
<p>But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,<br/>
    Who, stationed here among these other blessed,<br/>
    Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.</p>
<p>All our affections, that alone inflamed<br/>
    Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,<br/>
    Rejoice at being of his order formed;</p>
<p>And this allotment, which appears so low,<br/>
    Therefore is given us, because our vows<br/>
    Have been neglected and in some part void."</p>
<p>Whence I to her: "In your miraculous aspects<br/>
    There shines I know not what of the divine,<br/>
    Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.</p>
<p>Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;<br/>
    But what thou tellest me now aids me so,<br/>
    That the refiguring is easier to me.</p>
<p>But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,<br/>
    Are you desirous of a higher place,<br/>
    To see more or to make yourselves more friends?"</p>
<p>First with those other shades she smiled a little;<br/>
    Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,<br/>
    She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:</p>
<p>"Brother, our will is quieted by virtue<br/>
    Of charity, that makes us wish alone<br/>
    For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.</p>
<p>If to be more exalted we aspired,<br/>
    Discordant would our aspirations be<br/>
    Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;</p>
<p>Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,<br/>
    If being in charity is needful here,<br/>
    And if thou lookest well into its nature;</p>
<p>Nay, 'tis essential to this blest existence<br/>
    To keep itself within the will divine,<br/>
    Whereby our very wishes are made one;</p>
<p>So that, as we are station above station<br/>
    Throughout this realm, to all the realm 'tis pleasing,<br/>
    As to the King, who makes his will our will.</p>
<p>And his will is our peace; this is the sea<br/>
    To which is moving onward whatsoever<br/>
    It doth create, and all that nature makes."</p>
<p>Then it was clear to me how everywhere<br/>
    In heaven is Paradise, although the grace<br/>
    Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.</p>
<p>But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,<br/>
    And for another still remains the longing,<br/>
    We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,</p>
<p>E'en thus did I; with gesture and with word,<br/>
    To learn from her what was the web wherein<br/>
    She did not ply the shuttle to the end.</p>
<p>"A perfect life and merit high in-heaven<br/>
    A lady o'er us," said she, "by whose rule<br/>
    Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,</p>
<p>That until death they may both watch and sleep<br/>
    Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts<br/>
    Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.</p>
<p>To follow her, in girlhood from the world<br/>
    I fled, and in her habit shut myself,<br/>
    And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.</p>
<p>Then men accustomed unto evil more<br/>
    Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;<br/>
    God knows what afterward my life became.</p>
<p>This other splendour, which to thee reveals<br/>
    Itself on my right side, and is enkindled<br/>
    With all the illumination of our sphere,</p>
<p>What of myself I say applies to her;<br/>
    A nun was she, and likewise from her head<br/>
    Was ta'en the shadow of the sacred wimple.</p>
<p>But when she too was to the world returned<br/>
    Against her wishes and against good usage,<br/>
    Of the heart's veil she never was divested.</p>
<p>Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,<br/>
    Who from the second wind of Suabia<br/>
    Brought forth the third and latest puissance."</p>
<p>Thus unto me she spake, and then began<br/>
    "Ave Maria" singing, and in singing<br/>
    Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.</p>
<p>My sight, that followed her as long a time<br/>
    As it was possible, when it had lost her<br/>
    Turned round unto the mark of more desire,</p>
<p>And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;<br/>
    But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,<br/>
    That at the first my sight endured it not;</p>
<p>And this in questioning more backward made me.</p>

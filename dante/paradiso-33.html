<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXXIII</h3>
<p>"Thou Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son,<br/>
    Humble and high beyond all other creature,<br/>
    The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,</p>
<p>Thou art the one who such nobility<br/>
    To human nature gave, that its Creator<br/>
    Did not disdain to make himself its creature.</p>
<p>Within thy womb rekindled was the love,<br/>
    By heat of which in the eternal peace<br/>
    After such wise this flower has germinated.</p>
<p>Here unto us thou art a noonday torch<br/>
    Of charity, and below there among mortals<br/>
    Thou art the living fountain-head of hope.</p>
<p>Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,<br/>
    That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,<br/>
    His aspirations without wings would fly.</p>
<p>Not only thy benignity gives succour<br/>
    To him who asketh it, but oftentimes<br/>
    Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.</p>
<p>In thee compassion is, in thee is pity,<br/>
    In thee magnificence; in thee unites<br/>
    Whate'er of goodness is in any creature.</p>
<p>Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth<br/>
    Of the universe as far as here has seen<br/>
    One after one the spiritual lives,</p>
<p>Supplicate thee through grace for so much power<br/>
    That with his eyes he may uplift himself<br/>
    Higher towards the uttermost salvation.</p>
<p>And I, who never burned for my own seeing<br/>
    More than I do for his, all of my prayers<br/>
    Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,</p>
<p>That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud<br/>
    Of his mortality so with thy prayers,<br/>
    That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.</p>
<p>Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst<br/>
    Whate'er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve<br/>
    After so great a vision his affections.</p>
<p>Let thy protection conquer human movements;<br/>
    See Beatrice and all the blessed ones<br/>
    My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!"</p>
<p>The eyes beloved and revered of God,<br/>
    Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us<br/>
    How grateful unto her are prayers devout;</p>
<p>Then unto the Eternal Light they turned,<br/>
    On which it is not credible could be<br/>
    By any creature bent an eye so clear.</p>
<p>And I, who to the end of all desires<br/>
    Was now approaching, even as I ought<br/>
    The ardour of desire within me ended.</p>
<p>Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,<br/>
    That I should upward look; but I already<br/>
    Was of my own accord such as he wished;</p>
<p>Because my sight, becoming purified,<br/>
    Was entering more and more into the ray<br/>
    Of the High Light which of itself is true.</p>
<p>From that time forward what I saw was greater<br/>
    Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,<br/>
    And yields the memory unto such excess.</p>
<p>Even as he is who seeth in a dream,<br/>
    And after dreaming the imprinted passion<br/>
    Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,</p>
<p>Even such am I, for almost utterly<br/>
    Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet<br/>
    Within my heart the sweetness born of it;</p>
<p>Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,<br/>
    Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves<br/>
    Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.</p>
<p>O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee<br/>
    From the conceits of mortals, to my mind<br/>
    Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,</p>
<p>And make my tongue of so great puissance,<br/>
    That but a single sparkle of thy glory<br/>
    It may bequeath unto the future people;</p>
<p>For by returning to my memory somewhat,<br/>
    And by a little sounding in these verses,<br/>
    More of thy victory shall be conceived!</p>
<p>I think the keenness of the living ray<br/>
    Which I endured would have bewildered me,<br/>
    If but mine eyes had been averted from it;</p>
<p>And I remember that I was more bold<br/>
    On this account to bear, so that I joined<br/>
    My aspect with the Glory Infinite.</p>
<p>O grace abundant, by which I presumed<br/>
    To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,<br/>
    So that the seeing I consumed therein!</p>
<p>I saw that in its depth far down is lying<br/>
    Bound up with love together in one volume,<br/>
    What through the universe in leaves is scattered;</p>
<p>Substance, and accident, and their operations,<br/>
    All interfused together in such wise<br/>
    That what I speak of is one simple light.</p>
<p>The universal fashion of this knot<br/>
    Methinks I saw, since more abundantly<br/>
    In saying this I feel that I rejoice.</p>
<p>One moment is more lethargy to me,<br/>
    Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise<br/>
    That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!</p>
<p>My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,<br/>
    Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,<br/>
    And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.</p>
<p>In presence of that light one such becomes,<br/>
    That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect<br/>
    It is impossible he e'er consent;</p>
<p>Because the good, which object is of will,<br/>
    Is gathered all in this, and out of it<br/>
    That is defective which is perfect there.</p>
<p>Shorter henceforward will my language fall<br/>
    Of what I yet remember, than an infant's<br/>
    Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.</p>
<p>Not because more than one unmingled semblance<br/>
    Was in the living light on which I looked,<br/>
    For it is always what it was before;</p>
<p>But through the sight, that fortified itself<br/>
    In me by looking, one appearance only<br/>
    To me was ever changing as I changed.</p>
<p>Within the deep and luminous subsistence<br/>
    Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,<br/>
    Of threefold colour and of one dimension,</p>
<p>And by the second seemed the first reflected<br/>
    As Iris is by Iris, and the third<br/>
    Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.</p>
<p>O how all speech is feeble and falls short<br/>
    Of my conceit, and this to what I saw<br/>
    Is such, 'tis not enough to call it little!</p>
<p>O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,<br/>
    Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself<br/>
    And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!</p>
<p>That circulation, which being thus conceived<br/>
    Appeared in thee as a reflected light,<br/>
    When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,</p>
<p>Within itself, of its own very colour<br/>
    Seemed to me painted with our effigy,<br/>
    Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.</p>
<p>As the geometrician, who endeavours<br/>
    To square the circle, and discovers not,<br/>
    By taking thought, the principle he wants,</p>
<p>Even such was I at that new apparition;<br/>
    I wished to see how the image to the circle<br/>
    Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;</p>
<p>But my own wings were not enough for this,<br/>
    Had it not been that then my mind there smote<br/>
    A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.</p>
<p>Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:<br/>
    But now was turning my desire and will,<br/>
    Even as a wheel that equally is moved,</p>
<p>The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.</p>
<p>THE END</p>

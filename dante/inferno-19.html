<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XIX</h3>
<p>O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,<br/>
    Ye who the things of God, which ought to be<br/>
    The brides of holiness, rapaciously</p>
<p>For silver and for gold do prostitute,<br/>
    Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,<br/>
    Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.</p>
<p>We had already on the following tomb<br/>
    Ascended to that portion of the crag<br/>
    Which o'er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.</p>
<p>Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest<br/>
    In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,<br/>
    And with what justice doth thy power distribute!</p>
<p>I saw upon the sides and on the bottom<br/>
    The livid stone with perforations filled,<br/>
    All of one size, and every one was round.</p>
<p>To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater<br/>
    Than those that in my beautiful Saint John<br/>
    Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,</p>
<p>And one of which, not many years ago,<br/>
    I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;<br/>
    Be this a seal all men to undeceive.</p>
<p>Out of the mouth of each one there protruded<br/>
    The feet of a transgressor, and the legs<br/>
    Up to the calf, the rest within remained.</p>
<p>In all of them the soles were both on fire;<br/>
    Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,<br/>
    They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.</p>
<p>Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont<br/>
    To move upon the outer surface only,<br/>
    So likewise was it there from heel to point.</p>
<p>"Master, who is that one who writhes himself,<br/>
    More than his other comrades quivering,"<br/>
    I said, "and whom a redder flame is sucking?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "If thou wilt have me bear thee<br/>
    Down there along that bank which lowest lies,<br/>
    From him thou'lt know his errors and himself."</p>
<p>And I: "What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;<br/>
    Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not<br/>
    From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken."</p>
<p>Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;<br/>
    We turned, and on the left-hand side descended<br/>
    Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.</p>
<p>And the good Master yet from off his haunch<br/>
    Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me<br/>
    Of him who so lamented with his shanks.</p>
<p>"Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down,<br/>
    O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,"<br/>
    To say began I, "if thou canst, speak out."</p>
<p>I stood even as the friar who is confessing<br/>
    The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,<br/>
    Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.</p>
<p>And he cried out: "Dost thou stand there already,<br/>
    Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?<br/>
    By many years the record lied to me.</p>
<p>Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,<br/>
    For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud<br/>
    The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?"</p>
<p>Such I became, as people are who stand,<br/>
    Not comprehending what is answered them,<br/>
    As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.</p>
<p>Then said Virgilius: "Say to him straightway,<br/>
    'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'"<br/>
    And I replied as was imposed on me.</p>
<p>Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,<br/>
    Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation<br/>
    Said to me: "Then what wantest thou of me?</p>
<p>If who I am thou carest so much to know,<br/>
    That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,<br/>
    Know that I vested was with the great mantle;</p>
<p>And truly was I son of the She-bear,<br/>
    So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth<br/>
    Above, and here myself, I pocketed.</p>
<p>Beneath my head the others are dragged down<br/>
    Who have preceded me in simony,<br/>
    Flattened along the fissure of the rock.</p>
<p>Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever<br/>
    That one shall come who I believed thou wast,<br/>
    What time the sudden question I proposed.</p>
<p>But longer I my feet already toast,<br/>
    And here have been in this way upside down,<br/>
    Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;</p>
<p>For after him shall come of fouler deed<br/>
    From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,<br/>
    Such as befits to cover him and me.</p>
<p>New Jason will he be, of whom we read<br/>
    In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,<br/>
    So he who governs France shall be to this one."</p>
<p>I do not know if I were here too bold,<br/>
    That him I answered only in this metre:<br/>
    "I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure</p>
<p>Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,<br/>
    Before he put the keys into his keeping?<br/>
    Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'</p>
<p>Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias<br/>
    Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen<br/>
    Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.</p>
<p>Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,<br/>
    And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,<br/>
    Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.</p>
<p>And were it not that still forbids it me<br/>
    The reverence for the keys superlative<br/>
    Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,</p>
<p>I would make use of words more grievous still;<br/>
    Because your avarice afflicts the world,<br/>
    Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.</p>
<p>The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,<br/>
    When she who sitteth upon many waters<br/>
    To fornicate with kings by him was seen;</p>
<p>The same who with the seven heads was born,<br/>
    And power and strength from the ten horns received,<br/>
    So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.</p>
<p>Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;<br/>
    And from the idolater how differ ye,<br/>
    Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?</p>
<p>Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,<br/>
    Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower<br/>
    Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!"</p>
<p>And while I sang to him such notes as these,<br/>
    Either that anger or that conscience stung him,<br/>
    He struggled violently with both his feet.</p>
<p>I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,<br/>
    With such contented lip he listened ever<br/>
    Unto the sound of the true words expressed.</p>
<p>Therefore with both his arms he took me up,<br/>
    And when he had me all upon his breast,<br/>
    Remounted by the way where he descended.</p>
<p>Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;<br/>
    But bore me to the summit of the arch<br/>
    Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.</p>
<p>There tenderly he laid his burden down,<br/>
    Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,<br/>
    That would have been hard passage for the goats:</p>
<p>Thence was unveiled to me another valley.</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XIII</h3>
<p>Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,<br/>
    When we had put ourselves within a wood,<br/>
    That was not marked by any path whatever.</p>
<p>Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,<br/>
    Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,<br/>
    Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.</p>
<p>Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,<br/>
    Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold<br/>
    'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.</p>
<p>There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,<br/>
    Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,<br/>
    With sad announcement of impending doom;</p>
<p>Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,<br/>
    And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;<br/>
    They make laments upon the wondrous trees.</p>
<p>And the good Master: "Ere thou enter farther,<br/>
    Know that thou art within the second round,"<br/>
    Thus he began to say, "and shalt be, till</p>
<p>Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;<br/>
    Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see<br/>
    Things that will credence give unto my speech."</p>
<p>I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,<br/>
    And person none beheld I who might make them,<br/>
    Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.</p>
<p>I think he thought that I perhaps might think<br/>
    So many voices issued through those trunks<br/>
    From people who concealed themselves from us;</p>
<p>Therefore the Master said: "If thou break off<br/>
    Some little spray from any of these trees,<br/>
    The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain."</p>
<p>Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,<br/>
    And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;<br/>
    And the trunk cried, "Why dost thou mangle me?"</p>
<p>After it had become embrowned with blood,<br/>
    It recommenced its cry: "Why dost thou rend me?<br/>
    Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?</p>
<p>Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;<br/>
    Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,<br/>
    Even if the souls of serpents we had been."</p>
<p>As out of a green brand, that is on fire<br/>
    At one of the ends, and from the other drips<br/>
    And hisses with the wind that is escaping;</p>
<p>So from that splinter issued forth together<br/>
    Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip<br/>
    Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.</p>
<p>"Had he been able sooner to believe,"<br/>
    My Sage made answer, "O thou wounded soul,<br/>
    What only in my verses he has seen,</p>
<p>Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;<br/>
    Whereas the thing incredible has caused me<br/>
    To put him to an act which grieveth me.</p>
<p>But tell him who thou wast, so that by way<br/>
    Of some amends thy fame he may refresh<br/>
    Up in the world, to which he can return."</p>
<p>And the trunk said: "So thy sweet words allure me,<br/>
    I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,<br/>
    That I a little to discourse am tempted.</p>
<p>I am the one who both keys had in keeping<br/>
    Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro<br/>
    So softly in unlocking and in locking,</p>
<p>That from his secrets most men I withheld;<br/>
    Fidelity I bore the glorious office<br/>
    So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.</p>
<p>The courtesan who never from the dwelling<br/>
    Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,<br/>
    Death universal and the vice of courts,</p>
<p>Inflamed against me all the other minds,<br/>
    And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,<br/>
    That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.</p>
<p>My spirit, in disdainful exultation,<br/>
    Thinking by dying to escape disdain,<br/>
    Made me unjust against myself, the just.</p>
<p>I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,<br/>
    Do swear to you that never broke I faith<br/>
    Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;</p>
<p>And to the world if one of you return,<br/>
    Let him my memory comfort, which is lying<br/>
    Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it."</p>
<p>Waited awhile, and then: "Since he is silent,"<br/>
    The Poet said to me, "lose not the time,<br/>
    But speak, and question him, if more may please thee."</p>
<p>Whence I to him: "Do thou again inquire<br/>
    Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;<br/>
    For I cannot, such pity is in my heart."</p>
<p>Therefore he recommenced: "So may the man<br/>
    Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,<br/>
    Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased</p>
<p>To tell us in what way the soul is bound<br/>
    Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,<br/>
    If any from such members e'er is freed."</p>
<p>Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward<br/>
    The wind was into such a voice converted:<br/>
    "With brevity shall be replied to you.</p>
<p>When the exasperated soul abandons<br/>
    The body whence it rent itself away,<br/>
    Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.</p>
<p>It falls into the forest, and no part<br/>
    Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,<br/>
    There like a grain of spelt it germinates.</p>
<p>It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;<br/>
    The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,<br/>
    Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.</p>
<p>Like others for our spoils shall we return;<br/>
    But not that any one may them revest,<br/>
    For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.</p>
<p>Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal<br/>
    Forest our bodies shall suspended be,<br/>
    Each to the thorn of his molested shade."</p>
<p>We were attentive still unto the trunk,<br/>
    Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,<br/>
    When by a tumult we were overtaken,</p>
<p>In the same way as he is who perceives<br/>
    The boar and chase approaching to his stand,<br/>
    Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;</p>
<p>And two behold! upon our left-hand side,<br/>
    Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,<br/>
    That of the forest, every fan they broke.</p>
<p>He who was in advance: "Now help, Death, help!"<br/>
    And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,<br/>
    Was shouting: "Lano, were not so alert</p>
<p>Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!"<br/>
    And then, perchance because his breath was failing,<br/>
    He grouped himself together with a bush.</p>
<p>Behind them was the forest full of black<br/>
    She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot<br/>
    As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.</p>
<p>On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,<br/>
    And him they lacerated piece by piece,<br/>
    Thereafter bore away those aching members.</p>
<p>Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,<br/>
    And led me to the bush, that all in vain<br/>
    Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.</p>
<p>"O Jacopo," it said, "of Sant' Andrea,<br/>
    What helped it thee of me to make a screen?<br/>
    What blame have I in thy nefarious life?"</p>
<p>When near him had the Master stayed his steps,<br/>
    He said: "Who wast thou, that through wounds so many<br/>
    Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?"</p>
<p>And he to us: "O souls, that hither come<br/>
    To look upon the shameful massacre<br/>
    That has so rent away from me my leaves,</p>
<p>Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;<br/>
    I of that city was which to the Baptist<br/>
    Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this</p>
<p>Forever with his art will make it sad.<br/>
    And were it not that on the pass of Arno<br/>
    Some glimpses of him are remaining still,</p>
<p>Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it<br/>
    Upon the ashes left by Attila,<br/>
    In vain had caused their labour to be done.</p>
<p>Of my own house I made myself a gibbet."</p>

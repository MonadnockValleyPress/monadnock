<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXXIII</h3>
<p>His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,<br/>
    That sinner, wiping it upon the hair<br/>
    Of the same head that he behind had wasted.</p>
<p>Then he began: "Thou wilt that I renew<br/>
    The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already<br/>
    To think of only, ere I speak of it;</p>
<p>But if my words be seed that may bear fruit<br/>
    Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,<br/>
    Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.</p>
<p>I know not who thou art, nor by what mode<br/>
    Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine<br/>
    Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.</p>
<p>Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,<br/>
    And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;<br/>
    Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.</p>
<p>That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,<br/>
    Trusting in him I was made prisoner,<br/>
    And after put to death, I need not say;</p>
<p>But ne'ertheless what thou canst not have heard,<br/>
    That is to say, how cruel was my death,<br/>
    Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.</p>
<p>A narrow perforation in the mew,<br/>
    Which bears because of me the title of Famine,<br/>
    And in which others still must be locked up,</p>
<p>Had shown me through its opening many moons<br/>
    Already, when I dreamed the evil dream<br/>
    Which of the future rent for me the veil.</p>
<p>This one appeared to me as lord and master,<br/>
    Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain<br/>
    For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.</p>
<p>With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,<br/>
    Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi<br/>
    He had sent out before him to the front.</p>
<p>After brief course seemed unto me forespent<br/>
    The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes<br/>
    It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.</p>
<p>When I before the morrow was awake,<br/>
    Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons<br/>
    Who with me were, and asking after bread.</p>
<p>Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,<br/>
    Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,<br/>
    And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?</p>
<p>They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh<br/>
    At which our food used to be brought to us,<br/>
    And through his dream was each one apprehensive;</p>
<p>And I heard locking up the under door<br/>
    Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word<br/>
    I gazed into the faces of my sons.</p>
<p>I wept not, I within so turned to stone;<br/>
    They wept; and darling little Anselm mine<br/>
    Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'</p>
<p>Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made<br/>
    All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,<br/>
    Until another sun rose on the world.</p>
<p>As now a little glimmer made its way<br/>
    Into the dolorous prison, and I saw<br/>
    Upon four faces my own very aspect,</p>
<p>Both of my hands in agony I bit;<br/>
    And, thinking that I did it from desire<br/>
    Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,</p>
<p>And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us<br/>
    If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us<br/>
    With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'</p>
<p>I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.<br/>
    That day we all were silent, and the next.<br/>
    Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?</p>
<p>When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo<br/>
    Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,<br/>
    Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?'</p>
<p>And there he died; and, as thou seest me,<br/>
    I saw the three fall, one by one, between<br/>
    The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,</p>
<p>Already blind, to groping over each,<br/>
    And three days called them after they were dead;<br/>
    Then hunger did what sorrow could not do."</p>
<p>When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,<br/>
    The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,<br/>
    Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.</p>
<p>Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people<br/>
    Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,<br/>
    Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,</p>
<p>Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,<br/>
    And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno<br/>
    That every person in thee it may drown!</p>
<p>For if Count Ugolino had the fame<br/>
    Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,<br/>
    Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.</p>
<p>Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!<br/>
    Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,<br/>
    And the other two my song doth name above!</p>
<p>We passed still farther onward, where the ice<br/>
    Another people ruggedly enswathes,<br/>
    Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.</p>
<p>Weeping itself there does not let them weep,<br/>
    And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes<br/>
    Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;</p>
<p>Because the earliest tears a cluster form,<br/>
    And, in the manner of a crystal visor,<br/>
    Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.</p>
<p>And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,<br/>
    Because of cold all sensibility<br/>
    Its station had abandoned in my face,</p>
<p>Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;<br/>
    Whence I: "My Master, who sets this in motion?<br/>
    Is not below here every vapour quenched?"</p>
<p>Whence he to me: "Full soon shalt thou be where<br/>
    Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,<br/>
    Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast."</p>
<p>And one of the wretches of the frozen crust<br/>
    Cried out to us: "O souls so merciless<br/>
    That the last post is given unto you,</p>
<p>Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I<br/>
    May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart<br/>
    A little, e'er the weeping recongeal."</p>
<p>Whence I to him: "If thou wouldst have me help thee<br/>
    Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,<br/>
    May I go to the bottom of the ice."</p>
<p>Then he replied: "I am Friar Alberigo;<br/>
    He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,<br/>
    Who here a date am getting for my fig."</p>
<p>"O," said I to him, "now art thou, too, dead?"<br/>
    And he to me: "How may my body fare<br/>
    Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.</p>
<p>Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,<br/>
    That oftentimes the soul descendeth here<br/>
    Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.</p>
<p>And, that thou mayest more willingly remove<br/>
    From off my countenance these glassy tears,<br/>
    Know that as soon as any soul betrays</p>
<p>As I have done, his body by a demon<br/>
    Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,<br/>
    Until his time has wholly been revolved.</p>
<p>Itself down rushes into such a cistern;<br/>
    And still perchance above appears the body<br/>
    Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.</p>
<p>This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;<br/>
    It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years<br/>
    Have passed away since he was thus locked up."</p>
<p>"I think," said I to him, "thou dost deceive me;<br/>
    For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet,<br/>
    And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes."</p>
<p>"In moat above," said he, "of Malebranche,<br/>
    There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,<br/>
    As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,</p>
<p>When this one left a devil in his stead<br/>
    In his own body and one near of kin,<br/>
    Who made together with him the betrayal.</p>
<p>But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,<br/>
    Open mine eyes;"&mdash;and open them I did not,<br/>
    And to be rude to him was courtesy.</p>
<p>Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance<br/>
    With every virtue, full of every vice<br/>
    Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?</p>
<p>For with the vilest spirit of Romagna<br/>
    I found of you one such, who for his deeds<br/>
    In soul already in Cocytus bathes,</p>
<p>And still above in body seems alive!</p>

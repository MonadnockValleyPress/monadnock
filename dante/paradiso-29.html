<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXIX</h3>
<p>At what time both the children of Latona,<br/>
    Surmounted by the Ram and by the Scales,<br/>
    Together make a zone of the horizon,</p>
<p>As long as from the time the zenith holds them<br/>
    In equipoise, till from that girdle both<br/>
    Changing their hemisphere disturb the balance,</p>
<p>So long, her face depicted with a smile,<br/>
    Did Beatrice keep silence while she gazed<br/>
    Fixedly at the point which had o'ercome me.</p>
<p>Then she began: "I say, and I ask not<br/>
    What thou dost wish to hear, for I have seen it<br/>
    Where centres every When and every 'Ubi.'</p>
<p>Not to acquire some good unto himself,<br/>
    Which is impossible, but that his splendour<br/>
    In its resplendency may say, 'Subsisto,'</p>
<p>In his eternity outside of time,<br/>
    Outside all other limits, as it pleased him,<br/>
    Into new Loves the Eternal Love unfolded.</p>
<p>Nor as if torpid did he lie before;<br/>
    For neither after nor before proceeded<br/>
    The going forth of God upon these waters.</p>
<p>Matter and Form unmingled and conjoined<br/>
    Came into being that had no defect,<br/>
    E'en as three arrows from a three-stringed bow.</p>
<p>And as in glass, in amber, or in crystal<br/>
    A sunbeam flashes so, that from its coming<br/>
    To its full being is no interval,</p>
<p>So from its Lord did the triform effect<br/>
    Ray forth into its being all together,<br/>
    Without discrimination of beginning.</p>
<p>Order was con-created and constructed<br/>
    In substances, and summit of the world<br/>
    Were those wherein the pure act was produced.</p>
<p>Pure potentiality held the lowest part;<br/>
    Midway bound potentiality with act<br/>
    Such bond that it shall never be unbound.</p>
<p>Jerome has written unto you of angels<br/>
    Created a long lapse of centuries<br/>
    Or ever yet the other world was made;</p>
<p>But written is this truth in many places<br/>
    By writers of the Holy Ghost, and thou<br/>
    Shalt see it, if thou lookest well thereat.</p>
<p>And even reason seeth it somewhat,<br/>
    For it would not concede that for so long<br/>
    Could be the motors without their perfection.</p>
<p>Now dost thou know both where and when these Loves<br/>
    Created were, and how; so that extinct<br/>
    In thy desire already are three fires.</p>
<p>Nor could one reach, in counting, unto twenty<br/>
    So swiftly, as a portion of these angels<br/>
    Disturbed the subject of your elements.</p>
<p>The rest remained, and they began this art<br/>
    Which thou discernest, with so great delight<br/>
    That never from their circling do they cease.</p>
<p>The occasion of the fall was the accursed<br/>
    Presumption of that One, whom thou hast seen<br/>
    By all the burden of the world constrained.</p>
<p>Those whom thou here beholdest modest were<br/>
    To recognise themselves as of that goodness<br/>
    Which made them apt for so much understanding;</p>
<p>On which account their vision was exalted<br/>
    By the enlightening grace and their own merit,<br/>
    So that they have a full and steadfast will.</p>
<p>I would not have thee doubt, but certain be,<br/>
    'Tis meritorious to receive this grace,<br/>
    According as the affection opens to it.</p>
<p>Now round about in this consistory<br/>
    Much mayst thou contemplate, if these my words<br/>
    Be gathered up, without all further aid.</p>
<p>But since upon the earth, throughout your schools,<br/>
    They teach that such is the angelic nature<br/>
    That it doth hear, and recollect, and will,</p>
<p>More will I say, that thou mayst see unmixed<br/>
    The truth that is confounded there below,<br/>
    Equivocating in such like prelections.</p>
<p>These substances, since in God's countenance<br/>
    They jocund were, turned not away their sight<br/>
    From that wherefrom not anything is hidden;</p>
<p>Hence they have not their vision intercepted<br/>
    By object new, and hence they do not need<br/>
    To recollect, through interrupted thought.</p>
<p>So that below, not sleeping, people dream,<br/>
    Believing they speak truth, and not believing;<br/>
    And in the last is greater sin and shame.</p>
<p>Below you do not journey by one path<br/>
    Philosophising; so transporteth you<br/>
    Love of appearance and the thought thereof.</p>
<p>And even this above here is endured<br/>
    With less disdain, than when is set aside<br/>
    The Holy Writ, or when it is distorted.</p>
<p>They think not there how much of blood it costs<br/>
    To sow it in the world, and how he pleases<br/>
    Who in humility keeps close to it.</p>
<p>Each striveth for appearance, and doth make<br/>
    His own inventions; and these treated are<br/>
    By preachers, and the Evangel holds its peace.</p>
<p>One sayeth that the moon did backward turn,<br/>
    In the Passion of Christ, and interpose herself<br/>
    So that the sunlight reached not down below;</p>
<p>And lies; for of its own accord the light<br/>
    Hid itself; whence to Spaniards and to Indians,<br/>
    As to the Jews, did such eclipse respond.</p>
<p>Florence has not so many Lapi and Bindi<br/>
    As fables such as these, that every year<br/>
    Are shouted from the pulpit back and forth,</p>
<p>In such wise that the lambs, who do not know,<br/>
    Come back from pasture fed upon the wind,<br/>
    And not to see the harm doth not excuse them.</p>
<p>Christ did not to his first disciples say,<br/>
    'Go forth, and to the world preach idle tales,'<br/>
    But unto them a true foundation gave;</p>
<p>And this so loudly sounded from their lips,<br/>
    That, in the warfare to enkindle Faith,<br/>
    They made of the Evangel shields and lances.</p>
<p>Now men go forth with jests and drolleries<br/>
    To preach, and if but well the people laugh,<br/>
    The hood puffs out, and nothing more is asked.</p>
<p>But in the cowl there nestles such a bird,<br/>
    That, if the common people were to see it,<br/>
    They would perceive what pardons they confide in,</p>
<p>For which so great on earth has grown the folly,<br/>
    That, without proof of any testimony,<br/>
    To each indulgence they would flock together.</p>
<p>By this Saint Anthony his pig doth fatten,<br/>
    And many others, who are worse than pigs,<br/>
    Paying in money without mark of coinage.</p>
<p>But since we have digressed abundantly,<br/>
    Turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path,<br/>
    So that the way be shortened with the time.</p>
<p>This nature doth so multiply itself<br/>
    In numbers, that there never yet was speech<br/>
    Nor mortal fancy that can go so far.</p>
<p>And if thou notest that which is revealed<br/>
    By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands<br/>
    Number determinate is kept concealed.</p>
<p>The primal light, that all irradiates it,<br/>
    By modes as many is received therein,<br/>
    As are the splendours wherewith it is mated.</p>
<p>Hence, inasmuch as on the act conceptive<br/>
    The affection followeth, of love the sweetness<br/>
    Therein diversely fervid is or tepid.</p>
<p>The height behold now and the amplitude<br/>
    Of the eternal power, since it hath made<br/>
    Itself so many mirrors, where 'tis broken,</p>
<p>One in itself remaining as before."</p>

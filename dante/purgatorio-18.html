<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XVIII</h3>
<p>An end had put unto his reasoning<br/>
    The lofty Teacher, and attent was looking<br/>
    Into my face, if I appeared content;</p>
<p>And I, whom a new thirst still goaded on,<br/>
    Without was mute, and said within: "Perchance<br/>
    The too much questioning I make annoys him."</p>
<p>But that true Father, who had comprehended<br/>
    The timid wish, that opened not itself,<br/>
    By speaking gave me hardihood to speak.</p>
<p>Whence I: "My sight is, Master, vivified<br/>
    So in thy light, that clearly I discern<br/>
    Whate'er thy speech importeth or describes.</p>
<p>Therefore I thee entreat, sweet Father dear,<br/>
    To teach me love, to which thou dost refer<br/>
    Every good action and its contrary."</p>
<p>"Direct," he said, "towards me the keen eyes<br/>
    Of intellect, and clear will be to thee<br/>
    The error of the blind, who would be leaders.</p>
<p>The soul, which is created apt to love,<br/>
    Is mobile unto everything that pleases,<br/>
    Soon as by pleasure she is waked to action.</p>
<p>Your apprehension from some real thing<br/>
    An image draws, and in yourselves displays it<br/>
    So that it makes the soul turn unto it.</p>
<p>And if, when turned, towards it she incline,<br/>
    Love is that inclination; it is nature,<br/>
    Which is by pleasure bound in you anew</p>
<p>Then even as the fire doth upward move<br/>
    By its own form, which to ascend is born,<br/>
    Where longest in its matter it endures,</p>
<p>So comes the captive soul into desire,<br/>
    Which is a motion spiritual, and ne'er rests<br/>
    Until she doth enjoy the thing beloved.</p>
<p>Now may apparent be to thee how hidden<br/>
    The truth is from those people, who aver<br/>
    All love is in itself a laudable thing;</p>
<p>Because its matter may perchance appear<br/>
    Aye to be good; but yet not each impression<br/>
    Is good, albeit good may be the wax."</p>
<p>"Thy words, and my sequacious intellect,"<br/>
    I answered him, "have love revealed to me;<br/>
    But that has made me more impregned with doubt;</p>
<p>For if love from without be offered us,<br/>
    And with another foot the soul go not,<br/>
    If right or wrong she go, 'tis not her merit."</p>
<p>And he to me: "What reason seeth here,<br/>
    Myself can tell thee; beyond that await<br/>
    For Beatrice, since 'tis a work of faith.</p>
<p>Every substantial form, that segregate<br/>
    From matter is, and with it is united,<br/>
    Specific power has in itself collected,</p>
<p>Which without act is not perceptible,<br/>
    Nor shows itself except by its effect,<br/>
    As life does in a plant by the green leaves.</p>
<p>But still, whence cometh the intelligence<br/>
    Of the first notions, man is ignorant,<br/>
    And the affection for the first allurements,</p>
<p>Which are in you as instinct in the bee<br/>
    To make its honey; and this first desire<br/>
    Merit of praise or blame containeth not.</p>
<p>Now, that to this all others may be gathered,<br/>
    Innate within you is the power that counsels,<br/>
    And it should keep the threshold of assent.</p>
<p>This is the principle, from which is taken<br/>
    Occasion of desert in you, according<br/>
    As good and guilty loves it takes and winnows.</p>
<p>Those who, in reasoning, to the bottom went,<br/>
    Were of this innate liberty aware,<br/>
    Therefore bequeathed they Ethics to the world.</p>
<p>Supposing, then, that from necessity<br/>
    Springs every love that is within you kindled,<br/>
    Within yourselves the power is to restrain it.</p>
<p>The noble virtue Beatrice understands<br/>
    By the free will; and therefore see that thou<br/>
    Bear it in mind, if she should speak of it."</p>
<p>The moon, belated almost unto midnight,<br/>
    Now made the stars appear to us more rare,<br/>
    Formed like a bucket, that is all ablaze,</p>
<p>And counter to the heavens ran through those paths<br/>
    Which the sun sets aflame, when he of Rome<br/>
    Sees it 'twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down;</p>
<p>And that patrician shade, for whom is named<br/>
    Pietola more than any Mantuan town,<br/>
    Had laid aside the burden of my lading;</p>
<p>Whence I, who reason manifest and plain<br/>
    In answer to my questions had received,<br/>
    Stood like a man in drowsy reverie.</p>
<p>But taken from me was this drowsiness<br/>
    Suddenly by a people, that behind<br/>
    Our backs already had come round to us.</p>
<p>And as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus<br/>
    Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,<br/>
    If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,</p>
<p>So they along that circle curve their step,<br/>
    From what I saw of those approaching us,<br/>
    Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.</p>
<p>Full soon they were upon us, because running<br/>
    Moved onward all that mighty multitude,<br/>
    And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,</p>
<p>"Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,<br/>
    And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,<br/>
    Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain."</p>
<p>"Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost<br/>
    By little love!" forthwith the others cried,<br/>
    "For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!"</p>
<p>"O folk, in whom an eager fervour now<br/>
    Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,<br/>
    Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness,</p>
<p>This one who lives, and truly I lie not,<br/>
    Would fain go up, if but the sun relight us;<br/>
    So tell us where the passage nearest is."</p>
<p>These were the words of him who was my Guide;<br/>
    And some one of those spirits said: "Come on<br/>
    Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;</p>
<p>So full of longing are we to move onward,<br/>
    That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,<br/>
    If thou for churlishness our justice take.</p>
<p>I was San Zeno's Abbot at Verona,<br/>
    Under the empire of good Barbarossa,<br/>
    Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse;</p>
<p>And he has one foot in the grave already,<br/>
    Who shall erelong lament that monastery,<br/>
    And sorry be of having there had power,</p>
<p>Because his son, in his whole body sick,<br/>
    And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,<br/>
    He put into the place of its true pastor."</p>
<p>If more he said, or silent was, I know not,<br/>
    He had already passed so far beyond us;<br/>
    But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.</p>
<p>And he who was in every need my succour<br/>
    Said: "Turn thee hitherward; see two of them<br/>
    Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth."</p>
<p>In rear of all they shouted: "Sooner were<br/>
    The people dead to whom the sea was opened,<br/>
    Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;</p>
<p>And those who the fatigue did not endure<br/>
    Unto the issue, with Anchises' son,<br/>
    Themselves to life withouten glory offered."</p>
<p>Then when from us so separated were<br/>
    Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,<br/>
    Within me a new thought did entrance find,</p>
<p>Whence others many and diverse were born;<br/>
    And so I lapsed from one into another,<br/>
    That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,</p>
<p>And meditation into dream transmuted.</p>

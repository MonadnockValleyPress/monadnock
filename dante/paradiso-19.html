<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XIX</h3>
<p>Appeared before me with its wings outspread<br/>
    The beautiful image that in sweet fruition<br/>
    Made jubilant the interwoven souls;</p>
<p>Appeared a little ruby each, wherein<br/>
    Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled<br/>
    That each into mine eyes refracted it.</p>
<p>And what it now behoves me to retrace<br/>
    Nor voice has e'er reported, nor ink written,<br/>
    Nor was by fantasy e'er comprehended;</p>
<p>For speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,<br/>
    And utter with its voice both 'I' and 'My,'<br/>
    When in conception it was 'We' and 'Our.'</p>
<p>And it began: "Being just and merciful<br/>
    Am I exalted here unto that glory<br/>
    Which cannot be exceeded by desire;</p>
<p>And upon earth I left my memory<br/>
    Such, that the evil-minded people there<br/>
    Commend it, but continue not the story."</p>
<p>So doth a single heat from many embers<br/>
    Make itself felt, even as from many loves<br/>
    Issued a single sound from out that image.</p>
<p>Whence I thereafter: "O perpetual flowers<br/>
    Of the eternal joy, that only one<br/>
    Make me perceive your odours manifold,</p>
<p>Exhaling, break within me the great fast<br/>
    Which a long season has in hunger held me,<br/>
    Not finding for it any food on earth.</p>
<p>Well do I know, that if in heaven its mirror<br/>
    Justice Divine another realm doth make,<br/>
    Yours apprehends it not through any veil.</p>
<p>You know how I attentively address me<br/>
    To listen; and you know what is the doubt<br/>
    That is in me so very old a fast."</p>
<p>Even as a falcon, issuing from his hood,<br/>
    Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,<br/>
    Showing desire, and making himself fine,</p>
<p>Saw I become that standard, which of lauds<br/>
    Was interwoven of the grace divine,<br/>
    With such songs as he knows who there rejoices.</p>
<p>Then it began: "He who a compass turned<br/>
    On the world's outer verge, and who within it<br/>
    Devised so much occult and manifest,</p>
<p>Could not the impress of his power so make<br/>
    On all the universe, as that his Word<br/>
    Should not remain in infinite excess.</p>
<p>And this makes certain that the first proud being,<br/>
    Who was the paragon of every creature,<br/>
    By not awaiting light fell immature.</p>
<p>And hence appears it, that each minor nature<br/>
    Is scant receptacle unto that good<br/>
    Which has no end, and by itself is measured.</p>
<p>In consequence our vision, which perforce<br/>
    Must be some ray of that intelligence<br/>
    With which all things whatever are replete,</p>
<p>Cannot in its own nature be so potent,<br/>
    That it shall not its origin discern<br/>
    Far beyond that which is apparent to it.</p>
<p>Therefore into the justice sempiternal<br/>
    The power of vision that your world receives,<br/>
    As eye into the ocean, penetrates;</p>
<p>Which, though it see the bottom near the shore,<br/>
    Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet<br/>
    'Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth.</p>
<p>There is no light but comes from the serene<br/>
    That never is o'ercast, nay, it is darkness<br/>
    Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.</p>
<p>Amply to thee is opened now the cavern<br/>
    Which has concealed from thee the living justice<br/>
    Of which thou mad'st such frequent questioning.</p>
<p>For saidst thou: 'Born a man is on the shore<br/>
    Of Indus, and is none who there can speak<br/>
    Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;</p>
<p>And all his inclinations and his actions<br/>
    Are good, so far as human reason sees,<br/>
    Without a sin in life or in discourse:</p>
<p>He dieth unbaptised and without faith;<br/>
    Where is this justice that condemneth him?<br/>
    Where is his fault, if he do not believe?'</p>
<p>Now who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit<br/>
    In judgment at a thousand miles away,<br/>
    With the short vision of a single span?</p>
<p>Truly to him who with me subtilizes,<br/>
    If so the Scripture were not over you,<br/>
    For doubting there were marvellous occasion.</p>
<p>O animals terrene, O stolid minds,<br/>
    The primal will, that in itself is good,<br/>
    Ne'er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved.</p>
<p>So much is just as is accordant with it;<br/>
    No good created draws it to itself,<br/>
    But it, by raying forth, occasions that."</p>
<p>Even as above her nest goes circling round<br/>
    The stork when she has fed her little ones,<br/>
    And he who has been fed looks up at her,</p>
<p>So lifted I my brows, and even such<br/>
    Became the blessed image, which its wings<br/>
    Was moving, by so many counsels urged.</p>
<p>Circling around it sang, and said: "As are<br/>
    My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them,<br/>
    Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals."</p>
<p>Those lucent splendours of the Holy Spirit<br/>
    Grew quiet then, but still within the standard<br/>
    That made the Romans reverend to the world.</p>
<p>It recommenced: "Unto this kingdom never<br/>
    Ascended one who had not faith in Christ,<br/>
    Before or since he to the tree was nailed.</p>
<p>But look thou, many crying are, 'Christ, Christ!'<br/>
    Who at the judgment shall be far less near<br/>
    To him than some shall be who knew not Christ.</p>
<p>Such Christians shall the Ethiop condemn,<br/>
    When the two companies shall be divided,<br/>
    The one for ever rich, the other poor.</p>
<p>What to your kings may not the Persians say,<br/>
    When they that volume opened shall behold<br/>
    In which are written down all their dispraises?</p>
<p>There shall be seen, among the deeds of Albert,<br/>
    That which ere long shall set the pen in motion,<br/>
    For which the realm of Prague shall be deserted.</p>
<p>There shall be seen the woe that on the Seine<br/>
    He brings by falsifying of the coin,<br/>
    Who by the blow of a wild boar shall die.</p>
<p>There shall be seen the pride that causes thirst,<br/>
    Which makes the Scot and Englishman so mad<br/>
    That they within their boundaries cannot rest;</p>
<p>Be seen the luxury and effeminate life<br/>
    Of him of Spain, and the Bohemian,<br/>
    Who valour never knew and never wished;</p>
<p>Be seen the Cripple of Jerusalem,<br/>
    His goodness represented by an I,<br/>
    While the reverse an M shall represent;</p>
<p>Be seen the avarice and poltroonery<br/>
    Of him who guards the Island of the Fire,<br/>
    Wherein Anchises finished his long life;</p>
<p>And to declare how pitiful he is<br/>
    Shall be his record in contracted letters<br/>
    Which shall make note of much in little space.</p>
<p>And shall appear to each one the foul deeds<br/>
    Of uncle and of brother who a nation<br/>
    So famous have dishonoured, and two crowns.</p>
<p>And he of Portugal and he of Norway<br/>
    Shall there be known, and he of Rascia too,<br/>
    Who saw in evil hour the coin of Venice.</p>
<p>O happy Hungary, if she let herself<br/>
    Be wronged no farther! and Navarre the happy,<br/>
    If with the hills that gird her she be armed!</p>
<p>And each one may believe that now, as hansel<br/>
    Thereof, do Nicosia and Famagosta<br/>
    Lament and rage because of their own beast,</p>
<p>Who from the others' flank departeth not."</p>

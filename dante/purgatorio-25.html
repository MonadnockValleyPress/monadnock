<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXV</h3>
<p>Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked,<br/>
    Because the sun had his meridian circle<br/>
    To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio;</p>
<p>Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not,<br/>
    But goes his way, whate'er to him appear,<br/>
    If of necessity the sting transfix him,</p>
<p>In this wise did we enter through the gap,<br/>
    Taking the stairway, one before the other,<br/>
    Which by its narrowness divides the climbers.</p>
<p>And as the little stork that lifts its wing<br/>
    With a desire to fly, and does not venture<br/>
    To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop,</p>
<p>Even such was I, with the desire of asking<br/>
    Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming<br/>
    He makes who doth address himself to speak.</p>
<p>Not for our pace, though rapid it might be,<br/>
    My father sweet forbore, but said: "Let fly<br/>
    The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn."</p>
<p>With confidence I opened then my mouth,<br/>
    And I began: "How can one meagre grow<br/>
    There where the need of nutriment applies not?"</p>
<p>"If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager<br/>
    Was wasted by the wasting of a brand,<br/>
    This would not," said he, "be to thee so sour;</p>
<p>And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion<br/>
    Trembles within a mirror your own image;<br/>
    That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee.</p>
<p>But that thou mayst content thee in thy wish<br/>
    Lo Statius here; and him I call and pray<br/>
    He now will be the healer of thy wounds."</p>
<p>"If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,"<br/>
    Responded Statius, "where thou present art,<br/>
    Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee."</p>
<p>Then he began: "Son, if these words of mine<br/>
    Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive,<br/>
    They'll be thy light unto the How thou sayest.</p>
<p>The perfect blood, which never is drunk up<br/>
    Into the thirsty veins, and which remaineth<br/>
    Like food that from the table thou removest,</p>
<p>Takes in the heart for all the human members<br/>
    Virtue informative, as being that<br/>
    Which to be changed to them goes through the veins</p>
<p>Again digest, descends it where 'tis better<br/>
    Silent to be than say; and then drops thence<br/>
    Upon another's blood in natural vase.</p>
<p>There one together with the other mingles,<br/>
    One to be passive meant, the other active<br/>
    By reason of the perfect place it springs from;</p>
<p>And being conjoined, begins to operate,<br/>
    Coagulating first, then vivifying<br/>
    What for its matter it had made consistent.</p>
<p>The active virtue, being made a soul<br/>
    As of a plant, (in so far different,<br/>
    This on the way is, that arrived already,)</p>
<p>Then works so much, that now it moves and feels<br/>
    Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes<br/>
    To organize the powers whose seed it is.</p>
<p>Now, Son, dilates and now distends itself<br/>
    The virtue from the generator's heart,<br/>
    Where nature is intent on all the members.</p>
<p>But how from animal it man becomes<br/>
    Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point<br/>
    Which made a wiser man than thou once err</p>
<p>So far, that in his doctrine separate<br/>
    He made the soul from possible intellect,<br/>
    For he no organ saw by this assumed.</p>
<p>Open thy breast unto the truth that's coming,<br/>
    And know that, just as soon as in the foetus<br/>
    The articulation of the brain is perfect,</p>
<p>The primal Motor turns to it well pleased<br/>
    At so great art of nature, and inspires<br/>
    A spirit new with virtue all replete,</p>
<p>Which what it finds there active doth attract<br/>
    Into its substance, and becomes one soul,<br/>
    Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves.</p>
<p>And that thou less may wonder at my word,<br/>
    Behold the sun's heat, which becometh wine,<br/>
    Joined to the juice that from the vine distils.</p>
<p>Whenever Lachesis has no more thread,<br/>
    It separates from the flesh, and virtually<br/>
    Bears with itself the human and divine;</p>
<p>The other faculties are voiceless all;<br/>
    The memory, the intelligence, and the will<br/>
    In action far more vigorous than before.</p>
<p>Without a pause it falleth of itself<br/>
    In marvellous way on one shore or the other;<br/>
    There of its roads it first is cognizant.</p>
<p>Soon as the place there circumscribeth it,<br/>
    The virtue informative rays round about,<br/>
    As, and as much as, in the living members.</p>
<p>And even as the air, when full of rain,<br/>
    By alien rays that are therein reflected,<br/>
    With divers colours shows itself adorned,</p>
<p>So there the neighbouring air doth shape itself<br/>
    Into that form which doth impress upon it<br/>
    Virtually the soul that has stood still.</p>
<p>And then in manner of the little flame,<br/>
    Which followeth the fire where'er it shifts,<br/>
    After the spirit followeth its new form.</p>
<p>Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance,<br/>
    It is called shade; and thence it organizes<br/>
    Thereafter every sense, even to the sight.</p>
<p>Thence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh;<br/>
    Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs,<br/>
    That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard.</p>
<p>According as impress us our desires<br/>
    And other affections, so the shade is shaped,<br/>
    And this is cause of what thou wonderest at."</p>
<p>And now unto the last of all the circles<br/>
    Had we arrived, and to the right hand turned,<br/>
    And were attentive to another care.</p>
<p>There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire,<br/>
    And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast<br/>
    That drives them back, and from itself sequesters.</p>
<p>Hence we must needs go on the open side,<br/>
    And one by one; and I did fear the fire<br/>
    On this side, and on that the falling down.</p>
<p>My Leader said: "Along this place one ought<br/>
    To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein,<br/>
    Seeing that one so easily might err."</p>
<p>"Summae Deus clementiae," in the bosom<br/>
    Of the great burning chanted then I heard,<br/>
    Which made me no less eager to turn round;</p>
<p>And spirits saw I walking through the flame;<br/>
    Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs<br/>
    Apportioning my sight from time to time.</p>
<p>After the close which to that hymn is made,<br/>
    Aloud they shouted, "Virum non cognosco;"<br/>
    Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.</p>
<p>This also ended, cried they: "To the wood<br/>
    Diana ran, and drove forth Helice<br/>
    Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison."</p>
<p>Then to their song returned they; then the wives<br/>
    They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste.<br/>
    As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.</p>
<p>And I believe that them this mode suffices,<br/>
    For all the time the fire is burning them;<br/>
    With such care is it needful, and such food,</p>
<p>That the last wound of all should be closed up.</p>

<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XI</h3>
<p>O Thou insensate care of mortal men,<br/>
    How inconclusive are the syllogisms<br/>
    That make thee beat thy wings in downward flight!</p>
<p>One after laws and one to aphorisms<br/>
    Was going, and one following the priesthood,<br/>
    And one to reign by force or sophistry,</p>
<p>And one in theft, and one in state affairs,<br/>
    One in the pleasures of the flesh involved<br/>
    Wearied himself, one gave himself to ease;</p>
<p>When I, from all these things emancipate,<br/>
    With Beatrice above there in the Heavens<br/>
    With such exceeding glory was received!</p>
<p>When each one had returned unto that point<br/>
    Within the circle where it was before,<br/>
    It stood as in a candlestick a candle;</p>
<p>And from within the effulgence which at first<br/>
    Had spoken unto me, I heard begin<br/>
    Smiling while it more luminous became:</p>
<p>"Even as I am kindled in its ray,<br/>
    So, looking into the Eternal Light,<br/>
    The occasion of thy thoughts I apprehend.</p>
<p>Thou doubtest, and wouldst have me to resift<br/>
    In language so extended and so open<br/>
    My speech, that to thy sense it may be plain,</p>
<p>Where just before I said, 'where well one fattens,'<br/>
    And where I said, 'there never rose a second;'<br/>
    And here 'tis needful we distinguish well.</p>
<p>The Providence, which governeth the world<br/>
    With counsel, wherein all created vision<br/>
    Is vanquished ere it reach unto the bottom,</p>
<p>(So that towards her own Beloved might go<br/>
    The bride of Him who, uttering a loud cry,<br/>
    Espoused her with his consecrated blood,</p>
<p>Self-confident and unto Him more faithful,)<br/>
    Two Princes did ordain in her behoof,<br/>
    Which on this side and that might be her guide.</p>
<p>The one was all seraphical in ardour;<br/>
    The other by his wisdom upon earth<br/>
    A splendour was of light cherubical.</p>
<p>One will I speak of, for of both is spoken<br/>
    In praising one, whichever may be taken,<br/>
    Because unto one end their labours were.</p>
<p>Between Tupino and the stream that falls<br/>
    Down from the hill elect of blessed Ubald,<br/>
    A fertile slope of lofty mountain hangs,</p>
<p>From which Perugia feels the cold and heat<br/>
    Through Porta Sole, and behind it weep<br/>
    Gualdo and Nocera their grievous yoke.</p>
<p>From out that slope, there where it breaketh most<br/>
    Its steepness, rose upon the world a sun<br/>
    As this one does sometimes from out the Ganges;</p>
<p>Therefore let him who speaketh of that place,<br/>
    Say not Ascesi, for he would say little,<br/>
    But Orient, if he properly would speak.</p>
<p>He was not yet far distant from his rising<br/>
    Before he had begun to make the earth<br/>
    Some comfort from his mighty virtue feel.</p>
<p>For he in youth his father's wrath incurred<br/>
    For certain Dame, to whom, as unto death,<br/>
    The gate of pleasure no one doth unlock;</p>
<p>And was before his spiritual court<br/>
    'Et coram patre' unto her united;<br/>
    Then day by day more fervently he loved her.</p>
<p>She, reft of her first husband, scorned, obscure,<br/>
    One thousand and one hundred years and more,<br/>
    Waited without a suitor till he came.</p>
<p>Naught it availed to hear, that with Amyclas<br/>
    Found her unmoved at sounding of his voice<br/>
    He who struck terror into all the world;</p>
<p>Naught it availed being constant and undaunted,<br/>
    So that, when Mary still remained below,<br/>
    She mounted up with Christ upon the cross.</p>
<p>But that too darkly I may not proceed,<br/>
    Francis and Poverty for these two lovers<br/>
    Take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse.</p>
<p>Their concord and their joyous semblances,<br/>
    The love, the wonder, and the sweet regard,<br/>
    They made to be the cause of holy thoughts;</p>
<p>So much so that the venerable Bernard<br/>
    First bared his feet, and after so great peace<br/>
    Ran, and, in running, thought himself too slow.</p>
<p>O wealth unknown! O veritable good!<br/>
    Giles bares his feet, and bares his feet Sylvester<br/>
    Behind the bridegroom, so doth please the bride!</p>
<p>Then goes his way that father and that master,<br/>
    He and his Lady and that family<br/>
    Which now was girding on the humble cord;</p>
<p>Nor cowardice of heart weighed down his brow<br/>
    At being son of Peter Bernardone,<br/>
    Nor for appearing marvellously scorned;</p>
<p>But regally his hard determination<br/>
    To Innocent he opened, and from him<br/>
    Received the primal seal upon his Order.</p>
<p>After the people mendicant increased<br/>
    Behind this man, whose admirable life<br/>
    Better in glory of the heavens were sung,</p>
<p>Incoronated with a second crown<br/>
    Was through Honorius by the Eternal Spirit<br/>
    The holy purpose of this Archimandrite.</p>
<p>And when he had, through thirst of martyrdom,<br/>
    In the proud presence of the Sultan preached<br/>
    Christ and the others who came after him,</p>
<p>And, finding for conversion too unripe<br/>
    The folk, and not to tarry there in vain,<br/>
    Returned to fruit of the Italic grass,</p>
<p>On the rude rock 'twixt Tiber and the Arno<br/>
    From Christ did he receive the final seal,<br/>
    Which during two whole years his members bore.</p>
<p>When He, who chose him unto so much good,<br/>
    Was pleased to draw him up to the reward<br/>
    That he had merited by being lowly,</p>
<p>Unto his friars, as to the rightful heirs,<br/>
    His most dear Lady did he recommend,<br/>
    And bade that they should love her faithfully;</p>
<p>And from her bosom the illustrious soul<br/>
    Wished to depart, returning to its realm,<br/>
    And for its body wished no other bier.</p>
<p>Think now what man was he, who was a fit<br/>
    Companion over the high seas to keep<br/>
    The bark of Peter to its proper bearings.</p>
<p>And this man was our Patriarch; hence whoever<br/>
    Doth follow him as he commands can see<br/>
    That he is laden with good merchandise.</p>
<p>But for new pasturage his flock has grown<br/>
    So greedy, that it is impossible<br/>
    They be not scattered over fields diverse;</p>
<p>And in proportion as his sheep remote<br/>
    And vagabond go farther off from him,<br/>
    More void of milk return they to the fold.</p>
<p>Verily some there are that fear a hurt,<br/>
    And keep close to the shepherd; but so few,<br/>
    That little cloth doth furnish forth their hoods.</p>
<p>Now if my utterance be not indistinct,<br/>
    If thine own hearing hath attentive been,<br/>
    If thou recall to mind what I have said,</p>
<p>In part contented shall thy wishes be;<br/>
    For thou shalt see the plant that's chipped away,<br/>
    And the rebuke that lieth in the words,</p>
<p>'Where well one fattens, if he strayeth not.'"</p>

<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXIV</h3>
<p>"O company elect to the great supper<br/>
    Of the Lamb benedight, who feedeth you<br/>
    So that for ever full is your desire,</p>
<p>If by the grace of God this man foretaste<br/>
    Something of that which falleth from your table,<br/>
    Or ever death prescribe to him the time,</p>
<p>Direct your mind to his immense desire,<br/>
    And him somewhat bedew; ye drinking are<br/>
    For ever at the fount whence comes his thought."</p>
<p>Thus Beatrice; and those souls beatified<br/>
    Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,<br/>
    Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.</p>
<p>And as the wheels in works of horologes<br/>
    Revolve so that the first to the beholder<br/>
    Motionless seems, and the last one to fly,</p>
<p>So in like manner did those carols, dancing<br/>
    In different measure, of their affluence<br/>
    Give me the gauge, as they were swift or slow.</p>
<p>From that one which I noted of most beauty<br/>
    Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy<br/>
    That none it left there of a greater brightness;</p>
<p>And around Beatrice three several times<br/>
    It whirled itself with so divine a song,<br/>
    My fantasy repeats it not to me;</p>
<p>Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not,<br/>
    Since our imagination for such folds,<br/>
    Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring.</p>
<p>"O holy sister mine, who us implorest<br/>
    With such devotion, by thine ardent love<br/>
    Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!"</p>
<p>Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire<br/>
    Unto my Lady did direct its breath,<br/>
    Which spake in fashion as I here have said.</p>
<p>And she: "O light eterne of the great man<br/>
    To whom our Lord delivered up the keys<br/>
    He carried down of this miraculous joy,</p>
<p>This one examine on points light and grave,<br/>
    As good beseemeth thee, about the Faith<br/>
    By means of which thou on the sea didst walk.</p>
<p>If he love well, and hope well, and believe,<br/>
    From thee 'tis hid not; for thou hast thy sight<br/>
    There where depicted everything is seen.</p>
<p>But since this kingdom has made citizens<br/>
    By means of the true Faith, to glorify it<br/>
    'Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof."</p>
<p>As baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not<br/>
    Until the master doth propose the question,<br/>
    To argue it, and not to terminate it,</p>
<p>So did I arm myself with every reason,<br/>
    While she was speaking, that I might be ready<br/>
    For such a questioner and such profession.</p>
<p>"Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;<br/>
    What is the Faith?" Whereat I raised my brow<br/>
    Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.</p>
<p>Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she<br/>
    Prompt signals made to me that I should pour<br/>
    The water forth from my internal fountain.</p>
<p>"May grace, that suffers me to make confession,"<br/>
    Began I, "to the great centurion,<br/>
    Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!"</p>
<p>And I continued: "As the truthful pen,<br/>
    Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it,<br/>
    Who put with thee Rome into the good way,</p>
<p>Faith is the substance of the things we hope for,<br/>
    And evidence of those that are not seen;<br/>
    And this appears to me its quiddity."</p>
<p>Then heard I: "Very rightly thou perceivest,<br/>
    If well thou understandest why he placed it<br/>
    With substances and then with evidences."</p>
<p>And I thereafterward: "The things profound,<br/>
    That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,<br/>
    Unto all eyes below are so concealed,</p>
<p>That they exist there only in belief,<br/>
    Upon the which is founded the high hope,<br/>
    And hence it takes the nature of a substance.</p>
<p>And it behoveth us from this belief<br/>
    To reason without having other sight,<br/>
    And hence it has the nature of evidence."</p>
<p>Then heard I: "If whatever is acquired<br/>
    Below by doctrine were thus understood,<br/>
    No sophist's subtlety would there find place."</p>
<p>Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;<br/>
    Then added: "Very well has been gone over<br/>
    Already of this coin the alloy and weight;</p>
<p>But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?"<br/>
    And I: "Yes, both so shining and so round<br/>
    That in its stamp there is no peradventure."</p>
<p>Thereafter issued from the light profound<br/>
    That there resplendent was: "This precious jewel,<br/>
    Upon the which is every virtue founded,</p>
<p>Whence hadst thou it?" And I: "The large outpouring<br/>
    Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused<br/>
    Upon the ancient parchments and the new,</p>
<p>A syllogism is, which proved it to me<br/>
    With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,<br/>
    All demonstration seems to me obtuse."</p>
<p>And then I heard: "The ancient and the new<br/>
    Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,<br/>
    Why dost thou take them for the word divine?"</p>
<p>And I: "The proofs, which show the truth to me,<br/>
    Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature<br/>
    Ne'er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat."</p>
<p>'Twas answered me: "Say, who assureth thee<br/>
    That those works ever were? the thing itself<br/>
    That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it."</p>
<p>"Were the world to Christianity converted,"<br/>
    I said, "withouten miracles, this one<br/>
    Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;</p>
<p>Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter<br/>
    Into the field to sow there the good plant,<br/>
    Which was a vine and has become a thorn!"</p>
<p>This being finished, the high, holy Court<br/>
    Resounded through the spheres, "One God we praise!"<br/>
    In melody that there above is chanted.</p>
<p>And then that Baron, who from branch to branch,<br/>
    Examining, had thus conducted me,<br/>
    Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,</p>
<p>Again began: "The Grace that dallying<br/>
    Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,<br/>
    Up to this point, as it should opened be,</p>
<p>So that I do approve what forth emerged;<br/>
    But now thou must express what thou believest,<br/>
    And whence to thy belief it was presented."</p>
<p>"O holy father, spirit who beholdest<br/>
    What thou believedst so that thou o'ercamest,<br/>
    Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,"</p>
<p>Began I, "thou dost wish me in this place<br/>
    The form to manifest of my prompt belief,<br/>
    And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.</p>
<p>And I respond: In one God I believe,<br/>
    Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens<br/>
    With love and with desire, himself unmoved;</p>
<p>And of such faith not only have I proofs<br/>
    Physical and metaphysical, but gives them<br/>
    Likewise the truth that from this place rains down</p>
<p>Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,<br/>
    Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote<br/>
    After the fiery Spirit sanctified you;</p>
<p>In Persons three eterne believe, and these<br/>
    One essence I believe, so one and trine<br/>
    They bear conjunction both with 'sunt' and 'est.'</p>
<p>With the profound condition and divine<br/>
    Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind<br/>
    Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.</p>
<p>This the beginning is, this is the spark<br/>
    Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,<br/>
    And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me."</p>
<p>Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him<br/>
    His servant straight embraces, gratulating<br/>
    For the good news as soon as he is silent;</p>
<p>So, giving me its benediction, singing,<br/>
    Three times encircled me, when I was silent,<br/>
    The apostolic light, at whose command</p>
<p>I spoken had, in speaking I so pleased him.</p>

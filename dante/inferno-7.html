<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto VII</h3>
<p>"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!"<br/>
    Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;<br/>
    And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,</p>
<p>Said, to encourage me: "Let not thy fear<br/>
    Harm thee; for any power that he may have<br/>
    Shall not prevent thy going down this crag."</p>
<p>Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,<br/>
    And said: "Be silent, thou accursed wolf;<br/>
    Consume within thyself with thine own rage.</p>
<p>Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;<br/>
    Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought<br/>
    Vengeance upon the proud adultery."</p>
<p>Even as the sails inflated by the wind<br/>
    Involved together fall when snaps the mast,<br/>
    So fell the cruel monster to the earth.</p>
<p>Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,<br/>
    Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore<br/>
    Which all the woe of the universe insacks.</p>
<p>Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many<br/>
    New toils and sufferings as I beheld?<br/>
    And why doth our transgression waste us so?</p>
<p>As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,<br/>
    That breaks itself on that which it encounters,<br/>
    So here the folk must dance their roundelay.</p>
<p>Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,<br/>
    On one side and the other, with great howls,<br/>
    Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.</p>
<p>They clashed together, and then at that point<br/>
    Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,<br/>
    Crying, "Why keepest?" and, "Why squanderest thou?"</p>
<p>Thus they returned along the lurid circle<br/>
    On either hand unto the opposite point,<br/>
    Shouting their shameful metre evermore.</p>
<p>Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about<br/>
    Through his half-circle to another joust;<br/>
    And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,</p>
<p>Exclaimed: "My Master, now declare to me<br/>
    What people these are, and if all were clerks,<br/>
    These shaven crowns upon the left of us."</p>
<p>And he to me: "All of them were asquint<br/>
    In intellect in the first life, so much<br/>
    That there with measure they no spending made.</p>
<p>Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,<br/>
    Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle,<br/>
    Where sunders them the opposite defect.</p>
<p>Clerks those were who no hairy covering<br/>
    Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,<br/>
    In whom doth Avarice practise its excess."</p>
<p>And I: "My Master, among such as these<br/>
    I ought forsooth to recognise some few,<br/>
    Who were infected with these maladies."</p>
<p>And he to me: "Vain thought thou entertainest;<br/>
    The undiscerning life which made them sordid<br/>
    Now makes them unto all discernment dim.</p>
<p>Forever shall they come to these two buttings;<br/>
    These from the sepulchre shall rise again<br/>
    With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.</p>
<p>Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world<br/>
    Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;<br/>
    Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it.</p>
<p>Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce<br/>
    Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,<br/>
    For which the human race each other buffet;</p>
<p>For all the gold that is beneath the moon,<br/>
    Or ever has been, of these weary souls<br/>
    Could never make a single one repose."</p>
<p>"Master," I said to him, "now tell me also<br/>
    What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,<br/>
    That has the world's goods so within its clutches?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "O creatures imbecile,<br/>
    What ignorance is this which doth beset you?<br/>
    Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.</p>
<p>He whose omniscience everything transcends<br/>
    The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,<br/>
    That every part to every part may shine,</p>
<p>Distributing the light in equal measure;<br/>
    He in like manner to the mundane splendours<br/>
    Ordained a general ministress and guide,</p>
<p>That she might change at times the empty treasures<br/>
    From race to race, from one blood to another,<br/>
    Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.</p>
<p>Therefore one people triumphs, and another<br/>
    Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,<br/>
    Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.</p>
<p>Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;<br/>
    She makes provision, judges, and pursues<br/>
    Her governance, as theirs the other gods.</p>
<p>Her permutations have not any truce;<br/>
    Necessity makes her precipitate,<br/>
    So often cometh who his turn obtains.</p>
<p>And this is she who is so crucified<br/>
    Even by those who ought to give her praise,<br/>
    Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.</p>
<p>But she is blissful, and she hears it not;<br/>
    Among the other primal creatures gladsome<br/>
    She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.</p>
<p>Let us descend now unto greater woe;<br/>
    Already sinks each star that was ascending<br/>
    When I set out, and loitering is forbidden."</p>
<p>We crossed the circle to the other bank,<br/>
    Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself<br/>
    Along a gully that runs out of it.</p>
<p>The water was more sombre far than perse;<br/>
    And we, in company with the dusky waves,<br/>
    Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.</p>
<p>A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,<br/>
    This tristful brooklet, when it has descended<br/>
    Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.</p>
<p>And I, who stood intent upon beholding,<br/>
    Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,<br/>
    All of them naked and with angry look.</p>
<p>They smote each other not alone with hands,<br/>
    But with the head and with the breast and feet,<br/>
    Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.</p>
<p>Said the good Master: "Son, thou now beholdest<br/>
    The souls of those whom anger overcame;<br/>
    And likewise I would have thee know for certain</p>
<p>Beneath the water people are who sigh<br/>
    And make this water bubble at the surface,<br/>
    As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.</p>
<p>Fixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were<br/>
    In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,<br/>
    Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;</p>
<p>Now we are sullen in this sable mire.'<br/>
    This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,<br/>
    For with unbroken words they cannot say it."</p>
<p>Thus we went circling round the filthy fen<br/>
    A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,<br/>
    With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;</p>
<p>Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto III</h3>
<p>"Through me the way is to the city dolent;<br/>
    Through me the way is to eternal dole;<br/>
    Through me the way among the people lost.</p>
<p>Justice incited my sublime Creator;<br/>
    Created me divine Omnipotence,<br/>
    The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.</p>
<p>Before me there were no created things,<br/>
    Only eterne, and I eternal last.<br/>
    All hope abandon, ye who enter in!"</p>
<p>These words in sombre colour I beheld<br/>
    Written upon the summit of a gate;<br/>
    Whence I: "Their sense is, Master, hard to me!"</p>
<p>And he to me, as one experienced:<br/>
    "Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,<br/>
    All cowardice must needs be here extinct.</p>
<p>We to the place have come, where I have told thee<br/>
    Thou shalt behold the people dolorous<br/>
    Who have foregone the good of intellect."</p>
<p>And after he had laid his hand on mine<br/>
    With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,<br/>
    He led me in among the secret things.</p>
<p>There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud<br/>
    Resounded through the air without a star,<br/>
    Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.</p>
<p>Languages diverse, horrible dialects,<br/>
    Accents of anger, words of agony,<br/>
    And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,</p>
<p>Made up a tumult that goes whirling on<br/>
    For ever in that air for ever black,<br/>
    Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.</p>
<p>And I, who had my head with horror bound,<br/>
    Said: "Master, what is this which now I hear?<br/>
    What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "This miserable mode<br/>
    Maintain the melancholy souls of those<br/>
    Who lived withouten infamy or praise.</p>
<p>Commingled are they with that caitiff choir<br/>
    Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,<br/>
    Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.</p>
<p>The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;<br/>
    Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,<br/>
    For glory none the damned would have from them."</p>
<p>And I: "O Master, what so grievous is<br/>
    To these, that maketh them lament so sore?"<br/>
    He answered: "I will tell thee very briefly.</p>
<p>These have no longer any hope of death;<br/>
    And this blind life of theirs is so debased,<br/>
    They envious are of every other fate.</p>
<p>No fame of them the world permits to be;<br/>
    Misericord and Justice both disdain them.<br/>
    Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass."</p>
<p>And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,<br/>
    Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,<br/>
    That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;</p>
<p>And after it there came so long a train<br/>
    Of people, that I ne'er would have believed<br/>
    That ever Death so many had undone.</p>
<p>When some among them I had recognised,<br/>
    I looked, and I beheld the shade of him<br/>
    Who made through cowardice the great refusal.</p>
<p>Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,<br/>
    That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches<br/>
    Hateful to God and to his enemies.</p>
<p>These miscreants, who never were alive,<br/>
    Were naked, and were stung exceedingly<br/>
    By gadflies and by hornets that were there.</p>
<p>These did their faces irrigate with blood,<br/>
    Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet<br/>
    By the disgusting worms was gathered up.</p>
<p>And when to gazing farther I betook me.<br/>
    People I saw on a great river's bank;<br/>
    Whence said I: "Master, now vouchsafe to me,</p>
<p>That I may know who these are, and what law<br/>
    Makes them appear so ready to pass over,<br/>
    As I discern athwart the dusky light."</p>
<p>And he to me: "These things shall all be known<br/>
    To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay<br/>
    Upon the dismal shore of Acheron."</p>
<p>Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,<br/>
    Fearing my words might irksome be to him,<br/>
    From speech refrained I till we reached the river.</p>
<p>And lo! towards us coming in a boat<br/>
    An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,<br/>
    Crying: "Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!</p>
<p>Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;<br/>
    I come to lead you to the other shore,<br/>
    To the eternal shades in heat and frost.</p>
<p>And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,<br/>
    Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!"<br/>
    But when he saw that I did not withdraw,</p>
<p>He said: "By other ways, by other ports<br/>
    Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;<br/>
    A lighter vessel needs must carry thee."</p>
<p>And unto him the Guide: "Vex thee not, Charon;<br/>
    It is so willed there where is power to do<br/>
    That which is willed; and farther question not."</p>
<p>Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks<br/>
    Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,<br/>
    Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.</p>
<p>But all those souls who weary were and naked<br/>
    Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,<br/>
    As soon as they had heard those cruel words.</p>
<p>God they blasphemed and their progenitors,<br/>
    The human race, the place, the time, the seed<br/>
    Of their engendering and of their birth!</p>
<p>Thereafter all together they drew back,<br/>
    Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,<br/>
    Which waiteth every man who fears not God.</p>
<p>Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,<br/>
    Beckoning to them, collects them all together,<br/>
    Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.</p>
<p>As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,<br/>
    First one and then another, till the branch<br/>
    Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;</p>
<p>In similar wise the evil seed of Adam<br/>
    Throw themselves from that margin one by one,<br/>
    At signals, as a bird unto its lure.</p>
<p>So they depart across the dusky wave,<br/>
    And ere upon the other side they land,<br/>
    Again on this side a new troop assembles.</p>
<p>"My son," the courteous Master said to me,<br/>
    "All those who perish in the wrath of God<br/>
    Here meet together out of every land;</p>
<p>And ready are they to pass o'er the river,<br/>
    Because celestial Justice spurs them on,<br/>
    So that their fear is turned into desire.</p>
<p>This way there never passes a good soul;<br/>
    And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,<br/>
    Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports."</p>
<p>This being finished, all the dusk champaign<br/>
    Trembled so violently, that of that terror<br/>
    The recollection bathes me still with sweat.</p>
<p>The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,<br/>
    And fulminated a vermilion light,<br/>
    Which overmastered in me every sense,</p>
<p>And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</p>

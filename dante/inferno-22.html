<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXII</h3>
<p>I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,<br/>
    Begin the storming, and their muster make,<br/>
    And sometimes starting off for their escape;</p>
<p>Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,<br/>
    O Aretines, and foragers go forth,<br/>
    Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,</p>
<p>Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,<br/>
    With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,<br/>
    And with our own, and with outlandish things,</p>
<p>But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth<br/>
    Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,<br/>
    Nor ship by any sign of land or star.</p>
<p>We went upon our way with the ten demons;<br/>
    Ah, savage company! but in the church<br/>
    With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!</p>
<p>Ever upon the pitch was my intent,<br/>
    To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,<br/>
    And of the people who therein were burned.</p>
<p>Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign<br/>
    To mariners by arching of the back,<br/>
    That they should counsel take to save their vessel,</p>
<p>Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,<br/>
    One of the sinners would display his back,<br/>
    And in less time conceal it than it lightens.</p>
<p>As on the brink of water in a ditch<br/>
    The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,<br/>
    So that they hide their feet and other bulk,</p>
<p>So upon every side the sinners stood;<br/>
    But ever as Barbariccia near them came,<br/>
    Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.</p>
<p>I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,<br/>
    One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass<br/>
    One frog remains, and down another dives;</p>
<p>And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,<br/>
    Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,<br/>
    And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.</p>
<p>I knew, before, the names of all of them,<br/>
    So had I noted them when they were chosen,<br/>
    And when they called each other, listened how.</p>
<p>"O Rubicante, see that thou do lay<br/>
    Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,"<br/>
    Cried all together the accursed ones.</p>
<p>And I: "My Master, see to it, if thou canst,<br/>
    That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,<br/>
    Thus come into his adversaries' hands."</p>
<p>Near to the side of him my Leader drew,<br/>
    Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:<br/>
    "I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;</p>
<p>My mother placed me servant to a lord,<br/>
    For she had borne me to a ribald knave,<br/>
    Destroyer of himself and of his things.</p>
<p>Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;<br/>
    I set me there to practise barratry,<br/>
    For which I pay the reckoning in this heat."</p>
<p>And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,<br/>
    On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,<br/>
    Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.</p>
<p>Among malicious cats the mouse had come;<br/>
    But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,<br/>
    And said: "Stand ye aside, while I enfork him."</p>
<p>And to my Master he turned round his head;<br/>
    "Ask him again," he said, "if more thou wish<br/>
    To know from him, before some one destroy him."</p>
<p>The Guide: "Now tell then of the other culprits;<br/>
    Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,<br/>
    Under the pitch?" And he: "I separated</p>
<p>Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;<br/>
    Would that I still were covered up with him,<br/>
    For I should fear not either claw nor hook!"</p>
<p>And Libicocco: "We have borne too much;"<br/>
    And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,<br/>
    So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.</p>
<p>Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him<br/>
    Down at the legs; whence their Decurion<br/>
    Turned round and round about with evil look.</p>
<p>When they again somewhat were pacified,<br/>
    Of him, who still was looking at his wound,<br/>
    Demanded my Conductor without stay:</p>
<p>"Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting<br/>
    Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?"<br/>
    And he replied: "It was the Friar Gomita,</p>
<p>He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,<br/>
    Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,<br/>
    And dealt so with them each exults thereat;</p>
<p>Money he took, and let them smoothly off,<br/>
    As he says; and in other offices<br/>
    A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.</p>
<p>Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche<br/>
    Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia<br/>
    To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.</p>
<p>O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;<br/>
    Still farther would I speak, but am afraid<br/>
    Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready."</p>
<p>And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,<br/>
    Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,<br/>
    Said: "Stand aside there, thou malicious bird."</p>
<p>"If you desire either to see or hear,"<br/>
    The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,<br/>
    "Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.</p>
<p>But let the Malebranche cease a little,<br/>
    So that these may not their revenges fear,<br/>
    And I, down sitting in this very place,</p>
<p>For one that I am will make seven come,<br/>
    When I shall whistle, as our custom is<br/>
    To do whenever one of us comes out."</p>
<p>Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,<br/>
    Shaking his head, and said: "Just hear the trick<br/>
    Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!"</p>
<p>Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,<br/>
    Responded: "I by far too cunning am,<br/>
    When I procure for mine a greater sadness."</p>
<p>Alichin held not in, but running counter<br/>
    Unto the rest, said to him: "If thou dive,<br/>
    I will not follow thee upon the gallop,</p>
<p>But I will beat my wings above the pitch;<br/>
    The height be left, and be the bank a shield<br/>
    To see if thou alone dost countervail us."</p>
<p>O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!<br/>
    Each to the other side his eyes averted;<br/>
    He first, who most reluctant was to do it.</p>
<p>The Navarrese selected well his time;<br/>
    Planted his feet on land, and in a moment<br/>
    Leaped, and released himself from their design.</p>
<p>Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,<br/>
    But he most who was cause of the defeat;<br/>
    Therefore he moved, and cried: "Thou art o'ertakern."</p>
<p>But little it availed, for wings could not<br/>
    Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,<br/>
    And, flying, upward he his breast directed;</p>
<p>Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden<br/>
    Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,<br/>
    And upward he returneth cross and weary.</p>
<p>Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina<br/>
    Flying behind him followed close, desirous<br/>
    The other should escape, to have a quarrel.</p>
<p>And when the barrator had disappeared,<br/>
    He turned his talons upon his companion,<br/>
    And grappled with him right above the moat.</p>
<p>But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk<br/>
    To clapperclaw him well; and both of them<br/>
    Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.</p>
<p>A sudden intercessor was the heat;<br/>
    But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,<br/>
    To such degree they had their wings belimed.</p>
<p>Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia<br/>
    Made four of them fly to the other side<br/>
    With all their gaffs, and very speedily</p>
<p>This side and that they to their posts descended;<br/>
    They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,<br/>
    Who were already baked within the crust,</p>
<p>And in this manner busied did we leave them.</p>

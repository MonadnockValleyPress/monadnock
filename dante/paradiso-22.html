<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXII</h3>
<p>Oppressed with stupor, I unto my guide<br/>
    Turned like a little child who always runs<br/>
    For refuge there where he confideth most;</p>
<p>And she, even as a mother who straightway<br/>
    Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy<br/>
    With voice whose wont it is to reassure him,</p>
<p>Said to me: "Knowest thou not thou art in heaven,<br/>
    And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all<br/>
    And what is done here cometh from good zeal?</p>
<p>After what wise the singing would have changed thee<br/>
    And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine,<br/>
    Since that the cry has startled thee so much,</p>
<p>In which if thou hadst understood its prayers<br/>
    Already would be known to thee the vengeance<br/>
    Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest.</p>
<p>The sword above here smiteth not in haste<br/>
    Nor tardily, howe'er it seem to him<br/>
    Who fearing or desiring waits for it.</p>
<p>But turn thee round towards the others now,<br/>
    For very illustrious spirits shalt thou see,<br/>
    If thou thy sight directest as I say."</p>
<p>As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,<br/>
    And saw a hundred spherules that together<br/>
    With mutual rays each other more embellished.</p>
<p>I stood as one who in himself represses<br/>
    The point of his desire, and ventures not<br/>
    To question, he so feareth the too much.</p>
<p>And now the largest and most luculent<br/>
    Among those pearls came forward, that it might<br/>
    Make my desire concerning it content.</p>
<p>Within it then I heard: "If thou couldst see<br/>
    Even as myself the charity that burns<br/>
    Among us, thy conceits would be expressed;</p>
<p>But, that by waiting thou mayst not come late<br/>
    To the high end, I will make answer even<br/>
    Unto the thought of which thou art so chary.</p>
<p>That mountain on whose slope Cassino stands<br/>
    Was frequented of old upon its summit<br/>
    By a deluded folk and ill-disposed;</p>
<p>And I am he who first up thither bore<br/>
    The name of Him who brought upon the earth<br/>
    The truth that so much sublimateth us.</p>
<p>And such abundant grace upon me shone<br/>
    That all the neighbouring towns I drew away<br/>
    From the impious worship that seduced the world.</p>
<p>These other fires, each one of them, were men<br/>
    Contemplative, enkindled by that heat<br/>
    Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up.</p>
<p>Here is Macarius, here is Romualdus,<br/>
    Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters<br/>
    Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart."</p>
<p>And I to him: "The affection which thou showest<br/>
    Speaking with me, and the good countenance<br/>
    Which I behold and note in all your ardours,</p>
<p>In me have so my confidence dilated<br/>
    As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes<br/>
    As far unfolded as it hath the power.</p>
<p>Therefore I pray, and thou assure me, father,<br/>
    If I may so much grace receive, that I<br/>
    May thee behold with countenance unveiled."</p>
<p>He thereupon: "Brother, thy high desire<br/>
    In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled,<br/>
    Where are fulfilled all others and my own.</p>
<p>There perfect is, and ripened, and complete,<br/>
    Every desire; within that one alone<br/>
    Is every part where it has always been;</p>
<p>For it is not in space, nor turns on poles,<br/>
    And unto it our stairway reaches up,<br/>
    Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away.</p>
<p>Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it<br/>
    Extending its supernal part, what time<br/>
    So thronged with angels it appeared to him.</p>
<p>But to ascend it now no one uplifts<br/>
    His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule<br/>
    Below remaineth for mere waste of paper.</p>
<p>The walls that used of old to be an Abbey<br/>
    Are changed to dens of robbers, and the cowls<br/>
    Are sacks filled full of miserable flour.</p>
<p>But heavy usury is not taken up<br/>
    So much against God's pleasure as that fruit<br/>
    Which maketh so insane the heart of monks;</p>
<p>For whatsoever hath the Church in keeping<br/>
    Is for the folk that ask it in God's name,<br/>
    Not for one's kindred or for something worse.</p>
<p>The flesh of mortals is so very soft,<br/>
    That good beginnings down below suffice not<br/>
    From springing of the oak to bearing acorns.</p>
<p>Peter began with neither gold nor silver,<br/>
    And I with orison and abstinence,<br/>
    And Francis with humility his convent.</p>
<p>And if thou lookest at each one's beginning,<br/>
    And then regardest whither he has run,<br/>
    Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown.</p>
<p>In verity the Jordan backward turned,<br/>
    And the sea's fleeing, when God willed were more<br/>
    A wonder to behold, than succour here."</p>
<p>Thus unto me he said; and then withdrew<br/>
    To his own band, and the band closed together;<br/>
    Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt.</p>
<p>The gentle Lady urged me on behind them<br/>
    Up o'er that stairway by a single sign,<br/>
    So did her virtue overcome my nature;</p>
<p>Nor here below, where one goes up and down<br/>
    By natural law, was motion e'er so swift<br/>
    That it could be compared unto my wing.</p>
<p>Reader, as I may unto that devout<br/>
    Triumph return, on whose account I often<br/>
    For my transgressions weep and beat my breast,&mdash;</p>
<p>Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire<br/>
    And drawn it out again, before I saw<br/>
    The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it.</p>
<p>O glorious stars, O light impregnated<br/>
    With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge<br/>
    All of my genius, whatsoe'er it be,</p>
<p>With you was born, and hid himself with you,<br/>
    He who is father of all mortal life,<br/>
    When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;</p>
<p>And then when grace was freely given to me<br/>
    To enter the high wheel which turns you round,<br/>
    Your region was allotted unto me.</p>
<p>To you devoutly at this hour my soul<br/>
    Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire<br/>
    For the stern pass that draws it to itself.</p>
<p>"Thou art so near unto the last salvation,"<br/>
    Thus Beatrice began, "thou oughtest now<br/>
    To have thine eves unclouded and acute;</p>
<p>And therefore, ere thou enter farther in,<br/>
    Look down once more, and see how vast a world<br/>
    Thou hast already put beneath thy feet;</p>
<p>So that thy heart, as jocund as it may,<br/>
    Present itself to the triumphant throng<br/>
    That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether."</p>
<p>I with my sight returned through one and all<br/>
    The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe<br/>
    Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance;</p>
<p>And that opinion I approve as best<br/>
    Which doth account it least; and he who thinks<br/>
    Of something else may truly be called just.</p>
<p>I saw the daughter of Latona shining<br/>
    Without that shadow, which to me was cause<br/>
    That once I had believed her rare and dense.</p>
<p>The aspect of thy son, Hyperion,<br/>
    Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves<br/>
    Around and near him Maia and Dione.</p>
<p>Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove<br/>
    'Twixt son and father, and to me was clear<br/>
    The change that of their whereabout they make;</p>
<p>And all the seven made manifest to me<br/>
    How great they are, and eke how swift they are,<br/>
    And how they are in distant habitations.</p>
<p>The threshing-floor that maketh us so proud,<br/>
    To me revolving with the eternal Twins,<br/>
    Was all apparent made from hill to harbour!</p>
<p>Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned.</p>

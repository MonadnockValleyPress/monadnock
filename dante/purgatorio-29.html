<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXIX</h3>
<p>Singing like unto an enamoured lady<br/>
    She, with the ending of her words, continued:<br/>
    "Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata."</p>
<p>And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone<br/>
    Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous<br/>
    One to avoid and one to see the sun,</p>
<p>She then against the stream moved onward, going<br/>
    Along the bank, and I abreast of her,<br/>
    Her little steps with little steps attending.</p>
<p>Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,<br/>
    When equally the margins gave a turn,<br/>
    In such a way, that to the East I faced.</p>
<p>Nor even thus our way continued far<br/>
    Before the lady wholly turned herself<br/>
    Unto me, saying, "Brother, look and listen!"</p>
<p>And lo! a sudden lustre ran across<br/>
    On every side athwart the spacious forest,<br/>
    Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.</p>
<p>But since the lightning ceases as it comes,<br/>
    And that continuing brightened more and more,<br/>
    Within my thought I said, "What thing is this?"</p>
<p>And a delicious melody there ran<br/>
    Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal<br/>
    Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;</p>
<p>For there where earth and heaven obedient were,<br/>
    The woman only, and but just created,<br/>
    Could not endure to stay 'neath any veil;</p>
<p>Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,<br/>
    I sooner should have tasted those delights<br/>
    Ineffable, and for a longer time.</p>
<p>While 'mid such manifold first-fruits I walked<br/>
    Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,<br/>
    And still solicitous of more delights,</p>
<p>In front of us like an enkindled fire<br/>
    Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,<br/>
    And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.</p>
<p>O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,<br/>
    Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,<br/>
    The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!</p>
<p>Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,<br/>
    And with her choir Urania must assist me,<br/>
    To put in verse things difficult to think.</p>
<p>A little farther on, seven trees of gold<br/>
    In semblance the long space still intervening<br/>
    Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;</p>
<p>But when I had approached so near to them<br/>
    The common object, which the sense deceives,<br/>
    Lost not by distance any of its marks,</p>
<p>The faculty that lends discourse to reason<br/>
    Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,<br/>
    And in the voices of the song "Hosanna!"</p>
<p>Above them flamed the harness beautiful,<br/>
    Far brighter than the moon in the serene<br/>
    Of midnight, at the middle of her month.</p>
<p>I turned me round, with admiration filled,<br/>
    To good Virgilius, and he answered me<br/>
    With visage no less full of wonderment.</p>
<p>Then back I turned my face to those high things,<br/>
    Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,<br/>
    They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.</p>
<p>The lady chid me: "Why dost thou burn only<br/>
    So with affection for the living lights,<br/>
    And dost not look at what comes after them?"</p>
<p>Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,<br/>
    Coming behind them, garmented in white,<br/>
    And such a whiteness never was on earth.</p>
<p>The water on my left flank was resplendent,<br/>
    And back to me reflected my left side,<br/>
    E'en as a mirror, if I looked therein.</p>
<p>When I upon my margin had such post<br/>
    That nothing but the stream divided us,<br/>
    Better to see I gave my steps repose;</p>
<p>And I beheld the flamelets onward go,<br/>
    Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,<br/>
    And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,</p>
<p>So that it overhead remained distinct<br/>
    With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours<br/>
    Whence the sun's bow is made, and Delia's girdle.</p>
<p>These standards to the rearward longer were<br/>
    Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,<br/>
    Ten paces were the outermost apart.</p>
<p>Under so fair a heaven as I describe<br/>
    The four and twenty Elders, two by two,<br/>
    Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.</p>
<p>They all of them were singing: "Blessed thou<br/>
    Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed<br/>
    For evermore shall be thy loveliness."</p>
<p>After the flowers and other tender grasses<br/>
    In front of me upon the other margin<br/>
    Were disencumbered of that race elect,</p>
<p>Even as in heaven star followeth after star,<br/>
    There came close after them four animals,<br/>
    Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.</p>
<p>Plumed with six wings was every one of them,<br/>
    The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus<br/>
    If they were living would be such as these.</p>
<p>Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste<br/>
    My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,<br/>
    That I in this cannot be prodigal.</p>
<p>But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them<br/>
    As he beheld them from the region cold<br/>
    Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;</p>
<p>And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,<br/>
    Such were they here; saving that in their plumage<br/>
    John is with me, and differeth from him.</p>
<p>The interval between these four contained<br/>
    A chariot triumphal on two wheels,<br/>
    Which by a Griffin's neck came drawn along;</p>
<p>And upward he extended both his wings<br/>
    Between the middle list and three and three,<br/>
    So that he injured none by cleaving it.</p>
<p>So high they rose that they were lost to sight;<br/>
    His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,<br/>
    And white the others with vermilion mingled.</p>
<p>Not only Rome with no such splendid car<br/>
    E'er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,<br/>
    But poor to it that of the Sun would be,&mdash;</p>
<p>That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up<br/>
    At the importunate orison of Earth,<br/>
    When Jove was so mysteriously just.</p>
<p>Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle<br/>
    Came onward dancing; one so very red<br/>
    That in the fire she hardly had been noted.</p>
<p>The second was as if her flesh and bones<br/>
    Had all been fashioned out of emerald;<br/>
    The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.</p>
<p>And now they seemed conducted by the white,<br/>
    Now by the red, and from the song of her<br/>
    The others took their step, or slow or swift.</p>
<p>Upon the left hand four made holiday<br/>
    Vested in purple, following the measure<br/>
    Of one of them with three eyes m her head.</p>
<p>In rear of all the group here treated of<br/>
    Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,<br/>
    But like in gait, each dignified and grave.</p>
<p>One showed himself as one of the disciples<br/>
    Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature<br/>
    Made for the animals she holds most dear;</p>
<p>Contrary care the other manifested,<br/>
    With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused<br/>
    Terror to me on this side of the river.</p>
<p>Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,<br/>
    And behind all an aged man alone<br/>
    Walking in sleep with countenance acute.</p>
<p>And like the foremost company these seven<br/>
    Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce<br/>
    No garland round about the head they wore,</p>
<p>But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;<br/>
    At little distance would the sight have sworn<br/>
    That all were in a flame above their brows.</p>
<p>And when the car was opposite to me<br/>
    Thunder was heard; and all that folk august<br/>
    Seemed to have further progress interdicted,</p>
<p>There with the vanward ensigns standing still.</p>

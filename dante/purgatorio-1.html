<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto I</h3>
<p>To run o'er better waters hoists its sail<br/>
    The little vessel of my genius now,<br/>
    That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;</p>
<p>And of that second kingdom will I sing<br/>
    Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,<br/>
    And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.</p>
<p>But let dead Poesy here rise again,<br/>
    O holy Muses, since that I am yours,<br/>
    And here Calliope somewhat ascend,</p>
<p>My song accompanying with that sound,<br/>
    Of which the miserable magpies felt<br/>
    The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.</p>
<p>Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire,<br/>
    That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect<br/>
    Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,</p>
<p>Unto mine eyes did recommence delight<br/>
    Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,<br/>
    Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.</p>
<p>The beauteous planet, that to love incites,<br/>
    Was making all the orient to laugh,<br/>
    Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.</p>
<p>To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind<br/>
    Upon the other pole, and saw four stars<br/>
    Ne'er seen before save by the primal people.</p>
<p>Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.<br/>
    O thou septentrional and widowed site,<br/>
    Because thou art deprived of seeing these!</p>
<p>When from regarding them I had withdrawn,<br/>
    Turning a little to the other pole,<br/>
    There where the Wain had disappeared already,</p>
<p>I saw beside me an old man alone,<br/>
    Worthy of so much reverence in his look,<br/>
    That more owes not to father any son.</p>
<p>A long beard and with white hair intermingled<br/>
    He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,<br/>
    Of which a double list fell on his breast.</p>
<p>The rays of the four consecrated stars<br/>
    Did so adorn his countenance with light,<br/>
    That him I saw as were the sun before him.</p>
<p>"Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,<br/>
    Have fled away from the eternal prison?"<br/>
    Moving those venerable plumes, he said:</p>
<p>"Who guided you? or who has been your lamp<br/>
    In issuing forth out of the night profound,<br/>
    That ever black makes the infernal valley?</p>
<p>The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?<br/>
    Or is there changed in heaven some council new,<br/>
    That being damned ye come unto my crags?"</p>
<p>Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,<br/>
    And with his words, and with his hands and signs,<br/>
    Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;</p>
<p>Then answered him: "I came not of myself;<br/>
    A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers<br/>
    I aided this one with my company.</p>
<p>But since it is thy will more be unfolded<br/>
    Of our condition, how it truly is,<br/>
    Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.</p>
<p>This one has never his last evening seen,<br/>
    But by his folly was so near to it<br/>
    That very little time was there to turn.</p>
<p>As I have said, I unto him was sent<br/>
    To rescue him, and other way was none<br/>
    Than this to which I have myself betaken.</p>
<p>I've shown him all the people of perdition,<br/>
    And now those spirits I intend to show<br/>
    Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.</p>
<p>How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.<br/>
    Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me<br/>
    To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.</p>
<p>Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;<br/>
    He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,<br/>
    As knoweth he who life for her refuses.</p>
<p>Thou know'st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter<br/>
    Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave<br/>
    The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.</p>
<p>By us the eternal edicts are not broken;<br/>
    Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;<br/>
    But of that circle I, where are the chaste</p>
<p>Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,<br/>
    O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;<br/>
    For her love, then, incline thyself to us.</p>
<p>Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;<br/>
    I will take back this grace from thee to her,<br/>
    If to be mentioned there below thou deignest."</p>
<p>"Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes<br/>
    While I was on the other side," then said he,<br/>
    "That every grace she wished of me I granted;</p>
<p>Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,<br/>
    She can no longer move me, by that law<br/>
    Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.</p>
<p>But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,<br/>
    As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;<br/>
    Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.</p>
<p>Go, then, and see thou gird this one about<br/>
    With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,<br/>
    So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,</p>
<p>For 'twere not fitting that the eye o'ercast<br/>
    By any mist should go before the first<br/>
    Angel, who is of those of Paradise.</p>
<p>This little island round about its base<br/>
    Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,<br/>
    Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;</p>
<p>No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,<br/>
    Or that doth indurate, can there have life,<br/>
    Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.</p>
<p>Thereafter be not this way your return;<br/>
    The sun, which now is rising, will direct you<br/>
    To take the mount by easier ascent."</p>
<p>With this he vanished; and I raised me up<br/>
    Without a word, and wholly drew myself<br/>
    Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.</p>
<p>And he began: "Son, follow thou my steps;<br/>
    Let us turn back, for on this side declines<br/>
    The plain unto its lower boundaries."</p>
<p>The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour<br/>
    Which fled before it, so that from afar<br/>
    I recognised the trembling of the sea.</p>
<p>Along the solitary plain we went<br/>
    As one who unto the lost road returns,<br/>
    And till he finds it seems to go in vain.</p>
<p>As soon as we were come to where the dew<br/>
    Fights with the sun, and, being in a part<br/>
    Where shadow falls, little evaporates,</p>
<p>Both of his hands upon the grass outspread<br/>
    In gentle manner did my Master place;<br/>
    Whence I, who of his action was aware,</p>
<p>Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;<br/>
    There did he make in me uncovered wholly<br/>
    That hue which Hell had covered up in me.</p>
<p>Then came we down upon the desert shore<br/>
    Which never yet saw navigate its waters<br/>
    Any that afterward had known return.</p>
<p>There he begirt me as the other pleased;<br/>
    O marvellous! for even as he culled<br/>
    The humble plant, such it sprang up again</p>
<p>Suddenly there where he uprooted it.</p>

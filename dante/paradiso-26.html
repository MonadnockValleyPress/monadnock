<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXVI</h3>
<p>While I was doubting for my vision quenched,<br/>
    Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it<br/>
    Issued a breathing, that attentive made me,</p>
<p>Saying: "While thou recoverest the sense<br/>
    Of seeing which in me thou hast consumed,<br/>
    'Tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it.</p>
<p>Begin then, and declare to what thy soul<br/>
    Is aimed, and count it for a certainty,<br/>
    Sight is in thee bewildered and not dead;</p>
<p>Because the Lady, who through this divine<br/>
    Region conducteth thee, has in her look<br/>
    The power the hand of Ananias had."</p>
<p>I said: "As pleaseth her, or soon or late<br/>
    Let the cure come to eyes that portals were<br/>
    When she with fire I ever burn with entered.</p>
<p>The Good, that gives contentment to this Court,<br/>
    The Alpha and Omega is of all<br/>
    The writing that love reads me low or loud."</p>
<p>The selfsame voice, that taken had from me<br/>
    The terror of the sudden dazzlement,<br/>
    To speak still farther put it in my thought;</p>
<p>And said: "In verity with finer sieve<br/>
    Behoveth thee to sift; thee it behoveth<br/>
    To say who aimed thy bow at such a target."</p>
<p>And I: "By philosophic arguments,<br/>
    And by authority that hence descends,<br/>
    Such love must needs imprint itself in me;</p>
<p>For Good, so far as good, when comprehended<br/>
    Doth straight enkindle love, and so much greater<br/>
    As more of goodness in itself it holds;</p>
<p>Then to that Essence (whose is such advantage<br/>
    That every good which out of it is found<br/>
    Is nothing but a ray of its own light)</p>
<p>More than elsewhither must the mind be moved<br/>
    Of every one, in loving, who discerns<br/>
    The truth in which this evidence is founded.</p>
<p>Such truth he to my intellect reveals<br/>
    Who demonstrates to me the primal love<br/>
    Of all the sempiternal substances.</p>
<p>The voice reveals it of the truthful Author,<br/>
    Who says to Moses, speaking of Himself,<br/>
    'I will make all my goodness pass before thee.'</p>
<p>Thou too revealest it to me, beginning<br/>
    The loud Evangel, that proclaims the secret<br/>
    Of heaven to earth above all other edict."</p>
<p>And I heard say: "By human intellect<br/>
    And by authority concordant with it,<br/>
    Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest.</p>
<p>But say again if other cords thou feelest,<br/>
    Draw thee towards Him, that thou mayst proclaim<br/>
    With how many teeth this love is biting thee."</p>
<p>The holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ<br/>
    Not latent was, nay, rather I perceived<br/>
    Whither he fain would my profession lead.</p>
<p>Therefore I recommenced: "All of those bites<br/>
    Which have the power to turn the heart to God<br/>
    Unto my charity have been concurrent.</p>
<p>The being of the world, and my own being,<br/>
    The death which He endured that I may live,<br/>
    And that which all the faithful hope, as I do,</p>
<p>With the forementioned vivid consciousness<br/>
    Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse,<br/>
    And of the right have placed me on the shore.</p>
<p>The leaves, wherewith embowered is all the garden<br/>
    Of the Eternal Gardener, do I love<br/>
    As much as he has granted them of good."</p>
<p>As soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet<br/>
    Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady<br/>
    Said with the others, "Holy, holy, holy!"</p>
<p>And as at some keen light one wakes from sleep<br/>
    By reason of the visual spirit that runs<br/>
    Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat,</p>
<p>And he who wakes abhorreth what he sees,<br/>
    So all unconscious is his sudden waking,<br/>
    Until the judgment cometh to his aid,</p>
<p>So from before mine eyes did Beatrice<br/>
    Chase every mote with radiance of her own,<br/>
    That cast its light a thousand miles and more.</p>
<p>Whence better after than before I saw,<br/>
    And in a kind of wonderment I asked<br/>
    About a fourth light that I saw with us.</p>
<p>And said my Lady: "There within those rays<br/>
    Gazes upon its Maker the first soul<br/>
    That ever the first virtue did create."</p>
<p>Even as the bough that downward bends its top<br/>
    At transit of the wind, and then is lifted<br/>
    By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,</p>
<p>Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,<br/>
    Being amazed, and then I was made bold<br/>
    By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.</p>
<p>And I began: "O apple, that mature<br/>
    Alone hast been produced, O ancient father,<br/>
    To whom each wife is daughter and daughter-in-law,</p>
<p>Devoutly as I can I supplicate thee<br/>
    That thou wouldst speak to me; thou seest my wish;<br/>
    And I, to hear thee quickly, speak it not."</p>
<p>Sometimes an animal, when covered, struggles<br/>
    So that his impulse needs must be apparent,<br/>
    By reason of the wrappage following it;</p>
<p>And in like manner the primeval soul<br/>
    Made clear to me athwart its covering<br/>
    How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.</p>
<p>Then breathed: "Without thy uttering it to me,<br/>
    Thine inclination better I discern<br/>
    Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee;</p>
<p>For I behold it in the truthful mirror,<br/>
    That of Himself all things parhelion makes,<br/>
    And none makes Him parhelion of itself.</p>
<p>Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me<br/>
    Within the lofty garden, where this Lady<br/>
    Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.</p>
<p>And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure,<br/>
    And of the great disdain the proper cause,<br/>
    And the language that I used and that I made.</p>
<p>Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree<br/>
    Not in itself was cause of so great exile,<br/>
    But solely the o'erstepping of the bounds.</p>
<p>There, whence thy Lady moved Virgilius,<br/>
    Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits<br/>
    Made by the sun, this Council I desired;</p>
<p>And him I saw return to all the lights<br/>
    Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty,<br/>
    Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying.</p>
<p>The language that I spake was quite extinct<br/>
    Before that in the work interminable<br/>
    The people under Nimrod were employed;</p>
<p>For nevermore result of reasoning<br/>
    (Because of human pleasure that doth change,<br/>
    Obedient to the heavens) was durable.</p>
<p>A natural action is it that man speaks;<br/>
    But whether thus or thus, doth nature leave<br/>
    To your own art, as seemeth best to you.</p>
<p>Ere I descended to the infernal anguish,<br/>
    'El' was on earth the name of the Chief Good,<br/>
    From whom comes all the joy that wraps me round</p>
<p>'Eli' he then was called, and that is proper,<br/>
    Because the use of men is like a leaf<br/>
    On bough, which goeth and another cometh.</p>
<p>Upon the mount that highest o'er the wave<br/>
    Rises was I, in life or pure or sinful,<br/>
    From the first hour to that which is the second,</p>
<p>As the sun changes quadrant, to the sixth."</p>

<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXXI</h3>
<p>In fashion then as of a snow-white rose<br/>
    Displayed itself to me the saintly host,<br/>
    Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride,</p>
<p>But the other host, that flying sees and sings<br/>
    The glory of Him who doth enamour it,<br/>
    And the goodness that created it so noble,</p>
<p>Even as a swarm of bees, that sinks in flowers<br/>
    One moment, and the next returns again<br/>
    To where its labour is to sweetness turned,</p>
<p>Sank into the great flower, that is adorned<br/>
    With leaves so many, and thence reascended<br/>
    To where its love abideth evermore.</p>
<p>Their faces had they all of living flame,<br/>
    And wings of gold, and all the rest so white<br/>
    No snow unto that limit doth attain.</p>
<p>From bench to bench, into the flower descending,<br/>
    They carried something of the peace and ardour<br/>
    Which by the fanning of their flanks they won.</p>
<p>Nor did the interposing 'twixt the flower<br/>
    And what was o'er it of such plenitude<br/>
    Of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour;</p>
<p>Because the light divine so penetrates<br/>
    The universe, according to its merit,<br/>
    That naught can be an obstacle against it.</p>
<p>This realm secure and full of gladsomeness,<br/>
    Crowded with ancient people and with modern,<br/>
    Unto one mark had all its look and love.</p>
<p>O Trinal Light, that in a single star<br/>
    Sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them,<br/>
    Look down upon our tempest here below!</p>
<p>If the barbarians, coming from some region<br/>
    That every day by Helice is covered,<br/>
    Revolving with her son whom she delights in,</p>
<p>Beholding Rome and all her noble works,<br/>
    Were wonder-struck, what time the Lateran<br/>
    Above all mortal things was eminent,&mdash;</p>
<p>I who to the divine had from the human,<br/>
    From time unto eternity, had come,<br/>
    From Florence to a people just and sane,</p>
<p>With what amazement must I have been filled!<br/>
    Truly between this and the joy, it was<br/>
    My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute.</p>
<p>And as a pilgrim who delighteth him<br/>
    In gazing round the temple of his vow,<br/>
    And hopes some day to retell how it was,</p>
<p>So through the living light my way pursuing<br/>
    Directed I mine eyes o'er all the ranks,<br/>
    Now up, now down, and now all round about.</p>
<p>Faces I saw of charity persuasive,<br/>
    Embellished by His light and their own smile,<br/>
    And attitudes adorned with every grace.</p>
<p>The general form of Paradise already<br/>
    My glance had comprehended as a whole,<br/>
    In no part hitherto remaining fixed,</p>
<p>And round I turned me with rekindled wish<br/>
    My Lady to interrogate of things<br/>
    Concerning which my mind was in suspense.</p>
<p>One thing I meant, another answered me;<br/>
    I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw<br/>
    An Old Man habited like the glorious people.</p>
<p>O'erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks<br/>
    With joy benign, in attitude of pity<br/>
    As to a tender father is becoming.</p>
<p>And "She, where is she?" instantly I said;<br/>
    Whence he: "To put an end to thy desire,<br/>
    Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place.</p>
<p>And if thou lookest up to the third round<br/>
    Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her<br/>
    Upon the throne her merits have assigned her."</p>
<p>Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,<br/>
    And saw her, as she made herself a crown<br/>
    Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.</p>
<p>Not from that region which the highest thunders<br/>
    Is any mortal eye so far removed,<br/>
    In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,</p>
<p>As there from Beatrice my sight; but this<br/>
    Was nothing unto me; because her image<br/>
    Descended not to me by medium blurred.</p>
<p>"O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,<br/>
    And who for my salvation didst endure<br/>
    In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,</p>
<p>Of whatsoever things I have beheld,<br/>
    As coming from thy power and from thy goodness<br/>
    I recognise the virtue and the grace.</p>
<p>Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,<br/>
    By all those ways, by all the expedients,<br/>
    Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.</p>
<p>Preserve towards me thy magnificence,<br/>
    So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,<br/>
    Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body."</p>
<p>Thus I implored; and she, so far away,<br/>
    Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;<br/>
    Then unto the eternal fountain turned.</p>
<p>And said the Old Man holy: "That thou mayst<br/>
    Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,<br/>
    Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,</p>
<p>Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden;<br/>
    For seeing it will discipline thy sight<br/>
    Farther to mount along the ray divine.</p>
<p>And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn<br/>
    Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,<br/>
    Because that I her faithful Bernard am."</p>
<p>As he who peradventure from Croatia<br/>
    Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,<br/>
    Who through its ancient fame is never sated,</p>
<p>But says in thought, the while it is displayed,<br/>
    "My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,<br/>
    Now was your semblance made like unto this?"</p>
<p>Even such was I while gazing at the living<br/>
    Charity of the man, who in this world<br/>
    By contemplation tasted of that peace.</p>
<p>"Thou son of grace, this jocund life," began he,<br/>
    "Will not be known to thee by keeping ever<br/>
    Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;</p>
<p>But mark the circles to the most remote,<br/>
    Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen<br/>
    To whom this realm is subject and devoted."</p>
<p>I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn<br/>
    The oriental part of the horizon<br/>
    Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,</p>
<p>Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale<br/>
    To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness<br/>
    Surpass in splendour all the other front.</p>
<p>And even as there where we await the pole<br/>
    That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more<br/>
    The light, and is on either side diminished,</p>
<p>So likewise that pacific oriflamme<br/>
    Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side<br/>
    In equal measure did the flame abate.</p>
<p>And at that centre, with their wings expanded,<br/>
    More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,<br/>
    Each differing in effulgence and in kind.</p>
<p>I saw there at their sports and at their songs<br/>
    A beauty smiling, which the gladness was<br/>
    Within the eyes of all the other saints;</p>
<p>And if I had in speaking as much wealth<br/>
    As in imagining, I should not dare<br/>
    To attempt the smallest part of its delight.</p>
<p>Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes<br/>
    Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour,<br/>
    His own with such affection turned to her</p>
<p>That it made mine more ardent to behold.</p>

<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXXIV</h3>
<p>"'Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni'<br/>
    Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,"<br/>
    My Master said, "if thou discernest him."</p>
<p>As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when<br/>
    Our hemisphere is darkening into night,<br/>
    Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,</p>
<p>Methought that such a building then I saw;<br/>
    And, for the wind, I drew myself behind<br/>
    My Guide, because there was no other shelter.</p>
<p>Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,<br/>
    There where the shades were wholly covered up,<br/>
    And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.</p>
<p>Some prone are lying, others stand erect,<br/>
    This with the head, and that one with the soles;<br/>
    Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.</p>
<p>When in advance so far we had proceeded,<br/>
    That it my Master pleased to show to me<br/>
    The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,</p>
<p>He from before me moved and made me stop,<br/>
    Saying: "Behold Dis, and behold the place<br/>
    Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself."</p>
<p>How frozen I became and powerless then,<br/>
    Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,<br/>
    Because all language would be insufficient.</p>
<p>I did not die, and I alive remained not;<br/>
    Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,<br/>
    What I became, being of both deprived.</p>
<p>The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous<br/>
    From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;<br/>
    And better with a giant I compare</p>
<p>Than do the giants with those arms of his;<br/>
    Consider now how great must be that whole,<br/>
    Which unto such a part conforms itself.</p>
<p>Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,<br/>
    And lifted up his brow against his Maker,<br/>
    Well may proceed from him all tribulation.</p>
<p>O, what a marvel it appeared to me,<br/>
    When I beheld three faces on his head!<br/>
    The one in front, and that vermilion was;</p>
<p>Two were the others, that were joined with this<br/>
    Above the middle part of either shoulder,<br/>
    And they were joined together at the crest;</p>
<p>And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;<br/>
    The left was such to look upon as those<br/>
    Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.</p>
<p>Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,<br/>
    Such as befitting were so great a bird;<br/>
    Sails of the sea I never saw so large.</p>
<p>No feathers had they, but as of a bat<br/>
    Their fashion was; and he was waving them,<br/>
    So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.</p>
<p>Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.<br/>
    With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins<br/>
    Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.</p>
<p>At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching<br/>
    A sinner, in the manner of a brake,<br/>
    So that he three of them tormented thus.</p>
<p>To him in front the biting was as naught<br/>
    Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine<br/>
    Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.</p>
<p>"That soul up there which has the greatest pain,"<br/>
    The Master said, "is Judas Iscariot;<br/>
    With head inside, he plies his legs without.</p>
<p>Of the two others, who head downward are,<br/>
    The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;<br/>
    See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.</p>
<p>And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.<br/>
    But night is reascending, and 'tis time<br/>
    That we depart, for we have seen the whole."</p>
<p>As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,<br/>
    And he the vantage seized of time and place,<br/>
    And when the wings were opened wide apart,</p>
<p>He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;<br/>
    From fell to fell descended downward then<br/>
    Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.</p>
<p>When we were come to where the thigh revolves<br/>
    Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,<br/>
    The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,</p>
<p>Turned round his head where he had had his legs,<br/>
    And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,<br/>
    So that to Hell I thought we were returning.</p>
<p>"Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,"<br/>
    The Master said, panting as one fatigued,<br/>
    "Must we perforce depart from so much evil."</p>
<p>Then through the opening of a rock he issued,<br/>
    And down upon the margin seated me;<br/>
    Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.</p>
<p>I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see<br/>
    Lucifer in the same way I had left him;<br/>
    And I beheld him upward hold his legs.</p>
<p>And if I then became disquieted,<br/>
    Let stolid people think who do not see<br/>
    What the point is beyond which I had passed.</p>
<p>"Rise up," the Master said, "upon thy feet;<br/>
    The way is long, and difficult the road,<br/>
    And now the sun to middle-tierce returns."</p>
<p>It was not any palace corridor<br/>
    There where we were, but dungeon natural,<br/>
    With floor uneven and unease of light.</p>
<p>"Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,<br/>
    My Master," said I when I had arisen,<br/>
    "To draw me from an error speak a little;</p>
<p>Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed<br/>
    Thus upside down? and how in such short time<br/>
    From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "Thou still imaginest<br/>
    Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped<br/>
    The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.</p>
<p>That side thou wast, so long as I descended;<br/>
    When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point<br/>
    To which things heavy draw from every side,</p>
<p>And now beneath the hemisphere art come<br/>
    Opposite that which overhangs the vast<br/>
    Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death</p>
<p>The Man who without sin was born and lived.<br/>
    Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere<br/>
    Which makes the other face of the Judecca.</p>
<p>Here it is morn when it is evening there;<br/>
    And he who with his hair a stairway made us<br/>
    Still fixed remaineth as he was before.</p>
<p>Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;<br/>
    And all the land, that whilom here emerged,<br/>
    For fear of him made of the sea a veil,</p>
<p>And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure<br/>
    To flee from him, what on this side appears<br/>
    Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled."</p>
<p>A place there is below, from Beelzebub<br/>
    As far receding as the tomb extends,<br/>
    Which not by sight is known, but by the sound</p>
<p>Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth<br/>
    Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed<br/>
    With course that winds about and slightly falls.</p>
<p>The Guide and I into that hidden road<br/>
    Now entered, to return to the bright world;<br/>
    And without care of having any rest</p>
<p>We mounted up, he first and I the second,<br/>
    Till I beheld through a round aperture<br/>
    Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;</p>
<p>Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.</p>

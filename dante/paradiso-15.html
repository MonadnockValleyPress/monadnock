<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XV</h3>
<p>A will benign, in which reveals itself<br/>
    Ever the love that righteously inspires,<br/>
    As in the iniquitous, cupidity,</p>
<p>Silence imposed upon that dulcet lyre,<br/>
    And quieted the consecrated chords,<br/>
    That Heaven's right hand doth tighten and relax.</p>
<p>How unto just entreaties shall be deaf<br/>
    Those substances, which, to give me desire<br/>
    Of praying them, with one accord grew silent?</p>
<p>'Tis well that without end he should lament,<br/>
    Who for the love of thing that doth not last<br/>
    Eternally despoils him of that love!</p>
<p>As through the pure and tranquil evening air<br/>
    There shoots from time to time a sudden fire,<br/>
    Moving the eyes that steadfast were before,</p>
<p>And seems to be a star that changeth place,<br/>
    Except that in the part where it is kindled<br/>
    Nothing is missed, and this endureth little;</p>
<p>So from the horn that to the right extends<br/>
    Unto that cross's foot there ran a star<br/>
    Out of the constellation shining there;</p>
<p>Nor was the gem dissevered from its ribbon,<br/>
    But down the radiant fillet ran along,<br/>
    So that fire seemed it behind alabaster.</p>
<p>Thus piteous did Anchises' shade reach forward,<br/>
    If any faith our greatest Muse deserve,<br/>
    When in Elysium he his son perceived.</p>
<p>"O sanguis meus, O superinfusa<br/>
    Gratia Dei, sicut tibi, cui<br/>
    Bis unquam Coeli janua reclusa?"</p>
<p>Thus that effulgence; whence I gave it heed;<br/>
    Then round unto my Lady turned my sight,<br/>
    And on this side and that was stupefied;</p>
<p>For in her eyes was burning such a smile<br/>
    That with mine own methought I touched the bottom<br/>
    Both of my grace and of my Paradise!</p>
<p>Then, pleasant to the hearing and the sight,<br/>
    The spirit joined to its beginning things<br/>
    I understood not, so profound it spake;</p>
<p>Nor did it hide itself from me by choice,<br/>
    But by necessity; for its conception<br/>
    Above the mark of mortals set itself.</p>
<p>And when the bow of burning sympathy<br/>
    Was so far slackened, that its speech descended<br/>
    Towards the mark of our intelligence,</p>
<p>The first thing that was understood by me<br/>
    Was "Benedight be Thou, O Trine and One,<br/>
    Who hast unto my seed so courteous been!"</p>
<p>And it continued: "Hunger long and grateful,<br/>
    Drawn from the reading of the mighty volume<br/>
    Wherein is never changed the white nor dark,</p>
<p>Thou hast appeased, my son, within this light<br/>
    In which I speak to thee, by grace of her<br/>
    Who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee.</p>
<p>Thou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass<br/>
    From Him who is the first, as from the unit,<br/>
    If that be known, ray out the five and six;</p>
<p>And therefore who I am thou askest not,<br/>
    And why I seem more joyous unto thee<br/>
    Than any other of this gladsome crowd.</p>
<p>Thou think'st the truth; because the small and great<br/>
    Of this existence look into the mirror<br/>
    Wherein, before thou think'st, thy thought thou showest.</p>
<p>But that the sacred love, in which I watch<br/>
    With sight perpetual, and which makes me thirst<br/>
    With sweet desire, may better be fulfilled,</p>
<p>Now let thy voice secure and frank and glad<br/>
    Proclaim the wishes, the desire proclaim,<br/>
    To which my answer is decreed already."</p>
<p>To Beatrice I turned me, and she heard<br/>
    Before I spake, and smiled to me a sign,<br/>
    That made the wings of my desire increase;</p>
<p>Then in this wise began I: "Love and knowledge,<br/>
    When on you dawned the first Equality,<br/>
    Of the same weight for each of you became;</p>
<p>For in the Sun, which lighted you and burned<br/>
    With heat and radiance, they so equal are,<br/>
    That all similitudes are insufficient.</p>
<p>But among mortals will and argument,<br/>
    For reason that to you is manifest,<br/>
    Diversely feathered in their pinions are.</p>
<p>Whence I, who mortal am, feel in myself<br/>
    This inequality; so give not thanks,<br/>
    Save in my heart, for this paternal welcome.</p>
<p>Truly do I entreat thee, living topaz!<br/>
    Set in this precious jewel as a gem,<br/>
    That thou wilt satisfy me with thy name."</p>
<p>"O leaf of mine, in whom I pleasure took<br/>
    E'en while awaiting, I was thine own root!"<br/>
    Such a beginning he in answer made me.</p>
<p>Then said to me: "That one from whom is named<br/>
    Thy race, and who a hundred years and more<br/>
    Has circled round the mount on the first cornice,</p>
<p>A son of mine and thy great-grandsire was;<br/>
    Well it behoves thee that the long fatigue<br/>
    Thou shouldst for him make shorter with thy works.</p>
<p>Florence, within the ancient boundary<br/>
    From which she taketh still her tierce and nones,<br/>
    Abode in quiet, temperate and chaste.</p>
<p>No golden chain she had, nor coronal,<br/>
    Nor ladies shod with sandal shoon, nor girdle<br/>
    That caught the eye more than the person did.</p>
<p>Not yet the daughter at her birth struck fear<br/>
    Into the father, for the time and dower<br/>
    Did not o'errun this side or that the measure.</p>
<p>No houses had she void of families,<br/>
    Not yet had thither come Sardanapalus<br/>
    To show what in a chamber can be done;</p>
<p>Not yet surpassed had Montemalo been<br/>
    By your Uccellatojo, which surpassed<br/>
    Shall in its downfall be as in its rise.</p>
<p>Bellincion Berti saw I go begirt<br/>
    With leather and with bone, and from the mirror<br/>
    His dame depart without a painted face;</p>
<p>And him of Nerli saw, and him of Vecchio,<br/>
    Contented with their simple suits of buff<br/>
    And with the spindle and the flax their dames.</p>
<p>O fortunate women! and each one was certain<br/>
    Of her own burial-place, and none as yet<br/>
    For sake of France was in her bed deserted.</p>
<p>One o'er the cradle kept her studious watch,<br/>
    And in her lullaby the language used<br/>
    That first delights the fathers and the mothers;</p>
<p>Another, drawing tresses from her distaff,<br/>
    Told o'er among her family the tales<br/>
    Of Trojans and of Fesole and Rome.</p>
<p>As great a marvel then would have been held<br/>
    A Lapo Salterello, a Cianghella,<br/>
    As Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.</p>
<p>To such a quiet, such a beautiful<br/>
    Life of the citizen, to such a safe<br/>
    Community, and to so sweet an inn,</p>
<p>Did Mary give me, with loud cries invoked,<br/>
    And in your ancient Baptistery at once<br/>
    Christian and Cacciaguida I became.</p>
<p>Moronto was my brother, and Eliseo;<br/>
    From Val di Pado came to me my wife,<br/>
    And from that place thy surname was derived.</p>
<p>I followed afterward the Emperor Conrad,<br/>
    And he begirt me of his chivalry,<br/>
    So much I pleased him with my noble deeds.</p>
<p>I followed in his train against that law's<br/>
    Iniquity, whose people doth usurp<br/>
    Your just possession, through your Pastor's fault.</p>
<p>There by that execrable race was I<br/>
    Released from bonds of the fallacious world,<br/>
    The love of which defileth many souls,</p>
<p>And came from martyrdom unto this peace."</p>

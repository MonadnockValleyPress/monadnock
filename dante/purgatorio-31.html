<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXXI</h3>
<p>"O thou who art beyond the sacred river,"<br/>
    Turning to me the point of her discourse,<br/>
    That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,</p>
<p>She recommenced, continuing without pause,<br/>
    "Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,<br/>
    Thy own confession needs must be conjoined."</p>
<p>My faculties were in so great confusion,<br/>
    That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct<br/>
    Than by its organs it was set at large.</p>
<p>Awhile she waited; then she said: "What thinkest?<br/>
    Answer me; for the mournful memories<br/>
    In thee not yet are by the waters injured."</p>
<p>Confusion and dismay together mingled<br/>
    Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight<br/>
    Was needful to the understanding of it.</p>
<p>Even as a cross-bow breaks, when 'tis discharged<br/>
    Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,<br/>
    And with less force the arrow hits the mark,</p>
<p>So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,<br/>
    Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,<br/>
    And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.</p>
<p>Whence she to me: "In those desires of mine<br/>
    Which led thee to the loving of that good,<br/>
    Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,</p>
<p>What trenches lying traverse or what chains<br/>
    Didst thou discover, that of passing onward<br/>
    Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?</p>
<p>And what allurements or what vantages<br/>
    Upon the forehead of the others showed,<br/>
    That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?"</p>
<p>After the heaving of a bitter sigh,<br/>
    Hardly had I the voice to make response,<br/>
    And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.</p>
<p>Weeping I said: "The things that present were<br/>
    With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,<br/>
    Soon as your countenance concealed itself."</p>
<p>And she: "Shouldst thou be silent, or deny<br/>
    What thou confessest, not less manifest<br/>
    Would be thy fault, by such a Judge 'tis known.</p>
<p>But when from one's own cheeks comes bursting forth<br/>
    The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal<br/>
    Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.</p>
<p>But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame<br/>
    For thy transgression, and another time<br/>
    Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,</p>
<p>Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;<br/>
    So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way<br/>
    My buried flesh should have directed thee.</p>
<p>Never to thee presented art or nature<br/>
    Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein<br/>
    I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.</p>
<p>And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee<br/>
    By reason of my death, what mortal thing<br/>
    Should then have drawn thee into its desire?</p>
<p>Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft<br/>
    Of things fallacious to have risen up<br/>
    To follow me, who was no longer such.</p>
<p>Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward<br/>
    To wait for further blows, or little girl,<br/>
    Or other vanity of such brief use.</p>
<p>The callow birdlet waits for two or three,<br/>
    But to the eyes of those already fledged,<br/>
    In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot."</p>
<p>Even as children silent in their shame<br/>
    Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,<br/>
    And conscious of their fault, and penitent;</p>
<p>So was I standing; and she said: "If thou<br/>
    In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard<br/>
    And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing."</p>
<p>With less resistance is a robust holm<br/>
    Uprooted, either by a native wind<br/>
    Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,</p>
<p>Than I upraised at her command my chin;<br/>
    And when she by the beard the face demanded,<br/>
    Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.</p>
<p>And as my countenance was lifted up,<br/>
    Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful<br/>
    Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;</p>
<p>And, still but little reassured, mine eyes<br/>
    Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,<br/>
    That is one person only in two natures.</p>
<p>Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,<br/>
    She seemed to me far more her ancient self<br/>
    To excel, than others here, when she was here.</p>
<p>So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,<br/>
    That of all other things the one which turned me<br/>
    Most to its love became the most my foe.</p>
<p>Such self-conviction stung me at the heart<br/>
    O'erpowered I fell, and what I then became<br/>
    She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.</p>
<p>Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,<br/>
    The lady I had found alone, above me<br/>
    I saw, and she was saying, "Hold me, hold me."</p>
<p>Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,<br/>
    And, dragging me behind her, she was moving<br/>
    Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.</p>
<p>When I was near unto the blessed shore,<br/>
    "Asperges me," I heard so sweetly sung,<br/>
    Remember it I cannot, much less write it.</p>
<p>The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,<br/>
    Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,<br/>
    Where I was forced to swallow of the water.</p>
<p>Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought<br/>
    Into the dance of the four beautiful,<br/>
    And each one with her arm did cover me.</p>
<p>'We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;<br/>
    Ere Beatrice descended to the world,<br/>
    We as her handmaids were appointed her.</p>
<p>We'll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant<br/>
    Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine<br/>
    The three beyond, who more profoundly look.'</p>
<p>Thus singing they began; and afterwards<br/>
    Unto the Griffin's breast they led me with them,<br/>
    Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.</p>
<p>"See that thou dost not spare thine eyes," they said;<br/>
    "Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,<br/>
    Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons."</p>
<p>A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,<br/>
    Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,<br/>
    That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.</p>
<p>As in a glass the sun, not otherwise<br/>
    Within them was the twofold monster shining,<br/>
    Now with the one, now with the other nature.</p>
<p>Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,<br/>
    When I beheld the thing itself stand still,<br/>
    And in its image it transformed itself.</p>
<p>While with amazement filled and jubilant,<br/>
    My soul was tasting of the food, that while<br/>
    It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,</p>
<p>Themselves revealing of the highest rank<br/>
    In bearing, did the other three advance,<br/>
    Singing to their angelic saraband.</p>
<p>"Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,"<br/>
    Such was their song, "unto thy faithful one,<br/>
    Who has to see thee ta'en so many steps.</p>
<p>In grace do us the grace that thou unveil<br/>
    Thy face to him, so that he may discern<br/>
    The second beauty which thou dost conceal."</p>
<p>O splendour of the living light eternal!<br/>
    Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus<br/>
    Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,</p>
<p>He would not seem to have his mind encumbered<br/>
    Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,<br/>
    Where the harmonious heaven o'ershadowed thee,</p>
<p>When in the open air thou didst unveil?</p>

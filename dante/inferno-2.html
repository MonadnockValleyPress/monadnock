<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto II</h3>
<p>Day was departing, and the embrowned air<br/>
    Released the animals that are on earth<br/>
    From their fatigues; and I the only one</p>
<p>Made myself ready to sustain the war,<br/>
    Both of the way and likewise of the woe,<br/>
    Which memory that errs not shall retrace.</p>
<p>O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!<br/>
    O memory, that didst write down what I saw,<br/>
    Here thy nobility shall be manifest!</p>
<p>And I began: "Poet, who guidest me,<br/>
    Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,<br/>
    Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.</p>
<p>Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,<br/>
    While yet corruptible, unto the world<br/>
    Immortal went, and was there bodily.</p>
<p>But if the adversary of all evil<br/>
    Was courteous, thinking of the high effect<br/>
    That issue would from him, and who, and what,</p>
<p>To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;<br/>
    For he was of great Rome, and of her empire<br/>
    In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;</p>
<p>The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,<br/>
    Were stablished as the holy place, wherein<br/>
    Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.</p>
<p>Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,<br/>
    Things did he hear, which the occasion were<br/>
    Both of his victory and the papal mantle.</p>
<p>Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,<br/>
    To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,<br/>
    Which of salvation's way is the beginning.</p>
<p>But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?<br/>
    I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,<br/>
    Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.</p>
<p>Therefore, if I resign myself to come,<br/>
    I fear the coming may be ill-advised;<br/>
    Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak."</p>
<p>And as he is, who unwills what he willed,<br/>
    And by new thoughts doth his intention change,<br/>
    So that from his design he quite withdraws,</p>
<p>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,<br/>
    Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,<br/>
    Which was so very prompt in the beginning.</p>
<p>"If I have well thy language understood,"<br/>
    Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,<br/>
    "Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,</p>
<p>Which many times a man encumbers so,<br/>
    It turns him back from honoured enterprise,<br/>
    As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.</p>
<p>That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,<br/>
    I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard<br/>
    At the first moment when I grieved for thee.</p>
<p>Among those was I who are in suspense,<br/>
    And a fair, saintly Lady called to me<br/>
    In such wise, I besought her to command me.</p>
<p>Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;<br/>
    And she began to say, gentle and low,<br/>
    With voice angelical, in her own language:</p>
<p>'O spirit courteous of Mantua,<br/>
    Of whom the fame still in the world endures,<br/>
    And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;</p>
<p>A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,<br/>
    Upon the desert slope is so impeded<br/>
    Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,</p>
<p>And may, I fear, already be so lost,<br/>
    That I too late have risen to his succour,<br/>
    From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.</p>
<p>Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,<br/>
    And with what needful is for his release,<br/>
    Assist him so, that I may be consoled.</p>
<p>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;<br/>
    I come from there, where I would fain return;<br/>
    Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.</p>
<p>When I shall be in presence of my Lord,<br/>
    Full often will I praise thee unto him.'<br/>
    Then paused she, and thereafter I began:</p>
<p>'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom<br/>
    The human race exceedeth all contained<br/>
    Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,</p>
<p>So grateful unto me is thy commandment,<br/>
    To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;<br/>
    No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.</p>
<p>But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun<br/>
    The here descending down into this centre,<br/>
    From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'</p>
<p>'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,<br/>
    Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,<br/>
    'Why I am not afraid to enter here.</p>
<p>Of those things only should one be afraid<br/>
    Which have the power of doing others harm;<br/>
    Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.</p>
<p>God in his mercy such created me<br/>
    That misery of yours attains me not,<br/>
    Nor any flame assails me of this burning.</p>
<p>A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves<br/>
    At this impediment, to which I send thee,<br/>
    So that stern judgment there above is broken.</p>
<p>In her entreaty she besought Lucia,<br/>
    And said, "Thy faithful one now stands in need<br/>
    Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him."</p>
<p>Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,<br/>
    Hastened away, and came unto the place<br/>
    Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.</p>
<p>"Beatrice" said she, "the true praise of God,<br/>
    Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,<br/>
    For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?</p>
<p>Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?<br/>
    Dost thou not see the death that combats him<br/>
    Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?"</p>
<p>Never were persons in the world so swift<br/>
    To work their weal and to escape their woe,<br/>
    As I, after such words as these were uttered,</p>
<p>Came hither downward from my blessed seat,<br/>
    Confiding in thy dignified discourse,<br/>
    Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'</p>
<p>After she thus had spoken unto me,<br/>
    Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;<br/>
    Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;</p>
<p>And unto thee I came, as she desired;<br/>
    I have delivered thee from that wild beast,<br/>
    Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.</p>
<p>What is it, then? Why, why dost thou delay?<br/>
    Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?<br/>
    Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,</p>
<p>Seeing that three such Ladies benedight<br/>
    Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,<br/>
    And so much good my speech doth promise thee?"</p>
<p>Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,<br/>
    Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,<br/>
    Uplift themselves all open on their stems;</p>
<p>Such I became with my exhausted strength,<br/>
    And such good courage to my heart there coursed,<br/>
    That I began, like an intrepid person:</p>
<p>"O she compassionate, who succoured me,<br/>
    And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon<br/>
    The words of truth which she addressed to thee!</p>
<p>Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed<br/>
    To the adventure, with these words of thine,<br/>
    That to my first intent I have returned.</p>
<p>Now go, for one sole will is in us both,<br/>
    Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou."<br/>
    Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,</p>
<p>I entered on the deep and savage way.</p>

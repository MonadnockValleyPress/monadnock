<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto VII</h3>
<p>"Osanna sanctus Deus Sabaoth,<br/>
    Superillustrans claritate tua<br/>
    Felices ignes horum malahoth!"</p>
<p>In this wise, to his melody returning,<br/>
    This substance, upon which a double light<br/>
    Doubles itself, was seen by me to sing,</p>
<p>And to their dance this and the others moved,<br/>
    And in the manner of swift-hurrying sparks<br/>
    Veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance.</p>
<p>Doubting was I, and saying, "Tell her, tell her,"<br/>
    Within me, "tell her," saying, "tell my Lady,"<br/>
    Who slakes my thirst with her sweet effluences;</p>
<p>And yet that reverence which doth lord it over<br/>
    The whole of me only by B and ICE,<br/>
    Bowed me again like unto one who drowses.</p>
<p>Short while did Beatrice endure me thus;<br/>
    And she began, lighting me with a smile<br/>
    Such as would make one happy in the fire:</p>
<p>"According to infallible advisement,<br/>
    After what manner a just vengeance justly<br/>
    Could be avenged has put thee upon thinking,</p>
<p>But I will speedily thy mind unloose;<br/>
    And do thou listen, for these words of mine<br/>
    Of a great doctrine will a present make thee.</p>
<p>By not enduring on the power that wills<br/>
    Curb for his good, that man who ne'er was born,<br/>
    Damning himself damned all his progeny;</p>
<p>Whereby the human species down below<br/>
    Lay sick for many centuries in great error,<br/>
    Till to descend it pleased the Word of God</p>
<p>To where the nature, which from its own Maker<br/>
    Estranged itself, he joined to him in person<br/>
    By the sole act of his eternal love.</p>
<p>Now unto what is said direct thy sight;<br/>
    This nature when united to its Maker,<br/>
    Such as created, was sincere and good;</p>
<p>But by itself alone was banished forth<br/>
    From Paradise, because it turned aside<br/>
    Out of the way of truth and of its life.</p>
<p>Therefore the penalty the cross held out,<br/>
    If measured by the nature thus assumed,<br/>
    None ever yet with so great justice stung,</p>
<p>And none was ever of so great injustice,<br/>
    Considering who the Person was that suffered,<br/>
    Within whom such a nature was contracted.</p>
<p>From one act therefore issued things diverse;<br/>
    To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing;<br/>
    Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened.</p>
<p>It should no longer now seem difficult<br/>
    To thee, when it is said that a just vengeance<br/>
    By a just court was afterward avenged.</p>
<p>But now do I behold thy mind entangled<br/>
    From thought to thought within a knot, from which<br/>
    With great desire it waits to free itself.</p>
<p>Thou sayest, 'Well discern I what I hear;<br/>
    But it is hidden from me why God willed<br/>
    For our redemption only this one mode.'</p>
<p>Buried remaineth, brother, this decree<br/>
    Unto the eyes of every one whose nature<br/>
    Is in the flame of love not yet adult.</p>
<p>Verily, inasmuch as at this mark<br/>
    One gazes long and little is discerned,<br/>
    Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say.</p>
<p>Goodness Divine, which from itself doth spurn<br/>
    All envy, burning in itself so sparkles<br/>
    That the eternal beauties it unfolds.</p>
<p>Whate'er from this immediately distils<br/>
    Has afterwards no end, for ne'er removed<br/>
    Is its impression when it sets its seal.</p>
<p>Whate'er from this immediately rains down<br/>
    Is wholly free, because it is not subject<br/>
    Unto the influences of novel things.</p>
<p>The more conformed thereto, the more it pleases;<br/>
    For the blest ardour that irradiates all things<br/>
    In that most like itself is most vivacious.</p>
<p>With all of these things has advantaged been<br/>
    The human creature; and if one be wanting,<br/>
    From his nobility he needs must fall.</p>
<p>'Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,<br/>
    And render him unlike the Good Supreme,<br/>
    So that he little with its light is blanched,</p>
<p>And to his dignity no more returns,<br/>
    Unless he fill up where transgression empties<br/>
    With righteous pains for criminal delights.</p>
<p>Your nature when it sinned so utterly<br/>
    In its own seed, out of these dignities<br/>
    Even as out of Paradise was driven,</p>
<p>Nor could itself recover, if thou notest<br/>
    With nicest subtilty, by any way,<br/>
    Except by passing one of these two fords:</p>
<p>Either that God through clemency alone<br/>
    Had pardon granted, or that man himself<br/>
    Had satisfaction for his folly made.</p>
<p>Fix now thine eye deep into the abyss<br/>
    Of the eternal counsel, to my speech<br/>
    As far as may be fastened steadfastly!</p>
<p>Man in his limitations had not power<br/>
    To satisfy, not having power to sink<br/>
    In his humility obeying then,</p>
<p>Far as he disobeying thought to rise;<br/>
    And for this reason man has been from power<br/>
    Of satisfying by himself excluded.</p>
<p>Therefore it God behoved in his own ways<br/>
    Man to restore unto his perfect life,<br/>
    I say in one, or else in both of them.</p>
<p>But since the action of the doer is<br/>
    So much more grateful, as it more presents<br/>
    The goodness of the heart from which it issues,</p>
<p>Goodness Divine, that doth imprint the world,<br/>
    Has been contented to proceed by each<br/>
    And all its ways to lift you up again;</p>
<p>Nor 'twixt the first day and the final night<br/>
    Such high and such magnificent proceeding<br/>
    By one or by the other was or shall be;</p>
<p>For God more bounteous was himself to give<br/>
    To make man able to uplift himself,<br/>
    Than if he only of himself had pardoned;</p>
<p>And all the other modes were insufficient<br/>
    For justice, were it not the Son of God<br/>
    Himself had humbled to become incarnate.</p>
<p>Now, to fill fully each desire of thine,<br/>
    Return I to elucidate one place,<br/>
    In order that thou there mayst see as I do.</p>
<p>Thou sayst: 'I see the air, I see the fire,<br/>
    The water, and the earth, and all their mixtures<br/>
    Come to corruption, and short while endure;</p>
<p>And these things notwithstanding were created;'<br/>
    Therefore if that which I have said were true,<br/>
    They should have been secure against corruption.</p>
<p>The Angels, brother, and the land sincere<br/>
    In which thou art, created may be called<br/>
    Just as they are in their entire existence;</p>
<p>But all the elements which thou hast named,<br/>
    And all those things which out of them are made,<br/>
    By a created virtue are informed.</p>
<p>Created was the matter which they have;<br/>
    Created was the informing influence<br/>
    Within these stars that round about them go.</p>
<p>The soul of every brute and of the plants<br/>
    By its potential temperament attracts<br/>
    The ray and motion of the holy lights;</p>
<p>But your own life immediately inspires<br/>
    Supreme Beneficence, and enamours it<br/>
    So with herself, it evermore desires her.</p>
<p>And thou from this mayst argue furthermore<br/>
    Your resurrection, if thou think again<br/>
    How human flesh was fashioned at that time</p>
<p>When the first parents both of them were made."</p>

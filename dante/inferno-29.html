<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXIX</h3>
<p>The many people and the divers wounds<br/>
    These eyes of mine had so inebriated,<br/>
    That they were wishful to stand still and weep;</p>
<p>But said Virgilius: "What dost thou still gaze at?<br/>
    Why is thy sight still riveted down there<br/>
    Among the mournful, mutilated shades?</p>
<p>Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;<br/>
    Consider, if to count them thou believest,<br/>
    That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,</p>
<p>And now the moon is underneath our feet;<br/>
    Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,<br/>
    And more is to be seen than what thou seest."</p>
<p>"If thou hadst," I made answer thereupon,<br/>
    "Attended to the cause for which I looked,<br/>
    Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned."</p>
<p>Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him<br/>
    I went, already making my reply,<br/>
    And superadding: "In that cavern where</p>
<p>I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,<br/>
    I think a spirit of my blood laments<br/>
    The sin which down below there costs so much."</p>
<p>Then said the Master: "Be no longer broken<br/>
    Thy thought from this time forward upon him;<br/>
    Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;</p>
<p>For him I saw below the little bridge,<br/>
    Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger<br/>
    Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.</p>
<p>So wholly at that time wast thou impeded<br/>
    By him who formerly held Altaforte,<br/>
    Thou didst not look that way; so he departed."</p>
<p>"O my Conductor, his own violent death,<br/>
    Which is not yet avenged for him," I said,<br/>
    "By any who is sharer in the shame,</p>
<p>Made him disdainful; whence he went away,<br/>
    As I imagine, without speaking to me,<br/>
    And thereby made me pity him the more."</p>
<p>Thus did we speak as far as the first place<br/>
    Upon the crag, which the next valley shows<br/>
    Down to the bottom, if there were more light.</p>
<p>When we were now right over the last cloister<br/>
    Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers<br/>
    Could manifest themselves unto our sight,</p>
<p>Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,<br/>
    Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,<br/>
    Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.</p>
<p>What pain would be, if from the hospitals<br/>
    Of Valdichiana, 'twixt July and September,<br/>
    And of Maremma and Sardinia</p>
<p>All the diseases in one moat were gathered,<br/>
    Such was it here, and such a stench came from it<br/>
    As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.</p>
<p>We had descended on the furthest bank<br/>
    From the long crag, upon the left hand still,<br/>
    And then more vivid was my power of sight</p>
<p>Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress<br/>
    Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,<br/>
    Punishes forgers, which she here records.</p>
<p>I do not think a sadder sight to see<br/>
    Was in Aegina the whole people sick,<br/>
    (When was the air so full of pestilence,</p>
<p>The animals, down to the little worm,<br/>
    All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,<br/>
    According as the poets have affirmed,</p>
<p>Were from the seed of ants restored again,)<br/>
    Than was it to behold through that dark valley<br/>
    The spirits languishing in divers heaps.</p>
<p>This on the belly, that upon the back<br/>
    One of the other lay, and others crawling<br/>
    Shifted themselves along the dismal road.</p>
<p>We step by step went onward without speech,<br/>
    Gazing upon and listening to the sick<br/>
    Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.</p>
<p>I saw two sitting leaned against each other,<br/>
    As leans in heating platter against platter,<br/>
    From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;</p>
<p>And never saw I plied a currycomb<br/>
    By stable-boy for whom his master waits,<br/>
    Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,</p>
<p>As every one was plying fast the bite<br/>
    Of nails upon himself, for the great rage<br/>
    Of itching which no other succour had.</p>
<p>And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,<br/>
    In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,<br/>
    Or any other fish that has them largest.</p>
<p>"O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,"<br/>
    Began my Leader unto one of them,<br/>
    "And makest of them pincers now and then,</p>
<p>Tell me if any Latian is with those<br/>
    Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee<br/>
    To all eternity unto this work."</p>
<p>"Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,<br/>
    Both of us here," one weeping made reply;<br/>
    "But who art thou, that questionest about us?"</p>
<p>And said the Guide: "One am I who descends<br/>
    Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,<br/>
    And I intend to show Hell unto him."</p>
<p>Then broken was their mutual support,<br/>
    And trembling each one turned himself to me,<br/>
    With others who had heard him by rebound.</p>
<p>Wholly to me did the good Master gather,<br/>
    Saying: "Say unto them whate'er thou wishest."<br/>
    And I began, since he would have it so:</p>
<p>"So may your memory not steal away<br/>
    In the first world from out the minds of men,<br/>
    But so may it survive 'neath many suns,</p>
<p>Say to me who ye are, and of what people;<br/>
    Let not your foul and loathsome punishment<br/>
    Make you afraid to show yourselves to me."</p>
<p>"I of Arezzo was," one made reply,<br/>
    "And Albert of Siena had me burned;<br/>
    But what I died for does not bring me here.</p>
<p>'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,<br/>
    That I could rise by flight into the air,<br/>
    And he who had conceit, but little wit,</p>
<p>Would have me show to him the art; and only<br/>
    Because no Daedalus I made him, made me<br/>
    Be burned by one who held him as his son.</p>
<p>But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,<br/>
    For alchemy, which in the world I practised,<br/>
    Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned."</p>
<p>And to the Poet said I: "Now was ever<br/>
    So vain a people as the Sienese?<br/>
    Not for a certainty the French by far."</p>
<p>Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,<br/>
    Replied unto my speech: "Taking out Stricca,<br/>
    Who knew the art of moderate expenses,</p>
<p>And Niccolo, who the luxurious use<br/>
    Of cloves discovered earliest of all<br/>
    Within that garden where such seed takes root;</p>
<p>And taking out the band, among whom squandered<br/>
    Caccia d'Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,<br/>
    And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!</p>
<p>But, that thou know who thus doth second thee<br/>
    Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye<br/>
    Tow'rds me, so that my face well answer thee,</p>
<p>And thou shalt see I am Capocchio's shade,<br/>
    Who metals falsified by alchemy;<br/>
    Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,</p>
<p>How I a skilful ape of nature was."</p>

<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto VIII</h3>
<p>The world used in its peril to believe<br/>
    That the fair Cypria delirious love<br/>
    Rayed out, in the third epicycle turning;</p>
<p>Wherefore not only unto her paid honour<br/>
    Of sacrifices and of votive cry<br/>
    The ancient nations in the ancient error,</p>
<p>But both Dione honoured they and Cupid,<br/>
    That as her mother, this one as her son,<br/>
    And said that he had sat in Dido's lap;</p>
<p>And they from her, whence I beginning take,<br/>
    Took the denomination of the star<br/>
    That woos the sun, now following, now in front.</p>
<p>I was not ware of our ascending to it;<br/>
    But of our being in it gave full faith<br/>
    My Lady whom I saw more beauteous grow.</p>
<p>And as within a flame a spark is seen,<br/>
    And as within a voice a voice discerned,<br/>
    When one is steadfast, and one comes and goes,</p>
<p>Within that light beheld I other lamps<br/>
    Move in a circle, speeding more and less,<br/>
    Methinks in measure of their inward vision.</p>
<p>From a cold cloud descended never winds,<br/>
    Or visible or not, so rapidly<br/>
    They would not laggard and impeded seem</p>
<p>To any one who had those lights divine<br/>
    Seen come towards us, leaving the gyration<br/>
    Begun at first in the high Seraphim.</p>
<p>And behind those that most in front appeared<br/>
    Sounded "Osanna!" so that never since<br/>
    To hear again was I without desire.</p>
<p>Then unto us more nearly one approached,<br/>
    And it alone began: "We all are ready<br/>
    Unto thy pleasure, that thou joy in us.</p>
<p>We turn around with the celestial Princes,<br/>
    One gyre and one gyration and one thirst,<br/>
    To whom thou in the world of old didst say,</p>
<p>'Ye who, intelligent, the third heaven are moving;'<br/>
    And are so full of love, to pleasure thee<br/>
    A little quiet will not be less sweet."</p>
<p>After these eyes of mine themselves had offered<br/>
    Unto my Lady reverently, and she<br/>
    Content and certain of herself had made them,</p>
<p>Back to the light they turned, which so great promise<br/>
    Made of itself, and "Say, who art thou?" was<br/>
    My voice, imprinted with a great affection.</p>
<p>O how and how much I beheld it grow<br/>
    With the new joy that superadded was<br/>
    Unto its joys, as soon as I had spoken!</p>
<p>Thus changed, it said to me: "The world possessed me<br/>
    Short time below; and, if it had been more,<br/>
    Much evil will be which would not have been.</p>
<p>My gladness keepeth me concealed from thee,<br/>
    Which rayeth round about me, and doth hide me<br/>
    Like as a creature swathed in its own silk.</p>
<p>Much didst thou love me, and thou hadst good reason;<br/>
    For had I been below, I should have shown thee<br/>
    Somewhat beyond the foliage of my love.</p>
<p>That left-hand margin, which doth bathe itself<br/>
    In Rhone, when it is mingled with the Sorgue,<br/>
    Me for its lord awaited in due time,</p>
<p>And that horn of Ausonia, which is towned<br/>
    With Bari, with Gaeta and Catona,<br/>
    Whence Tronto and Verde in the sea disgorge.</p>
<p>Already flashed upon my brow the crown<br/>
    Of that dominion which the Danube waters<br/>
    After the German borders it abandons;</p>
<p>And beautiful Trinacria, that is murky<br/>
    'Twixt Pachino and Peloro, (on the gulf<br/>
    Which greatest scath from Eurus doth receive,)</p>
<p>Not through Typhoeus, but through nascent sulphur,<br/>
    Would have awaited her own monarchs still,<br/>
    Through me from Charles descended and from Rudolph,</p>
<p>If evil lordship, that exasperates ever<br/>
    The subject populations, had not moved<br/>
    Palermo to the outcry of 'Death! death!'</p>
<p>And if my brother could but this foresee,<br/>
    The greedy poverty of Catalonia<br/>
    Straight would he flee, that it might not molest him;</p>
<p>For verily 'tis needful to provide,<br/>
    Through him or other, so that on his bark<br/>
    Already freighted no more freight be placed.</p>
<p>His nature, which from liberal covetous<br/>
    Descended, such a soldiery would need<br/>
    As should not care for hoarding in a chest."</p>
<p>"Because I do believe the lofty joy<br/>
    Thy speech infuses into me, my Lord,<br/>
    Where every good thing doth begin and end</p>
<p>Thou seest as I see it, the more grateful<br/>
    Is it to me; and this too hold I dear,<br/>
    That gazing upon God thou dost discern it.</p>
<p>Glad hast thou made me; so make clear to me,<br/>
    Since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt,<br/>
    How from sweet seed can bitter issue forth."</p>
<p>This I to him; and he to me: "If I<br/>
    Can show to thee a truth, to what thou askest<br/>
    Thy face thou'lt hold as thou dost hold thy back.</p>
<p>The Good which all the realm thou art ascending<br/>
    Turns and contents, maketh its providence<br/>
    To be a power within these bodies vast;</p>
<p>And not alone the natures are foreseen<br/>
    Within the mind that in itself is perfect,<br/>
    But they together with their preservation.</p>
<p>For whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth<br/>
    Falls foreordained unto an end foreseen,<br/>
    Even as a shaft directed to its mark.</p>
<p>If that were not, the heaven which thou dost walk<br/>
    Would in such manner its effects produce,<br/>
    That they no longer would be arts, but ruins.</p>
<p>This cannot be, if the Intelligences<br/>
    That keep these stars in motion are not maimed,<br/>
    And maimed the First that has not made them perfect.</p>
<p>Wilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee?"<br/>
    And I: "Not so; for 'tis impossible<br/>
    That nature tire, I see, in what is needful."</p>
<p>Whence he again: "Now say, would it be worse<br/>
    For men on earth were they not citizens?"<br/>
    "Yes," I replied; "and here I ask no reason."</p>
<p>"And can they be so, if below they live not<br/>
    Diversely unto offices diverse?<br/>
    No, if your master writeth well for you."</p>
<p>So came he with deductions to this point;<br/>
    Then he concluded: "Therefore it behoves<br/>
    The roots of your effects to be diverse.</p>
<p>Hence one is Solon born, another Xerxes,<br/>
    Another Melchisedec, and another he<br/>
    Who, flying through the air, his son did lose.</p>
<p>Revolving Nature, which a signet is<br/>
    To mortal wax, doth practise well her art,<br/>
    But not one inn distinguish from another;</p>
<p>Thence happens it that Esau differeth<br/>
    In seed from Jacob; and Quirinus comes<br/>
    From sire so vile that he is given to Mars.</p>
<p>A generated nature its own way<br/>
    Would always make like its progenitors,<br/>
    If Providence divine were not triumphant.</p>
<p>Now that which was behind thee is before thee;<br/>
    But that thou know that I with thee am pleased,<br/>
    With a corollary will I mantle thee.</p>
<p>Evermore nature, if it fortune find<br/>
    Discordant to it, like each other seed<br/>
    Out of its region, maketh evil thrift;</p>
<p>And if the world below would fix its mind<br/>
    On the foundation which is laid by nature,<br/>
    Pursuing that, 'twould have the people good.</p>
<p>But you unto religion wrench aside<br/>
    Him who was born to gird him with the sword,<br/>
    And make a king of him who is for sermons;</p>
<p>Therefore your footsteps wander from the road."</p>

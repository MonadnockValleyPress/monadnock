<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XVIII</h3>
<p>Now was alone rejoicing in its word<br/>
    That soul beatified, and I was tasting<br/>
    My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,</p>
<p>And the Lady who to God was leading me<br/>
    Said: "Change thy thought; consider that I am<br/>
    Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens."</p>
<p>Unto the loving accents of my comfort<br/>
    I turned me round, and then what love I saw<br/>
    Within those holy eyes I here relinquish;</p>
<p>Not only that my language I distrust,<br/>
    But that my mind cannot return so far<br/>
    Above itself, unless another guide it.</p>
<p>Thus much upon that point can I repeat,<br/>
    That, her again beholding, my affection<br/>
    From every other longing was released.</p>
<p>While the eternal pleasure, which direct<br/>
    Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face<br/>
    Contented me with its reflected aspect,</p>
<p>Conquering me with the radiance of a smile,<br/>
    She said to me, "Turn thee about and listen;<br/>
    Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise."</p>
<p>Even as sometimes here do we behold<br/>
    The affection in the look, if it be such<br/>
    That all the soul is wrapt away by it,</p>
<p>So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy<br/>
    To which I turned, I recognized therein<br/>
    The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.</p>
<p>And it began: "In this fifth resting-place<br/>
    Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,<br/>
    And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,</p>
<p>Are blessed spirits that below, ere yet<br/>
    They came to Heaven, were of such great renown<br/>
    That every Muse therewith would affluent be.</p>
<p>Therefore look thou upon the cross's horns;<br/>
    He whom I now shall name will there enact<br/>
    What doth within a cloud its own swift fire."</p>
<p>I saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn<br/>
    By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)<br/>
    Nor noted I the word before the deed;</p>
<p>And at the name of the great Maccabee<br/>
    I saw another move itself revolving,<br/>
    And gladness was the whip unto that top.</p>
<p>Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,<br/>
    Two of them my regard attentive followed<br/>
    As followeth the eye its falcon flying.</p>
<p>William thereafterward, and Renouard,<br/>
    And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight<br/>
    Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.</p>
<p>Then, moved and mingled with the other lights,<br/>
    The soul that had addressed me showed how great<br/>
    An artist 'twas among the heavenly singers.</p>
<p>To my right side I turned myself around,<br/>
    My duty to behold in Beatrice<br/>
    Either by words or gesture signified;</p>
<p>And so translucent I beheld her eyes,<br/>
    So full of pleasure, that her countenance<br/>
    Surpassed its other and its latest wont.</p>
<p>And as, by feeling greater delectation,<br/>
    A man in doing good from day to day<br/>
    Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,</p>
<p>So I became aware that my gyration<br/>
    With heaven together had increased its arc,<br/>
    That miracle beholding more adorned.</p>
<p>And such as is the change, in little lapse<br/>
    Of time, in a pale woman, when her face<br/>
    Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,</p>
<p>Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,<br/>
    Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,<br/>
    The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.</p>
<p>Within that Jovial torch did I behold<br/>
    The sparkling of the love which was therein<br/>
    Delineate our language to mine eyes.</p>
<p>And even as birds uprisen from the shore,<br/>
    As in congratulation o'er their food,<br/>
    Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,</p>
<p>So from within those lights the holy creatures<br/>
    Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures<br/>
    Made of themselves now D, now I, now L.</p>
<p>First singing they to their own music moved;<br/>
    Then one becoming of these characters,<br/>
    A little while they rested and were silent.</p>
<p>O divine Pegasea, thou who genius<br/>
    Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,<br/>
    And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,</p>
<p>Illume me with thyself, that I may bring<br/>
    Their figures out as I have them conceived!<br/>
    Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!</p>
<p>Themselves then they displayed in five times seven<br/>
    Vowels and consonants; and I observed<br/>
    The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.</p>
<p>'Diligite justitiam,' these were<br/>
    First verb and noun of all that was depicted;<br/>
    'Qui judicatis terram' were the last.</p>
<p>Thereafter in the M of the fifth word<br/>
    Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter<br/>
    Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.</p>
<p>And other lights I saw descend where was<br/>
    The summit of the M, and pause there singing<br/>
    The good, I think, that draws them to itself.</p>
<p>Then, as in striking upon burning logs<br/>
    Upward there fly innumerable sparks,<br/>
    Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,</p>
<p>More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,<br/>
    And to ascend, some more, and others less,<br/>
    Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;</p>
<p>And, each one being quiet in its place,<br/>
    The head and neck beheld I of an eagle<br/>
    Delineated by that inlaid fire.</p>
<p>He who there paints has none to be his guide;<br/>
    But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered<br/>
    That virtue which is form unto the nest.</p>
<p>The other beatitude, that contented seemed<br/>
    At first to bloom a lily on the M,<br/>
    By a slight motion followed out the imprint.</p>
<p>O gentle star! what and how many gems<br/>
    Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice<br/>
    Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!</p>
<p>Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin<br/>
    Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard<br/>
    Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;</p>
<p>So that a second time it now be wroth<br/>
    With buying and with selling in the temple<br/>
    Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!</p>
<p>O soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate,<br/>
    Implore for those who are upon the earth<br/>
    All gone astray after the bad example!</p>
<p>Once 'twas the custom to make war with swords;<br/>
    But now 'tis made by taking here and there<br/>
    The bread the pitying Father shuts from none.</p>
<p>Yet thou, who writest but to cancel, think<br/>
    That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard<br/>
    Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!</p>
<p>Well canst thou say: "So steadfast my desire<br/>
    Is unto him who willed to live alone,<br/>
    And for a dance was led to martyrdom,</p>
<p>That I know not the Fisherman nor Paul."</p>

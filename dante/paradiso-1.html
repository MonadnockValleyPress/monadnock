<h1>Paradiso</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto I</h3>
<p>The glory of Him who moveth everything<br/>
    Doth penetrate the universe, and shine<br/>
    In one part more and in another less.</p>
<p>Within that heaven which most his light receives<br/>
    Was I, and things beheld which to repeat<br/>
    Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;</p>
<p>Because in drawing near to its desire<br/>
    Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,<br/>
    That after it the memory cannot go.</p>
<p>Truly whatever of the holy realm<br/>
    I had the power to treasure in my mind<br/>
    Shall now become the subject of my song.</p>
<p>O good Apollo, for this last emprise<br/>
    Make of me such a vessel of thy power<br/>
    As giving the beloved laurel asks!</p>
<p>One summit of Parnassus hitherto<br/>
    Has been enough for me, but now with both<br/>
    I needs must enter the arena left.</p>
<p>Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe<br/>
    As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw<br/>
    Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.</p>
<p>O power divine, lend'st thou thyself to me<br/>
    So that the shadow of the blessed realm<br/>
    Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,</p>
<p>Thou'lt see me come unto thy darling tree,<br/>
    And crown myself thereafter with those leaves<br/>
    Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.</p>
<p>So seldom, Father, do we gather them<br/>
    For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,<br/>
    (The fault and shame of human inclinations,)</p>
<p>That the Peneian foliage should bring forth<br/>
    Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,<br/>
    When any one it makes to thirst for it.</p>
<p>A little spark is followed by great flame;<br/>
    Perchance with better voices after me<br/>
    Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!</p>
<p>To mortal men by passages diverse<br/>
    Uprises the world's lamp; but by that one<br/>
    Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,</p>
<p>With better course and with a better star<br/>
    Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax<br/>
    Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.</p>
<p>Almost that passage had made morning there<br/>
    And evening here, and there was wholly white<br/>
    That hemisphere, and black the other part,</p>
<p>When Beatrice towards the left-hand side<br/>
    I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;<br/>
    Never did eagle fasten so upon it!</p>
<p>And even as a second ray is wont<br/>
    To issue from the first and reascend,<br/>
    Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,</p>
<p>Thus of her action, through the eyes infused<br/>
    In my imagination, mine I made,<br/>
    And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.</p>
<p>There much is lawful which is here unlawful<br/>
    Unto our powers, by virtue of the place<br/>
    Made for the human species as its own.</p>
<p>Not long I bore it, nor so little while<br/>
    But I beheld it sparkle round about<br/>
    Like iron that comes molten from the fire;</p>
<p>And suddenly it seemed that day to day<br/>
    Was added, as if He who has the power<br/>
    Had with another sun the heaven adorned.</p>
<p>With eyes upon the everlasting wheels<br/>
    Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her<br/>
    Fixing my vision from above removed,</p>
<p>Such at her aspect inwardly became<br/>
    As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him<br/>
    Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.</p>
<p>To represent transhumanise in words<br/>
    Impossible were; the example, then, suffice<br/>
    Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.</p>
<p>If I was merely what of me thou newly<br/>
    Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,<br/>
    Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!</p>
<p>When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal<br/>
    Desiring thee, made me attentive to it<br/>
    By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,</p>
<p>Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled<br/>
    By the sun's flame, that neither rain nor river<br/>
    E'er made a lake so widely spread abroad.</p>
<p>The newness of the sound and the great light<br/>
    Kindled in me a longing for their cause,<br/>
    Never before with such acuteness felt;</p>
<p>Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,<br/>
    To quiet in me my perturbed mind,<br/>
    Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,</p>
<p>And she began: "Thou makest thyself so dull<br/>
    With false imagining, that thou seest not<br/>
    What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.</p>
<p>Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;<br/>
    But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,<br/>
    Ne'er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest."</p>
<p>If of my former doubt I was divested<br/>
    By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,<br/>
    I in a new one was the more ensnared;</p>
<p>And said: "Already did I rest content<br/>
    From great amazement; but am now amazed<br/>
    In what way I transcend these bodies light."</p>
<p>Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,<br/>
    Her eyes directed tow'rds me with that look<br/>
    A mother casts on a delirious child;</p>
<p>And she began: "All things whate'er they be<br/>
    Have order among themselves, and this is form,<br/>
    That makes the universe resemble God.</p>
<p>Here do the higher creatures see the footprints<br/>
    Of the Eternal Power, which is the end<br/>
    Whereto is made the law already mentioned.</p>
<p>In the order that I speak of are inclined<br/>
    All natures, by their destinies diverse,<br/>
    More or less near unto their origin;</p>
<p>Hence they move onward unto ports diverse<br/>
    O'er the great sea of being; and each one<br/>
    With instinct given it which bears it on.</p>
<p>This bears away the fire towards the moon;<br/>
    This is in mortal hearts the motive power<br/>
    This binds together and unites the earth.</p>
<p>Nor only the created things that are<br/>
    Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,<br/>
    But those that have both intellect and love.</p>
<p>The Providence that regulates all this<br/>
    Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,<br/>
    Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.</p>
<p>And thither now, as to a site decreed,<br/>
    Bears us away the virtue of that cord<br/>
    Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.</p>
<p>True is it, that as oftentimes the form<br/>
    Accords not with the intention of the art,<br/>
    Because in answering is matter deaf,</p>
<p>So likewise from this course doth deviate<br/>
    Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,<br/>
    Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,</p>
<p>(In the same wise as one may see the fire<br/>
    Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus<br/>
    Earthward is wrested by some false delight.</p>
<p>Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,<br/>
    At thine ascent, than at a rivulet<br/>
    From some high mount descending to the lowland.</p>
<p>Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived<br/>
    Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,<br/>
    As if on earth the living fire were quiet."</p>
<p>Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.</p>

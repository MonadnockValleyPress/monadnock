<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XIV</h3>
<p>"Who is this one that goes about our mountain,<br/>
    Or ever Death has given him power of flight,<br/>
    And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?"</p>
<p>"I know not who, but know he's not alone;<br/>
    Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,<br/>
    And gently, so that he may speak, accost him."</p>
<p>Thus did two spirits, leaning tow'rds each other,<br/>
    Discourse about me there on the right hand;<br/>
    Then held supine their faces to address me.</p>
<p>And said the one: "O soul, that, fastened still<br/>
    Within the body, tow'rds the heaven art going,<br/>
    For charity console us, and declare</p>
<p>Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak'st us<br/>
    As much to marvel at this grace of thine<br/>
    As must a thing that never yet has been."</p>
<p>And I: "Through midst of Tuscany there wanders<br/>
    A streamlet that is born in Falterona,<br/>
    And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;</p>
<p>From thereupon do I this body bring.<br/>
    To tell you who I am were speech in vain,<br/>
    Because my name as yet makes no great noise."</p>
<p>"If well thy meaning I can penetrate<br/>
    With intellect of mine," then answered me<br/>
    He who first spake, "thou speakest of the Arno."</p>
<p>And said the other to him: "Why concealed<br/>
    This one the appellation of that river,<br/>
    Even as a man doth of things horrible?"</p>
<p>And thus the shade that questioned was of this<br/>
    Himself acquitted: "I know not; but truly<br/>
    'Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;</p>
<p>For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant<br/>
    The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro<br/>
    That in few places it that mark surpasses)</p>
<p>To where it yields itself in restoration<br/>
    Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,<br/>
    Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,</p>
<p>Virtue is like an enemy avoided<br/>
    By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune<br/>
    Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;</p>
<p>On which account have so transformed their nature<br/>
    The dwellers in that miserable valley,<br/>
    It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.</p>
<p>'Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier<br/>
    Than other food for human use created,<br/>
    It first directeth its impoverished way.</p>
<p>Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,<br/>
    More snarling than their puissance demands,<br/>
    And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.</p>
<p>It goes on falling, and the more it grows,<br/>
    The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,<br/>
    This maledict and misadventurous ditch.</p>
<p>Descended then through many a hollow gulf,<br/>
    It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,<br/>
    They fear no cunning that may master them.</p>
<p>Nor will I cease because another hears me;<br/>
    And well 'twill be for him, if still he mind him<br/>
    Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.</p>
<p>Thy grandson I behold, who doth become<br/>
    A hunter of those wolves upon the bank<br/>
    Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.</p>
<p>He sells their flesh, it being yet alive;<br/>
    Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;<br/>
    Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.</p>
<p>Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;<br/>
    He leaves it such, a thousand years from now<br/>
    In its primeval state 'tis not re-wooded."</p>
<p>As at the announcement of impending ills<br/>
    The face of him who listens is disturbed,<br/>
    From whate'er side the peril seize upon him;</p>
<p>So I beheld that other soul, which stood<br/>
    Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,<br/>
    When it had gathered to itself the word.</p>
<p>The speech of one and aspect of the other<br/>
    Had me desirous made to know their names,<br/>
    And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,</p>
<p>Whereat the spirit which first spake to me<br/>
    Began again: "Thou wishest I should bring me<br/>
    To do for thee what thou'lt not do for me;</p>
<p>But since God willeth that in thee shine forth<br/>
    Such grace of his, I'll not be chary with thee;<br/>
    Know, then, that I Guido del Duca am.</p>
<p>My blood was so with envy set on fire,<br/>
    That if I had beheld a man make merry,<br/>
    Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o'er with pallor.</p>
<p>From my own sowing such the straw I reap!<br/>
    O human race! why dost thou set thy heart<br/>
    Where interdict of partnership must be?</p>
<p>This is Renier; this is the boast and honour<br/>
    Of the house of Calboli, where no one since<br/>
    Has made himself the heir of his desert.</p>
<p>And not alone his blood is made devoid,<br/>
    'Twixt Po and mount, and sea-shore and the Reno,<br/>
    Of good required for truth and for diversion;</p>
<p>For all within these boundaries is full<br/>
    Of venomous roots, so that too tardily<br/>
    By cultivation now would they diminish.</p>
<p>Where is good Lizio, and Arrigo Manardi,<br/>
    Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna,<br/>
    O Romagnuoli into bastards turned?</p>
<p>When in Bologna will a Fabbro rise?<br/>
    When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco,<br/>
    The noble scion of ignoble seed?</p>
<p>Be not astonished, Tuscan, if I weep,<br/>
    When I remember, with Guido da Prata,<br/>
    Ugolin d' Azzo, who was living with us,</p>
<p>Frederick Tignoso and his company,<br/>
    The house of Traversara, and th' Anastagi,<br/>
    And one race and the other is extinct;</p>
<p>The dames and cavaliers, the toils and ease<br/>
    That filled our souls with love and courtesy,<br/>
    There where the hearts have so malicious grown!</p>
<p>O Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee,<br/>
    Seeing that all thy family is gone,<br/>
    And many people, not to be corrupted?</p>
<p>Bagnacaval does well in not begetting<br/>
    And ill does Castrocaro, and Conio worse,<br/>
    In taking trouble to beget such Counts.</p>
<p>Will do well the Pagani, when their Devil<br/>
    Shall have departed; but not therefore pure<br/>
    Will testimony of them e'er remain.</p>
<p>O Ugolin de' Fantoli, secure<br/>
    Thy name is, since no longer is awaited<br/>
    One who, degenerating, can obscure it!</p>
<p>But go now, Tuscan, for it now delights me<br/>
    To weep far better than it does to speak,<br/>
    So much has our discourse my mind distressed."</p>
<p>We were aware that those beloved souls<br/>
    Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent,<br/>
    They made us of our pathway confident.</p>
<p>When we became alone by going onward,<br/>
    Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared<br/>
    A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming:</p>
<p>"Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!"<br/>
    And fled as the reverberation dies<br/>
    If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.</p>
<p>As soon as hearing had a truce from this,<br/>
    Behold another, with so great a crash,<br/>
    That it resembled thunderings following fast:</p>
<p>"I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!"<br/>
    And then, to press myself close to the Poet,<br/>
    I backward, and not forward, took a step.</p>
<p>Already on all sides the air was quiet;<br/>
    And said he to me: "That was the hard curb<br/>
    That ought to hold a man within his bounds;</p>
<p>But you take in the bait so that the hook<br/>
    Of the old Adversary draws you to him,<br/>
    And hence availeth little curb or call.</p>
<p>The heavens are calling you, and wheel around you,<br/>
    Displaying to you their eternal beauties,<br/>
    And still your eye is looking on the ground;</p>
<p>Whence He, who all discerns, chastises you."</p>

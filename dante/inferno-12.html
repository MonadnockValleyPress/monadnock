<h1>Inferno</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XII</h3>
<p>The place where to descend the bank we came<br/>
    Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,<br/>
    Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.</p>
<p>Such as that ruin is which in the flank<br/>
    Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,<br/>
    Either by earthquake or by failing stay,</p>
<p>For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,<br/>
    Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,<br/>
    Some path 'twould give to him who was above;</p>
<p>Even such was the descent of that ravine,<br/>
    And on the border of the broken chasm<br/>
    The infamy of Crete was stretched along,</p>
<p>Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;<br/>
    And when he us beheld, he bit himself,<br/>
    Even as one whom anger racks within.</p>
<p>My Sage towards him shouted: "Peradventure<br/>
    Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens,<br/>
    Who in the world above brought death to thee?</p>
<p>Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not<br/>
    Instructed by thy sister, but he comes<br/>
    In order to behold your punishments."</p>
<p>As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment<br/>
    In which he has received the mortal blow,<br/>
    Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,</p>
<p>The Minotaur beheld I do the like;<br/>
    And he, the wary, cried: "Run to the passage;<br/>
    While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend."</p>
<p>Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge<br/>
    Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves<br/>
    Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.</p>
<p>Thoughtful I went; and he said: "Thou art thinking<br/>
    Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded<br/>
    By that brute anger which just now I quenched.</p>
<p>Now will I have thee know, the other time<br/>
    I here descended to the nether Hell,<br/>
    This precipice had not yet fallen down.</p>
<p>But truly, if I well discern, a little<br/>
    Before His coming who the mighty spoil<br/>
    Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,</p>
<p>Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley<br/>
    Trembled so, that I thought the Universe<br/>
    Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think</p>
<p>The world ofttimes converted into chaos;<br/>
    And at that moment this primeval crag<br/>
    Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.</p>
<p>But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near<br/>
    The river of blood, within which boiling is<br/>
    Whoe'er by violence doth injure others."</p>
<p>O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,<br/>
    That spurs us onward so in our short life,<br/>
    And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!</p>
<p>I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,<br/>
    As one which all the plain encompasses,<br/>
    Conformable to what my Guide had said.</p>
<p>And between this and the embankment's foot<br/>
    Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,<br/>
    As in the world they used the chase to follow.</p>
<p>Beholding us descend, each one stood still,<br/>
    And from the squadron three detached themselves,<br/>
    With bows and arrows in advance selected;</p>
<p>And from afar one cried: "Unto what torment<br/>
    Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?<br/>
    Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow."</p>
<p>My Master said: "Our answer will we make<br/>
    To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,<br/>
    That will of thine was evermore so hasty."</p>
<p>Then touched he me, and said: "This one is Nessus,<br/>
    Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,<br/>
    And for himself, himself did vengeance take.</p>
<p>And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,<br/>
    Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;<br/>
    That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.</p>
<p>Thousands and thousands go about the moat<br/>
    Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges<br/>
    Out of the blood, more than his crime allots."</p>
<p>Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;<br/>
    Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch<br/>
    Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.</p>
<p>After he had uncovered his great mouth,<br/>
    He said to his companions: "Are you ware<br/>
    That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?</p>
<p>Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men."<br/>
    And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,<br/>
    Where the two natures are together joined,</p>
<p>Replied: "Indeed he lives, and thus alone<br/>
    Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;<br/>
    Necessity, and not delight, impels us.</p>
<p>Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,<br/>
    Who unto me committed this new office;<br/>
    No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.</p>
<p>But by that virtue through which I am moving<br/>
    My steps along this savage thoroughfare,<br/>
    Give us some one of thine, to be with us,</p>
<p>And who may show us where to pass the ford,<br/>
    And who may carry this one on his back;<br/>
    For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air."</p>
<p>Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,<br/>
    And said to Nessus: "Turn and do thou guide them,<br/>
    And warn aside, if other band may meet you."</p>
<p>We with our faithful escort onward moved<br/>
    Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,<br/>
    Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.</p>
<p>People I saw within up to the eyebrows,<br/>
    And the great Centaur said: "Tyrants are these,<br/>
    Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.</p>
<p>Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here<br/>
    Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius<br/>
    Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.</p>
<p>That forehead there which has the hair so black<br/>
    Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,<br/>
    Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,</p>
<p>Up in the world was by his stepson slain."<br/>
    Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,<br/>
    "Now he be first to thee, and second I."</p>
<p>A little farther on the Centaur stopped<br/>
    Above a folk, who far down as the throat<br/>
    Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.</p>
<p>A shade he showed us on one side alone,<br/>
    Saying: "He cleft asunder in God's bosom<br/>
    The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured."</p>
<p>Then people saw I, who from out the river<br/>
    Lifted their heads and also all the chest;<br/>
    And many among these I recognised.</p>
<p>Thus ever more and more grew shallower<br/>
    That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;<br/>
    And there across the moat our passage was.</p>
<p>"Even as thou here upon this side beholdest<br/>
    The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,"<br/>
    The Centaur said, "I wish thee to believe</p>
<p>That on this other more and more declines<br/>
    Its bed, until it reunites itself<br/>
    Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.</p>
<p>Justice divine, upon this side, is goading<br/>
    That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,<br/>
    And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks</p>
<p>The tears which with the boiling it unseals<br/>
    In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,<br/>
    Who made upon the highways so much war."</p>
<p>Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</p>

<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XVI</h3>
<p>Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived<br/>
    Of every planet under a poor sky,<br/>
    As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,</p>
<p>Ne'er made unto my sight so thick a veil,<br/>
    As did that smoke which there enveloped us,<br/>
    Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;</p>
<p>For not an eye it suffered to stay open;<br/>
    Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,<br/>
    Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.</p>
<p>E'en as a blind man goes behind his guide,<br/>
    Lest he should wander, or should strike against<br/>
    Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,</p>
<p>So went I through the bitter and foul air,<br/>
    Listening unto my Leader, who said only,<br/>
    "Look that from me thou be not separated."</p>
<p>Voices I heard, and every one appeared<br/>
    To supplicate for peace and misericord<br/>
    The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.</p>
<p>Still "Agnus Dei" their exordium was;<br/>
    One word there was in all, and metre one,<br/>
    So that all harmony appeared among them.</p>
<p>"Master," I said, "are spirits those I hear?"<br/>
    And he to me: "Thou apprehendest truly,<br/>
    And they the knot of anger go unloosing."</p>
<p>"Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke<br/>
    And art discoursing of us even as though<br/>
    Thou didst by calends still divide the time?"</p>
<p>After this manner by a voice was spoken;<br/>
    Whereon my Master said: "Do thou reply,<br/>
    And ask if on this side the way go upward."</p>
<p>And I: "O creature that dost cleanse thyself<br/>
    To return beautiful to Him who made thee,<br/>
    Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me."</p>
<p>"Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,"<br/>
    He answered; "and if smoke prevent our seeing,<br/>
    Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof."</p>
<p>Thereon began I: "With that swathing band<br/>
    Which death unwindeth am I going upward,<br/>
    And hither came I through the infernal anguish.</p>
<p>And if God in his grace has me infolded,<br/>
    So that he wills that I behold his court<br/>
    By method wholly out of modern usage,</p>
<p>Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,<br/>
    But tell it me, and tell me if I go<br/>
    Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort."</p>
<p>"Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;<br/>
    The world I knew, and loved that excellence,<br/>
    At which has each one now unbent his bow.</p>
<p>For mounting upward, thou art going right."<br/>
    Thus he made answer, and subjoined: "I pray thee<br/>
    To pray for me when thou shalt be above."</p>
<p>And I to him: "My faith I pledge to thee<br/>
    To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting<br/>
    Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.</p>
<p>First it was simple, and is now made double<br/>
    By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,<br/>
    Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.</p>
<p>The world forsooth is utterly deserted<br/>
    By every virtue, as thou tellest me,<br/>
    And with iniquity is big and covered;</p>
<p>But I beseech thee point me out the cause,<br/>
    That I may see it, and to others show it;<br/>
    For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it."</p>
<p>A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!<br/>
    He first sent forth, and then began he: "Brother,<br/>
    The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!</p>
<p>Ye who are living every cause refer<br/>
    Still upward to the heavens, as if all things<br/>
    They of necessity moved with themselves.</p>
<p>If this were so, in you would be destroyed<br/>
    Free will, nor any justice would there be<br/>
    In having joy for good, or grief for evil.</p>
<p>The heavens your movements do initiate,<br/>
    I say not all; but granting that I say it,<br/>
    Light has been given you for good and evil,</p>
<p>And free volition; which, if some fatigue<br/>
    In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,<br/>
    Afterwards conquers all, if well 'tis nurtured.</p>
<p>To greater force and to a better nature,<br/>
    Though free, ye subject are, and that creates<br/>
    The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.</p>
<p>Hence, if the present world doth go astray,<br/>
    In you the cause is, be it sought in you;<br/>
    And I therein will now be thy true spy.</p>
<p>Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it<br/>
    Before it is, like to a little girl<br/>
    Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,</p>
<p>Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,<br/>
    Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,<br/>
    Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.</p>
<p>Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour;<br/>
    Is cheated by it, and runs after it,<br/>
    If guide or rein turn not aside its love.</p>
<p>Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,<br/>
    Behoved a king to have, who at the least<br/>
    Of the true city should discern the tower.</p>
<p>The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?<br/>
    No one; because the shepherd who precedes<br/>
    Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;</p>
<p>Wherefore the people that perceives its guide<br/>
    Strike only at the good for which it hankers,<br/>
    Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.</p>
<p>Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance<br/>
    The cause is that has made the world depraved,<br/>
    And not that nature is corrupt in you.</p>
<p>Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was<br/>
    Two suns to have, which one road and the other,<br/>
    Of God and of the world, made manifest.</p>
<p>One has the other quenched, and to the crosier<br/>
    The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it<br/>
    That by main force one with the other go,</p>
<p>Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;<br/>
    If thou believe not, think upon the grain,<br/>
    For by its seed each herb is recognized.</p>
<p>In the land laved by Po and Adige,<br/>
    Valour and courtesy used to be found,<br/>
    Before that Frederick had his controversy;</p>
<p>Now in security can pass that way<br/>
    Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,<br/>
    From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.</p>
<p>True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids<br/>
    The ancient age the new, and late they deem it<br/>
    That God restore them to the better life:</p>
<p>Currado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,<br/>
    And Guido da Castel, who better named is,<br/>
    In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:</p>
<p>Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,<br/>
    Confounding in itself two governments,<br/>
    Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden."</p>
<p>"O Marco mine," I said, "thou reasonest well;<br/>
    And now discern I why the sons of Levi<br/>
    Have been excluded from the heritage.</p>
<p>But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample<br/>
    Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained<br/>
    In reprobation of the barbarous age?"</p>
<p>"Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,"<br/>
    He answered me; "for speaking Tuscan to me,<br/>
    It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.</p>
<p>By other surname do I know him not,<br/>
    Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.<br/>
    May God be with you, for I come no farther.</p>
<p>Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,<br/>
    Already whitening; and I must depart&mdash;<br/>
    Yonder the Angel is&mdash;ere he appear."</p>
<p>Thus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.</p>

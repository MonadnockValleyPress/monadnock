<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XV</h3>
<p>As much as 'twixt the close of the third hour<br/>
    And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere<br/>
    Which aye in fashion of a child is playing,</p>
<p>So much it now appeared, towards the night,<br/>
    Was of his course remaining to the sun;<br/>
    There it was evening, and 'twas midnight here;</p>
<p>And the rays smote the middle of our faces,<br/>
    Because by us the mount was so encircled,<br/>
    That straight towards the west we now were going</p>
<p>When I perceived my forehead overpowered<br/>
    Beneath the splendour far more than at first,<br/>
    And stupor were to me the things unknown,</p>
<p>Whereat towards the summit of my brow<br/>
    I raised my hands, and made myself the visor<br/>
    Which the excessive glare diminishes.</p>
<p>As when from off the water, or a mirror,<br/>
    The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,<br/>
    Ascending upward in the selfsame measure</p>
<p>That it descends, and deviates as far<br/>
    From falling of a stone in line direct,<br/>
    (As demonstrate experiment and art,)</p>
<p>So it appeared to me that by a light<br/>
    Refracted there before me I was smitten;<br/>
    On which account my sight was swift to flee.</p>
<p>"What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot<br/>
    So fully screen my sight that it avail me,"<br/>
    Said I, "and seems towards us to be moving?"</p>
<p>"Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet<br/>
    The family of heaven," he answered me;<br/>
    "An angel 'tis, who comes to invite us upward.</p>
<p>Soon will it be, that to behold these things<br/>
    Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee<br/>
    As much as nature fashioned thee to feel."</p>
<p>When we had reached the Angel benedight,<br/>
    With joyful voice he said: "Here enter in<br/>
    To stairway far less steep than are the others."</p>
<p>We mounting were, already thence departed,<br/>
    And "Beati misericordes" was<br/>
    Behind us sung, "Rejoice, thou that o'ercomest!"</p>
<p>My Master and myself, we two alone<br/>
    Were going upward, and I thought, in going,<br/>
    Some profit to acquire from words of his;</p>
<p>And I to him directed me, thus asking:<br/>
    "What did the spirit of Romagna mean,<br/>
    Mentioning interdict and partnership?"</p>
<p>Whence he to me: "Of his own greatest failing<br/>
    He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not<br/>
    If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.</p>
<p>Because are thither pointed your desires<br/>
    Where by companionship each share is lessened,<br/>
    Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.</p>
<p>But if the love of the supernal sphere<br/>
    Should upwardly direct your aspiration,<br/>
    There would not be that fear within your breast;</p>
<p>For there, as much the more as one says 'Our,'<br/>
    So much the more of good each one possesses,<br/>
    And more of charity in that cloister burns."</p>
<p>"I am more hungering to be satisfied,"<br/>
    I said, "than if I had before been silent,<br/>
    And more of doubt within my mind I gather.</p>
<p>How can it be, that boon distributed<br/>
    The more possessors can more wealthy make<br/>
    Therein, than if by few it be possessed?"</p>
<p>And he to me: "Because thou fixest still<br/>
    Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,<br/>
    Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.</p>
<p>That goodness infinite and ineffable<br/>
    Which is above there, runneth unto love,<br/>
    As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.</p>
<p>So much it gives itself as it finds ardour,<br/>
    So that as far as charity extends,<br/>
    O'er it increases the eternal valour.</p>
<p>And the more people thitherward aspire,<br/>
    More are there to love well, and more they love there,<br/>
    And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.</p>
<p>And if my reasoning appease thee not,<br/>
    Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully<br/>
    Take from thee this and every other longing.</p>
<p>Endeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,<br/>
    As are the two already, the five wounds<br/>
    That close themselves again by being painful."</p>
<p>Even as I wished to say, "Thou dost appease me,"<br/>
    I saw that I had reached another circle,<br/>
    So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.</p>
<p>There it appeared to me that in a vision<br/>
    Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,<br/>
    And in a temple many persons saw;</p>
<p>And at the door a woman, with the sweet<br/>
    Behaviour of a mother, saying: "Son,<br/>
    Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?</p>
<p>Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself<br/>
    Were seeking for thee;"&mdash;and as here she ceased,<br/>
    That which appeared at first had disappeared.</p>
<p>Then I beheld another with those waters<br/>
    Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever<br/>
    From great disdain of others it is born,</p>
<p>And saying: "If of that city thou art lord,<br/>
    For whose name was such strife among the gods,<br/>
    And whence doth every science scintillate,</p>
<p>Avenge thyself on those audacious arms<br/>
    That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;"<br/>
    And the lord seemed to me benign and mild</p>
<p>To answer her with aspect temperate:<br/>
    "What shall we do to those who wish us ill,<br/>
    If he who loves us be by us condemned?"</p>
<p>Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,<br/>
    With stones a young man slaying, clamorously<br/>
    Still crying to each other, "Kill him! kill him!"</p>
<p>And him I saw bow down, because of death<br/>
    That weighed already on him, to the earth,<br/>
    But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,</p>
<p>Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,<br/>
    That he would pardon those his persecutors,<br/>
    With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.</p>
<p>Soon as my soul had outwardly returned<br/>
    To things external to it which are true,<br/>
    Did I my not false errors recognize.</p>
<p>My Leader, who could see me bear myself<br/>
    Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,<br/>
    Exclaimed: "What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?</p>
<p>But hast been coming more than half a league<br/>
    Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,<br/>
    In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?"</p>
<p>"O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,<br/>
    I'll tell thee," said I, "what appeared to me,<br/>
    When thus from me my legs were ta'en away."</p>
<p>And he: "If thou shouldst have a hundred masks<br/>
    Upon thy face, from me would not be shut<br/>
    Thy cogitations, howsoever small.</p>
<p>What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail<br/>
    To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,<br/>
    Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.</p>
<p>I did not ask, 'What ails thee?' as he does<br/>
    Who only looketh with the eyes that see not<br/>
    When of the soul bereft the body lies,</p>
<p>But asked it to give vigour to thy feet;<br/>
    Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow<br/>
    To use their wakefulness when it returns."</p>
<p>We passed along, athwart the twilight peering<br/>
    Forward as far as ever eye could stretch<br/>
    Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;</p>
<p>And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached<br/>
    In our direction, sombre as the night,<br/>
    Nor was there place to hide one's self therefrom.</p>
<p>This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.</p>

<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XIII</h3>
<p>We were upon the summit of the stairs,<br/>
    Where for the second time is cut away<br/>
    The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.</p>
<p>There in like manner doth a cornice bind<br/>
    The hill all round about, as does the first,<br/>
    Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.</p>
<p>Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;<br/>
    So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,<br/>
    With but the livid colour of the stone.</p>
<p>"If to inquire we wait for people here,"<br/>
    The Poet said, "I fear that peradventure<br/>
    Too much delay will our election have."</p>
<p>Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,<br/>
    Made his right side the centre of his motion,<br/>
    And turned the left part of himself about.</p>
<p>"O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter<br/>
    Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,"<br/>
    Said he, "as one within here should be led.</p>
<p>Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;<br/>
    If other reason prompt not otherwise,<br/>
    Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!"</p>
<p>As much as here is counted for a mile,<br/>
    So much already there had we advanced<br/>
    In little time, by dint of ready will;</p>
<p>And tow'rds us there were heard to fly, albeit<br/>
    They were not visible, spirits uttering<br/>
    Unto Love's table courteous invitations,</p>
<p>The first voice that passed onward in its flight,<br/>
    "Vinum non habent," said in accents loud,<br/>
    And went reiterating it behind us.</p>
<p>And ere it wholly grew inaudible<br/>
    Because of distance, passed another, crying,<br/>
    "I am Orestes!" and it also stayed not.</p>
<p>"O," said I, "Father, these, what voices are they?"<br/>
    And even as I asked, behold the third,<br/>
    Saying: "Love those from whom ye have had evil!"</p>
<p>And the good Master said: "This circle scourges<br/>
    The sin of envy, and on that account<br/>
    Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.</p>
<p>The bridle of another sound shall be;<br/>
    I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,<br/>
    Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.</p>
<p>But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,<br/>
    And people thou wilt see before us sitting,<br/>
    And each one close against the cliff is seated."</p>
<p>Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;<br/>
    I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles<br/>
    Not from the colour of the stone diverse.</p>
<p>And when we were a little farther onward,<br/>
    I heard a cry of, "Mary, pray for us!"<br/>
    A cry of, "Michael, Peter, and all Saints!"</p>
<p>I do not think there walketh still on earth<br/>
    A man so hard, that he would not be pierced<br/>
    With pity at what afterward I saw.</p>
<p>For when I had approached so near to them<br/>
    That manifest to me their acts became,<br/>
    Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.</p>
<p>Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,<br/>
    And one sustained the other with his shoulder,<br/>
    And all of them were by the bank sustained.</p>
<p>Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,<br/>
    Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,<br/>
    And one upon another leans his head,</p>
<p>So that in others pity soon may rise,<br/>
    Not only at the accent of their words,<br/>
    But at their aspect, which no less implores.</p>
<p>And as unto the blind the sun comes not,<br/>
    So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,<br/>
    Heaven's light will not be bounteous of itself;</p>
<p>For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,<br/>
    And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild<br/>
    Is done, because it will not quiet stay.</p>
<p>To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,<br/>
    Seeing the others without being seen;<br/>
    Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.</p>
<p>Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,<br/>
    And therefore waited not for my demand,<br/>
    But said: "Speak, and be brief, and to the point."</p>
<p>I had Virgilius upon that side<br/>
    Of the embankment from which one may fall,<br/>
    Since by no border 'tis engarlanded;</p>
<p>Upon the other side of me I had<br/>
    The shades devout, who through the horrible seam<br/>
    Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.</p>
<p>To them I turned me, and, "O people, certain,"<br/>
    Began I, "of beholding the high light,<br/>
    Which your desire has solely in its care,</p>
<p>So may grace speedily dissolve the scum<br/>
    Upon your consciences, that limpidly<br/>
    Through them descend the river of the mind,</p>
<p>Tell me, for dear 'twill be to me and gracious,<br/>
    If any soul among you here is Latian,<br/>
    And 'twill perchance be good for him I learn it."</p>
<p>"O brother mine, each one is citizen<br/>
    Of one true city; but thy meaning is,<br/>
    Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim."</p>
<p>By way of answer this I seemed to hear<br/>
    A little farther on than where I stood,<br/>
    Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.</p>
<p>Among the rest I saw a shade that waited<br/>
    In aspect, and should any one ask how,<br/>
    Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.</p>
<p>"Spirit," I said, "who stoopest to ascend,<br/>
    If thou art he who did reply to me,<br/>
    Make thyself known to me by place or name."</p>
<p>"Sienese was I," it replied, "and with<br/>
    The others here recleanse my guilty life,<br/>
    Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.</p>
<p>Sapient I was not, although I Sapia<br/>
    Was called, and I was at another's harm<br/>
    More happy far than at my own good fortune.</p>
<p>And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,<br/>
    Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.<br/>
    The arc already of my years descending,</p>
<p>My fellow-citizens near unto Colle<br/>
    Were joined in battle with their adversaries,<br/>
    And I was praying God for what he willed.</p>
<p>Routed were they, and turned into the bitter<br/>
    Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,<br/>
    A joy received unequalled by all others;</p>
<p>So that I lifted upward my bold face<br/>
    Crying to God, 'Henceforth I fear thee not,'<br/>
    As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.</p>
<p>Peace I desired with God at the extreme<br/>
    Of my existence, and as yet would not<br/>
    My debt have been by penitence discharged,</p>
<p>Had it not been that in remembrance held me<br/>
    Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,<br/>
    Who out of charity was grieved for me.</p>
<p>But who art thou, that into our conditions<br/>
    Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound<br/>
    As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?"</p>
<p>"Mine eyes," I said, "will yet be here ta'en from me,<br/>
    But for short space; for small is the offence<br/>
    Committed by their being turned with envy.</p>
<p>Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended<br/>
    My soul is, of the torment underneath,<br/>
    For even now the load down there weighs on me."</p>
<p>And she to me: "Who led thee, then, among us<br/>
    Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?"<br/>
    And I: "He who is with me, and speaks not;</p>
<p>And living am I; therefore ask of me,<br/>
    Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move<br/>
    O'er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee."</p>
<p>"O, this is such a novel thing to hear,"<br/>
    She answered, "that great sign it is God loves thee;<br/>
    Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.</p>
<p>And I implore, by what thou most desirest,<br/>
    If e'er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,<br/>
    Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.</p>
<p>Them wilt thou see among that people vain<br/>
    Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there<br/>
    More hope than in discovering the Diana;</p>
<p>But there still more the admirals will lose."</p>

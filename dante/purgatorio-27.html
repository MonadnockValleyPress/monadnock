<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto XXVII</h3>
<p>As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays,<br/>
    In regions where his Maker shed his blood,<br/>
    (The Ebro falling under lofty Libra,</p>
<p>And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,)<br/>
    So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing,<br/>
    When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.</p>
<p>Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,<br/>
    And chanted forth, "Beati mundo corde,"<br/>
    In voice by far more living than our own.</p>
<p>Then: "No one farther goes, souls sanctified,<br/>
    If first the fire bite not; within it enter,<br/>
    And be not deaf unto the song beyond."</p>
<p>When we were close beside him thus he said;<br/>
    Wherefore e'en such became I, when I heard him,<br/>
    As he is who is put into the grave.</p>
<p>Upon my clasped hands I straightened me,<br/>
    Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling<br/>
    The human bodies I had once seen burned.</p>
<p>Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors,<br/>
    And unto me Virgilius said: "My son,<br/>
    Here may indeed be torment, but not death.</p>
<p>Remember thee, remember! and if I<br/>
    On Geryon have safely guided thee,<br/>
    What shall I do now I am nearer God?</p>
<p>Believe for certain, shouldst thou stand a full<br/>
    Millennium in the bosom of this flame,<br/>
    It could not make thee bald a single hair.</p>
<p>And if perchance thou think that I deceive thee,<br/>
    Draw near to it, and put it to the proof<br/>
    With thine own hands upon thy garment's hem.</p>
<p>Now lay aside, now lay aside all fear,<br/>
    Turn hitherward, and onward come securely;"<br/>
    And I still motionless, and 'gainst my conscience!</p>
<p>Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,<br/>
    Somewhat disturbed he said: "Now look thou, Son,<br/>
    'Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall."</p>
<p>As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids<br/>
    The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her,<br/>
    What time the mulberry became vermilion,</p>
<p>Even thus, my obduracy being softened,<br/>
    I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name<br/>
    That in my memory evermore is welling.</p>
<p>Whereat he wagged his head, and said: "How now?<br/>
    Shall we stay on this side?" then smiled as one<br/>
    Does at a child who's vanquished by an apple.</p>
<p>Then into the fire in front of me he entered,<br/>
    Beseeching Statius to come after me,<br/>
    Who a long way before divided us.</p>
<p>When I was in it, into molten glass<br/>
    I would have cast me to refresh myself,<br/>
    So without measure was the burning there!</p>
<p>And my sweet Father, to encourage me,<br/>
    Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,<br/>
    Saying: "Her eyes I seem to see already!"</p>
<p>A voice, that on the other side was singing,<br/>
    Directed us, and we, attent alone<br/>
    On that, came forth where the ascent began.</p>
<p>"Venite, benedicti Patris mei,"<br/>
    Sounded within a splendour, which was there<br/>
    Such it o'ercame me, and I could not look.</p>
<p>"The sun departs," it added, "and night cometh;<br/>
    Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,<br/>
    So long as yet the west becomes not dark."</p>
<p>Straight forward through the rock the path ascended<br/>
    In such a way that I cut off the rays<br/>
    Before me of the sun, that now was low.</p>
<p>And of few stairs we yet had made assay,<br/>
    Ere by the vanished shadow the sun's setting<br/>
    Behind us we perceived, I and my Sages.</p>
<p>And ere in all its parts immeasurable<br/>
    The horizon of one aspect had become,<br/>
    And Night her boundless dispensation held,</p>
<p>Each of us of a stair had made his bed;<br/>
    Because the nature of the mount took from us<br/>
    The power of climbing, more than the delight.</p>
<p>Even as in ruminating passive grow<br/>
    The goats, who have been swift and venturesome<br/>
    Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,</p>
<p>Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,<br/>
    Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff<br/>
    Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;</p>
<p>And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,<br/>
    Passes the night beside his quiet flock,<br/>
    Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,</p>
<p>Such at that hour were we, all three of us,<br/>
    I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,<br/>
    Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.</p>
<p>Little could there be seen of things without;<br/>
    But through that little I beheld the stars<br/>
    More luminous and larger than their wont.</p>
<p>Thus ruminating, and beholding these,<br/>
    Sleep seized upon me,&mdash;sleep, that oftentimes<br/>
    Before a deed is done has tidings of it.</p>
<p>It was the hour, I think, when from the East<br/>
    First on the mountain Citherea beamed,<br/>
    Who with the fire of love seems always burning;</p>
<p>Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought<br/>
    I saw a lady walking in a meadow,<br/>
    Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:</p>
<p>"Know whosoever may my name demand<br/>
    That I am Leah, and go moving round<br/>
    My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.</p>
<p>To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,<br/>
    But never does my sister Rachel leave<br/>
    Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.</p>
<p>To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,<br/>
    As I am to adorn me with my hands;<br/>
    Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies."</p>
<p>And now before the antelucan splendours<br/>
    That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,<br/>
    As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,</p>
<p>The darkness fled away on every side,<br/>
    And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,<br/>
    Seeing already the great Masters risen.</p>
<p>"That apple sweet, which through so many branches<br/>
    The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,<br/>
    To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings."</p>
<p>Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words<br/>
    As these made use; and never were there guerdons<br/>
    That could in pleasantness compare with these.</p>
<p>Such longing upon longing came upon me<br/>
    To be above, that at each step thereafter<br/>
    For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.</p>
<p>When underneath us was the stairway all<br/>
    Run o'er, and we were on the highest step,<br/>
    Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,</p>
<p>And said: "The temporal fire and the eternal,<br/>
    Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come<br/>
    Where of myself no farther I discern.</p>
<p>By intellect and art I here have brought thee;<br/>
    Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth;<br/>
    Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.</p>
<p>Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;<br/>
    Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs<br/>
    Which of itself alone this land produces.</p>
<p>Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes<br/>
    Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,<br/>
    Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.</p>
<p>Expect no more or word or sign from me;<br/>
    Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,<br/>
    And error were it not to do its bidding;</p>
<p>Thee o'er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!"</p>

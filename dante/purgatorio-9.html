<h1>Purgatorio</h1>
<h2>by Dante Alighieri</h2>
<h3>Canto IX</h3>
<p>The concubine of old Tithonus now<br/>
    Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,<br/>
    Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;</p>
<p>With gems her forehead all relucent was,<br/>
    Set in the shape of that cold animal<br/>
    Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,</p>
<p>And of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night<br/>
    Had taken two in that place where we were,<br/>
    And now the third was bending down its wings;</p>
<p>When I, who something had of Adam in me,<br/>
    Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,<br/>
    There were all five of us already sat.</p>
<p>Just at the hour when her sad lay begins<br/>
    The little swallow, near unto the morning,<br/>
    Perchance in memory of her former woes,</p>
<p>And when the mind of man, a wanderer<br/>
    More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,<br/>
    Almost prophetic in its visions is,</p>
<p>In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended<br/>
    An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,<br/>
    With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,</p>
<p>And this, it seemed to me, was where had been<br/>
    By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,<br/>
    When to the high consistory he was rapt.</p>
<p>I thought within myself, perchance he strikes<br/>
    From habit only here, and from elsewhere<br/>
    Disdains to bear up any in his feet.</p>
<p>Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,<br/>
    Terrible as the lightning he descended,<br/>
    And snatched me upward even to the fire.</p>
<p>Therein it seemed that he and I were burning,<br/>
    And the imagined fire did scorch me so,<br/>
    That of necessity my sleep was broken.</p>
<p>Not otherwise Achilles started up,<br/>
    Around him turning his awakened eyes,<br/>
    And knowing not the place in which he was,</p>
<p>What time from Chiron stealthily his mother<br/>
    Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,<br/>
    Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,</p>
<p>Than I upstarted, when from off my face<br/>
    Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,<br/>
    As doth the man who freezes with affright.</p>
<p>Only my Comforter was at my side,<br/>
    And now the sun was more than two hours high,<br/>
    And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.</p>
<p>"Be not intimidated," said my Lord,<br/>
    "Be reassured, for all is well with us;<br/>
    Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.</p>
<p>Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;<br/>
    See there the cliff that closes it around;<br/>
    See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.</p>
<p>Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,<br/>
    When inwardly thy spirit was asleep<br/>
    Upon the flowers that deck the land below,</p>
<p>There came a Lady and said: 'I am Lucia;<br/>
    Let me take this one up, who is asleep;<br/>
    So will I make his journey easier for him.'</p>
<p>Sordello and the other noble shapes<br/>
    Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,<br/>
    Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.</p>
<p>She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes<br/>
    That open entrance pointed out to me;<br/>
    Then she and sleep together went away."</p>
<p>In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,<br/>
    And who to confidence his fear doth change,<br/>
    After the truth has been discovered to him,</p>
<p>So did I change; and when without disquiet<br/>
    My Leader saw me, up along the cliff<br/>
    He moved, and I behind him, tow'rd the height.</p>
<p>Reader, thou seest well how I exalt<br/>
    My theme, and therefore if with greater art<br/>
    I fortify it, marvel not thereat.</p>
<p>Nearer approached we, and were in such place,<br/>
    That there, where first appeared to me a rift<br/>
    Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,</p>
<p>I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,<br/>
    Diverse in colour, to go up to it,<br/>
    And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.</p>
<p>And as I opened more and more mine eyes,<br/>
    I saw him seated on the highest stair,<br/>
    Such in the face that I endured it not.</p>
<p>And in his hand he had a naked sword,<br/>
    Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow'rds us,<br/>
    That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.</p>
<p>"Tell it from where you are, what is't you wish?"<br/>
    Began he to exclaim; "where is the escort?<br/>
    Take heed your coming hither harm you not!"</p>
<p>"A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,"<br/>
    My Master answered him, "but even now<br/>
    Said to us, 'Thither go; there is the portal.'"</p>
<p>"And may she speed your footsteps in all good,"<br/>
    Again began the courteous janitor;<br/>
    "Come forward then unto these stairs of ours."</p>
<p>Thither did we approach; and the first stair<br/>
    Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,<br/>
    I mirrored myself therein as I appear.</p>
<p>The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,<br/>
    Was of a calcined and uneven stone,<br/>
    Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.</p>
<p>The third, that uppermost rests massively,<br/>
    Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red<br/>
    As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.</p>
<p>Both of his feet was holding upon this<br/>
    The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,<br/>
    Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.</p>
<p>Along the three stairs upward with good will<br/>
    Did my Conductor draw me, saying: "Ask<br/>
    Humbly that he the fastening may undo."</p>
<p>Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,<br/>
    For mercy's sake besought that he would open,<br/>
    But first upon my breast three times I smote.</p>
<p>Seven P's upon my forehead he described<br/>
    With the sword's point, and, "Take heed that thou wash<br/>
    These wounds, when thou shalt be within," he said.</p>
<p>Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,<br/>
    Of the same colour were with his attire,<br/>
    And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.</p>
<p>One was of gold, and the other was of silver;<br/>
    First with the white, and after with the yellow,<br/>
    Plied he the door, so that I was content.</p>
<p>"Whenever faileth either of these keys<br/>
    So that it turn not rightly in the lock,"<br/>
    He said to us, "this entrance doth not open.</p>
<p>More precious one is, but the other needs<br/>
    More art and intellect ere it unlock,<br/>
    For it is that which doth the knot unloose.</p>
<p>From Peter I have them; and he bade me err<br/>
    Rather in opening than in keeping shut,<br/>
    If people but fall down before my feet."</p>
<p>Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,<br/>
    Exclaiming: "Enter; but I give you warning<br/>
    That forth returns whoever looks behind."</p>
<p>And when upon their hinges were turned round<br/>
    The swivels of that consecrated gate,<br/>
    Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,</p>
<p>Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed<br/>
    Tarpeia, when was ta'en from it the good<br/>
    Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.</p>
<p>At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,<br/>
    And "Te Deum laudamus" seemed to hear<br/>
    In voices mingled with sweet melody.</p>
<p>Exactly such an image rendered me<br/>
    That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,<br/>
    When people singing with the organ stand;</p>
<p>For now we hear, and now hear not, the words.</p>

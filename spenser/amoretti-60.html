<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>LX</h2>
<p>
They that in course of heavenly spheares are skild<br/>
To every planet point his sundry yeare,<br/>
In which her circles voyage is fulfild:<br/>
As Mars in threescore yeares doth run his spheare.<br/>
So, since the winged god his planet cleare<br/>
Began in me to move, one yeare is spent;<br/>
The which doth longer unto me appeare,<br/>
Then al those fourty which my life out-went.<br/>
Then, by that count which lovers books invent,<br/>
The spheare of Cupid fourty yeares containes,<br/>
Which I have wasted in long languishment,<br/>
That seemâ€™d the longer for my greater paines.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But let my Loves fayre planet short her wayes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This yeare ensuing, or else short my dayes.

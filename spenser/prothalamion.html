<h1>Prothalamion</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<p>
Calm was the day, and through the trembling air<br/>
Sweet breathing Zephyrus did softly play,<br/>
A gentle spirit, that lightly did delay<br/>
Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;<br/>
When I whose sullen care,<br/>
Through discontent of my long fruitless stay<br/>
In prince's court, and expectation vain<br/>
Of idle hopes, which still do fly away<br/>
Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,<br/>
Walked forth to ease my pain<br/>
Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,<br/>
Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,<br/>
Was painted all with variable flowers,<br/>
And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,<br/>
Fit to deck maidens' bowers,<br/>
And crown their paramours,<br/>
Against the bridal day, which is not long:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There, in a meadow, by the river's side,<br/>
A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,<br/>
All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,<br/>
With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,<br/>
As each had been a bride;<br/>
And each one had a little wicker basket,<br/>
Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,<br/>
In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,<br/>
And with fine fingers cropt full featously<br/>
The tender stalks on high.<br/>
Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,<br/>
They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,<br/>
The little daisy, that at evening closes,<br/>
The virgin lily, and the primrose true,<br/>
With store of vermeil roses,<br/>
To deck their bridegrooms' posies<br/>
Against the bridal day, which was not long:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue<br/>
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;<br/>
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.<br/>
The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,<br/>
Did never whiter shew,<br/>
Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be<br/>
For love of Leda, whiter did appear:<br/>
Yet Leda was they say as white as he,<br/>
Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.<br/>
So purely white they were,<br/>
That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,<br/>
Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare<br/>
To wet their silken feathers, lest they might<br/>
Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,<br/>
And mar their beauties bright,<br/>
That shone as heaven's light,<br/>
Against their bridal day, which was not long:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,<br/>
Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,<br/>
As they came floating on the crystal flood.<br/>
Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,<br/>
Their wondering eyes to fill.<br/>
Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,<br/>
Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem<br/>
Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair<br/>
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;<br/>
For sure they did not seem<br/>
To be begot of any earthly seed,<br/>
But rather angels, or of angels' breed:<br/>
Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,<br/>
In sweetest season, when each flower and weed<br/>
The earth did fresh array,<br/>
So fresh they seemed as day,<br/>
Even as their bridal day, which was not long:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then forth they all out of their baskets drew<br/>
Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,<br/>
That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,<br/>
All which upon those goodly birds they threw,<br/>
And all the waves did strew,<br/>
That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,<br/>
When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,<br/>
Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,<br/>
That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,<br/>
Like a bride's chamber floor.<br/>
Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,<br/>
Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,<br/>
The which presenting all in trim array,<br/>
Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,<br/>
Whilst one did sing this lay,<br/>
Prepared against that day,<br/>
Against their bridal day, which was not long:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,<br/>
And heaven's glory, whom this happy hour<br/>
Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,<br/>
Joy may you have and gentle heart's content<br/>
Of your love's complement:<br/>
And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,<br/>
With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,<br/>
Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove<br/>
All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile<br/>
For ever to assoil.<br/>
Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,<br/>
And blessed plenty wait upon your board,<br/>
And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,<br/>
That fruitful issue may to you afford,<br/>
Which may your foes confound,<br/>
And make your joys redound<br/>
Upon your bridal day, which is not long:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'<br/>
</p>
<p>
So ended she; and all the rest around<br/>
To her redoubled that her undersong,<br/>
Which said their bridal day should not be long.<br/>
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground<br/>
Their accents did resound.<br/>
So forth those joyous birds did pass along,<br/>
Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,<br/>
As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,<br/>
Yet did by signs his glad affection show,<br/>
Making his stream run slow.<br/>
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell<br/>
Gan flock about these twain, that did excel<br/>
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend<br/>
The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,<br/>
Did on those two attend,<br/>
And their best service lend,<br/>
Against their wedding day, which was not long:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br/>
</p>
<p>
At length they all to merry London came,<br/>
To merry London, my most kindly nurse,<br/>
That to me gave this life's first native source;<br/>
Though from another place I take my name,<br/>
An house of ancient fame.<br/>
There when they came, whereas those bricky towers,<br/>
The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,<br/>
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers<br/>
There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,<br/>
Till they decayed through pride:<br/>
Next whereunto there stands a stately place,<br/>
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace<br/>
Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,<br/>
Whose want too well now feels my friendless case.<br/>
But ah, here fits not well<br/>
Old woes but joys to tell<br/>
Against the bridal day, which is not long:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,<br/>
Great England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,<br/>
Whose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,<br/>
And Hercules' two pillars standing near<br/>
Did make to quake and fear:<br/>
Fair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,<br/>
That fillest England with thy triumph's fame,<br/>
Joy have thou of thy noble victory,<br/>
And endless happiness of thine own name<br/>
That promiseth the same:<br/>
That through thy prowess and victorious arms,<br/>
Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;<br/>
And great Elisa's glorious name may ring<br/>
Through all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,<br/>
Which some brave Muse may sing<br/>
To ages following,<br/>
Upon the bridal day, which is not long:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From those high towers this noble lord issuing,<br/>
Like radiant Hesper when his golden hair<br/>
In th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,<br/>
Descended to the river's open viewing,<br/>
With a great train ensuing.<br/>
Above the rest were goodly to be seen<br/>
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature<br/>
Beseeming well the bower of any queen,<br/>
With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,<br/>
Fit for so goodly stature;<br/>
That like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,<br/>
Which deck the baldric of the heavens bright.<br/>
They two forth pacing to the river's side,<br/>
Received those two fair birds, their love's delight;<br/>
Which, at th' appointed tide,<br/>
Each one did make his bride<br/>
Against their bridal day, which is not long:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br/>

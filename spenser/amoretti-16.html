<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>XVI</h2>
<p>
One day as I unwarily did gaze<br/>
On those fayre eyes, my loves immortall light,<br/>
The whiles my stonisht hart stood in amaze,<br/>
Through sweet illusion of her lookes delight,<br/>
I mote perceive how, in her glauncing sight,<br/>
Legions of Loves with little wings did fly,<br/>
Darting their deadly arrows, fyry bright,<br/>
At every rash beholder passing by.<br/>
One of those archers closely I did spy,<br/>
Ayming his arrow at my very hart:<br/>
When suddenly, with twincle of her eye,<br/>
The damzell broke his misintended dart.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had she not so doon, sure I had bene slayne;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet as it was, I hardly scapâ€™t with paine.

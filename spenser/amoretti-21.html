<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>XXI</h2>
<p>
Was it the worke of Nature or of Art,<br/>
Which tempred so the feature of her face,<br/>
That pride and meeknesse, mist by equall part,<br/>
Doe both appeare tâ€™adorne her beauties grace?<br/>
For with mild pleasance, which doth pride displace,<br/>
She to her love doth lookers eyes allure;<br/>
And with stern countenance back again doth chace<br/>
Their looser lookes that stir up lustes impure.<br/>
With such strange termes her eyes she doth inure,<br/>
That with one looke she doth my life dismay,<br/>
And with another doth it streight recure:<br/>
Her smile me drawes; her frowne me drives away.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus doth she traine and teach me with her lookes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such art of eyes I never read in bookes!<br/>

<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>XXIX</h2>
<p>
See! how the stubborne damzell doth deprave<br/>
My simple meaning with disdaynfull scorne,<br/>
And by the bay which I unto her gave<br/>
Accoumpts my self her captive quite forlorne.<br/>
The bay, quoth she, is of the victours born,<br/>
Yielded them by the vanquisht as theyr meeds,<br/>
And they therewith doe poetes heads adorne,<br/>
To sing the glory of their famous deeds.<br/>
But sith she will the conquest challeng needs,<br/>
Let her accept me as her faithfull thrall;<br/>
That her great triumph, which my skill exceeds,<br/>
I may in trump of fame blaze over all.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then would I decke her head with glorious bayes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fill the world with her victorious prayse.

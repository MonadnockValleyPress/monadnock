<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>LXXIII</h2>
<p>
Being my self captyved here in care,<br/>
My hart, (whom none with servile bands can tye,<br/>
But the fayre tresses of your golden hayre,)<br/>
Breaking his prison, forth to you doth fly.<br/>
Like as a byrd, that in ones hand doth spy<br/>
Desired food, to it doth make his flight,<br/>
Even so my hart, that wont on your fayre eye<br/>
To feed his fill, flyes backe unto your sight.<br/>
Doe you him take, and in your bosome bright<br/>
Gently encage, that he may be your thrall:<br/>
Perhaps he there may learne, with rare delight,<br/>
To sing your name and prayses over all:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That it hereafter may you not repent,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Him lodging in your bosome to have lent.

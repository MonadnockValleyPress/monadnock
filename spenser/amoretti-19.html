<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>XIX</h2>
<p>
The merry cuckow, messenger of Spring,<br/>
His trompet shrill hath thrise already sounded.<br/>
That warnes al lovers wayte upon their king,<br/>
Who now is coming forth with girland crouned.<br/>
With noyse whereof the quyre of byrds resounded<br/>
Their anthemes sweet, devized of loves prayse,<br/>
That all the woods theyr ecchoes back rebounded,<br/>
As if they knew the meaning of their layes.<br/>
But mongst them all which did Loves honor rayse,<br/>
No word was heard of her that most it ought;<br/>
But she his precept proudly disobayes,<br/>
And doth his ydle message set at nought.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, O Love, unlesse she turne to thee<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere cuckow end, let her a rebell be!

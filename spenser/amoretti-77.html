<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>LXXVII</h2>
<p>
Was it a dreame, or did I see it playne?<br/>
A goodly table of pure yvory,<br/>
All spred with juncats fit to entertayne<br/>
The greatest prince with pompous roialty:<br/>
Mongst which, there in a silver dish did ly<br/>
Two golden apples of unvalewd price,<br/>
Far passing those which Hercules came by,<br/>
Or those which Atalanta did entice;<br/>
Exceeding sweet, yet voyd of sinfull vice;<br/>
That many sought, yet none could ever taste;<br/>
Sweet fruit of pleasure, brought from Paradice<br/>
By Love himselfe, and in his garden plaste.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her brest that table was, so richly spredd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My thoughts the guests, which would thereon have fedd.<br/>

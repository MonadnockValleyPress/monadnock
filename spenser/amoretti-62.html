<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>LXII</h2>
<p>
The weary yeare his race now having run,<br/>
The new begins his compast course anew:<br/>
With shew of morning mylde he hath begun,<br/>
Betokening peace and plenty to ensew.<br/>
So let us, which this chaunge of weather vew,<br/>
Chaunge eke our mynds, and former lives amend;<br/>
The old yeares sinnes forepast let us eschew,<br/>
And fly the faults with which we did offend.<br/>
Then shall the new yeares ioy forth freshly send<br/>
Into the glooming world his gladsome ray,<br/>
And all these stormes, which now his beauty blend,<br/>
Shall turne to calmes, and tymely cleare away.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So, likewise, Love! cheare you your heavy spright,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And chaunge old yeares annoy to new delight.

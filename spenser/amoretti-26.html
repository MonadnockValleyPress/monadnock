<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>XXVI</h2>
<p>
Sweet is the rose, but growes upon a brere;<br/>
Sweet is the iunipeer; but sharpe his bough;<br/>
Sweet is the eglantine, but pricketh nere;<br/>
Sweet is the firbloome, but his braunches rough;<br/>
Sweet is the cypresse, but his rynd is rough;<br/>
Sweet is the nut, but bitter is his pill;<br/>
Sweet is the broome-flowre, but yet sowre enough;<br/>
And sweet is moly, but his root is ill.<br/>
So every sweet with soure is tempred still,<br/>
That maketh it be coveted the more:<br/>
For easie things, that may be got at will,<br/>
Most sorts of men doe set but little store.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then should I accompt of little paine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That endlesse pleasure shall unto me gaine!<br/>

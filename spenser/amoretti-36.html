<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>XXXVI</h2>
<p>
Tell me, when shall these wearie woes have end;<br/>
Or shall their ruthlesse torment never cease,<br/>
But al my days in pining languor spend,<br/>
Without hope of asswagement or release?<br/>
Is there no meanes for me to purchace peace,<br/>
Or make agreement with her thrilling eyes;<br/>
But that their cruelty doth still increace,<br/>
And dayly more augment my miseryes?<br/>
But when ye have shewâ€™d all extremityes,<br/>
Then think how little glory ye have gayned<br/>
By slaying him, whose lyfe, though ye despyse,<br/>
Mote have your life in honor long maintayned.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But by his death, which some perhaps will mone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall condemned be of many a one.

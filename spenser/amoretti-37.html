<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>XXXVII</h2>
<p>
What guyle is this, that those her golden tresses<br/>
She doth attyre under a net of gold,<br/>
And with sly skill so cunningly them dresses,<br/>
That which is gold or haire may scarse be told?<br/>
Is it that mens frayle eyes, which gaze too bold,<br/>
She may entangle in that golden snare;<br/>
And, being caught, may craftily enfold<br/>
Their weaker harts, which are not wel aware?<br/>
Take heed therefore, myne eyes, how ye doe stare<br/>
Henceforth too rashly on that guilefull net,<br/>
In which if ever ye entrapped are,<br/>
Out of her bands ye by no meanes shall get.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fondnesse it were for any, being free,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To covet fetters, though they golden bee!

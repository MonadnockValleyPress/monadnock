<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>LXXIV</h2>
<p>
Most happy letters! fram’d by skilfull trade,<br/>
With which that happy name was first desynd<br/>
The which three times thrise happy hath me made,<br/>
With guifts of body, fortune, and of mind.<br/>
The first ray being to me gave by kind,<br/>
From mothers womb deriv’d by dew descent:<br/>
The second is my sovereigne Queene most kind,<br/>
That honour and large richesse to me lent:<br/>
The third my Love, my lives last ornament,<br/>
By whom my spirit out of dust was raysed,<br/>
To speake her prayse and glory excellent,<br/>
Of all alive most worthy to be praysed.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye three Elizabeths! for ever live,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That three such graces did unto me give.

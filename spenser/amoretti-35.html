<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>XXXV</h2>
<p>
My hungry eyes, through greedy covetize<br/>
Still to behold the obiect of their paine,<br/>
With no contentment can themselves suffize;<br/>
But having, pine, and having not, complaine.<br/>
For lacking it, they cannot lyfe sustayne;<br/>
And having it, they gaze on it the more,<br/>
In their amazement lyke Narcissus vaine,<br/>
Whose eyes him starvâ€™d: so plenty makes me poore.<br/>
Yet are mine eyes so filled with the store<br/>
Of that faire sight, that nothing else they brooke,<br/>
But lothe the things which they did like before,<br/>
And can no more endure on them to looke.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All this worlds glory seemeth vayne to me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all their showes but shadowes, saving she.

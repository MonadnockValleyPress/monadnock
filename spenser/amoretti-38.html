<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>XXXVIII</h2>
<p>
Arion, when, through tempests cruel wracke,<br/>
He forth was thrown into the greedy seas,<br/>
Through the sweet musick which his harp did make<br/>
Allur’d a dolphin him from death to ease.<br/>
But my rude musick, which was wont to please<br/>
Some dainty eares, cannot, with any skill,<br/>
The dreadfull tempest of her wrath appease,<br/>
Nor move the dolphin from her stubborn will.<br/>
But in her pride she dooth persever still,<br/>
All carelesse how my life for her decayes:<br/>
Yet with one word she can it save or spill.<br/>
To spill were pitty, but to save were prayse!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuse rather to be praysd for doing good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to be blam’d for spilling guiltlesse blood.

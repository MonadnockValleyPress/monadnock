<h1>Amoretti</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Spenser</h2>
<h2>XLVII</h2>
<p>
Trust not the treason of those smyling lookes,<br/>
Untill ye have their guylefull traynes well tryde;<br/>
For they are lyke but unto golden hookes,<br/>
That from the foolish fish theyr bayts do hyde:<br/>
So she with flattring smyles weake harts doth guyde<br/>
Unto her love, and tempte to theyr decay;<br/>
Whome, being caught, she kills with cruell pryde,<br/>
And feeds at pleasure on the wretched pray.<br/>
Yet even whylst her bloody hands them slay,<br/>
Her eyes looke lovely, and upon them smyle,<br/>
That they take pleasure in their cruell play,<br/>
And, dying, doe themselves of payne beguyle.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O mighty charm! which makes men love theyr bane,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thinck they dy with pleasure, live with payne.

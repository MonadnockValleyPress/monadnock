<h1>Dimensions</h1>
<h2>by Laura Riding</h2>
<p>
Measure me for a burial<br/>
That my low stone may neatly say<br/>
In a precise, Euclidean way<br/>
How I am three-dimensional.
</p>
<p>
Yet can life be so thin and small?<br/>
Measure me in time. But time is strange<br/>
And still and knows no rule or change<br/>
But death and death is nothing at all.
</p>
<p>
Measure me by beauty.<br/>
But beauty is death's earliest name<br/>
For life, and life's first dying, a flame<br/>
That glimmers, an amaranth that will fade<br/>
And fade again in death's dim shade.
</p>
<p>
Measure me not by beauty, that fears strife.<br/>
For beauty makes peace with death, buying<br/>
Dishonor and eternal dying<br/>
That she may keep outliving life.
</p>
<p>
Measure me then by love &mdash; yet, no,<br/>
For I remember times when she<br/>
Sought her own measurements in me,<br/>
But fled, afraid I might foreshow<br/>
How broad I was myself and tall<br/>
And deep and many-measured, moving<br/>
My scale upon her and thus proving<br/>
That both of us were nothing at all.
</p>
<p>
Measure me by myself<br/>
And not by time or love or space<br/>
Or beauty. Give me this last grace:<br/>
That I may be on my low stone<br/>
A gage unto myself alone.<br/>
I would not have these old faiths fall<br/>
To prove that I was nothing at all.

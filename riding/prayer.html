<h1>And a Poor Prayer</h1>
<h2>by Laura Riding (1926)</h2>
<p>
And a poor prayer, in these days, to be simple.<br/>
What can the curled tongue say in a straighter way<br/>
When beauty breaks, even before we touch it<br/>
Into a thousand ardours at a thought?
</p>
<p>
Yet must the many be made one and fully<br/>
Needs still the same fright comfort and a kiss.<br/>
Keep us from questioning the hydra-headed<br/>
Philosophies, or hearing their replies.
</p>
<p>
If we must be more stupid to be kind,<br/>
May wisdom part from our commiserations<br/>
And be not seen among us again<br/>
Till we have loved without an understanding.
</p>
<p>
Then we shall weep, even as when we were wiser<br/>
But be not troubled with accounting for<br/>
The hidden grief; forget old words; beseech<br/>
The truth with silence, as we did with speech.
</p>

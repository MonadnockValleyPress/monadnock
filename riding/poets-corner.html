<h1>The Poet's Corner</h1>
<h2>by Laura Riding (1926)</h2>
<p>
Here where the end of bone is no end of song<br/>
And the earth is bedecked with immortality<br/>
In what was poetry<br/>
And now is pride beside<br/>
And nationality,<br/>
Here is a battle with no bravery<br/>
But if the coward's tongue has gone<br/>
Swording his own lusty lung.<br/>
Listen if there is victory<br/>
Written into a library,<br/>
Waving the books in banners<br/>
Soldierly at last, for the lines<br/>
Go marching on, delivered of the soul.
</p>
<p>
And happily may they rest beyond<br/>
Suspicion now, the incomprehensibles<br/>
Traitorous in such talking<br/>
As chattered over their country's boundaries.<br/>
The graves are gardened and the whispering<br/>
Stops at the hedges, there is singing<br/>
Of it in the ranks, there is a hush<br/>
Where the ground has limits<br/>
And the rest is loveliness.
</p>
<p>
And loveliness?<br/>
Death has an understanding of it<br/>
Loyal to many flags<br/>
And is a silent ally of any country<br/>
Beset in its mortal heart<br/>
With immortal poetry.

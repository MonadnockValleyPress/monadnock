<h1>Helen's Burning</h1>
<h2>by Laura Riding</h2>
<p>
Her beauty, which we talk of,<br/>
Is but half her fate.<br/>
All does not come to light<br/>
Until the two halves meet<br/>
And we are silent<br/>
And she speaks,<br/>
Her whole fate saying,<br/>
She is, she is not, in one breath.
</p>
<p>
But we tell only half, fear to know all<br/>
Lest all should be to tell<br/>
And our mouths choke with flame<br/>
Of her consuming<br/>
And lose the gift of prophecy.
</p>

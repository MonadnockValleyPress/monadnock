<h1>Prisms</h1>
<h2>by Laura Riding</h2>
<p>
What is beheld through glass seems glass.
</p>
<p>
The quality of what I am<br/>
Encases what I am not,<br/>
Smoothes the strange world.<br/>
I perceive it slowly,<br/>
In my time,<br/>
In my material,<br/>
As my pride,<br/>
As my possession:<br/>
The vision is love.
</p>
<p>
When life crashes like a cracked pane,<br/>
Still shall I love<br/>
Even the strange dead as the living once.<br/>
Death also sees, though distantly,<br/>
And I must trust then as now<br/>
A prism &mdash; of another kind,<br/>
Through which one may not put one's hands to touch.

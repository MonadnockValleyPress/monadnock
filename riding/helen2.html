<h1>Helen's Faces</h1>
<h2>by Laura Riding</h2>
<p>
Bitterly have I been contested for,<br/>
Though never have I counted numbers &mdash;<br/>
They were too many, less than all.<br/>
And kindly have I warded off<br/>
Contest and bitterness,<br/>
Given each a replica of love,<br/>
Beguiled them with fine images.
</p>
<p>
To their hearts they held them.<br/>
Her dear face, its explicitness!<br/>
Clearly, of all women, the immediate one<br/>
To these immediate men.
</p>
<p>
But the original woman is mythical,<br/>
Lies lonely against no heart.<br/>
Her eyes are cold, see love far off,<br/>
Read no desertion when love removes,<br/>
The images out of fashion.
</p>
<p>
Undreamed of in her many faces<br/>
That each kept off the plunderer:<br/>
Contest and bitterness never raged round her.

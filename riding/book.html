<h1>The Troubles of a Book</h1>
<h2>by Laura Riding</h2>
<p>
The trouble of a book is first to be<br/>
No thoughts to nobody,<br/>
Then to lie as long unwritten<br/>
As it will lie unread,<br/>
Then to build word for word an author<br/>
And occupy his head<br/>
Until the head declares vacancy<br/>
To make full publication<br/>
Of running empty.
</p>
<p>
The trouble of a book is secondly<br/>
To keep aware and ready<br/>
And listening like an innkeeper,<br/>
Wishing, not wishing for a guest,<br/>
Torn between hope of no rest<br/>
And hope of rest.<br/>
Uncertainly the pages doze<br/>
And blink open to passing fingers<br/>
With landlord smile, then close.
</p>
<p>
The trouble of a book is thirdly<br/>
To speak its sermon, then look the other way,<br/>
Arouse commotion in the margin,<br/>
Where tongue meets the eye,<br/>
But claim no experience of panic,<br/>
No complicity in the outcry.<br/>
The ordeal of a book is to give no hint<br/>
Of ordeal, to be flat and witless<br/>
Of the upright sense of print.
</p>
<p>
The trouble of a book is chiefly<br/>
To be nothing but book outwardly;<br/>
To wear binding like binding,<br/>
Bury itself in book-death,<br/>
Yet to feel all but book;<br/>
To breathe live words, yet with the breath<br/>
Of letters; to address liveliness<br/>
In reading eyes, be answered with<br/>
Letters and bookishness.

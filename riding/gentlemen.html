<h1>Many Gentlemen</h1>
<h2>by Laura Riding (1926)</h2>
<p>
Many gentlemen there are born not babes.<br/>
They will be babes, they will be babes<br/>
In the shades.<br/>
They will dribble, they will babble,<br/>
They will pule in pantomime<br/>
Who were not babes in baby time.
</p>
<p>
Of such infant sorrow<br/>
Will they whimper<br/>
On Aspasia's bosom<br/>
In the shades to-morrow:<br/>
Many gentlemen, many gentlemen frowning,<br/>
But not Socrates simpering among these,<br/>
Who was well weaned of her honey<br/>
In his prime and needs no pap now,<br/>
Having then long with baby eyes<br/>
Smiled upward to her learn√®d brow.

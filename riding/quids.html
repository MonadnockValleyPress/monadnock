<h1>The Quids</h1>
<h2>by Laura Riding (1926)</h2>
<p>
The little quids, the monstrous quids,<br/>
The everywhere, everything, always quids,<br/>
The atoms of the Monoton,<br/>
Each turned an essence where it stood,<br/>
Ground a gisty dust from its neighbours' edges,<br/>
Until a powdery thoughtfall stormed in and out &mdash;<br/>
The cerebration of a slippery quid enterprise.
</p>
<p>
Each quid stirred.<br/>
The united quids<br/>
Waved through a sinuous decision.<br/>
The quids, that had never done anything before<br/>
But be, be, be, be, be &mdash;<br/>
The quids resolved to predicate,<br/>
To dissipate themselves in grammar.
</p>
<p>
Oh, the Monoton didn't care,<br/>
For whatever they did &mdash;<br/>
The Monoton's contributing quids &mdash;<br/>
The Monoton would always remain the same.
</p>
<p>
A quid here and there gyrated in place-position,<br/>
While many turned inside-out for the fun of it.<br/>
And a few refused to be anything but<br/>
Simple unpredicated copulatives.<br/>
Little by little, this commotion of quids,<br/>
By ones, by tens, by casual millions,<br/>
Squirming within the state of things,<br/>
The metaphysical acrobats,<br/>
The naked, immaterial quids,<br/>
Turned in on themselves<br/>
And came out all dressed &mdash;<br/>
Each similar quid of the inward same,<br/>
Each similar quid dressed in a different way,<br/>
The quids' idea of a holiday.
</p>
<p>
The quids could never tell what was happening.<br/>
But the Monoton felt itself differently the same<br/>
In its different parts.<br/>
The silly quids upon their learn√®d exercise<br/>
Never knew, could never tell<br/>
What their wisdom was about,<br/>
What their carnival was like,<br/>
Being in, being in, being always in<br/>
Where they never could get out<br/>
Of the everywhere, everything, always in,<br/>
To derive themselves from the Monoton.
</p>
<p>
But I know, with a quid inside of me,<br/>
But I know what a quid's disguise is like,<br/>
Being one myself,<br/>
The gymnastic device<br/>
That a quid puts on for exercise.
</p>
<p>
And so should the trees,<br/>
And so should the worms,<br/>
And so should you,<br/>
And all the other predicates<br/>
And all the other accessories<br/>
Of the quids' masquerade.

<h1>As Well As Any Other</h1>
<h2>by Laura Riding</h2>
<p>
As well as any other, Erato,<br/>
I can dwell separately on what we know<br/>
In common secrecy,<br/>
And celebrate the old, ador√®d rose,<br/>
Retell &mdash; oh why &mdash; how similarly grows<br/>
The last leaf of the tree.
</p>
<p>
But for familiar sense what need can be<br/>
Of my most singular device or me,<br/>
If homage may be done<br/>
(Unless it is agreed we shall not break<br/>
The patent silence for mere singing's sake)<br/>
As well by anyone?
</p>
<p>
Mistrust me not, then, if I have begun<br/>
Unwontedly and if I seem to shun<br/>
Unstrange and much-told ground:<br/>
For in peculiar earth alone can I<br/>
Construe the word and let the meaning lie<br/>
That rarely may be found.

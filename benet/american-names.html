<h1>American Names</h1>
<h2>by Stephen Vincent Benét</h2>
<p>
I have fallen in love with American names,<br/>
The sharp names that never get fat,<br/>
The snakeskin-titles of mining-claims,<br/>
The plumed war-bonnet of Medicine Hat,<br/>
Tucson and Deadwood and Lost Mule Flat.
</p>
<p>
Seine and Piave are silver spoons,<br/>
But the spoonbowl-metal is thin and worn,<br/>
There are English counties like hunting-tunes<br/>
Played on the keys of a postboy's horn,<br/>
But I will remember where I was born.
</p>
<p>
I will remember Carquinez Straits,<br/>
Little French Lick and Lundy's Lane,<br/>
The Yankee ships and the Yankee dates<br/>
And the bullet-towns of Calamity Jane.<br/>
I will remember Skunktown Plain.
</p>
<p>
I will fall in love with a Salem tree<br/>
And a rawhide quirt from Santa Cruz,<br/>
I will get me a bottle of Boston sea<br/>
And a blue-gum nigger to sing me blues.<br/>
I am tired of loving a foreign muse.
</p>
<p>
Rue des Martyrs and Bleeding-Heart-Yard,<br/>
Senlis, Pisa, and Blindman's Oast,<br/>
It is a magic ghost you guard<br/>
But I am sick for a newer ghost,<br/>
Harrisburg, Spartanburg, Painted Post.
</p>
<p>
Henry and John were never so<br/>
And Henry and John were always right?<br/>
Granted, but when it was time to go<br/>
And the tea and the laurels had stood all night,<br/>
Did they never watch for Nantucket Light?
</p>
<p>
I shall not rest quiet in Montparnasse.<br/>
I shall not lie easy at Winchelsea.<br/>
You may bury my body in Sussex grass,<br/>
You may bury my tongue at Champmédy.<br/>
I shall not be there. I shall rise and pass.<br/>
Bury my heart at Wounded Knee.
</p>

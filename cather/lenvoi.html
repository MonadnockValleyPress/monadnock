<h1>L'Envoi</h1>
<h2>by Willa Cather (1903)</h2>
<p>
Where are the loves that we had loved before<br/>
When once we are alone, and shut the door?<br/>
No matter whose the arms that held me fast,<br/>
The arms of Darkness hold me at the last.<br/>
No matter down what primrose path I tend,<br/>
I kiss the lips of Silence in the end.<br/>
No matter on what heart I found delight,<br/>
I come again unto the breast of Night.<br/>
No matter when or how love did befall,<br/>
'Tis Loneliness that loves me best of all,<br/>
And in the end she claims me, and I know<br/>
That she will stay, though all the rest may go.<br/>
No matter whose the eyes that I would keep<br/>
Near in the dark, 'tis in the eyes of Sleep<br/>
That I must look and look forever more,<br/>
When once I am alone, and shut the door.

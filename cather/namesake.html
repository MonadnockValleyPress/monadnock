<h1>The Namesake</h1>
<h2>by Willa Cather (1903)</h2>
<p>TO W.S.B., OF THE THIRTY-THIRD VIRGINIA</p>
<p><em>Vigesimum post annum in obscurum correpto lucem vigesimi gaudens percipisse</em>
<p>
Two by two and three by three<br/>
Missouri lies by Tennessee;<br/>
Row on row, and hundred deep,<br/>
Maryland and Georgia sleep;<br/>
Wistfully the poplars sigh<br/>
Where Virginia's thousands lie. 
<p>
</p>
Somewhere there among the stones,<br/>
All alike, that mark their bones,<br/>
Lies a lad beneath the pine<br/>
Who once bore a name like mine,&mdash;<br/>
Flung his splendid life away<br/>
Long before I saw the day. 
<p>
</p>
Often have they told me how<br/>
Hair like mine grew on his brow.<br/>
He was twenty to a day<br/>
When he got his jacket gray&mdash;<br/>
He was barely twenty-one<br/>
When they found him by his gun. 
<p>
</p>
Tell me, Uncle by the pine,<br/>
Had you such a girl as mine,<br/>
When you put her arms away<br/>
Riding to the wars that day?<br/>
Were her lips so cold, instead<br/>
You must need to kiss the lead? 
<p>
</p>
Had the bugle, lilting gay,<br/>
Sweeter things than she to say?<br/>
Were there no gay fellows then,<br/>
You must seek these silent men?<br/>
Was your luck so bad at play<br/>
You must game your bones away? 
<p>
</p>
Ah! you lad with hair like mine,<br/>
Sleeping by the Georgia pine,<br/>
I'd be quick to quit the sun<br/>
Just to help you hold your gun,<br/>
And I'd leave my girl to share<br/>
Your still bed of glory there. 
<p>
</p>
Proud it is I am to know<br/>
In my veins there still must flow,<br/>
There to burn and bite alway,<br/>
That proud blood you threw away;<br/>
And I'll be winner at the game<br/>
Enough for two who bore the name.

<h1>Life</h1>
<h2>by Abraham Cowley</h2>
<p>
Life's a name<br/>
That nothing here can truly claim;<br/>
This wretched inn, where we scarce stay to bait,<br/>
We call our dwelling-place!<br/>
And mighty voyages we take,<br/>
And mighty journeys seem to make,<br/>
O'er sea and land, the little point that has no space.<br/>
Because we fight and battles gain,<br/>
Some captives call, and say, "the rest are slain";<br/>
Because we heap up yellow earth, and so<br/>
Rich, valiant, wise, and virtuous seem to grow;<br/>
Because we draw a long nobility<br/>
From hieroglyphic proofs of heraldry&mdash;<br/>
We grow at last by Custom to believe,<br/>
That really we Live;<br/>
Whilst all these Shadows, that for Things we take,<br/>
Are but the empty Dreams which in Death's sleep we make.<br/>

<h1>The Wish</h1>
<h2>by Abraham Cowley</h2>
<p>
Well then; I now do plainly see<br/>
This busy world and I shall ne'er agree.<br/>
The very honey of all earthly joy<br/>
Does of all meats the soonest cloy;<br/>
And they (methinks) deserve my pity<br/>
Who for it can endure the stings,<br/>
The crowd, and buzz, and murmurings<br/>
Of this great hive, the city.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ah, yet, ere I descend to th' grave<br/>
May I a small house and large garden have!<br/>
And a few friends, and many books, both true,<br/>
Both wise, and both delightful too!<br/>
And since love ne'er will from me flee,<br/>
A mistress moderately fair,<br/>
And good as guardian angels are,<br/>
Only belov'd, and loving me.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O fountains! when in you shall I<br/>
Myself eas'd of unpeaceful thoughts espy?<br/>
O fields! O woods! when shall I be made<br/>
The happy tenant of your shade?<br/>
Here's the spring-head of Pleasure's flood:<br/>
Here's wealthy Nature's treasury,<br/>
Where all the riches lie that she<br/>
Has coin'd and stamp'd for good.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pride and ambition here<br/>
Only in far-fetch'd metaphors appear;<br/>
Here nought but winds can hurtful murmurs scatter,<br/>
And nought but Echo flatter.<br/>
The gods, when they descended, hither<br/>
From heaven did always choose their way:<br/>
And therefore we may boldly say<br/>
That 'tis the way too thither.<br/>
</p>
<p>
How happy here should I<br/>
And one dear she live, and embracing die!<br/>
She who is all the world, and can exclude<br/>
In deserts solitude.<br/>
I should have then this only fear:<br/>
Lest men, when they my pleasures see,<br/>
Should hither throng to live like me,<br/>
And so make a city here.<br/>

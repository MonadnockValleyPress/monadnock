<h1>Platonic Love</h1>
<h2>by Abraham Cowley</h2>
<p>
Indeed I must confess,<br/>
When souls mix 't is an happiness;<br/>
But not complete till bodies too do combine,<br/>
And closely as our minds together join:<br/>
But half of heaven the souls in glory taste,<br/>
Till by love in heaven, at last,<br/>
Their bodies too are plac'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In thy immortal part<br/>
Man, as well as I, thou art;<br/>
But something't is that differs thee and me;<br/>
And we must one even in that difference be.<br/>
I thee, both as a man and woman, prize;<br/>
For a perfect love implies<br/>
Love in all capacities.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Can that for true love pass,<br/>
When a fair woman courts her glass?<br/>
Something unlike must in love's likeness be;<br/>
His wonder is, one, and variety:<br/>
For he, whose soul nought but a soul can move,<br/>
Does a new Narcissus prove,<br/>
And his own image love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That souls do beauty know,<br/>
'T is to the bodies' help they owe;<br/>
If, when they know 't, they straight abuse that trust,<br/>
And shut the body from't, 't is as unjust<br/>
As if I brought my dearest friend to see<br/>
My mistress, and at th' instant he<br/>
Should steal her quite from me.<br/>

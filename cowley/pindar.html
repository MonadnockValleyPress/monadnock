<h1>The Praise of Pindar</h1>
<h2>by Abraham Cowley</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Pindar is imitable by none;<br/>
The phoenix Pindar is a vast species alone.<br/>
Whoe'er but Daedalus with waxen wings could fly<br/>
And neither sink too low nor soar too high?<br/>
What could he who followed claim<br/>
But of vain boldness the unhappy fame,<br/>
And by his fall a sea to name?<br/>
Pindar's unnavigable song,<br/>
Like a swollen flood from some steep mountain, pours along;<br/>
The ocean meets with such a voice<br/>
From his enlarged mouth as drowns the ocean's noise.<br/>
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
So Pindar does new words and figures roll<br/>
Down his impetuous dithyrambic tide,<br/>
Which in no channel deigns to abide,<br/>
Which neither banks nor dikes control.<br/>
Whether the immortal gods he sings<br/>
In a no less immortal strain,<br/>
Or the great acts of god-descended kings,<br/>
Who in his numbers still survive and reign,<br/>
Each rich embroidered line,<br/>
Which their triumphant brows around<br/>
By his sacred hand is bound,<br/>
Does all their starry diadems outshine.<br/>
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
Whether at Pisa's race he please<br/>
To carve in polished verse the conquerors' images,<br/>
Whether the swift, the skillful, or the strong<br/>
Be crowned in his nimble, artful, vigorous song,<br/>
Whether some brave young man's untimely fate<br/>
In words worth dying for he celebrate,<br/>
Such mournful and such pleasing words<br/>
As joy to his mother's and his mistress' grief affords,<br/>
He bids him live and grow in fame;<br/>
Among the stars he sticks his name;<br/>
The grave can but the dross of him devour,<br/>
So small is death's, so great the poet's power.<br/>
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
Lo, how the obsequious wind and swelling air<br/>
The Theban swan does upwards bear<br/>
Into the walks of clouds, where he does play,<br/>
And with extended wings opens his liquid way,<br/>
Whilst, alas, my timorous Muse<br/>
Unambitious tracks pursues;<br/>
Does, with weak, unballast wings,<br/>
About the mossy brooks and springs,<br/>
About the trees' new-blossomed heads,<br/>
About the gardens' painted beds,<br/>
About the fields and flowery meads,<br/>
And all inferior beauteous things,<br/>
Like the laborious bee,<br/>
For little drops of honey flee,<br/>
And there with humble sweets contents her industry.<br/>

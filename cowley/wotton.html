<h1>On the Death of Sir Henry Wotton</h1>
<h2>by Abraham Cowley</h2>
<p>
What shall we say, since silent now is he<br/>
Who when he spoke, all things would silent be?<br/>
Who had so many languages in store,<br/>
That only fame shall speak of him in more;<br/>
Whom England now no more return'd must see;<br/>
He's gone to heaven on his fourth embassy.<br/>
On earth he travell'd often; not to say<br/>
H' had been abroad, or pass loose time away.<br/>
In whatsoever land he chanc'd to come,<br/>
He read the men and manners, bringing home<br/>
Their wisdom, learning, and their piety,<br/>
As if he went to conquer, not to see.<br/>
So well he understood the most and best<br/>
Of tongues, that Babel sent into the West;<br/>
Spoke them so truly, that he had (you'd swear)<br/>
Not only liv'd, but been born every-where.<br/>
Justly each nation's speech to him was known,<br/>
Who for the world was made, not us alone;<br/>
Nor ought the language of that man be less,<br/>
Who in his breast had all things to express.<br/>
We say that learning's endless, and blame Fate<br/>
For not allowing life a longer date:<br/>
He did the utmost bounds of knowledge find,<br/>
He found them not so large as was his mind;<br/>
But, like the brave Pell√¶an youth, did moan<br/>
Because that art had no more worlds than one;<br/>
And, when he saw that he through all had past,<br/>
He dy'd, lest he should idle grow at last.<br/>

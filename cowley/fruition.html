<h1>Against Fruition</h1>
<h2>by Abraham Cowley</h2>
<p>
No; thou'rt a fool, I'll swear, if e'er thou grant;<br/>
Much of my veneration thou must want,<br/>
When once thy kindness puts my ignorance out,<br/>
For a learn'd age is always least devout.<br/>
Keep still thy distance; for at once to me<br/>
Goddess and woman too thou canst not be;<br/>
Thou'rt queen of all that sees thee, and as such<br/>
Must neither tyrannize nor yield too much;<br/>
Such freedom give as may admit command,<br/>
But keep the forts and magazines in thine hand.<br/>
Thou'rt yet a whole world to me, and dost fill<br/>
My large ambition; but 'tis dang'rous still,<br/>
Lest I like the Pell√¶an prince should be,<br/>
And weep for other worlds, having conquered thee.<br/>
When Love has taken all thou hast away,<br/>
His strength by too much riches will decay.<br/>
Thou in my fancy dost much higher stand<br/>
Than women can be placed by Nature's hand;<br/>
And I must needs, I'm sure, a loser be,<br/>
To change thee, as thou'rt there, for very thee.<br/>
Thy sweetness is so much within me placed,<br/>
That shouldst thou nectar give, 'twould spoil the taste.<br/>
Beauty at first moves wonder and delight;<br/>
'Tis Nature's juggling trick to cheat the sight;<br/>
We admire it, whilst unknown, but after more<br/>
Admire ourselves for liking it before.<br/>
Love, like a greedy hawk, if we give way,<br/>
Does overgorge himself with his own prey;<br/>
Of very hopes a surfeit he'll sustain<br/>
Unless by fears he cast them up again:<br/>
His spirit and sweetness dangers keep alone;<br/>
If once he lose his sting, he grows a drone.<br/>

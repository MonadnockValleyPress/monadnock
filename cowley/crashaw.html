<h1>On the Death of Mr Crashaw</h1>
<h2>by Abraham Cowley</h2>
<p>
Poet and Saint! to thee alone are given<br/>
The two most sacred names of earth and heaven,<br/>
The hard and rarest union which can be<br/>
Next that of godhead with humanity.<br/>
Long did the Muses banish'd slaves abide,<br/>
And built vain pyramids to mortal pride;<br/>
Like Moses thou (though spells and charms withstand)<br/>
Hast brought them nobly home back to their Holy Land.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ah wretched we, poets of earth! but thou<br/>
Wert living the same poet which thou'rt now.<br/>
Whilst angels sing to thee their airs divine,<br/>
And joy in an applause so great as thine,<br/>
Equal society with them to hold,<br/>
Thou need'st not make new songs, but say the old.<br/>
And they (kind spirits!) shall all rejoice to see<br/>
How little less than they exalted man may be.<br/>
Still the old heathen gods in numbers dwell,<br/>
The heavenliest thing on earth still keeps up Hell.<br/>
Nor have we yet quite purg'd the Christian land;<br/>
Still idols here like calves at Bethel stand.<br/>
And though Pan's death long since all oracles broke,<br/>
Yet still in rhyme the fiend Apollo spoke:<br/>
Nay with the worst of heathen dotage we<br/>
(Vain men!) the monster Woman deify;<br/>
Find stars, and tie our fates there in a face,<br/>
And Paradise in them by whom we lost it, place.<br/>
What different faults corrupt our Muses thus<br/>
Wanton as girls, as old wives fabulous!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thy spotless Muse, like Mary, did contain<br/>
The boundless Godhead; she did well disdain<br/>
That her eternal verse employ'd should be<br/>
On a less subject than eternity;<br/>
And for a sacred mistress scorn'd to take<br/>
But her whom God himself scorn'd not his spouse to make.<br/>
It (in a kind) her miracle did do;<br/>
A fruitful mother was, and virgin too.<br/>
</p>
<p>
How well, blest swan, did fate contrive thy death;<br/>
And make thee render up thy tuneful breath<br/>
In thy great mistress' arms! thou most divine<br/>
And richest offering of Loretto's shrine!<br/>
Where like some holy sacrifice t' expire<br/>
A fever burns thee, and Love lights the fire.<br/>
Angels (they say) brought the fam'd chapel there,<br/>
And bore the sacred load in triumph through the air.<br/>
'Tis surer much they brought thee there, and they,<br/>
And thou, their charge, went singing all the way.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pardon, my Mother Church, if I consent<br/>
That angels led him when from thee he went,<br/>
For even in error sure no danger is<br/>
When join'd with so much piety as his.<br/>
Ah, mighty God, with shame I speak't, and grief,<br/>
Ah that our greatest faults were in belief!<br/>
And our weak reason were even weaker yet,<br/>
Rather than thus our wills too strong for it.<br/>
His faith perhaps in some nice tenents might<br/>
Be wrong; his life, I'm sure, was in the right.<br/>
And I myself a Catholic will be,<br/>
So far at least, great saint, to pray to thee.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hail, bard triumphant! and some care bestow<br/>
On us, the poets militant below!<br/>
Oppos'd by our old enemy, adverse chance,<br/>
Attack'd by envy, and by ignorance,<br/>
Enchain'd by beauty, tortured by desires,<br/>
Expos'd by tyrant Love to savage beasts and fires.<br/>
Thou from low earth in nobler flames didst rise,<br/>
And like Elijah, mount alive the skies.<br/>
Elisha-like (but with a wish much less,<br/>
More fit thy greatness, and my littleness)<br/>
Lo here I beg (I whom thou once didst prove<br/>
So humble to esteem, so good to love)<br/>
Not that thy spirit might on me doubled be,<br/>
I ask but half thy mighty spirit for me;<br/>
And when my Muse soars with so strong a wing,<br/>
'Twill learn of things divine, and first of thee to sing.<br/>

<h1>A Supplication</h1>
<h2>by Abraham Cowley</h2>
<p>
Awake, awake, my Lyre!<br/>
And tell thy silent master's humble tale<br/>
In sounds that may prevail;<br/>
Sounds that gentle thoughts inspire:<br/>
Though so exalted she<br/>
And I so lowly be<br/>
Tell her, such different notes make all thy harmony.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hark, how the strings awake!<br/>
And, though the moving hand approach not near,<br/>
Themselves with awful fear<br/>
A kind of numerous trembling make.<br/>
Now all thy forces try;<br/>
Now all thy charms apply;<br/>
Revenge upon her ear the conquests of her eye.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Weak Lyre! thy virtue sure<br/>
Is useless here, since thou art only found<br/>
To cure, but not to wound,<br/>
And she to wound, but not to cure,<br/>
Too weak too wilt thou prove<br/>
My passion to remove;<br/>
Physic to other ills, thou'rt nourishment to love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sleep, sleep again, my Lyre!<br/>
For thou canst never tell my humble tale<br/>
In sounds that will prevail,<br/>
Nor gentle thoughts in her inspire;<br/>
All thy vain mirth lay by,<br/>
Bid thy strings silent lie,<br/>
Sleep, sleep again, my Lyre, and let thy master die.<br/>

<h1>Inconstancy</h1>
<h2>by Abraham Cowley</h2>
<p>
Five years ago (says Story) I lov'd you,<br/>
For which you call me most inconstant now;<br/>
Pardon me, Madam! you mistake the man,<br/>
For I am not the same that I was then;<br/>
No flesh is now the same 'twas then in me;<br/>
And that my mind is chang'd, yourself may see.<br/>
The same thoughts to retain still, and intents,<br/>
Were more inconstant far; for accidents<br/>
Must of all things most strangely inconstant prove,<br/>
If from one subject they t' another move;<br/>
My members then the father-members were<br/>
From whence these take their birth which now are here.<br/>
If then this body love what th' other did,<br/>
'T were incest; which by Nature is forbid.<br/>
You might as well this day inconstant name,<br/>
Because the weather is not still the same<br/>
That it was yesterday â€” or blame the year,<br/>
'Cause the spring flowers, and autumn fruit, does bear.<br/>
The world's a scene of changes; and to be<br/>
Constant, in Nature were inconstancy;<br/>
For 't were to break the laws herself has made:<br/>
Our substances themselves do fleet and fade;<br/>
The most fix'd being still does move and fly,<br/>
Swift as the wings of time 't is measur'd by.<br/>
T' imagine then that Love should never cease<br/>
(Love, which is but the ornament of these)<br/>
Were quite as senseless, as to wonder why<br/>
Beauty and colour stay not when we die.<br/>

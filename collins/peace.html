<h1>Ode to Peace</h1>
<h2>by William Collins</h2>
<p>
O thou, who bad'st thy turtles bear<br/>
Swift from his grasp thy golden hair,<br/>
And sought'st thy native skies;<br/>
When War, by vultures drawn from far,<br/>
To Britain bent his iron car,<br/>
And bade his storms arise!
</p>
<p>
Tired of his rude tyrannic sway,<br/>
Our youth shall fix some festive day,<br/>
His sullen shrines to burn:<br/>
But thou who hear'st the turning spheres,<br/>
What sounds may charm thy partial ears,<br/>
And gain thy blest return!
</p>
<p>
O Peace, thy injured robes up-bind!<br/>
O rise! and leave not one behind<br/>
Of all thy beamy train;<br/>
The British Lion, goddess sweet,<br/>
Lies stretch'd on earth to kiss thy feet,<br/>
And own thy holier reign.
</p>
<p>
Let others court thy transient smile,<br/>
But come to grace thy western isle,<br/>
By warlike Honour led;<br/>
And, while around her ports rejoice,<br/>
While all her sons adore thy choice,<br/>
With him for ever wed!

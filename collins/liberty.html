<h1>Ode to Liberty</h1>
<h2>by William Collins</h2>
<h4>(STROPHE)</h4>
<p>
Who shall awake the Spartan fife,<br/>
And call in solemn sounds to life<br/>
The youths, whose locks divinely spreading,<br/>
Like vernal hyacinths in sullen hue,<br/>
At once the breath of Fear and Virtue shedding,<br/>
Applauding Freedom lov'd of old to view?<br/>
What new Alcæus, fancy-blest,<br/>
Shall sing the sword, in myrtles drest,<br/>
At Wisdom's shrine a-while its flame concealing,<br/>
(What place so fit to seal a deed renown'd?)<br/>
Till she her brightest lightnings round revealing,<br/>
It leap'd in glory forth, and dealt her prompted wound!<br/>
O Goddess, in that feeling hour,<br/>
When most its sounds would court thy ears,<br/>
Let not my shell's misguided pow'r,<br/>
E'er draw thy sad, thy mindful tears.<br/>
No, Freedom, no, I will not tell,<br/>
How Rome, before thy weeping face,<br/>
With heaviest sound, a giant-statue, fell,<br/>
Push'd by a wild and artless race,<br/>
From off its wide ambitious base,<br/>
When Time his northern sons of spoil awoke,<br/>
And all the blended work of strength and grace,<br/>
With many a rude repeated stroke,<br/>
And many a barb'rous yell, to thousand fragments broke.<br/>
</p>
<h4>(EPODE)</h4>
<p>
Yet ev'n, where'er the least appear'd,<br/>
Th' admiring world thy hand rever'd;<br/>
Still 'midst the scatter'd states around,<br/>
Some remnants of her strength were found;<br/>
They saw by what escap'd the storm,<br/>
How wond'rous rose her perfect form;<br/>
How in the great the labour'd whole,<br/>
Each mighty master pour'd his soul!<br/>
For sunny Florence, seat of Art,<br/>
Beneath her vines preserv'd a part,<br/>
Till they, whom Science lov'd to name,<br/>
(O who could fear it?) quench'd her flame.<br/>
And lo, an humbler relic laid<br/>
In jealous Pisa's olive shade!<br/>
See small Marino joins the theme,<br/>
Tho' least, not last in thy esteem:<br/>
Strike, louder strike th' ennobling strings<br/>
To those whose merchant sons were kings;<br/>
To him, who deck'd with pearly pride,<br/>
In Adria weds his green-hair'd bride;<br/>
Hail Port of Glory, Wealth, and Pleasure,<br/>
Ne'er let me change this Lydian measure:<br/>
Nor e'er her former pride relate,<br/>
To sad Liguria's bleeding state.<br/>
Ah no! more pleas'd thy haunts I seek,<br/>
On wild Helvetia's mountains bleak:<br/>
(Where, when the favor'd of thy choice,<br/>
The daring archer heard thy voice;<br/>
Forth from his eyrie rous'd in dread,<br/>
The rav'ning eagle northward fled.)<br/>
Or dwell in willow'd meads more near,<br/>
With those to whom thy stork is dear:<br/>
Those whom the rod of Alva bruis'd,<br/>
Whose crown a British queen refus'd!<br/>
The magic works, thou feel'st the strains,<br/>
One holier name alone remains;<br/>
The perfect spell shall then avail,<br/>
Hail Nymph, ador'd by Britain, hail!<br/>
</p>
<h4>(ANTISTROPHE)</h4>
<p>
Beyond the measure vast of thought,<br/>
The works, the wizard Time has wrought!<br/>
The Gaul, 'tis held of antique story,<br/>
Saw Britain link'd to his now adverse strand,<br/>
No sea between, nor cliff sublime and hoary,<br/>
He pass'd with unwet feet thro' all our land.<br/>
To the blown Baltic then, they say,<br/>
The wild waves found another way,<br/>
Where Orcas howls, his wolfish mountains rounding,<br/>
Till all the banded West at once 'gan rise,<br/>
A wide wild storm ev'n Nature's self confounding,<br/>
With'ring her giant sons with strange uncouth surprise.<br/>
This pillar'd Earth so firm and wide,<br/>
By winds and inward labours torn,<br/>
In thunders dread was push'd aside,<br/>
And down the should'ring billows borne.<br/>
And see, like gems, her laughing train,<br/>
The little isles on ev'ry side,<br/>
Mona, once hid from those who search the main,<br/>
Where thousand elfin shapes abide,<br/>
And Wight who checks the west'ring tide,<br/>
For thee consenting Heav'n has each bestow'd,<br/>
A fair attendant on her sov'reign pride:<br/>
To thee this blest divorce she ow'd,<br/>
For thou hast made her vales thy lov'd, thy last abode!<br/>
</p>
<h4>(SECOND EPODE)</h4>
<p>
Then too, 'tis said, an hoary pile,<br/>
'Midst the green navel of our Isle,<br/>
Thy shrine in some religious wood,<br/>
O soul-enforcing Goddess, stood!<br/>
There oft the painted native's feet,<br/>
Were wont thy form celestial meet:<br/>
Tho' now with hopeless toil we trace<br/>
Time's backward rolls, to find its place;<br/>
Whether the fiery-tressed Dane,<br/>
Or Roman's self o'erturn'd the fane,<br/>
Or in what Heav'n-left age it fell,<br/>
'Twere hard for modern song to tell.<br/>
Yet still, if truth those beams infuse,<br/>
Which guide at once, and charm the Muse,<br/>
Beyond yon braided clouds that lie,<br/>
Paving the light-embroider'd sky:<br/>
Amidst the bright pavilion'd plains,<br/>
The beauteous model still remains.<br/>
There happier than in islands blest,<br/>
Or bow'rs by Spring or Hebe drest,<br/>
The chiefs who fill our Albion's story,<br/>
In warlike weeds, retir'd in glory,<br/>
Hear their consorted Druids sing<br/>
Their triumphs to th' immortal string.<br/>
How may the poet now unfold<br/>
What never tongue or numbers told?<br/>
How learn delighted, and amaz'd,<br/>
What hands unknown that fabric rais'd?<br/>
Ev'n now before his favour'd eyes,<br/>
In Gothic pride it seems to rise!<br/>
Yet Græcia's graceful orders join,<br/>
Majestic thro' the mix'd design;<br/>
The secret builder knew to choose,<br/>
Each sphere-found gem of richest hues:<br/>
Whate'er Heav'n's purer mould contains,<br/>
When nearer suns emblaze its veins;<br/>
There on the walls the patriot's sight,<br/>
May ever hang with fresh delight,<br/>
And, grav'd with some prophetic rage,<br/>
Read Albion's fame thro' ev'ry age.<br/>
Ye forms divine, ye laureate band,<br/>
That near her inmost altar stand!<br/>
Now soothe her, to her blissful train<br/>
Blithe Concord's social form to gain:<br/>
Concord, whose myrtle wand can steep<br/>
Ev'n Anger's blood-shot eyes in sleep:<br/>
Before whose breathing bosom's balm,<br/>
Rage drops his steel, and storms grow clam;<br/>
Her let our sires and matrons hoar<br/>
Welcome to Britain's ravag'd shore,<br/>
Our youths, enamour'd of the fair,<br/>
Play with the tangles of her hair,<br/>
Till in one loud applauding sound,<br/>
The Nations shout to her around,<br/>
O how supremely art thou blest,<br/>
Thou, Lady, thou shalt rule the West!<br/>

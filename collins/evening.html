<h1>Ode to Evening</h1>
<h2>by William Collins</h2>
<p>
If aught of oaten stop, or past'ral song,<br/>
May hope, chaste Eve, to soothe thy modest ear,<br/>
Like thy own solemn springs,<br/>
Thy springs and dying gales,<br/>
O nymph reserved, while now the bright-haired sun<br/>
Sits in yon western tent, whose cloudy skirts,<br/>
With brede ethereal wove,<br/>
O'erhang his wavy bed;<br/>
Now air is hushed, save where the weak-ey'd bat<br/>
With short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing,<br/>
Or where the beetle winds<br/>
His small but sullen horn<br/>
As oft he rises 'midst the twilight path<br/>
Against the pilgrim, borne in heedless hum:<br/>
Now teach me, maid composed,<br/>
To breathe some softened strain,<br/>
Whose numbers stealing through thy dark'ning vale<br/>
May not unseemly with its stillness suit,<br/>
As musing slow, I hail<br/>
Thy genial loved return.<br/>
For when thy folding star arising shows<br/>
His paly circlet, at his warning lamp<br/>
The fragrant Hours, and elves<br/>
Who slept in flowers the day,<br/>
And many a nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge<br/>
And sheds the fresh'ning dew, and lovelier still,<br/>
The pensive pleasures sweet<br/>
Prepare thy shad'wy car.<br/>
Then lead, calm votress, where some sheety lake<br/>
Cheers the lone heath, or some time-hallowed pile<br/>
Or upland fallows grey<br/>
Reflect its last cool gleam.<br/>
But when chill blust'ring winds, or driving rain,<br/>
Forbid my willing feet, be mine the hut<br/>
That from the mountain's side<br/>
Views wilds, and swelling floods,<br/>
And hamlets brown, and dim-discovered spires,<br/>
And hears their simple bell, and marks o'er all<br/>
Thy dewy fingers draw<br/>
The gradual dusky veil.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While Spring shall pour his showers, as oft he wont,<br/>
And bathe thy breathing tresses, meekest Eve;<br/>
While Summer loves to sport<br/>
Beneath thy ling'ring light;<br/>
While sallow Autumn fills thy lap with leaves;<br/>
Or Winter, yelling through the troublous air,<br/>
Affrights thy shrinking train<br/>
And rudely rends thy robes;<br/>
So long, sure-found beneath the sylvan shed,<br/>
Shall Fancy, Friendship, Science, rose-lipp'd Health,<br/>
Thy gentlest influence own,<br/>
And hymn thy fav'rite name!<br/>

<h1>The Passions</h1>
<h2>An Ode for Music</h2>
<h2>by William Collins</h2>
<p>
When Music, heavenly maid, was young,<br/>
While yet in early Greece she sung,<br/>
The Passions oft, to hear her shell,<br/>
Thronged around her magic cell,<br/>
Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,<br/>
Possest beyond the Muse's painting:<br/>
By turns they felt the glowing mind<br/>
Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined;<br/>
Till once, 'tis said, when all were fired,<br/>
Filled with fury, rapt, inspired,<br/>
From the supporting myrtles round<br/>
They snatched her instruments of sound,<br/>
And, as they oft had heard apart<br/>
Sweet lessons of her forceful art,<br/>
Each (for Madness ruled the hour)<br/>
Would prove his own expressive power.<br/>
</p>
<p>
First Fear his hand, its skill to try,<br/>
Amid the chords bewildered laid,<br/>
And back recoiled, he knew not why,<br/>
E'en at the sound himself had made.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next Anger rushed, his eyes on fire,<br/>
In lightnings owned his secret stings:<br/>
In one rude clash he struck the lyre,<br/>
And swept with hurried hand the strings.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With woful measures wan Despair<br/>
Low sullen sounds his grief beguiled;<br/>
A solemn, strange, and mingled air,<br/>
'Twas sad by fits, by starts 'twas wild.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But thou, O Hope, with eyes so fair,<br/>
What was thy delighted measure?<br/>
Still it whispered promised pleasure,<br/>
And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail!<br/>
Still would her touch the strain prolong;<br/>
And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,<br/>
She called on Echo still, through all the song,<br/>
And, where her sweetest theme she chose,<br/>
A soft responsive voice was heard at every close;<br/>
And Hope enchanted smiled, and waved her golden hair.<br/>
And longer had she sung;&mdash;but, with a frown,<br/>
Revenge impatient rose:<br/>
He threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down;<br/>
And, with a withering look,<br/>
The war-denouncing trumpet took,<br/>
And blew a blast so loud and dread,<br/>
Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe!<br/>
And ever and anon he beat<br/>
The doubling drum with furious heat;<br/>
And though sometimes each dreary pause between<br/>
Dejected Pity, at his side,<br/>
Her soul-subduing voice applied,<br/>
Yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien,<br/>
While each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head.<br/>
Thy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fixed:<br/>
Sad proof of thy distressful state!<br/>
Of differing themes the veering song was mixed;<br/>
And now it courted Love, now raving called on Hate.<br/>
With eyes up-raised, as one inspired,<br/>
Pale Melancholy sat retired;<br/>
And from her wild sequestered seat,<br/>
In notes, by distance made more sweet,<br/>
Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul;<br/>
And, dashing soft from rocks around,<br/>
Bubbling runnels joined the sound;<br/>
Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole,<br/>
Or, o'er some haunted stream, with fond delay,<br/>
Round an holy calm diffusing,<br/>
Love of Peace, and lonely musing,<br/>
In hollow murmurs died away.<br/>
But Oh! how altered was its sprightlier tone<br/>
When Cheerfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue,<br/>
Her bow across her shoulder flung,<br/>
Her buskins gemmed with morning dew,<br/>
Blew an inspiring air that dale and thicket rung<br/>
The hunter's call, to Faun and Dryad known!<br/>
The oak-crowned Sisters, and their chaste-eyed Queen,<br/>
Satyrs and Sylvan Boys, were seen<br/>
Peeping from forth their alleys green:<br/>
Brown Exercise rejoiced to hear;<br/>
And Sport leapt up, and seized his beechen spear.<br/>
Last came Joy's ecstatic trial:<br/>
He, with viny crown advancing,<br/>
First to the lively pipe his hand addrest;<br/>
But soon he saw the brisk awakening viol,<br/>
Whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best:<br/>
They would have thought who heard the strain<br/>
They saw, in Tempe's vale, her native maids<br/>
Amidst the festal-sounding shades<br/>
To some unwearied minstrel dancing,<br/>
While, as his flying fingers kissed the strings,<br/>
Love framed with Mirth a gay fantastic round:<br/>
Loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound;<br/>
And he, amidst his frolic play,<br/>
As if he would the charming air repay,<br/>
Shook thousand odours from his dewy wings.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O Music, sphere-descended maid,<br/>
Friend of Pleasure, Wisdom's aid!<br/>
Why, goddess, why, to us denied,<br/>
Lay'st thou thy ancient lyre aside?<br/>
As, in that loved Athenian bower,<br/>
You learned an all-commanding power,<br/>
Thy mimic soul, O Nymph endeared,<br/>
Can well recall what then it heard;<br/>
Where is thy native simple heart,<br/>
Devote to Virtue, Fancy, Art?<br/>
Arise, as in that elder time,<br/>
Warm, energetic, chaste, sublime!<br/>
Thy wonders, in that godlike age,<br/>
Fill thy recording Sister's page&mdash;<br/>
'Tis said, and I believe the tale,<br/>
Thy humblest reed could more prevail,<br/>
Had more of strength, diviner rage,<br/>
Than all which charms this laggard age;<br/>
E'en all at once together found<br/>

<h1>The Manners</h1>
<h2>by William Collins</h2>
<p>
Farewell, for clearer ken design'd,<br/>
The dim-discover'd tracts of mind;<br/>
Truths which, from action's paths retired,<br/>
My silent search in vain required!<br/>
No more my sail that deep explores;<br/>
No more I search those magic shores;<br/>
What regions part the world of soul,<br/>
Or whence thy streams, Opinion, roll:<br/>
If e'er I round such fairy field,<br/>
Some power impart the spear and shield,<br/>
At which the wizard Passions fly;<br/>
By which the giant Follies die!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Farewell the porch whose roof is seen<br/>
Arch'd with the enlivening olive's green:<br/>
Where Science, prank'd in tissued vest,<br/>
By Reason, Pride, and Fancy drest,<br/>
Comes, like a bride, so trim array'd,<br/>
To wed with Doubt in Plato's shade!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Youth of the quick uncheated sight,<br/>
Thy walks, Observance, more invite!<br/>
O thou who lovest that ampler range,<br/>
Where life's wide prospects round thee change,<br/>
And, with her mingling sons allied,<br/>
Throw'st the prattling page aside,<br/>
To me, in converse sweet, impart<br/>
To read in man the native heart;<br/>
To learn, where Science sure is found,<br/>
From Nature as she lives around;<br/>
And, gazing oft her mirror true,<br/>
By turns each shifting image view!<br/>
Till meddling Art's officious lore<br/>
Reverse the lessons taught before;<br/>
Alluring from a safer rule,<br/>
To dream in her enchanted school:<br/>
Thou, Heaven, whate'er of great we boast,<br/>
Hast blest this social science most.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Retiring hence to thoughtful cell,<br/>
As Fancy breathes her potent spell,<br/>
Not vain she finds the charmful task,<br/>
In pageant quaint, in motley mask;<br/>
Behold, before her musing eyes,<br/>
The countless Manners round her rise;<br/>
While, ever varying as they pass,<br/>
To some Contempt applies her glass:<br/>
With these the white-robed maids combine;<br/>
And those the laughing satyrs join!<br/>
But who is he whom now she views,<br/>
In robe of wild contending hues?<br/>
Thou by the Passions nursed, I greet<br/>
The comic sock that binds thy feet!<br/>
O Humour, thou whose name is known<br/>
To Britain's favour'd isle alone:<br/>
Me too amidst thy band admit;<br/>
There where the young-eyed healthful Wit,<br/>
(Whose jewels in his crisp√©d hair<br/>
Are placed each other's beams to share;<br/>
Whom no delights from thee divide)<br/>
In laughter loosed, attends thy side.<br/>
</p>
<p>
By old Miletus, who so long<br/>
Has ceased his love-inwoven song;<br/>
By all you taught the Tuscan maids,<br/>
In changed Italia's modern shades;<br/>
By him whose knight's distinguish'd name<br/>
Refined a nation's lust of fame;<br/>
Whose tales e'en now, with echoes sweet,<br/>
Castilia's Moorish hills repeat;<br/>
Or him whom Seine's blue nymphs deplore,<br/>
In watchet weeds on Gallia's shore;<br/>
Who drew the sad Sicilian maid,<br/>
By virtues in her sire betray'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O Nature boon, from whom proceed<br/>
Each forceful thought, each prompted deed;<br/>
If but from thee I hope to feel,<br/>
On all my heart imprint thy seal!<br/>
Let some retreating cynic find<br/>
Those oft-turn'd scrolls I leave behind:<br/>
The Sports and I this hour agree,<br/>
To rove thy scene-full world with thee!<br/>

<h1>Verses Selected from an Occasional Poem Entitled "Valediction"</h1>
<h2>by William Cowper</h2>
<p>
Oh Friendship! cordial of the human breast!<br/>
So little felt, so fervently profess'd!<br/>
Thy blossoms deck our unsuspecting years;<br/>
The promise of delicious fruit appears:<br/>
We hug the hopes of constancy and truth,<br/>
Such is the folly of our dreaming youth;<br/>
But soon, alas! detect the rash mistake<br/>
That sanguine inexperience loves to make;<br/>
And view with tears the expected harvest lost,<br/>
Decay'd by time, or wither'd by a frost.<br/>
Whoever undertakes a friend's great part<br/>
Should be renew'd in nature, pure in heart,<br/>
Prepared for martyrdom, and strong to prove<br/>
A thousand ways the force of genuine love.<br/>
He may be call'd to give up health and gain,<br/>
To exchange content for trouble, ease for pain,<br/>
To echo sigh for sigh, and groan for groan,<br/>
And wet his cheeks with sorrows not his own.<br/>
The heart of man, for such a task too frail,<br/>
When most relied on is most sure to fail;<br/>
And, summon'd to partake its fellow's woe,<br/>
Starts from its office like a broken bow.
</p>
<p>
Votaries of business and of pleasure prove<br/>
Faithless alike in friendship and in love.<br/>
Retired from all the circles of the gay,<br/>
And all the crowds that bustle life away,<br/>
To scenes where competition, envy, strife,<br/>
Beget no thunder-clouds to trouble life,<br/>
Let me, the charge of some good angel, find<br/>
One who has known, and has escaped mankind;<br/>
Polite, yet virtuous, who has brought away<br/>
The manners, not the morals, of the day:<br/>
With him, perhaps with her (for men have known<br/>
No firmer friendships than the fair have shown,)<br/>
Let me enjoy, in some unthought-of spot,<br/>
All former friends forgiven and forgot,<br/>
Down to the close of life's fast fading scene,<br/>
Union of hearts without a flaw between.<br/>
'Tis grace, 'tis bounty, and it calls for praise,<br/>
If God give health, that sunshine of our days!<br/>
And if he add, a blessing shared by few,<br/>
Content of heart, more praises still are due&mdash;<br/>
But if he grant a friend, that boon possess'd<br/>
Indeed is treasure, and crowns all the rest;<br/>
And giving one, whose heart is in the skies,<br/>
Born from above and made divinely wise,<br/>
He gives, what bankrupt nature never can,<br/>
Whose noblest coin is light and brittle man,<br/>
Gold, purer far than Ophir ever knew,<br/>
A soul, an image of himself, and therefore true.

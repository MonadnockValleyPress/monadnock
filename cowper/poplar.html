<h1>The Poplar Field</h1>
<h2>by William Cowper</h2>
<p>
The poplars are felled; farewell to the shade,<br/>
And the whispering sound of the cool colonnade:<br/>
The winds play no longer and sing in the leaves,<br/>
Nor Ouse on his bosom their image receives.
</p>
<p>
Twelve years have elapsed since I first took a view<br/>
Of my favourite field, and the bank where they grew,<br/>
And now in the grass behold they are laid,<br/>
And the tree is my seat that once lent me a shade.
</p>
<p>
The blackbird has fled to another retreat<br/>
Where the hazels afford him a screen from the heat;<br/>
And the scene where his melody charmed me before<br/>
Resounds with his sweet-flowing ditty no more.
</p>
<p>
My fugitive years are all hasting away,<br/>
And I must ere long lie as lowly as they,<br/>
With a turf on my breast and a stone at my head,<br/>
Ere another such grove shall arise in its stead.
</p>
<p>
'Tis a sight to engage me, if anything can,<br/>
To muse on the perishing pleasures of man;<br/>
Short-lived as we are, our enjoyments, I see,<br/>
Have a still shorter date, and die sooner than we.

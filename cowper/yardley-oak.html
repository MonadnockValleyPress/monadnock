<h1>Yardley Oak</h1>
<h2>by William Cowper</h2>
<p><em>(This poem was unfinished by the author.)</em></p>
<p>
Survivor sole, and hardly such, of all<br/>
That once lived here, thy brethren, at my birth,<br/>
(Since which I number threescore winters past,)<br/>
A shatter'd veteran, hollow-trunk'd perhaps,<br/>
As now, and with excoriate forks deform,<br/>
Relics of ages! could a mind, imbued<br/>
With truth from heaven, created thing adore,<br/>
I might with reverence kneel, and worship thee.
</p>
<p>
It seems idolatry with some excuse,<br/>
When our forefather druids in their oaks<br/>
Imagined sanctity. The conscience, yet<br/>
Unpurified by an authentic act<br/>
Of amnesty, the meed of blood divine,<br/>
Loved not the light, but, gloomy, into gloom<br/>
Of thickest shades, like Adam after taste<br/>
Of fruit proscribed, as to a refuge, fled.
</p>
<p>
Thou wast a bauble once, a cup and ball<br/>
Which babes might play with; and the thievish jay,<br/>
Seeking her food, with ease might have purloin'd<br/>
The auburn nut that held thee, swallowing down<br/>
Thy yet close-folded latitude of boughs<br/>
And all thine embryo vastness at a gulp.<br/>
But fate thy growth decreed; autumnal rains<br/>
Beneath thy parent tree mellow'd the soil<br/>
Design'd thy cradle; and a skipping deer,<br/>
With pointed hoof dibbling the glebe, prepared<br/>
The soft receptacle, in which, secure,<br/>
Thy rudiments should sleep the winter through.
</p>
<p>
So fancy dreams. Disprove it, if ye can,<br/>
Ye reasoners broad awake, whose busy search<br/>
Of argument, employ'd too oft amiss,<br/>
Sifts half the pleasures of short life away!
</p>
<p>
Thou fell'st mature; and, in the loamy clod<br/>
Swelling with vegetative force instinct,<br/>
Didst burst thine egg, as theirs the fabled twins,<br/>
Now stars; two lobes, protruding, pair'd exact;<br/>
A leaf succeeded, and another leaf,<br/>
And, all the elements thy puny growth<br/>
Fostering propitious, thou becamest a twig.
</p>
<p>
Who lived when thou wast such? Oh, could'st thou speak,<br/>
As in Dodona once thy kindred trees<br/>
Oracular, I would not curious ask<br/>
The future, best unknown, but at thy mouth<br/>
Inquisitive, the less ambiguous past.
</p>
<p>
By thee I might correct, erroneous oft,<br/>
The clock of history, facts and events<br/>
Timing more punctual, unrecorded facts<br/>
Recovering, and misstated setting right&mdash;<br/>
Desperate attempt, till trees shall speak again!
</p>
<p>
Time made thee what thou wast, king of the woods;<br/>
And time hath made thee what thou art&mdash;a cave<br/>
For owls to roost in. Once thy spreading boughs<br/>
O'erhung the champaign; and the numerous flocks<br/>
That grazed it stood beneath that ample cope<br/>
Uncrowded, yet safe shelter'd from the storm.<br/>
No flock frequents thee now. Thou hast outlived<br/>
Thy popularity, and art become<br/>
(Unless verse rescue thee awhile) a thing<br/>
Forgotten, as the foliage of thy youth.
</p>
<p>
While thus through all the stages thou hast push'd<br/>
Of treeship&mdash;first a seedling, hid in grass;<br/>
Then twig; then sapling; and, as century roll'd<br/>
Slow after century, a giant bulk<br/>
Of girth enormous, with moss-cushion'd root<br/>
Upheaved above the soil, and sides emboss'd<br/>
With prominent wens globose&mdash;till at the last<br/>
The rottenness, which time is charged to inflict<br/>
On other mighty ones, found also thee.
</p>
<p>
What exhibitions various hath the world<br/>
Witness'd of mutability in all<br/>
That we account most durable below?<br/>
Change is the diet on which all subsist,<br/>
Created changeable, and change at last,<br/>
Destroys them. Skies uncertain now the heat<br/>
Transmitting cloudless, and the solar beam<br/>
Now quenching in a boundless sea of clouds&mdash;<br/>
Calm and alternate storm, moisture, and drought,<br/>
Invigorate by turns the springs of life<br/>
In all that live, plant, animal, and man,<br/>
And in conclusion mar them. Nature's threads,<br/>
Fine passing thought, e'en in their coarsest works,<br/>
Delight in agitation, yet sustain<br/>
The force that agitates not unimpair'd;<br/>
But worn by frequent impulse, to the cause<br/>
Of their best tone their dissolution owe.
</p>
<p>
Thought cannot spend itself, comparing still<br/>
The great and little of thy lot, thy growth<br/>
From almost nullity into a state<br/>
Of matchless grandeur, and declension thence,<br/>
Slow, into such magnificent decay.<br/>
Time was when, settling on thy leaf, a fly<br/>
Could shake thee to the root&mdash;and time has been<br/>
When tempests could not. At thy firmest age<br/>
Thou hadst within thy bole solid contents<br/>
That might have ribb'd the sides and plank'd the deck<br/>
Of some flagg'd admiral; and tortuous arms,<br/>
The shipwright's darling treasure, didst present<br/>
To the four-quarter'd winds, robust and bold,<br/>
Warp'd into tough knee-timber, many a load!<br/>
But the axe spared thee. In those thriftier days<br/>
Oaks fell not, hewn by thousands, to supply<br/>
The bottomless demands of contest waged<br/>
For senatorial honours. Thus to time<br/>
The task was left to whittle thee away<br/>
With his sly scythe, whose ever-nibbling edge,<br/>
Noiseless, an atom, and an atom more,<br/>
Disjoining from the rest, has, unobserved,<br/>
Achieved a labour which had, far and wide,<br/>
By man perform'd, made all the forest ring.
</p>
<p>
Embowell'd now, and of thy ancient self<br/>
Possessing nought but the scoop'd rind, that seems<br/>
A huge throat calling to the clouds for drink,<br/>
Which it would give in rivulets to thy root,<br/>
Thou temptest none, but rather much forbidd'st<br/>
The feller's toil, which thou couldst ill requite.<br/>
Yet is thy root sincere, sound as the rock,<br/>
A quarry of stout spurs and knotted fangs,<br/>
Which, crook'd into a thousand whimsies, clasp<br/>
The stubborn soil, and hold thee still erect.
</p>
<p>
So stands a kingdom, whose foundation yet<br/>
Fails not, in virtue and in wisdom laid,<br/>
Though all the superstructure, by the tooth<br/>
Pulverized of venality, a shell<br/>
Stands now, and semblance only of itself!
</p>
<p>
Thine arms have left thee. Winds have rent them off<br/>
Long since, and rovers of the forest wild<br/>
With bow and shaft have burnt them. Some have left<br/>
A splinter'd stump bleach'd to a snowy white;<br/>
And some memorial none where once they grew.<br/>
Yet life still lingers in thee, and puts forth<br/>
Proof not contemptible of what she can,<br/>
Even where death predominates. The spring<br/>
Finds thee not less alive to her sweet force<br/>
Than yonder upstarts of the neighbouring wood,<br/>
So much thy juniors, who their birth received<br/>
Half a millennium since the date of thine.
</p>
<p>
But since, although well-qualified by age<br/>
To teach, no spirit dwells in thee, nor voice<br/>
May be expected from thee, seated here<br/>
On thy distorted root, with hearers none,<br/>
Or prompter, save the scene, I will perform<br/>
Myself the oracle, and will discourse<br/>
In my own ear such matter as I may.
</p>
<p>
One man alone, the father of us all,<br/>
Drew not his life from woman; never gazed,<br/>
With mute unconsciousness of what he saw,<br/>
On all around him; learn'd not by degrees,<br/>
Nor owed articulation to his ear;<br/>
But, moulded by his Maker into man<br/>
At once, upstood intelligent, survey'd<br/>
All creatures, with precision understood<br/>
Their purport, uses, properties, assign'd<br/>
To each his name significant, and, fill'd<br/>
With love and wisdom, render'd back to Heaven<br/>
In praise harmonious the first air he drew.<br/>
He was excused the penalties of dull<br/>
Minority. No tutor charged his hand<br/>
With the thought-tracing quill, or task'd his mind<br/>
With problems. History, not wanted yet,<br/>
Lean'd on her elbow, watching time, whose course,<br/>
Eventful, should supply her with a theme....

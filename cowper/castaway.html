<h1>The Castaway</h1>
<h2>by William Cowper</h2>
<p>
Obscurest night involved the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Atlantic billows roar'd,<br/>
When such a destined wretch as I,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash'd headlong from on board,<br/>
Of friends, of hope, of all bereft,<br/>
His floating home for ever left.
</p>
<p>
No braver chief could Albion boast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than he with whom he went,<br/>
Nor ever ship left Albion's coast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With warmer wishes sent.<br/>
He loved them both, but both in vain,<br/>
Nor him beheld, nor her again.
</p>
<p>
Not long beneath the whelming brine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expert to swim, he lay;<br/>
Nor soon he felt his strength decline,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or courage die away:<br/>
But waged with death a lasting strife,<br/>
Supported by despair of life.
</p>
<p>
He shouted; nor his friends had fail'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To check the vessel's course,<br/>
But so the furious blast prevail'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, pitiless perforce,<br/>
They left their outcast mate behind,<br/>
And scudded still before the wind.
</p>
<p>
Some succour yet they could afford;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, such as storms allow,<br/>
The cask, the coop, the floated cord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay'd not to bestow:<br/>
But he, they knew, nor ship nor shore,<br/>
Whate'er they gave, should visit more.
</p>
<p>
Nor, cruel as it seem'd, could he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their haste himself condemn,<br/>
Aware that flight, in such a sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone could rescue them;<br/>
Yet bitter felt it still to die<br/>
Deserted, and his friends so nigh.
</p>
<p>
He long survives, who lives an hour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ocean, self-upheld:<br/>
And so long he, with unspent power,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His destiny repell'd:<br/>
And ever, as the minutes flew,<br/>
Entreated help, or cried&mdash;"Adieu!"
</p>
<p>
At length, his transient respite past,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His comrades, who before<br/>
Had heard his voice in every blast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could catch the sound no more:<br/>
For then, by toil subdued, he drank<br/>
The stifling wave, and then he sank.
</p>
<p>
No poet wept him; but the page<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of narrative sincere,<br/>
That tells his name, his worth, his age,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is wet with Anson's tear;<br/>
And tears by bards or heroes shed<br/>
Alike immortalize the dead.
</p>
<p>
I therefore purpose not, or dream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descanting on his fate,<br/>
To give the melancholy theme<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more enduring date:<br/>
But misery still delights to trace<br/>
Its semblance in another's case.
</p>
<p>
No voice divine the storm allay'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No light propitious shone;<br/>
When, snatch'd from all effectual aid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We perish'd, each alone:<br/>
But I beneath a rougher sea,<br/>
And whelm'd in deeper gulfs than he.

<h1>A Poetical Epistle to Lady Austen</h1>
<h2>by William Cowper</h2>
<p>
Dear Anna&mdash;between friend and friend<br/>
Prose answers every common end;<br/>
Serves, in a plain and homely way,<br/>
To express the occurrence of the day;<br/>
Our health, the weather, and the news;<br/>
What walks we take, what books we choose;<br/>
And all the floating thoughts we find<br/>
Upon the surface of the mind.
</p>
<p>
But when a poet takes the pen,<br/>
Far more alive than other men,<br/>
He feels a gentle tingling come<br/>
Down to his finger and his thumb,<br/>
Derived from nature's noblest part,<br/>
The centre of a glowing heart:<br/>
And this is what the world, who knows<br/>
No flights above the pitch of prose,<br/>
His more sublime vagaries slighting,<br/>
Denominates an itch for writing.<br/>
No wonder I, who scribble rhyme<br/>
To catch the triflers of the time,<br/>
And tell them truths divine and clear,<br/>
Which, couch'd in prose, they will not hear;<br/>
Who labour hard to allure and draw<br/>
The loiterers I never saw,<br/>
Should feel that itching and that tingling,<br/>
With all my purpose intermingling,<br/>
To your intrinsic merit true,<br/>
When call'd to address myself to you.
</p>
<p>
Mysterious are His ways whose power<br/>
Brings forth that unexpected hour,<br/>
When minds, that never met before,<br/>
Shall meet, unite, and part no more:<br/>
It is the allotment of the skies,<br/>
The hand of the Supremely Wise,<br/>
That guides and governs our affections,<br/>
And plans and orders our connexions:<br/>
Directs us in our distant road,<br/>
And marks the bounds of our abode.<br/>
Thus we were settled when you found us,<br/>
Peasants and children all around us,<br/>
Not dreaming of so dear a friend,<br/>
Deep in the abyss of Silver-End.<br/>
Thus Martha, e'en against her will,<br/>
Perch'd on the top of yonder hill;<br/>
And you, though you must needs prefer<br/>
The fairer scenes of sweet Sancerre,<br/>
Are come from distant Loire, to choose<br/>
A cottage on the banks of Ouse.<br/>
This page of Providence quite new,<br/>
And now just opening to our view,<br/>
Employs our present thoughts and pains<br/>
To guess and spell what it contains:<br/>
But day by day, and year by year,<br/>
Will make the dark enigma clear;<br/>
And furnish us, perhaps, at last,<br/>
Like other scenes already past,<br/>
With proof, that we, and our affairs,<br/>
Are part of a Jehovah's cares;<br/>
For God unfolds by slow degrees<br/>
The purport of his deep decrees;<br/>
Sheds every hour a clearer light<br/>
In aid of our defective sight;<br/>
And spreads, at length, before the soul,<br/>
A beautiful and perfect whole,<br/>
Which busy man's inventive brain<br/>
Toils to anticipate in vain.
</p>
<p>
Say, Anna, had you never known<br/>
The beauties of a rose full blown,<br/>
Could you, though luminous your eye,<br/>
By looking on the bud descry,<br/>
Or guess with a prophetic power,<br/>
The future splendour of the flower?<br/>
Just so the Omnipotent, who turns<br/>
The system of a world's concerns,<br/>
From mere minuti√¶ can educe<br/>
Events of most important use;<br/>
And bid a dawning sky display<br/>
The blaze of a meridian day.<br/>
The works of man tend, one and all,<br/>
As needs they must, from great to small;<br/>
And vanity absorbs at length<br/>
The monuments of human strength.<br/>
But who can tell how vast the plan<br/>
Which this day's incident began?<br/>
Too small, perhaps, the slight occasion<br/>
For our dim-sighted observation;<br/>
It pass'd unnoticed, as the bird<br/>
That cleaves the yielding air unheard,<br/>
And yet may prove, when understood,<br/>
A harbinger of endless good.
</p>
<p>
Not that I deem, or mean to call<br/>
Friendship a blessing cheap or small:<br/>
But merely to remark, that ours,<br/>
Like some of nature's sweetest flowers,<br/>
Rose from a seed of tiny size<br/>
That seem'd to promise no such prize;<br/>
A transient visit intervening,<br/>
And made almost without a meaning,<br/>
(Hardly the effect of inclination,<br/>
Much less of pleasing expectation,)<br/>
Produced a friendship, then begun,<br/>
That has cemented us in one;<br/>
And placed it in our power to prove,<br/>
By long fidelity and love,<br/>
That Solomon has wisely spoken;<br/>
"A threefold cord is not soon broken."

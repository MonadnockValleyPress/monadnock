<h1>Lines Written During A Period Of Insanity</h1>
<h2>by William Cowper (ca. 1773)</h2>
<p>
Hatred and vengence, my eternal portion<br/>
Scarce can endure delay of execution,<br/>
Wait with impatient readiness to seize my<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soul in a moment.
</p>
<p>
Damned below Judas; more abhorred than he was,<br/>
Who for a few pence sold his holy Master!<br/>
Twice betrayed, Jesus me, the last delinquent,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deems the profanest.
</p>
<p>
Man disavows, and Deity disowns me:<br/>
Hell might afford my miseries a shelter;<br/>
Therefore Hell keeps her ever-hungry mouths all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolted against me.
</p>
<p>
Hard lot! encompassed with a thousand dangers;<br/>
Weary, faint, trembling with a thousand terrors,<br/>
I'm called, if vanquished, to receive a sentence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse than Abiram's.
</p>
<p>
Him the vindictive rod of angry Justice<br/>
Sent quick and howling to the centre headlong;<br/>
I, fed with judgment, in a fleshy tomb am<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried above ground.

<h1>The Solitude of Alexander Selkirk</h1>
<h2>by William Cowper</h2>
<p>
I am monarch of all I survey;<br/>
My right there is none to dispute;<br/>
From the centre all round to the sea<br/>
I am lord of the fowl and the brute.<br/>
O Solitude! where are the charms<br/>
That sages have seen in thy face?<br/>
Better dwell in the midst of alarms,<br/>
Than reign in this horrible place.
</p>
<p>
I am out of humanity's reach,<br/>
I must finish my journey alone,<br/>
Never hear the sweet music of speech;<br/>
I start at the sound of my own.<br/>
The beasts that roam over the plain<br/>
My form with indifference see;<br/>
They are so unacquainted with man,<br/>
Their tameness is shocking to me.
</p>
<p>
Society, Friendship, and Love<br/>
Divinely bestow'd upon man,<br/>
O, had I the wings of a dove<br/>
How soon would I taste you again!<br/>
My sorrows I then might assuage<br/>
In the ways of religion and truth;<br/>
Might learn from the wisdom of age,<br/>
And be cheer'd by the sallies of youth.
</p>
<p>
Ye winds that have made me your sport,<br/>
Convey to this desolate shore<br/>
Some cordial endearing report<br/>
Of a land I shall visit no more:<br/>
My friends, do they now and then send<br/>
A wish or a thought after me?<br/>
O tell me I yet have a friend,<br/>
Though a friend I am never to see.
</p>
<p>
How fleet is a glance of the mind!<br/>
Compared with the speed of its flight,<br/>
The tempest itself lags behind,<br/>
And the swift-wing√®d arrows of light.<br/>
When I think of my own native land,<br/>
In a moment I seem to be there;<br/>
But, alas! recollection at hand<br/>
Soon hurries me back to despair.
</p>
<p>
But the sea-fowl is gone to her nest,<br/>
The beast is laid down in his lair;<br/>
Even here is a season of rest,<br/>
And I to my cabin repair.<br/>
There's mercy in every place,<br/>
And mercy, encouraging thought!<br/>
Gives even affliction a grace,<br/>
And reconciles man to his lot.

<h1>The Morning Dream</h1>
<h2>by William Cowper</h2>
<p>
'Twas in the glad season of spring,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asleep at the dawn of the day,<br/>
I dream'd what I cannot but sing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So pleasant it seem'd as I lay.<br/>
I dream'd that on ocean afloat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far hence to the westward I sail'd,<br/>
While the billows high lifted the boat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fresh blowing breeze never fail'd.
</p>
<p>
In the steerage a woman I saw,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such at least was the form that she wore,<br/>
Whose beauty impressed me with awe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne'er taught me by woman before:<br/>
She sat, and a shield at her side<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shed light like a sun on the waves,<br/>
And, smiling divinely, she cried&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I go to make freemen of slaves."
</p>
<p>
Then, raising her voice to a strain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweetest that ear ever heard,<br/>
She sung of the slave's broken chain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever her glory appear'd.<br/>
Some clouds which had over us hung<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fled, chas'd by her melody clear,<br/>
And methought, while she liberty sung,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas liberty only to hear.
</p>
<p>
Thus swiftly dividing the flood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a slave-cultured island we came,<br/>
Where a demon, her enemy, stood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oppression his terrible name:<br/>
In his hand, as a sign of his sway,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scourge hung with lashes he bore,<br/>
And stood looking out for his prey,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Africa's sorrowful shore.
</p>
<p>
But soon as, approaching the land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That goddess-like woman he view'd,<br/>
The scourge he let fall from his hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With blood of his subjects imbrued.<br/>
I saw him both sicken and die,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the moment the monster expir'd,<br/>
Heard shouts that ascended the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thousands with rapture inspir'd.
</p>
<p>
Awaking, how could I but muse<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At what such a dream should betide,<br/>
But soon my ear caught the glad news,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which serv'd my weak thought for a guide&mdash;<br/>
That Britannia, renown'd o'er the waves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the hatred she ever has shown<br/>
To the black-sceptred rulers of slaves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolves to have none of her own.

<h1>The Garden</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Marvell</h2>
<p>
How vainly men themselves amaze<br />
To win the palm, the oak, or bays,<br />
And their uncessant labours see<br />
Crowned from some single herb or tree,<br />
Whose short and narrow verg&#232;d shade<br />
Does prudently their toils upbraid,<br />
While all flow'rs and all trees do close<br />
To weave the garlands of repose.
</p>
<p>
Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,<br />
And Innocence, thy sister dear!<br />
Mistaken long, I sought you then<br />
In busy companies of men.<br />
Your sacred plants, if here below,<br />
Only among the plants will grow.<br />
Society is all but rude,<br />
To this delicious solitude.
</p>
<p>
No white nor red was ever seen<br />
So am'rous as this lovely green.<br />
Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,<br />
Cut in these trees their mistress' name.<br />
Little, alas, they know, or heed,<br />
How far these beauties hers exceed!<br />
Fair trees! wheres'e'er your barks I wound,<br />
No name shall but your own be found.
</p>
<p>
When we have run our passion's heat,<br />
Love hither makes his best retreat.<br />
The gods, that mortal beauty chase,<br />
Still in a tree did end their race.<br />
Apollo hunted Daphne so,<br />
Only that she might laurel grow.<br />
And Pan did after Syrinx speed,<br />
Not as a nymph, but for a reed.
</p>
<p>
What wondrous life is this I lead!<br />
Ripe apples drop about my head;<br />
The luscious clusters of the vine<br />
Upon my mouth do crush their wine;<br />
The nectarene, and curious peach,<br />
Into my hands themselves do reach;<br />
Stumbling on melons, I pass,<br />
Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the mind, from pleasures less,<br />
Withdraws into its happiness:<br />
The mind, that ocean where each kind<br />
Does straight its own resemblance find,<br />
Yet it creates, transcending these,<br />
Far other worlds, and other seas,<br />
Annihilating all that's made<br />
To a green thought in a green shade.
</p>
<p>
Here at the fountain's sliding foot,<br />
Or at some fruit-tree's mossy root,<br />
Casting the body's vest aside,<br />
My soul into the boughs does glide:<br />
There like a bird it sits, and sings,<br />
Then whets, and combs its silver wings;<br />
And, till prepared for longer flight,<br />
Waves in its plumes the various light.
</p>
<p>
Such was that happy garden-state,<br />
While man there walked without a mate:<br />
After a place so pure, and sweet,<br />
What other help could yet be meet!<br />
But 'twas beyond a mortal's share<br />
To wander solitary there:<br />
Two paradises 'twere in one<br />
To live in paradise alone.
</p>
<p>
How well the skilful gardener drew<br />
Of flowers and herbs this dial new,<br />
Where from above the milder sun<br />
Does through a fragrant zodiac run;<br />
And, as it works, the industrious bee<br />
Computes its time as well as we.<br />
How could such sweet and wholesome hours<br />
Be reckoned but with herbs and flowers!

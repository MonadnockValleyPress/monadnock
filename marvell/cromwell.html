<h1>An Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Marvell</h2>
<p>
The forward youth that would appear<br/>
Must now forsake his Muses dear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor in the shadows sing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His numbers languishing.<br/>
'Tis time to leave the books in dust,<br/>
And oil th' unused armour's rust,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing from the wall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corslet of the hall.<br/>
So restless Cromwell could not cease<br/>
In the inglorious arts of peace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But through advent'rous war<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgèd his active star.<br/>
And like the three-fork'd lightning, first<br/>
Breaking the clouds where it was nurst,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did through his own side<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fiery way divide.<br/>
For 'tis all one to courage high,<br/>
The emulous or enemy;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with such to enclose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is more than to oppose.<br/>
Then burning through the air he went,<br/>
And palaces and temples rent;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cæsar's head at last<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did through his laurels blast.<br/>
'Tis madness to resist or blame<br/>
The force of angry Heaven's flame;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if we would speak true,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much to the man is due,<br/>
Who from his private gardens where<br/>
He liv'd reservèd and austere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if his highest plot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To plant the bergamot,<br/>
Could by industrious valour climb<br/>
To ruin the great work of time,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cast the kingdom old<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into another mould.<br/>
Though justice against fate complain,<br/>
And plead the ancient rights in vain;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those do hold or break<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men are strong or weak.<br/>
Nature that hateth emptiness<br/>
Allows of penetration less,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore must make room<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where greater spirits come.<br/>
What field of all the civil wars<br/>
Where his were not the deepest scars?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hampton shows what part<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had of wiser art,<br/>
Where, twining subtle fears with hope,<br/>
He wove a net of such a scope<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Charles himself might chase<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Carisbrooke's narrow case,<br/>
That thence the royal actor borne<br/>
The tragic scaffold might adorn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While round the armèd bands<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did clap their bloody hands.<br/>
He nothing common did or mean<br/>
Upon that memorable scene,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with his keener eye<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The axe's edge did try;<br/>
Nor call'd the gods with vulgar spite<br/>
To vindicate his helpless right,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But bowed his comely head<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down as upon a bed.<br/>
This was that memorable hour<br/>
Which first assur'd the forcèd pow'r.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when they did design<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Capitol's first line,<br/>
A bleeding head, where they begun,<br/>
Did fright the architects to run;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet in that the state<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foresaw its happy fate.<br/>
And now the Irish are asham'd<br/>
To see themselves in one year tam'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much one man can do<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does both act and know.<br/>
They can affirm his praises best,<br/>
And have, though overcome, confest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How good he is, how just,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fit for highest trust;<br/>
Nor yet grown stiffer with command,<br/>
But still in the republic's hand;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How fit he is to sway<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That can so well obey.<br/>
He to the Commons' feet presents<br/>
A kingdom for his first year's rents;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, what he may, forbears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fame, to make it theirs,<br/>
And has his sword and spoils ungirt,<br/>
To lay them at the public's skirt.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the falcon high<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falls heavy from the sky,<br/>
She, having kill'd, no more does search<br/>
But on the next green bough to perch,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, when he first does lure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The falc'ner has her sure.<br/>
What may not then our isle presume<br/>
While victory his crest does plume!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What may not others fear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thus he crown each year!<br/>
A Cæsar he ere long to Gaul,<br/>
To Italy an Hannibal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to all states not free,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall climacteric be.<br/>
The Pict no shelter now shall find<br/>
Within his parti-colour'd mind;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from this valour sad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrink underneath the plaid,<br/>
Happy if in the tufted brake<br/>
The English hunter him mistake,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor lay his hounds in near<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Caledonian deer.<br/>
But thou, the war's and fortune's son,<br/>
March indefatigably on;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the last effect<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still keep thy sword erect;<br/>
Besides the force it has to fright<br/>
The spirits of the shady night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same arts that did gain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pow'r, must it maintain.<br/>

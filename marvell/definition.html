<h1>The Definition of Love</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Marvell</h2>
<p>
My love is of a birth as rare<br />
As 'tis for object strange and high:<br />
It was begotten by Despair<br />
Upon Impossibility.
</p>
<p>
Magnanimous Despair alone<br />
Could show me so divine a thing,<br />
Where feeble Hope could ne'er have flown<br />
But vainly flapped its tinsel wing.
</p>
<p>
And yet I quickly might arrive<br />
Where my extended soul is fixed<br />
But Fate does iron wedges drive,<br />
And always crowds itself betwixt.
</p>
<p>
For Fate with jealous eye does see<br />
Two perfect loves, nor lets them close:<br />
Their union would her ruin be,<br />
And her tyrranic power depose.
</p>
<p>
And therefore her decrees of steel<br />
Us as the distant Poles have placed<br />
(Though Love's whole world on us doth wheel)<br />
Not by themselves to be embraced,
</p>
<p>
Unless the giddy heaven fall,<br />
And earth some new convulsion tear;<br />
And, us to join, the world should all<br />
Be cramped into a planisphere.
</p>
<p>
As lines (so loves) oblique may well<br />
Themselves in every angle greet:<br />
But ours so truly parallel,<br />
Though infinite, can never meet.
</p>
<p>
Therefore the love which us doth bind,<br />
But Fate so enviously debars,<br />
Is the conjunction of the mind,<br />
And opposition of the stars.

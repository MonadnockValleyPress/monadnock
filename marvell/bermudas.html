<h1>Bermudas</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Marvell</h2>
<p>
Where the remote Bermudas ride<br/>
In th' ocean's bosom unespy'd,<br/>
From a small boat, that row'd along,<br/>
The list'ning winds receiv'd this song.
</p>
<p>
What should we do but sing his praise<br/>
That led us through the wat'ry maze<br/>
Unto an isle so long unknown,<br/>
And yet far kinder than our own?<br/>
Where he the huge sea-monsters wracks,<br/>
That lift the deep upon their backs,<br/>
He lands us on a grassy stage,<br/>
Safe from the storm's and prelates' rage.<br/>
He gave us this eternal spring<br/>
Which here enamels everything,<br/>
And sends the fowls to us in care,<br/>
On daily visits through the air.<br/>
He hangs in shades the orange bright,<br/>
Like golden lamps in a green night;<br/>
And does in the pomegranates close<br/>
Jewels more rich than Ormus shows.<br/>
He makes the figs our mouths to meet<br/>
And throws the melons at our feet,<br/>
But apples plants of such a price,<br/>
No tree could ever bear them twice.<br/>
With cedars, chosen by his hand,<br/>
From Lebanon, he stores the land,<br/>
And makes the hollow seas that roar<br/>
Proclaim the ambergris on shore.<br/>
He cast (of which we rather boast)<br/>
The Gospel's pearl upon our coast,<br/>
And in these rocks for us did frame<br/>
A temple, where to sound his name.<br/>
Oh let our voice his praise exalt,<br/>
Till it arrive at heaven's vault;<br/>
Which thence (perhaps) rebounding, may<br/>
Echo beyond the Mexic Bay.
</p>
<p>
Thus sung they in the English boat<br/>
An holy and a cheerful note,<br/>
And all the way, to guide their chime,<br/>
With falling oars they kept the time.

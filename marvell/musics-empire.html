<h1>Music's Empire</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Marvell</h2>
<p>
First was the world as one great cymbal made,<br />
Where jarring winds to infant Nature played.<br />
All music was a solitary sound,<br />
To hollow rocks and murmuring fountains bound.
</p>
<p>
Jubal first made the wilder notes agree;<br />
And Jubal tuned music's first jubilee:<br />
He called the echoes from their sullen cell,<br />
And built the organ's city where they dwell.<br />
</p>
<p>
Each sought a consort in that lovely place;<br />
And virgin trebles wed the manly bass.<br />
From whence the progeny of numbers new<br />
Into harmonious colonies withdrew.
</p>
<p>
Some to the lute, some to the viol went,<br />
And others chose the cornet eloquent,<br />
These practising the wind, and those the wire,<br />
To sing men's triumphs, or in heaven's choir.
</p>
<p>
Then music, the mosaic of the air,<br />
Did of all these a solemn noise prepare:<br />
With which she gained the empire of the ear,<br />
Including all between the earth and sphere.
</p>
<p>
Victorious sounds!  Yet here your homage do<br />
Unto a gentler conqueror than you:<br />
Who though he flies the music of his praise,<br />
Would with you heaven's hallelujahs raise.
</p>

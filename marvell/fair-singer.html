<h1>The Fair Singer</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Marvell</h2>
<p>
To make a final conquest of all me,<br/>
Love did compose so sweet an enemy,<br/>
In whom both beauties to my death agree,<br/>
Joining themselves in fatal harmony;<br/>
That while she with her eyes my heart does bind,<br/>
She with her voice might captivate my mind.
</p>
<p> 
I could have fled from one but singly fair:<br/>
My disentangled soul itself might save,<br/>
Breaking the curl&#232;d trammels of her hair;<br/>
But how should I avoid to be her slave,<br/>
Whose subtle art invisibly can wreath<br/>
My fetters of the very air I breathe?
</p>
<p>  
It had been easy fighting in some plain,<br/>
Where victory might hang in equal choice.<br/>
But all resistance against her is vain,<br/>
Who has the advantage both of eyes and voice,<br/>
And all my forces needs must be undone,<br/>
She having gain&#232;d both the wind and sun.

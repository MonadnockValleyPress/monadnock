<h1>The Gallery</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Marvell</h2>
<p>
Clora, come view my soul, and tell<br/>
Whether I have contrived it well.<br/>
Now all its several lodgings lie<br/>
Composed into one gallery;<br/>
And the great arras-hangings, made<br/>
Of various faces, by are laid;<br/>
That, for all furniture, you'll find<br/>
Only your picture in my mind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here thou are painted in the dress<br/>
Of an inhuman murderess;<br/>
Examining upon our hearts<br/>
Thy fertile shop of cruel arts:<br/>
Engines more keen than ever yet<br/>
Adorned a tyrant's cabinet;<br/>
Of which the most tormenting are<br/>
Black eyes, red lips, and curlèd hair.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But, on the other side, th'art drawn<br/>
Like to Aurora in the dawn;<br/>
When in the East she slumbering lies,<br/>
And stretches out her milky thighs;<br/>
While all the morning choir does sing,<br/>
And manna falls, and roses spring;<br/>
And, at thy feet, the wooing doves<br/>
Sit pérfecting their harmless loves.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Like an enchantress here thou show'st,<br/>
Vexing thy restless lover's ghost;<br/>
And, by a light obscure, dost rave<br/>
Over his entrails, in the cave;<br/>
Divining thence, with horrid care,<br/>
How long thou shalt continue fair;<br/>
And (when informed) them throw'st away,<br/>
To be the greedy vulture's prey.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But, against that, thou sit'st afloat<br/>
Like Venus in her pearly boat.<br/>
The halcyons, calming all that's nigh,<br/>
Betwixt the air and water fly;<br/>
Or, if some rolling wave appears,<br/>
A mass of ambergris it bears.<br/>
Nor blows more wind than what may well<br/>
Convoy the perfume to the smell.<br/>
</p>
<p>
These pictures and a thousand more<br/>
Of thee my gallery do store<br/>
In all the forms thou canst invent<br/>
Either to please me, or torment:<br/>
For thou alone to people me,<br/>
Art grown a numerous colony;<br/>
And a collection choicer far<br/>
Than or Whitehall's or Mantua's were.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But, of these pictures and the rest,<br/>
That at the entrance likes me best:<br/>
Where the same posture, and the look<br/>
Remains, with which I first was took:<br/>
A tender shepherdess, whose hair<br/>
Hangs loosely playing in the air,<br/>
Transplanting flowers from the green hill,<br/>
To crown her head, and bosom fill.<br/>

<h1>To His Coy Mistress</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Marvell</h2>
<p>
Had we but world enough, and time,<br />
This coyness, Lady, were no crime.<br />
We would sit down, and think which way<br />
To walk, and pass our long love's day.<br />
Thou by the Indian Ganges' side<br />
Shouldst rubies find:  I by the tide<br /> 
Of Humber would complain. I would<br />
Love you ten years before the Flood:<br />
And you should, if you please, refuse<br />
Till the conversion of the Jews.<br />
My vegetable love should grow<br />
Vaster than empires, and more slow.<br />
An hundred years should go to praise<br />
Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze.<br />
Two hundred years to adore each breast,<br />
But thirty thousand to the rest.<br />
An age at least to every part,<br />
And the last age should show your heart.<br />
For, Lady, you deserve this state,<br />
Nor would I love at lower rate.
</p>
<p>
But at my back I always hear<br />
Time's wing&#232;d chariot hurrying near:<br />
And yonder all before us lie<br />
Deserts of vast eternity.<br />
Thy beauty shall no more be found;<br />
Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound<br />
My echoing song: then worms shall try<br />
That long-preserved virginity,<br />
And your quaint honor turn to dust,<br />
And into ashes all my lust.<br />
The grave's a fine and private place,<br />
But none, I think, do there embrace.
</p>
<p>
Now, therefore, while the youthful hue<br />
Sits on thy skin like morning dew,<br />
And while thy willing soul transpires<br />
At every pore with instant fires,<br />
Now let us sport us while we may;<br />
And now, like amorous birds of prey,<br />
Rather at once our time devour,<br />
Than languish in his slow-chapped power.<br />
Let us roll all our strength, and all<br />
Our sweetness, up into one ball:<br />
And tear our pleasures with rough strife,<br />
Thorough the iron gates of life.<br />
Thus, though we cannot make our sun<br />
Stand still, yet we will make him run.

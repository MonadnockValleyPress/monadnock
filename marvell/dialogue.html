<h1>A Dialogue between the Soul and the Body</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Marvell</h2>
<p>SOUL<br />
O, who shall from this dungeon raise<br />
A soul, enslaved so many ways,<br />
With bolts of bone, that fettered stands<br />
In feet, and manacled in hands.<br />
Here blinded with an eye; and there<br />
Deaf with the drumming of an ear,<br />
A soul hung up, as 'twere, in chains<br />
Of nerves, and arteries, and veins,<br />
Tortured, besides each other part,<br />
In a vain head, and double heart?
</p>
<p>
BODY<br />
O, who shall me deliver whole,<br />
From bonds of this tyrranic soul,<br />
Which, stretched upright, impales me so,<br />
That mine own precipice I go;<br />
And warms and moves this needless frame<br />
(A fever could but do the same),<br />
And, wanting where its sprite to try,<br />
Has made me live to let me die,<br />
A body that could never rest,<br />
Since this ill spirit it possessed?
</p>
<p>
SOUL<br />
What magic could me thus confine<br />
Within another's grief to pine,<br />
Where, whatsoever it complain,<br />
I feel, that cannot feel, the pain,<br />
And all my care itself employs,<br />
That to preserve, which me destroys:<br />
Constrained not only to endure<br />
Diseases, but, what's worse, the cure:<br />
And ready oft the port to gain,<br />
Am shipwrecked into health again?
</p>
<p>
BODY<br />
But physic yet could never reach<br />
The maladies thou me dost teach:<br />
Whom first the cramp of hope does tear,<br />
And then the palsy shakes of fear;<br />
The pestilence of love does heat,<br />
Or hatred's hidden ulcer eat;<br />
Joy's cheerful madness does perplex,<br />
Or sorrow's other madness vex;<br />
Which knowledge forces me to know,<br />
And memory will not forego.<br />
What but a soul could have the wit<br />
To build me up for sin so fit?<br />
So architects do square and hew,<br />
Green trees that in the forest grew.

<h1>He Seems to Me</h1>
<h2>by Sappho</h2>
<h3>translated by Peter Saint-Andre (1990)</h3>
<p>
He seems to me, that one, equal to the gods,<br />
The man fixed there, who sits opposite you<br />
And hears close by your sweet voice<br />
And delightful laugh, which once<br />
Shook the soul in my breast.
</p>
<p>
For as I look on you,<br />
My voice yields no sound,<br />
Gasping, my silent tongue shivers,<br />
A thin fire runs in under my skin,<br />
In my eyes there is no sight,<br />
My ears pound and throb,<br />
A chill sweat runs over me,<br />
Trembling seizes me all over,<br />
Paler than the reeds am I,<br />
And, weakened, I seem little short of dying.
</p>
<p>
But all must be endured....

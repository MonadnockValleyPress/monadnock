<h1>Deathless Aphrodite on Your Lavish Throne</h1>
<h2>by Sappho</h2>
<h3>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h3>
<p>
Deathless Aphrodite on your lavish throne,<br />
Enchantress, daughter of Zeus: I beg you, queen,<br />
Do not overpower my soul with heartaches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hardest troubles,
</p>
<p>
But come here, if ever at another time<br />
Having heard my voice you paid me attention<br />
And leaving the golden house of your father<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You came to my aid,
</p>
<p>
Yoking your horse and chariot: gorgeous swift<br />
Sparrows carried you over the coal-black earth,<br />
Thickly whirling their feathers through the middle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heaven's ether.
</p>
<p>
Swiftly they arrived, and you, O blessed one,<br />
Smiling with your immortal face, you asked for<br />
What I suffered, and why again I call you,<br />
And what in my maddened soul I want most<br />
To happen to me: what dear one shall I now<br />
Persuade to lead you back to her &#151; who, Sappho,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has wronged you this time?
</p>
<p>
Even if she flees, swiftly she will pursue;<br />
If she doesn't receive my gifts, she will give;<br />
If she doesn't love me, swiftly she will love &mdash;<br />
Even against her will. So come to my aid,<br />
Release me from my grievous cares, and fulfill<br />
What my heart yearns to be fulfilled: come and be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fellow-fighter.

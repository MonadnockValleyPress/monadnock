<h1>Deathless Aphrodite on Your Lavish Throne</h1>
<h2>by Sappho</h2>
<h3>translated by Peter Saint-Andre (1990)</h3>
<p>
Deathless Aphrodite on your lavish throne,<br />
Enchantress, daughter of Zeus: I beg you, queen,<br />
Do not overpower my soul with heartaches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hard troubles,
</p>
<p>
But come here, if ever at another time<br />
Having heard my voice you paid me attention<br />
And leaving the golden house of your father<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you came to me,
</p>
<p>
Yoking your horse and chariot: gorgeous swift<br />
Sparrows carried you over the coal-black earth,<br />
Thickly whirling their feathers through the midst of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven's ether.
</p>
<p>
Swiftly they arrived, and you, O blessed one,<br />
Smiling with your immortal face, you asked for<br />
What I suffered, and why again I call you,<br />
And what in my maddened soul I desire most<br />
To happen to me: what dearest one shall I now<br />
Persuade to lead you back to her &#151; who, O Sappho,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wronged you this time?
</p>
<p>
For even if she flees, swiftly she will pursue;<br />
And if she does not receive my gifts, she will give;<br />
And if she does not love me, swiftly she will love,<br />
Even against her will. So come to my aid now,<br />
Release me from my grievous cares, fulfill as much<br />
As my heart yearns to be fulfilled: come, be my<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fellow-fighter.

<h1>Some Say</h1>
<h2>by Sappho</h2>
<h3>translated by Peter Saint-Andre (1990)</h3>
<p>
Some say an army of horsemen or footmen or rowers<br />
Is the most beautiful thing over the coal-black earth,<br />
But I say it is that thing, whatever it is,<br />
That one loves and desires.
</p>
<p>
All easy it is to make this clear to anyone,<br />
For Helen, far surpassing all mortals in beauty,<br />
Leaving behind the best of all men,<br />
Departed, sailing for Troy &#151;<br />
And not at all did she remember<br />
Parents, nor love of children,<br />
But passion directed her....
</p>
<p>
Now my Anactoria too is gone, and<br />
I would rather see her supple walk<br />
And the bright sparkle of her face<br />
Than all the chariots of Lydia<br />
And foot-soldiers in arms.

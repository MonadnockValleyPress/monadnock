<h1>If you refuse me once, and think again</h1>
<h2>by Sir John Suckling</h2>
<p>
If you refuse me once, and think again,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will complain.<br/>
You are deceiv’d, love is no work of art,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be got and born,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not made and worn,<br/>
By every one that hath a heart.
</p>
<p>
Or do you think they more than once can die,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom you deny?<br/>
Who tell you of a thousand deaths a day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the old poets feign<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell the pain<br/>
They met, but in the common way?
</p>
<p>
Or do you think ’t too soon to yield,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quit the field?<br/>
Nor is that right, they yield that first entreat;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once one may crave for love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more would prove<br/>
This heart too little, that too great.
</p>
<p>
Oh that I were all soul, that I might prove<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you as fit a love<br/>
As you are for an angel; for I know,<br/>
None but pure spirits are fit loves for you.
</p>
<p>
You are all ethereal; there’s in you no dross,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any part that’s gross.<br/>
Your coarsest part is like a curious lawn,<br/>
The vestal relics for a covering drawn.
</p>
<p>
Your other parts, part of the purest fire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That e’er Heav’n did inspire,<br/>
Makes every thought that is refin’d by it<br/>
A quintessence of goodness and of wit.
</p>
<p>
Thus have your raptures reach’d to that degree<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In love’s philosophy,<br/>
That you can figure to yourself a fire<br/>
Void of all heat, a love without desire.
</p>
<p>
Nor in divinity do you go less;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think, and you profess,<br/>
That souls may have a plenitude of joy,<br/>
Although their bodies meet not to employ.
</p>
<p>
But I must needs confess, I do not find<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motions of my mind<br/>
So purified as yet, but at the best<br/>
My body claims in them an interest.
</p>
<p>
I hold that perfect joy makes all our parts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As joyful as our hearts.<br/>
Our senses tell us, if we please not them,<br/>
Our love is but a dotage or a dream.
</p>
<p>
How shall we then agree? you may descend,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But will not, to my end.<br/>
I fain would tune my fancy to your key,<br/>
But cannot reach to that obstructed way.
</p>
<p>
There rests but this, that whilst we sorrow here,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bodies may draw near;<br/>
And, when no more their joys they can extend,<br/>
Then let our souls begin where they did end.

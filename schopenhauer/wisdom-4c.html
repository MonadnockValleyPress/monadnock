<h1>The Wisdom of Life</h1>
<h2>by Arthur Schopenhauer</h2>
<h3>translated by T. Bailey Saunders</h3>
<h3>Chapter IV: Position, or a Man's Place in the Estimation of Others</h3>
<h4>Section 3. &mdash; Rank</h4>
<p>Let us take rank first, as it may be dismissed in a few words, although it plays an important part in the eyes of the masses and of the philistines, and is a most useful wheel in the machinery of the State.</p> 
<p>It has a purely conventional value. Strictly speaking, it is a sham; its method is to exact an artificial respect, and, as a matter of fact, the whole thing is a mere farce.</p> 
<p>Orders, it may be said, are bills of exchange drawn on public opinion, and the measure of their value is the credit of the drawer. Of course, as a substitute for pensions, they save the State a good deal of money; and, besides, they serve a very useful purpose, if they are distributed with discrimination and judgment. For people in general have eyes and ears, it is true; but not much else, very little judgment indeed, or even memory. There are many services of the State quite beyond the range of their understanding; others, again, are appreciated and made much of for a time, and then soon forgotten. It seems to me, therefore, very proper, that a cross or a star should proclaim to the mass of people always and everywhere, <em>This man is not like you; he has done something</em>. But orders lose their value when they are distributed unjustly, or without due selection, or in too great numbers: a prince should be as careful in conferring them as a man of business is in signing a bill. It is a pleonasm to inscribe on any order <em>for distinguished service</em>; for every order ought to be for distinguished service. That stands to reason.</p>

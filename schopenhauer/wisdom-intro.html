<h1>The Wisdom of Life</h1>
<h2>by Arthur Schopenhauer</h2>
<h3>translated by T. Bailey Saunders</h3>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In these pages I shall speak of <cite>The Wisdom of Life</cite> in the common meaning of the term, as the art, namely, of ordering our lives so as to obtain the greatest possible amount of pleasure and success; an art the theory of which may be called <em>Eudaemonology</em>, for it teaches us how to lead a happy existence. Such an existence might perhaps be defined as one which, looked at from a purely objective point of view, or, rather, after cool and mature reflection &mdash; for the question necessarily involves subjective considerations, &mdash; would be decidedly preferable to non-existence; implying that we should cling to it for its own sake, and not merely from the fear of death; and further, that we should never like it to come to an end.</p>
<p>Now whether human life corresponds, or could possibly correspond, to this conception of existence, is a question to which, as is well-known, my philosophical system returns a negative answer. On the eudaemonistic hypothesis, however, the question must be answered in the affirmative; and I have shown, in the second volume of my chief work (ch. 49), that this hypothesis is based upon a fundamental mistake. Accordingly, in elaborating the scheme of a happy existence, I have had to make a complete surrender of the higher metaphysical and ethical standpoint to which my own theories lead; and everything I shall say here will to some extent rest upon a compromise; in so far, that is, as I take the common standpoint of every day, and embrace the error which is at the bottom of it. My remarks, therefore, will possess only a qualified value, for the very word <em>eudaemonology</em> is a euphemism. Further, I make no claims to completeness; partly because the subject is inexhaustible, and partly because I should otherwise have to say over again what has been already said by others.</p>
<p>The only book composed, as far as I remember, with a like purpose to that which animates this collection of aphorisms, is Cardano's <cite>De utilitate ex adversis capienda</cite>, which is well worth reading, and may be used to supplement the present work. Aristotle, it is true, has a few words on eudaemonology in the fifth chapter of the first book of his <cite>Rhetoric</cite>; but what he says does not come to very much.  As compilation is not my business, I have made no use of these predecessors; more especially because in the process of compiling, individuality of view is lost, and individuality of view is the kernel of works of this kind. In general, indeed, the wise in all ages have always said the same thing, and the fools, who at all times form the immense majority, have in their way too acted alike, and done just the opposite; and so it will continue. For, as Voltaire says, <em>we shall leave this world as foolish and as wicked as we found it on our arrival</em>.</p>

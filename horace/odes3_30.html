<h2>"I Have Completed a Monument"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes III.30)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
I have built a monument<br />
Which will last more years than bronze,<br/>
Which will reach far higher than<br />
That royal pile of Pyramids,<br />
Which gnawing rain and furious<br />
North winds lack power to destroy,<br/>
Nor chain of years, nor flight of time.<br />
Oblivion won't be complete,<br />
The greatest part of me will live<br/>
Beyond the grasp of greedy death.<br />
I'll prosper on, fed fresh with praise.<br />
For while the priest and silent virgin<br />
Still climb the Capitoline hill,<br />
In places high and places low &mdash;<br/>
Where the raging Aufidus thunders,<br />
Where Daunus lords it over those<br />
Whose farms are starved of life-rich rain &mdash;<br />
Forever I will be proclaimed<br/>
As having been the very first<br />
To make the songs of ancient Greece<br />
Dance freely to Italian beats.<br/>
Melpomene, accept with pride<br/>
The honor you've so richly earned:<br />
Place Delphic laurels on my head.

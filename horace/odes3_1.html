<h2>"A Priest of the Muses"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes III.1)</h3>
<h4>translated by <a href='https://stpeter.im/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h4>
<p>
I keep away and loathe the lowly crowd,<br />
I keep a sacred silence: for I am<br />
A priest of the Muses and I sing songs<br />
Never heard before to virgins and boys.<br />
Great rulers are feared by their subject-flocks,<br />
But high over them is the rule of Jove,<br />
Famed for his triumph over the Giants,<br />
Changing all by a move of his eyebrow.<br />
It's true that one man plants greater vineyards,<br />
That one candidate in the Campus is<br />
Of nobler descent while another is<br />
Of greater fame and worth, and a third has<br />
A bigger crowd of followers &mdash; yet Fate,<br />
With blind justice, decides the end of high<br />
And low alike: the urn stirs every name.<br />
To one above whose neck the drawn sword hangs,<br />
Sicilian feasts hold no sweet taste, nor will<br />
Songs of birds or citharas let him sleep &mdash;<br />
Yet gentle dreams do not shun peasant homes,<br />
Shady riverbanks, and breezy valleys.<br />
One who desires no more than his needs<br />
Is not disturbed by stormy seas and the<br />
Raging onset of setting Arcturus<br />
Or rising Haedus, not by the hail that<br />
Attacks his vines, nor by an estate that<br />
Disappoints him, the fruit-trees now blaming<br />
Floods, now field-parching stars, now harsh winter.<br />
Or look here: shunning land, crowds of workers,<br />
The contractor, and the owner himself<br />
Lay their stones in the water, and fishes<br />
Are confined by pilings built in the deep;<br />
Yet fear and threats plague the proprietor,<br />
And gloomy trouble besets his bronze-beaked<br />
Trireme and settles behind his horsemen.<br />
If Phrygian marble, brilliant purples,<br />
Falernian wines, and Persian spices<br />
Can't comfort one who's in pain, then why build<br />
A hall with pillars in the latest style?<br />
Why switch my Sabine vale for troubling wealth?

<h2>"A Priest of the Muses"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes III.1)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
I loathe and shun the uninitiate crowd,<br />
I keep a sacred silence: for I am<br />
a priest of the Muses and I sing songs<br />
never heard before to virgins and boys.<br />
Great rulers are feared by their subject-flocks,<br />
but high over them is the rule of Jove,<br />
famed for his triumph over the Giants,<br />
changing all by a move of his eyebrow.<br />
It's true that one man plants greater vineyards,<br />
that one candidate in the Campus is<br />
of nobler descent while another is<br />
of greater fame and worth and a third has<br />
a bigger crowd of followers &#151; yet Fate,<br />
with blind justice, decides the end of high<br />
and low alike: the urn stirs every name.<br />
To one above whose neck the drawn sword hangs,<br />
Sicilian feasts hold no sweet savor, nor will<br />
the songs of birds and citharas let him sleep &#151;<br />
yet gentle dreams do not shun peasant homes,<br />
shady riverbanks, and breezy valleys.<br />
One who desires no more than his needs<br />
is not disturbed by stormy seas and the<br />
raging onset of setting Arcturus<br />
or rising Haedus, not by the hail that<br />
attacks his vines nor by an estate that<br />
disappoints him, the fruit-trees now blaming<br />
floods, now field-parching stars, now harsh winter.<br />
Or look here: shunning land, crowds of workers<br />
and the contractor and the owner himself<br />
lay their stones in the water, and the fishes<br />
are confined by pilings built in the deep;<br />
yet fear and threats rise up to plague the owner,<br />
and gloomy trouble besets his bronze-beaked<br />
trireme and even sits behind his horsemen.<br />
Yet if Phrygian marble and brilliant purples<br />
and Falernian wines and Persian spices<br />
cannot comfort one who's in pain, why build<br />
a huge hall with pillars in the latest style?<br />
Why switch my Sabine vale for troublesome wealth?

<h2>"The Fleeting Years"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes II.14)</h3>
<h4>translated by <a href='https://stpeter.im/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h4>
<p>
Alas, my Postumus, the fleeting years<br />
Will fall away, nor will piety cause<br />
Delay to wrinkles or to advancing<br />
Old age or to indomitable death.
</p>
<p>
Let's say you were to sacrifice a bull<br />
Each day, still you couldn't placate tearless<br />
Pluto, who with his waves has imprisoned<br />
Both thrice-strong Geryon and Tityos &mdash;
</p>
<p>
Those are the waves, my friend, that you must cross<br />
Along with all who thrive on the earth's gifts,<br />
Whether we are kings or wretched peasants.<br />
In vain would we try to avoid cruel Mars
</p>
<p>
And the mercurial disturbances<br />
That course across the Adriatic Sea &mdash;<br />
In vain throughout the autumn will we fear<br />
The south wind, so harmful to our bodies.
</p>
<p>
We needs must see the wandering, sluggish<br />
Cocytos and the infamous offspring<br />
Of Danaus and the son of Aeolus:<br />
Sisyphus damned to his ceaseless toil.
</p>
<p>
We needs must leave behind the earth and home<br />
And our pleasing spouse. And none of those trees<br />
That you tend will follow you, its short-lived<br />
Master, except the reviled cypress.
</p>
<p>
A worthier heir will guzzle the wine<br />
You guard now with a hundred keys: for he<br />
Will drench the pavement with your best &mdash; more fine<br />
Than that on which the highest priests do feast.
</p>

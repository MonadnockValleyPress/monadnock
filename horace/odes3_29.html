<h2>"This Aegean Storm"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes III.29)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
Maecenas, descended from Etruscan kings,<br />
smooth wine not yet opened and blooming roses<br />
and fragrant hair oils have long been ready<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you at my house.
</p>
<p>
Break free from all hindrances: do not always<br />
contemplate the humid Tibur, Aefula's<br />
sloping fields, and the ridge of that parricide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old Telegonus;
</p>
<p>
forsaking loathsome wealth and sky-high power,<br />
shaking your head at the smoke and wealth and noise<br />
of decadent Rome, I urge you to leave: for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change is pleasant,
</p>
<p>
and a simple dinner at a peasant's small<br />
hut all lacking in fine purple tapestries<br />
loosens the troubled brow of the richest man.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For see already:
</p>
<p>
Andromeda's shining father shows forth his<br />
secret fire; Procyon and the savage star<br />
of Leo rage, and the sun brings back the days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drought-filled, without rain;
</p>
<p>
the shepherd with his sluggish flock seeks out shade<br />
and stream and the wild brambles of savage<br />
Silvanus, and the quiet banks lack even<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an unsteady breeze.
</p>
<p>
Yet you worry about the health of the State;<br />
troubled over the City, you're anxious about<br />
the Seres and Cyrus-ruled Bactra and the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fractious Scythians. 
</p>
<p>
Wisely the god suppresses the outcome of<br />
future times in darkest night, and he laughs if<br />
mortals are disturbed by that which is beyond<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their proper orbit.
</p>
<p>
Take care to deal clearly with what's before you &#151;<br />
the rest is carried along like a river:<br />
now gliding calmly within its channel down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the Tuscan sea,
</p>
<p>
now churning gnawed rocks and uprooted tree-trunks<br />
and cattle and homes until the surrounding<br />
woods and hills resound with noise when the fierce flood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roils the quiet stream.
</p>
<p>
Joyous and self-possessed is the life of he<br />
who each day can say: "I have lived &#151; tomorrow<br />
the Father may fill the sky with black storm-clouds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or purest sunshine,
</p>
<p>
yet even so he can't upset what is past:<br />
he can't complete or alter or make undone<br />
whatever the fleeting hour has once produced."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For haughty Fortune, 
</p>
<p>
so pleased with her cruel affairs and stubbornly<br />
playing her games, keeps shifting around all her<br />
dubious honors, smiling now on me and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now on someone else.
</p>
<p>
I praise her while she stays. Yet when she spreads her<br />
her too-swift wings, I give back what she's granted<br />
and wrapped in my strength I seek out poverty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honest and bereft.
</p>
<p>
It's not my way, when the southern gales roar out<br />
of Africa, to make abject prayers and<br />
votive offerings to strike a bargain lest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my exotic wares
</p>
<p>
should add to the wealth of the rapacious sea;<br />
it's then that the gods and a favoring breeze<br />
carry me and my two-oared skiff safely through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this Aegean storm.

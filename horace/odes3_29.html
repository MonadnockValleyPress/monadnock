<h2>"This Aegean Storm"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes III.29)</h3>
<h4>translated by <a href='https://stpeter.im/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h4>
<p>
Maecenas, descended from Etruscan kings,<br />
Smooth wine not yet opened and blooming roses<br />
And fragrant hair oils have long been ready<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you at my house.
</p>
<p>
Break free from all hindrances: do not always<br />
Contemplate the humid Tibur, Aefula's<br />
Sloping fields, and the ridge of that parricide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Telegonus;
</p>
<p>
Forsaking loathsome wealth and sky-high power,<br />
Shaking your head at the smoke and wealth and noise<br />
Of decadent Rome, I urge you now to leave:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For change is pleasant,
</p>
<p>
And a simple dinner at a peasant's small<br />
Hut all lacking in fine purple tapestries<br />
Loosens the troubled brow of the richest man.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see already:
</p>
<p>
Andromeda's shining father shows forth his<br />
Secret fire; Procyon and the harsh star<br />
Of Leo rage, and the sun brings back the days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drought-filled, without rain;
</p>
<p>
The shepherd with his sluggish flock seeks out shade<br />
And stream and the wild brambles of savage<br />
Silvanus, and the quiet banks lack even<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unsteady breeze.
</p>
<p>
Yet you worry about the health of the State;<br />
Troubled by the City, you're anxious about<br />
The Seres and Cyrus-ruled Bactra and the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fractious Scythians. 
</p>
<p>
Wisely the god suppresses the outcome of<br />
Future times in darkest night, and he laughs if<br />
Mortals are disturbed by that which is beyond<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their proper orbit.
</p>
<p>
Take care to deal clearly with what's before you &mdash;<br />
The rest is carried along like a river:<br />
Now gliding calmly within its channel down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Tuscan sea,
</p>
<p>
Now churning gnawed rocks and uprooted tree-trunks<br />
And cattle and homes until the surrounding<br />
Woods and hills resound with noise when the fierce flood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roils the placid stream.
</p>
<p>
Joyous and self-possessed is the life of he<br />
Who each day can say: "I have lived &mdash; tomorrow<br />
The Father may fill the sky with black storm-clouds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or purest sunshine,
</p>
<p>
Yet even so he can't upset what is past:<br />
He can't complete or alter or make undone<br />
Whatever the fleeting hour has produced."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For haughty Fortune, 
</p>
<p>
So pleased with her cruel affairs and stubbornly<br />
Playing her games, keeps shifting around all her<br />
Dubious honors, smiling now on me and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on someone else.
</p>
<p>
I praise her while she stays. Yet when she spreads her<br />
Too-swift wings, I give back what she has granted<br />
And wrapped in my strength I seek out poverty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honest and bereft.
</p>
<p>
It's not my way, when the southern gales roar out<br />
Of Africa, to make abject prayers and<br />
Votive offerings to strike a bargain lest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My exotic wares
</p>
<p>
Should add to the wealth of the rapacious sea;<br />
It's then that the gods and a favoring breeze<br />
Carry me and my two-oared skiff safely through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Aegean storm.

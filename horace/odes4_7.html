<h2>"The Snows Have Fled"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes IV.7)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
The snows have fled, already<br />
the grass returns to the fields<br />
and leaves return to the trees.<br />
Earth is turning her changes,<br />
the rivers flow less strongly.
</p>
<p>
Grace along with her Nymphs and<br />
twin sisters ventures naked<br />
to lead her bands of dancers.<br />
"Hope for immortality<br />
not", warn the year and the hour<br />
that steal the nourishing day.
</p>
<p>
The Zephyr lessens the cold,<br />
the Summer tramples the Spring<br />
only to be overturned<br />
as soon as fruit-bearing Fall<br />
has poured forth its crops, and soon<br />
dead winter returns again.
</p>
<p>
Swift moons heal the heavenly<br />
damage &#151; but we, when we have<br />
gone down where good Aeneas,<br />
where rich Tullus and Arcus<br />
have gone, we are dust and shade.
</p>
<p>
Who knows if the gods will add<br />
tomorrow's time to our sum?<br />
The only thing that escapes<br />
your heir's grasping hands will be<br />
what you've added to your soul.
</p>
<p>
When once you've died and Minos<br />
has given his distinguished<br />
judgment, nothing, Torquatus &#151;<br />
not birth nor eloquence nor<br />
goodness &#151; will restore your life.
</p>
<p>
For Diana can't release<br />
good Hippolytus from the<br />
darkness, nor has Theseus<br />
the power to burst the chains<br />
of his dear Peritho&#246;s.

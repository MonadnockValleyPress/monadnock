<h2>"Keep a Tranquil Mind"</h2>
<h3>(Horace Odes II.3)</h3>
<h4>translated by <a href='https://stpeter.im/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h4>
<p>
Remember when times are difficult to<br />
Keep a tranquil mind, when times are good to<br />
Keep yourself from becoming overjoyed,<br />
Dellius who is yet to face your death,
</p>
<p>
Whether you will live always in sadness<br />
Or on festal days in a far-off field<br />
Reclining there you will find delight in<br />
A famed vintage of Falernian wine.
</p>
<p>
Why do the tall pine and the white poplar<br />
So love to join their foliage to make<br />
Inviting shade? And why does the rushing<br />
Water press through the river's winding banks?
</p>
<p>
Bring along wines, perfumes, and the too-brief<br />
Flower that blooms upon the lovely rose<br />
While your good fortune and our youth allow,<br />
And the dark-spun threads of the three Sisters.
</p>
<p>
You will leave your boughten lands and country<br />
House, which is washed by the river Tiber &mdash;<br />
You will leave them, and some heir will acquire<br />
All the wealth you have piled up so high.
</p>
<p>
Whether you're rich from an old family<br />
Or you are poor and sleep beneath the stars,<br />
It makes no difference at the very end:<br />
For pitiless Orcus will have your soul.
</p>
<p>
Each of us is gathered to the same place:<br />
Every lot is turned in the urn of Fate,<br />
The god who will come forth and place each one<br />
In the skiff of Styx, never to return.
</p>

<h2>"It's Better to Live"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes II.10)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
It's better to live, Licinius, neither<br />
always pressing out on the deep nor, trembling<br />
and cautious, hugging overly close to the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dangerous shoreline.
</p>
<p>
Whosoever cherishes the golden mean<br />
safely avoids the squalor of a hovel<br />
and discreetly keeps away from a palace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that excites envy.
</p>
<p>
Most often it's the huge pine that is shaken<br />
by the wind, and the highest towers that fall<br />
the greatest fall, and the tops of mountains that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attract the lightning.
</p>
<p>
Hopeful in adversity, apprehensive<br />
in prosperity is the heart that prepares<br />
well for either fate. Zeus brings the winter, but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also takes it back.
</p>
<p>
For even if right now times are bad, they won't<br />
always be that way: for Apollo doesn't<br />
always tense his bow, but sometimes he inspires<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the silent Muses.
</p>
<p>
When the straits you sail have narrowed, show yourself<br />
to be undaunted and bold &#151; yet also be<br />
wise and tuck your sails when they're swelled by too strong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a following wind.

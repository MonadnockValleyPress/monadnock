<h2>"It's Better to Live"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes II.10)</h3>
<h4>translated by <a href='https://stpeter.im/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h4>
<p>
It's better to live, Licinius, neither<br />
Always pressing out on the deep nor, trembling<br />
And cautious, hugging overly close to the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangerous shoreline.
</p>
<p>
The power who cherishes the golden mean<br />
Safely avoids the squalor of a hovel<br />
And discreetly keeps away from a palace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That excites envy.
</p>
<p>
Most often it's the huge pine that is shaken<br />
By the wind, and the highest towers that fall<br />
The greatest fall, and the tops of mountains that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attract the lightning.
</p>
<p>
Hopeful in adversity, apprehensive<br />
In prosperity is the heart that prepares<br />
Well for either fate. Zeus brings the winter, but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also takes it back.
</p>
<p>
For even if right now times are bad, they won't<br />
Ever be that way: for Apollo doesn't<br />
Always tense his bow, but sometimes he inspires<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent Muses.
</p>
<p>
When the straits you sail have narrowed, show yourself<br />
To be undaunted and bold &mdash; yet also be<br />
Wise and tuck your sails when they're swelled by too strong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A following wind.

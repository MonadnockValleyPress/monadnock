<h2>"Deep with Snow"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes I.9)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
You see how white Soractus stands deep with snow<br />
and how the laboring woods cannot support<br />
their burden, and the rivers stand still with frost.
</p>
<p>
Drive out the cold, Thaliarchus, piling logs<br />
high on the fire, and bring out in abundance<br />
that four-year-old vintage in the Sabine jar.
</p>
<p>
Leave all else to the gods, for not cypresses<br />
nor ancient wild ash trees are disturbed when<br />
they scatter warring winds over raging seas.
</p>
<p>
Don't bother asking what tomorrow will bring,<br />
consider as gain whatever days fortune<br />
grants &#151; don't spurn sweet loves and dances while you're young,
</p>
<p>
while yet you flourish and capricious old age<br />
has not yet arrived. So let's seek out the town,<br />
with low whispering at the appointed hour
</p>
<p>
under the stars, the tell-tale laugh of a girl<br />
hiding in the farthest corner, and the pledge<br />
torn from her arm or finger, not unyielding.
</p>

<h2>"Deep with Snow"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes I.9)</h3>
<h4>translated by <a href='https://stpeter.im/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a></h4>
<p>
You see how white Soractus stands there deep with snow<br />
And how the laboring woods struggle to support<br />
Their burden, and the rivers stand stock still with frost.
</p>
<p>
So drive out the cold, Thaliarchus, piling logs<br />
High on the fire, and bring out in abundance<br />
The four-year-old wine contained in that Sabine jar.
</p>
<p>
Leave all else to the gods, for neither cypresses<br />
Nor ancient wild ash trees are much disturbed when<br />
They scatter the warring winds over raging seas.
</p>
<p>
Do not bother asking what tomorrow will bring,<br />
Consider as gain whatever days fortune grants &mdash;<br />
Do not spurn sweet loves and dances while you're still young,
</p>
<p>
While yet you're flourishing and capricious old age<br />
Has not yet arrived. So come, let's seek out the town,<br />
With low-voiced whispering at the appointed hour
</p>
<p>
Under the stars, the tell-tale laughter of a girl<br />
Who's hiding in the farthest corner, and the pledge<br />
That's torn from her arm or finger, not unyielding.
</p>

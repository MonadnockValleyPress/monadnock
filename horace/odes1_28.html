<h2>"You Who Measured the Sea"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes 1.28)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
You who measured the sea, the earth, and the numberless sands,<br />
You, Archytas, are now confined in a small mound of dirt<br />
Near the Matine shore, and what good does it do you that you<br />
Attempted the mansions of the skies and that you traversed<br />
The round celestial vault &mdash; you with a soul born to die?
</p>
<p>
For these have perished: Tantalus, the father of Pelops,<br />
Guest of the gods; Tithonus, scattered to the far-off winds;<br />
Minos, privy to the secrets of Jove; Pythagoras,<br />
Son of Panthous, held by Tartarus, consigned to Orcus<br />
Not once but twice, who witnessed Trojan times by taking down<br />
The shield and who conceded to dark death nothing at all<br />
But his sinews and skin &mdash; and I know you consider him<br />
No mean judge of nature and truth. A common night awaits<br />
Us all, and in the end we must all tread the path of death.
</p>
<p>
Some are offered by the Furies to bloody Mars as sport;<br />
Sailors are devoured when they go out on voracious seas;<br />
Mixed corpses of young and old are densely packed together;<br />
No head escapes harsh Proserpina. I've been submerged in<br />
Illyrian waves by Orion's swift friend, the south wind.
</p>
<p>
So, sailor, don't spite me, don't be sparing with shifting sands,<br />
Grant instead a little to my unburied bones and skull &mdash;<br />
Then may you stay safe whatever the east wind vents against<br />
Hesperian waves when Venusian woods are beaten back,<br />
May a great reward flow down to you from Jove and Neptune.
</p>
<p>
Would you make light of committing a wrong that might bring harm<br />
To your innocent children? For chance may yet deny you<br />
Due justice and bring you outrageous fortune: in which case<br />
My request would not go unrewarded, nor would any<br />
Atonement release you. Though you're in a hurry, the wait<br />
Is short: scatter three handfuls of sand and scurry away.

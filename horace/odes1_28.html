<h2>"You Who Measured the Sea"</h2>
<h3>(Horace, Odes 1.28)</h3>
<h4>translated by Peter Saint-Andre</h4>
<p>
You who measured the sea and the earth and the numberless sands,<br />
you, Archytas, are now confined in a small mound of dirt<br />
near the Matine shore, and what good does it do you that you<br />
attempted the mansions of the skies and that you traversed<br />
the round celestial vault &#151; you with a soul born to die?
</p>
<p>
For these have perished: Tantalus, the father of Pelops,<br />
guest of the gods; Tithonus, scattered to the far-off winds;<br />
Minos, privy to the secrets of Jove; Pythagoras,<br />
son of Panthous, held by Tartarus, consigned to Orcus<br />
not once but twice, who witnessed Trojan times by taking down<br />
the shield and who conceded to dark death nothing at all<br />
but his sinews and skin &#151; and I know you consider him<br />
no mean judge of nature and truth. A common night awaits<br />
us all, and in the end we must all tread the path of death.
</p>
<p>
Some are offered by the Furies to bloody Mars as sport;<br />
sailors are devoured when they go out on voracious seas;<br />
mixed corpses of young and old are densely packed together;<br />
no head escapes harsh Proserpina. I've been submerged too<br />
in Illyrian waves by Orion's swift friend, the south wind.
</p>
<p>
So, sailor, don't spite me, don't be sparing with the shifting sands,<br />
grant instead a little to my unburied bones and skull &#151;<br />
then may you stay safe whatever the east wind vents against<br />
Hesperian waves when Venusian woods are beaten back,<br />
may a great reward flow down to you from Jove and Neptune.
</p>
<p>
Would you make light of committing a wrong that might bring harm<br />
to your innocent children? For chance may yet deny you<br />
due justice and bring you outrageous fortune: in which case<br />
my entreaty would not go unrewarded, nor would would any<br />
atonement release you. Though you're in a hurry, the wait<br />
won't be long: scatter three handfuls of earth and scurry away.

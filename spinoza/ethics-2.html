<h1>Ethics</h1>
<h2>by Benedict Spinoza (1677)</h2>
<h3>translated by R.H.M. Elwes (1883)</h3>

<h2 id='part2'>Part 2: On the Nature and Origin of the Mind</h2>

<h3>Preface</h3>

  <p>I now pass on to explaining the results, which must necessarily follow from the essence of God, or of the eternal and infinite being; not, indeed, all of them (for we proved in <a href='ethics-1.html#prop16'>Proposition 16 of Part 1</a> that an infinite number must follow in an infinite number of ways), but only those which are able to lead us, as it were by the hand, to the knowledge of the human mind and its highest blessedness.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<dl>
  <di id='def1'>
    <dt>Definition 1</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>By <dfn>body</dfn> I mean a mode which expresses in a certain determinate manner the essence of God, in so far as he is considered as an extended thing.  (See <a href='ethics-1.html#prop25-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 25 of Part 1</a>.) </p>
    </dd>
  </di>
  <di id='def2'>
    <dt>Definition 2</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>I consider as belonging to the <dfn>essence</dfn> of a thing that, which being given, the thing is necessarily given also, and, which being removed, the thing is necessarily removed also; in other words, that without which the thing, and which itself without the thing, can neither be nor be conceived.</p>
    </dd>
  </di>
  <di id='def3'>
    <dt>Definition 3</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>By <dfn>idea</dfn>, I mean the mental conception which is formed by the mind as a thinking thing.</p>
      <p>Explanation &mdash; I say conception rather than perception, because the word perception seems to imply that the mind is passive in respect to the object; whereas conception seems to express an activity of the mind.</p>
    </dd>
  </di>
  <di id='def4'>
    <dt>Definition 4</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>By an <dfn>adequate idea</dfn>, I mean an idea which, in so far as it is considered in itself, without relation to the object, has all the properties or intrinsic marks of a true idea.</p>
      <p>Explanation &mdash; I say intrinsic, in order to exclude that mark which is extrinsic, namely, the agreement between the idea and its object (ideatum).</p>
    </dd>
  </di>
  <di id='def5'>
    <dt>Definition 5</dt>
    <dd>
      <p><dfn>Duration</dfn> is the indefinite continuance of existing.</p>
      <p>Explanation &mdash; I say indefinite, because it cannot be determined through the existence itself of the existing thing, or by its efficient cause, which necessarily gives the existence of the thing, but does not take it away.</p>
    </dd>
  </di>
  <di id='def6'>

  </di>
  <di id='def7'>
    <dt>Definition 7</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>By <dfn>particular things</dfn>, I mean things which are finite and have a conditioned existence; but if several individual things concur in one action, so as to be all simultaneously the effect of one cause, I consider them all, so far, as one particular thing.</p>

<h3>Propositions</h3>

<dl>
  <di id='prop1'>
    <dt>Proposition 1</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing.</p>
      <p id='prop1-proof'>Proof &mdash; Particular thoughts, or this and that thought, are modes which, in a certain conditioned manner, express the nature of God (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop25-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 25 of Part 1</a>).  God therefore possesses the attribute (<a href='ethics-1.html#def5'>Definition 5 of Part 1</a>) of which the concept is involved in all particular thoughts, which latter are conceived thereby.  Thought, therefore, is one of the infinite attributes of God, which express God's eternal and infinite essence (<a href='ethics-1.html#def6'>Definition 6 of Part 1</a>).  In other words, God is a thinking thing.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop1-note'>Note &mdash; This proposition is also evident from the fact, that we are able to conceive an infinite thinking being.  For, in proportion as a thinking being is conceived as thinking more thoughts, so is it conceived as containing more reality or perfection.  Therefore a being, which can think an infinite number of things in an infinite number of ways, is, necessarily, in respect of thinking, infinite.  As, therefore, from the consideration of thought alone, we conceive an infinite being, thought is necessarily (<a href='ethics-1.html#def4'>Definition 4</a> and <a href='ethics-1.html#def6'>Definition 6</a> of Part 1) one of the infinite attributes of God, as we were desirous of showing.</p>
    </dd>
  </di>
  <di id='prop2'>
    <dt>Proposition 2</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended thing.</p>
      <p id='prop2-proof'>Proof &mdash; The proof of this proposition is similar to that of the last.</p>
    </dd>
  </di>
  <di id='prop3'>
    <dt>Proposition 3</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>In God there is necessarily the idea not only of his essence, but also of all things which necessarily follow from his essence.</p>
      <p id='prop3-proof'>Proof &mdash; God (by <a href='ethics-1.html#prop1'>Proposition 1</a>) can think an infinite number of things in infinite ways, or (what is the same thing, by <a href='ethics-1.html#prop16'>Proposition 16 of Part 1</a>) can form the idea of his essence, and of all things which necessarily follow therefrom.  Now all that is in the power of God necessarily is (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop35'>Proposition 35 of Part 1</a>).  Therefore, such an idea as we are considering necessarily is, and in God alone.  Q.E.D.  (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop15'>Proposition 15 of Part 1</a>)</p>
      <p id='prop3-note'>Note &mdash; The multitude understand by the power of God the free will of God, and the right over all things that exist, which latter are accordingly generally considered as contingent.  For it is said that God has the power to destroy all things, and to reduce them to nothing.  Further, the power of God is very often likened to the power of kings.  But this doctrine we have refuted (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop32-corollary1'>Corollary 1</a> and <a href='ethics-1.html#prop32-corollary2'>Corollary 2</a> to Proposition 32 of Part 1), and we have shown (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop16'>Proposition 16 of Part 1</a>) that God acts by the same necessity, as that by which he understands himself; in other words, as it follows from the necessity of the divine nature (as all admit), that God understands himself, so also does it follow by the same necessity, that God performs infinite acts in infinite ways.  We further showed (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop34'>Proposition 34 of Part 1</a>), that God's power is identical with God's essence in action; therefore it is as impossible for us to conceive God as not acting, as to conceive him as non-existent.  If we might pursue the subject further, I could point out, that the power which is commonly attributed to God is not only human (as showing that God is conceived by the multitude as a man, or in the likeness of a man), but involves a negation of power.  However, I am unwilling to go over the same ground so often.  I would only beg the reader again and again, to turn over frequently in his mind what I have said in Part 1 from <a href='ethics-1.html#prop16'>Proposition 16</a> to the end.  No one will be able to follow my meaning, unless he is scrupulously careful not to confound the power of God with the human power and right of kings.</p>

  <di id='prop4'>
    <dt>Proposition 4</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The idea of God, from which an infinite number of things follow in infinite ways, can only be one.</p>
      <p id='prop4-proof'>Proof &mdash; Infinite intellect comprehends nothing save the attributes of God and his modifications (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop30'>Proposition 30 of Part 1</a>).  Now God is one (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop14-corollary1'>Corollary 1 to Proposition 14 of Part 1</a>).  Therefore the idea of God, wherefrom an infinite number of things follow in infinite ways, can only be one.  Q.E.D.</p>
    </dd>
  </di>
  <di id='prop5'>
    <dt>Proposition 5</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The actual being of ideas owns God as its cause, only in so far as he is considered as a thinking thing, not in so far as he is unfolded in any other attribute; that is, the ideas both of the attributes of God and of particular things do not own as their efficient cause their objects (ideata) or the things perceived, but God himself in so far as he is a thinking thing.</p>
      <p id='prop5-proof'>Proof &mdash; This proposition is evident from <a href='#prop3'>Proposition 3 of this Part</a>.  We there drew the conclusion, that God can form the idea of his essence, and of all things which follow necessarily therefrom, solely because he is a thinking thing, and not because he is the object of his own idea.  Wherefore the actual being of ideas owns for cause God, in so far as he is a thinking thing.  It may be differently proved as follows: the actual being of ideas is (obviously) a mode of thought, that is (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop25-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 25 of Part 1</a>) a mode which expresses in a certain manner the nature of God, in so far as he is a thinking thing, and therefore (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop10'>Proposition 10 of Part 1</a>) involves the conception of no other attribute of God, and consequently (by <a href='ethics-1.html#axiom4'>Axiom 4 of Part 1</a>) is not the effect of any attribute save thought.  Therefore the actual being of ideas owns God as its cause, in so far as he is considered as a thinking thing, &amp;c.  Q.E.D.</p>
    </dd>
  </di>
  <di id='prop6'>
    <dt>Proposition 6</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The modes of any given attribute are caused by God, in so far as he is considered through the attribute of which they are modes, and not in so far as he is considered through any other attribute.</p>
      <p id='prop6-proof'>Proof &mdash; Each attribute is conceived through itself, without any other (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop10'>Proposition 10 of Part 1</a>); wherefore the modes of each attribute involve the conception of that attribute, but not of any other.  Thus (<a href='ethics-1.html#axiom4'>Axiom 4 of Part 1</a>) they are caused by God, only in so far as he is considered through the attribute whose modes they are, and not in so far as he is considered through any other.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop6-corollary'>Corollary &mdash; Hence the actual being of things, which are not modes of thought, does not follow from the divine nature, because that nature has prior knowledge of the things.  Things represented in ideas follow, and are derived from their particular attribute, in the same manner, and with the same necessity as ideas follow (according to what we have shown) from the attribute of thought.</p>
    </dd>
  </di>
  <di id='prop7'>
    <dt>Proposition 7</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.</p>
      <p id='prop7-proof'>Proof &mdash; This proposition is evident from <a href='ethics-1.html#axiom4'>Axiom 4 of Part 1</a>.  For the idea of everything that is caused depends on a knowledge of the cause, whereof it is an effect.</p>
      <p id='prop7-corollary'>Corollary &mdash; Hence God's power of thinking is equal to his realized power of action &mdash; that is, whatsoever follows from the infinite nature of God in the world of extension (formaliter), follows without exception in the same order and connection from the idea of God in the world of thought (objective).</p>
      <p id='prop7-note'>Note &mdash; Before going any further, I wish to recall to mind what has been pointed out above &mdash; namely, that whatsoever can be perceived by the infinite intellect as constituting the essence of substance, belongs altogether only to one substance: consequently, substance thinking and substance extended are one and the same substance, comprehended now through one attribute, now through the other.  So, also, a mode of extension and the idea of that mode are one and the same thing, though expressed in two ways.  This truth seems to have been dimly recognized by those Jews who maintained that God, God's intellect, and the things understood by God are identical.  For instance, a circle existing in nature, and the idea of a circle existing, which is also in God, are one and the same thing displayed through different attributes.  Thus, whether we conceive nature under the attribute of extension, or under the attribute of thought, or under any other attribute, we shall find the same order, or one and the same chain of causes &mdash; that is, the same things following in either case.</p>
      <p>I said that God is the cause of an idea &mdash; for instance, of the idea of a circle, &mdash; in so far as he is a thinking thing; and of a circle, in so far as he is an extended thing, simply because the actual being of the idea of a circle can only be perceived as a proximate cause through another mode of thinking, and that again through another, and so on to infinity; so that, so long as we consider things as modes of thinking, we must explain the order of the whole of nature, or the whole chain of causes, through the attribute of thought only.  And, in so far as we consider things as modes of extension, we must explain the order of the whole of nature through the attributes of extension only; and so on, in the case of the other attributes.  Wherefore of things as they are in themselves God is really the cause, inasmuch as he consists of infinite attributes.  I cannot for the present explain my meaning more clearly.</p>
    </dd>
  </di>
  <di id='prop8'>
    <dt>Proposition 8</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The ideas of particular things, or of modes, that do not exist, must be comprehended in the infinite idea of God, in the same way as the formal essences of particular things or modes are contained in the attributes of God.</p>
      <p id='prop8-proof'>Proof &mdash; This proposition is evident from the last; it is understood more clearly from the preceding note.</p>
      <p id='prop8-corollary'>Corollary &mdash; Hence, so long as particular things do not exist, except in so far as they are comprehended in the attributes of God, their representations in thought or ideas do not exist, except in so far as the infinite idea of God exists; and when particular things are said to exist, not only in so far as they are involved in the attributes of God, but also in so far as they are said to continue, their ideas will also involve existence, through which they are said to continue.</p>
      <p id='prop8-note'>Note &mdash; If anyone desires an example to throw more light on this question, I shall, I fear, not be able to give him any, which adequately explains the thing of which I here speak, inasmuch as it is unique; however, I will endeavour to illustrate it as far as possible.  The nature of a circle is such that if any number of straight lines intersect within it, the rectangles formed by their segments will be equal to one another; thus, infinite equal rectangles are contained in a circle.  Yet none of these rectangles can be said to exist, except in so far as the circle exists; nor can the idea of any of these rectangles be said to exist, except in so far as they are comprehended in the idea of the circle.  Let us grant that, from this infinite number of rectangles, two only exist.  The ideas of these two not only exist, in so far as they are contained in the idea of the circle, but also as they involve the existence of those rectangles; wherefore they are distinguished from the remaining ideas of the remaining rectangles.</p>

  <di id='prop9'>
    <dt>Proposition 9</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The idea of an individual thing actually existing is caused by God, not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as he is considered as affected by another idea of a thing actually existing, of which he is the cause, in so far as he is affected by a third idea, and so on to infinity.</p>
      <p id='prop9-proof'>Proof &mdash; The idea of an individual thing actually existing is an individual mode of thinking, and is distinct from other modes (by the <a href='#prop8-corollary'>corollary</a> and <a href='#prop8-note'>note</a> to <a href='#prop8'>Proposition 8</a> of this part); thus (by <a href='#prop6'>Proposition 6</a> of this part) it is caused by God, in so far only as he is a thinking thing.  But not (by <a href='ethics-1.html#prop28'>Proposition 28 of Part 1</a>) in so far as he is a thing thinking absolutely, only in so far as he is considered as affected by another mode of thinking; and he is the cause of this latter, as being affected by a third, and so on to infinity.  Now, the order and connection of ideas is (by <a href='#prop7'>Proposition 7</a> of this book) the same as the order and connection of causes.   Therefore of a given individual idea another individual idea, or God, in so far as he is considered as modified by that idea, is the cause; and of this second idea God is the cause, in so far as he is affected by another idea, and so on to infinity.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop9-proof'>Corollary &mdash; Whatsoever takes place in the individual object of any idea, the knowledge thereof is in God, in so far only as he has the idea of the object.</p>
      <p id='prop9-corollary-proof'>Proof &mdash; Whatsoever takes place in the object of any idea, its idea is in God (by <a href='#prop3'>Proposition 3</a> of this part), not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as he is considered as affected by another idea of an individual thing (by <a href='#prop8'>the last Proposition</a>); but (by <a href='#prop7'>Proposition 7</a> of this part) the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.  The knowledge, therefore, of that which takes place in any individual object will be in God, in so far only as he has the idea of that object.  Q.E.D.</p>

    <dt>Proposition 10</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The being of substance does not appertain to the essence of man &mdash; in other words, substance does not constitute the actual being of man.</p>
      <p id='prop10-proof'>Proof &mdash; The being of substance involves necessary existence (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop7'>Proposition 7 of Part 1</a>).  If, therefore, the being of substance appertains to the essence of man, substance being granted, man would necessarily be granted also (<a href='#def2'>Definition 2</a>), and, consequently, man would necessarily exist, which is absurd (<a href='#axiom1'>Axiom 1</a>).  Therefore, &amp;c.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop10-note'>Note &mdash; This proposition may also be proved from <a href='ethics-1.html#prop5'>Proposition 5 of Part 1</a>, in which it is shown that there cannot be two substances of the same nature; for as there may be many men, the being of substance is not that which constitutes the actual being of man.  Again, the proposition is evident from the other properties of substance &mdash; namely, that substance is in its nature infinite, immutable, indivisible, &amp;c., as anyone may see for himself.</p>
      <p id='prop10-corollary'>Corollary &mdash; Hence it follows, that the essence of man is constituted by certain modifications of the attributes of God.  For (by <a href='#prop9'>the last Proposition</a>) the being of substance does not belong to the essence of man.  That essence therefore (by <a href='ethics-1.html#prop15'>Proposition 15 of Part 1</a>) is something which is in God, and which without God can neither be nor be conceived, whether it be a modification (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop25-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 25 of Part 1</a>), or a mode which expresses God's nature in a certain conditioned manner.</p>
      <p id='prop10-corollary-note'>Note &mdash; Everyone must surely admit, that nothing can be or be conceived without God.  All men agree that God is the one and only cause of all things, both of their essence and of their existence; that is, God is not only the cause of things in respect to their being made (secundum fieri), but also in respect to their being (secundum esse).</p>
      <p>At the same time many assert, that that, without which a thing cannot be nor be conceived, belongs to the essence of that thing; wherefore they believe that either the nature of God appertains to the essence of created things, or else that created things can be or be conceived without God; or else, as is more probably the case, they hold inconsistent doctrines.  I think the cause for such confusion is mainly, that they do not keep to the proper order of philosophic thinking.  The nature of God, which should be reflected on first, inasmuch as it is prior both in the order of knowledge and the order of nature, they have taken to be last in the order of knowledge, and have put into the first place what they call the objects of sensation; hence, while they are considering natural phenomena, they give no attention at all to the divine nature, and, when afterwards they apply their mind to the study of the divine nature, they are quite unable to bear in mind the first hypotheses, with which they have overlaid the knowledge of natural phenomena, inasmuch as such hypotheses are no help towards understanding the divine nature.  So that it is hardly to be wondered at, that these persons contradict themselves freely.</p>
      <p>However, I pass over this point.  My intention her was only to give a reason for not saying, that that, without which a thing cannot be or be conceived, belongs to the essence of that thing: individual things cannot be or be conceived without God, yet God does not appertain to their essence.  I said that "I considered as belonging to the essence of a thing that, which being given, the thing is necessarily given also, and which being removed, the thing is necessarily removed also; or that without which the thing, and which itself without the thing can neither be nor be conceived."

    <dd>
      <p>The first element, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is the idea of some particular thing actually existing.</p>
      <p id='prop11-proof'>Proof &mdash; The essence of man (by <a href='#prop10-corollary'>the Corollary to the last Proposition</a>) is constituted by certain modes of the attributes of God, namely (by <a href='#axiom2'>Axiom 2</a>), by the modes of thinking, of all which (by <a href='#axiom3'>Axiom 3</a>) the idea is prior in nature, and, when the idea is given, the other modes (namely, those of which the idea is prior in nature) must be in the same individual (by the same Axiom).  Therefore an idea is the first element constituting the human mind.  But not the idea of a non-existent thing, for then (<a href='#prop8-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 8</a>) the idea itself cannot be said to exist; it must therefore be the idea of something actually existing.  But not of an infinite thing.  For an infinite thing (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop21'>Proposition 21 of Part 1</a> and <a href='ethics-1.html#prop22'>Proposition 22 of Part 1</a>), must always necessarily exist; this would (by <a href='#axiom1'>Axiom 1</a>) involve an absurdity.  Therefore the first element, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is the idea of something actually existing.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop11-corollary'>Corollary &mdash; Hence it follows, that the human mind is part of the infinite intellect of God; thus when we say, that the human mind perceives this or that, we make the assertion, that God has this or that idea, not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as he is displayed through the nature of the human mind, or in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind; and when we say that God has this or that idea, not only in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind, but also in so far as he, simultaneously with the human mind, has the further idea of another thing, we assert that the human mind perceives a thing in part or inadequately.</p>
      <p id='prop11-note'>Note &mdash; Here, I doubt not, readers will come to a stand, and will call to mind many things which will cause them to hesitate; I therefore beg them to accompany me slowly, step by step, and not to pronounce on my statements, till they have read to the end.</p>

      <p>Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of the idea, which constitutes the human mind, must be perceived by the human mind, or there will necessarily be an idea in the human mind of the said occurrence.  That is, if the object of the idea constituting the human mind be a body, nothing can take place in that body without being perceived by the mind.</p>
      <p id='prop12-proof'>Proof &mdash; Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of any idea, the knowledge thereof is necessarily in God (<a href='#prop9-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 9</a>), in so far as he is considered as affected by the idea of the said object, that is (<a href='#prop9'>Proposition 9</a>), in so far as he constitutes the mind of anything.  Therefore, whatsoever takes place in the object constituting the idea of the human mind, the knowledge thereof is necessarily in God, in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind; that is (by <a href='#prop11-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>) the knowledge of the said thing will necessarily be in the mind, in other words the mind perceives it.</p>

      <p id='prop13-proof'>Proof &mdash; If indeed the body were not the object of the human mind, the ideas of the modifications of the body would not be in God (<a href='#prop11-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>) in virtue of his constituting our mind, but in virtue of his constituting the mind of something else; that is (<a href='#prop11-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>) the ideas of the modifications of the body would not be in our mind: now (by <a href='#axiom4'>Axiom 4</a>) we do possess the idea of the modifications of the body.  Therefore the object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body, and the body as it actually exists ((<a href='#prop11'>Proposition 11</a>)).  Further, if there were any other object of the idea constituting the mind besides body, then, as nothing can exist from which some effect does not follow (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop36'>Proposition 36 of Part 1</a>) there would necessarily have to be in our mind an idea, which would be the effect of that other object (<a href='#prop11'>Proposition 11</a>); but (<a href='ethics-1.html#axiom5'>Axiom 5</a>) (1. Ax. v.) there is no such idea.  Wherefore the object of our mind is the body as it exists, and nothing else.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop13-note'>Note &mdash; We thus comprehend, not only that the human mind is united to the body, but also the nature of the union between mind and body.  However, no one will be able to grasp this adequately or distinctly, unless he first has adequate knowledge of the nature of our body.  The propositions we have advanced hitherto have been entirely general, applying not more to men than to other individual things, all of which, though in different degrees, are animated.  For of everything there is necessarily an idea in God, of which God is the cause, in the same way as there is an idea of the human body; thus  whatever we have asserted of the idea of the human body must necessarily also be asserted of the idea of everything else.  Still, on the other hand, we cannot deny that ideas, like objects, differ one from the other, one being more excellent than another and containing more reality, just as the object of one idea is more excellent than the object of another idea, and contains more reality.</p>
      <p>Wherefore, in order to determine, wherein the human mind differs from other things, and wherein it surpasses them, it is necessary for us to know the nature of its object, that is, of the human body.  What this nature is, I am not able here to explain, nor is it necessary for the proof of what I advance, that I should do so.  I will only say generally, that in proportion as any given body is more fitted than others for doing many actions or receiving many impressions at once, so also is the mind, of which it is the object, more fitted than others for forming many simultaneous perceptions; and the more the actions of the body depend on itself alone, and the fewer other bodies concur with it in action, the more fitted is the mind of which it is the object for distinct comprehension.  We may thus recognize the superiority of one mind over others, and may further see the cause, why we have only a very confused knowledge of our body, and also many kindred questions, which I will, in the following propositions, deduce from what has been advanced.  Wherefore I have thought it worth while to explain and prove more strictly my present statements.  In order to do so, I must premise a few propositions concerning the nature of bodies.</p>
      <p id='prop13-axiom1'>Axiom 1.  All bodies are either in motion or at rest.</p>
      <p id='prop13-axiom1'>Axiom 2.  Every body is moved sometimes more slowly, sometimes more quickly.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma1'>Lemma 1.  Bodies are distinguished from one another in respect of motion and rest, quickness and slowness, and not in respect of substance.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma1-proof'>Proof &mdash; The first part of this proposition is, I take it, self-evident.  That bodies are not distinguished in respect of substance, is plain both from <a href='ethics-1.html#prop5'>Proposition 5 of Part 1</a> and <a href='ethics-1.html#prop8'>Proposition 8 of Part 1</a>.  It is brought out still more clearly from <a href='ethics-1.html#prop15-note'>Note to Proposition 15 of Part 1</a>.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma2'>Lemma 2.  All bodies agree in certain respects.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma2-proof'>Proof &mdash; All bodies agree in the fact, that they involve the conception of one and the same attribute <a href='#def1'>Definition 1</a>.  Further, in the fact that they may be moved less or more quickly, and may be absolutely in motion or at rest.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma3'>Lemma 3.  A body in motion or at rest must be determined to motion or rest by another body, which other body has been determined to motion or rest by a third body, and that third again by a fourth, and so on to infinity.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma3-proof'>Proof &mdash; Bodies are individual things (<a href='#def1'>Definition 1</a>), which (<a href='#prop13-lemma1'>Lemma 1</a>) are distinguished one from the other in respect to motion and rest; thus <a href='ethics-1.html#prop28'>Proposition 28 of Part 1</a>) each must necessarily be determined to motion or rest by another individual thing, namely <a href='#prop6'>Proposition 6</a>), by another body, which other body is also <a href='#prop13-axiom1'>Axiom 1</a>) in motion or at rest.  And this body again can only have been set in motion or caused to rest by being determined by a third body to motion or rest.   This third body again by a fourth, and so on to infinity.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma3-corollary'>Corollary &mdash; Hence it follows, that a body in motion keeps in motion, until it is determined to a state of rest by some other body; and a body at rest remains so, until it is determined to a state of motion by some other body.  This is indeed self-evident.  For when I suppose, for instance, that a given body, A, is at rest, and do not take into consideration other bodies in motion, I cannot affirm anything concerning the body A, except that it is at rest.  If it afterwards comes to pass that A is in motion, this cannot have resulted from its having been at rest, for no other consequence could have been involved than its remaining at rest.  If, on the other hand, A be given in motion, we shall, so long as we only consider A, be unable to affirm anything concerning it, except that it is in motion.   If A is subsequently found to be at rest, this rest cannot be the result of A's previous motion, for such motion can only have led to continued motion; the state of rest therefore must have resulted from something, which was not in A, namely, from an external cause determining A to a state of rest.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma3-corollary-axiom1'>Axiom 1.&mdash;All modes, wherein one body is affected by another body, follow simultaneously from the nature of the body affected and the body affecting; so that one and the same body may be moved in different modes, according to the difference in the nature of the bodies moving it; on the other hand, different bodies may be moved in different modes by one and the same body.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma3-corollary-axiom2'>Axiom 2.&mdash;When a body in motion impinges on another body at rest, which it is unable to move, it recoils, in order to continue its motion, and the angle made by the line of motion in the recoil and the plane of the body at rest, whereon the moving body has impinged, will be equal to the angle formed by the line of motion of incidence and the same plane.</p>
      <p>So far we have been speaking only of the most simple bodies, which are only distinguished one from the other by motion and rest, quickness and slowness.  We now pass on to compound bodies.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma2-corollary-definition'>Definition.&mdash;When any given bodies of the same or different magnitude are compelled by other bodies to remain in contact, or if they be moved at the same or different rates of speed, so that their mutual movements should preserve among themselves a certain fixed relation, we say that such bodies are in union, and that together they compose one body or individual, which is distinguished from other bodies by the fact of this union.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma2-corollary-axiom3'>Axiom 3.&mdash;In proportion as the parts of an individual, or a compound body, are in contact over a greater or less superficies, they will with greater or less difficulty admit of being moved from their position; consequently the individual will, with greater or less difficulty, be brought to assume another form.  Those bodies, whose parts are in contact over large superficies, are called hard; those, whose parts are in contact over small superficies, are called soft; those, whose parts are in motion among one another, are called fluid.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma4'>Lemma 4.  If from a body or individual, compounded of several bodies, certain bodies be separated, and if, at the same time, an equal number of other bodies of the same nature take their place, the individual will preserve its nature as before, without any change in its actuality (forma).</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma4-proof'>Proof &mdash; Bodies (<a href='#prop13-lemma1'>Lemma 1</a>) are not distinguished in respect of substance: that which constitutes the actuality (formam) of an individual consists (by the <a href='#prop13-lemma2-corollary-definition'>last Defintion</a>) in a union of bodies; but this union, although there is a continual change of bodies, will (by our hypothesis) be maintained; the individual, therefore, will retain its nature as before, both in respect of substance and in respect of mode.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma5'>Lemma 5.  If the parts composing an individual become greater or less, but in such proportion, that they all preserve the same mutual relations of motion and rest, the individual will still preserve its original nature, and its actuality will not be changed.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma5-proof'>Proof &mdash; The same as for the last Lemma.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma6'>Lemma 6.  If certain bodies composing an individual be compelled to change the motion, which they have in one direction, for motion in another direction, but in such a manner, that they be able to continue their motions and their mutual communication in the same relations as before, the individual will retain its own nature without any change of its actuality.</p>
      <p>Proof &mdash; This proposition is self-evident, for the individual is supposed to retain all that, which, in its definition, we spoke of as its actual being.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma7'>Lemma 7.  Furthermore, the individual thus composed preserves its nature, whether it be, as a whole, in motion or at rest, whether it be moved in this or that direction; so long as each part retains its motion, and preserves its communication with other parts as before.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma7-proof'>Proof &mdash; This proposition is evident from the definition of an individual prefixed to Lemma iv.</p>
      <p id='prop13-lemma7-note'>Note &mdash; We thus see, how a composite individual may be affected in many different ways, and preserve its nature notwithstanding.  Thus far we have conceived an individual as composed of bodies only distinguished one from the other in respect of motion and rest, speed and slowness; that is, of bodies of the most simple character.  If, however, we now conceive another individual composed of several individuals of diverse natures, we shall find that the number of ways in which it can be affected, without losing its nature, will be greatly multiplied.  Each of its parts would consist of several bodies, and therefore (by <a href='#prop13-lemma6'>Lemma 6</a>) each part would admit, without change to its nature, of quicker or slower motion, and would consequently be able to transmit its motions more quickly or more slowly to the remaining parts.  If we further conceive a third kind of individuals composed of individuals of this second kind, we shall find that they may be affected in a still greater number of ways without changing their actuality.  We may easily proceed thus to infinity, and conceive the whole of nature as one individual, whose parts, that is, all bodies, vary in infinite ways, without any change in the individual as a whole.  I should feel bound to explain and demonstrate this point at more length, if I were writing a special treatise on body.  But I have already said that such is not my object; I have only touched on the question, because it enables me to prove easily that which I have in view.</p>

      <p>The idea of every mode, in which the human body is affected by external bodies, must involve the nature of the human body, and also the nature of the external body.</p>
      <p id='prop15-proof'>Proof &mdash; All the modes, in which any given body is affected, follow from the nature of the body affected, and also from the nature of the affecting body (by <a href='#prop13-lemma3-corollary-axiom1'>Axiom 1 after the Corollary to Lemma 3</a>), wherefore their idea also necessarily (by <a href='ethics-1.html#axiom4'>Axiom 4 of Part 1</a> involves the nature of both bodies; therefore, the idea of every mode, in which the human body is affected by external bodies, involves the nature of the human body and of the external body.

    <dd>
      <p>If the human body is affected in a manner which involves the nature of any external body, the human mind will regard the said external body as actually existing, or as present to itself, until the human body be affected in such a way, as to exclude the existence or the presence of the said external body.</p>
      <p id='prop17-proof1'>Proof &mdash; This proposition is self-evident, for so long as the human body continues to be thus affected, so long will the human mind (<a href='prop12'>Proposition 12</a>) regard this modification of the body&mdash;that is (by <a href='prop16'>Proposition 16</a>), it will have the idea of the mode as actually existing, and this idea involves the nature of the external body.  In other words, it will have the idea which does not exclude, but postulates the existence or presence of the nature of the external body; therefore the mind (by <a href='prop16-corollary1'>Corollary 1 to Proposition 16</a>) will regard the external body as actually existing, until it is affected, &amp;c.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop17-proof1-corollary'>Corollary &mdash; The mind is able to regard as present external bodies, by which the human body has once been affected, even though they be no longer in existence or present.</p>
      <p id='prop17-proof1'>Proof &mdash; When external bodies determine the fluid parts of the human body, so that they often impinge on the softer parts, they change the surface of the last named (<a href='postulate5'>Postulate 5</a>); hence (<a href='#prop13-lemma3-corollary-axiom2'>Axiom 2 after the Corollary to Lemma 3</a>) they are refracted therefrom in a different manner from that which they followed before such change; and, further, when afterwards they impinge on the new surfaces by their own spontaneous movement, they will be refracted in the same manner, as though they had been impelled towards those surfaces by external bodies; consequently, they will, while they continue to be thus refracted, affect the human body in the same manner, whereof the mind (<a href='prop12'>Proposition 12</a>) will again take cognizance&mdash;that is (<a href='prop12'>Proposition 17</a>), the mind will again regard the external body as present, and will do so, as often as the fluid parts of the human body impinge on the aforesaid surfaces by their own spontaneous motion.  Wherefore, although the external bodies, by which the human body has once been affected, be no longer in existence, the mind will nevertheless regard them as present, as often as this action of the body is repeated.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop17-note'>Note &mdash; We thus see how it comes about, as is often the case, that we regard as present many things which are not.  It is possible that the same result may be brought about by other causes; but I think it suffices for me here to have indicated one possible explanation, just as well as if I had pointed out the true cause.  Indeed, I do not think I am very far from the truth, for all my assumptions are based on postulates, which rest, almost without exception, on experience, that cannot be controverted by those who have shown, as we have, that the human body, as we feel it, exists (<a href='#prop13-lemma3-corollary'>Corollary after Proposition 13</a>).  Furthermore (<a href='#prop7-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 7</a>, <a href='#prop16-corollary2'>Corollary 2 to Proposition 16</a>), we clearly understand what is the difference between the idea, say, of Peter, which constitutes the essence of Peter's mind, and the idea of the said Peter, which is in another man, say, Paul.  The former directly answers to the essence of Peter's own body, and only  implies existence so long as Peter exists; the latter indicates rather the disposition of Paul's body than the nature of Peter, and, therefore, while this disposition of Paul's body lasts, Paul's mind will regard Peter as present to itself, even though he no longer exists.  Further, to retain the usual phraseology,  the modifications of the human body, of which the ideas represent external bodies as present to us, we will call the images of things, though they do not recall the figure of things.  When the mind regards bodies in this fashion, we say that it imagines.  I will here draw attention to the fact, in order to indicate where error lies, that the imaginations of the mind, looked at in themselves, do not contain error.  The mind does not err in the mere act of imagining, but only in so far as it is regarded as being without the idea, which excludes the existence of such things as it imagines to be present to it.  If the mind, while imagining non&mdash;existent things as present to it, is at the same time conscious that they do not really exist, this power of imagination must be set down to the efficacy of its nature, and not to a fault, especially if this faculty of imagination depend solely on its own nature&mdash;that is (<a href='ethics-1.html#def7'>Definition 7 of Part 1</a>), if this faculty of imagination be free.</p>

      <p>If the human body has once been affected by two or more bodies at the same time, when the mind afterwards imagines any of them, it will straightway remember the others also.</p>
      <p id='prop18-proof'>Proof &mdash; The mind (<a href='#prop17-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 17</a>) imagines any given body, because the human body is affected and disposed by the impressions from an external body, in the same manner as it is affected when certain of its parts are acted on by the said external body; but (by our hypothesis) the body was then so disposed, that the mind imagined two bodies at once; therefore, it will also in the second case imagine two bodies at once, and the mind, when it imagines one, will straightway remember the other.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop18-proof'>Note &mdash; We now clearly see what Memory is.  It is simply a certain association of ideas involving the nature of things outside the human body, which association arises in the mind according to the order and association of the modifications (affectiones) of the human body.  I say, first, it is an association of those ideas only, which involve the nature of things outside the human body: not of ideas which answer to the nature of the said things: ideas of the modifications of the human body are, strictly speaking (<a href='#prop16'>Proposition 16</a>), those which involve the nature both of the human body and of external bodies.  I say, secondly, that this association arises according to the order and association of the modifications of the human body, in order to distinguish it from that association of ideas, which arises from the order of the intellect, whereby the mind perceives things through their primary causes, and which is in all men the same.  And hence we can further clearly understand, why the mind from the thought of one thing, should straightway arrive at the thought of another thing, which has no similarity with the first; for instance, from the thought of the word pomum (an apple), a Roman would straightway arrive at the thought of the fruit apple, which has no similitude with the articulate sound in question, nor anything in common with it, except that the body of the man has often been affected by these two things; that is, that the man has often heard the word pomum, while he was looking at the fruit; similarly every man will go on from one thought to another, according as his habit has ordered the images of things in his body.  For a soldier, for instance, when he sees the tracks of a horse in sand, will at once pass from the thought of a horse to the thought of a horseman, and thence to the thought of war, &amp;c.; while a countryman will proceed from the thought of a horse to the thought of a plough, a field, &amp;c.  Thus every man will follow this or that train of thought, according as he has been in the habit of conjoining and associating the mental images of things in this or that manner.</p>

      <p>The human mind has no knowledge of the body, and does not know it to exist, save through the ideas of the modifications whereby the body is affected.</p>
      <p id='prop19-proof'>Proof &mdash; The human mind is the very idea or knowledge of the human body (<a href='#prop13'>Proposition 13</a>), which (<a href='#prop9'>Proposition 9</a>) is in God, in so far as he is regarded as affected by another idea of a particular thing actually existing: or, inasmuch as (<a href='#postulate4'>Postulate 4</a>) the human body stands in need of very many bodies whereby it is, as it were, continually regenerated; and the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of causes (<a href='#prop7'>Proposition 7</a>); this idea will therefore be in God, in so far as he is regarded as affected by the ideas of very many particular things.  Thus God has the idea of the human body, or knows the human body, in so far as he is affected by very many other ideas, and not in so far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind; that is (by <a href='#prop11-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>), the human mind does not know the human body.

      <p>The mind does not know itself, except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of the body.</p>
      <p>Proof &mdash; The idea or knowledge of the mind (<a href='#prop20'>Proposition 20</a>) follows in God in the same manner, and is referred to God in the same manner, as the idea or knowledge of the body.  But since (<a href='#prop19'>Proposition 19</a>) the human mind does not know the human body itself, that is (<a href='#prop11-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>), since the knowledge of the human body is not referred to God, in so far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind; therefore, neither is the knowledge of the mind referred to God, in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind; therefore (by the <a href='#prop11-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>), the human mind thus far has no knowledge of itself.  Further the ideas of the modifications, whereby the body is affected, involve the nature of the human body itself (<a href='#prop16'>Proposition 16</a>), that is (<a href='#prop13'>Proposition 13</a>), they agree with the nature of the mind; wherefore the knowledge of these ideas necessarily involves knowledge of the mind; but (<a href='#prop22'>Proposition 22</a>) the knowledge of these ideas is in the human mind itself; wherefore the human mind thus far only has knowledge of itself.

      <p>The human mind does not involve an adequate knowledge of the parts composing the human body.</p>
      <p id='prop24-proof'>Proof &mdash; The parts composing the human body do not belong to the essence of that body, except in so far as they communicate their motions to one another in a certain fixed relation <a href='#prop13-lemma2-corollary-definition'>Definition after Lemma 3</a>, not in so far as they can be regarded as individuals without relation to the human body.  The parts of the human body are highly complex individuals <a href='#postulate1'>Postulate 1</a>, whose parts (<a href='#prop13-lemma4'>Lemma 4</a>) can be separated from the human body without in any way destroying the nature and distinctive quality of the latter, and they can communicate their motions (<a href='#prop13-lemma3-corollary-axiom1'>Axiom 1 after the Corollary to Lemma 3</a>) to other bodies in another relation; therefore <a href='#prop3'>Proposition 3</a> the idea or knowledge of each part will be in God, inasmuch <a href='#prop9'>Proposition 9</a> as he is regarded as affected by another idea of a particular thing, which particular thing is prior in the order of nature to the aforesaid part <a href='#prop7'>Proposition 7</a>.  We may affirm the same thing of each part of each individual composing the human body; therefore, the knowledge of each part composing the human body is in God, in so far as he is affected by very many ideas of things, and not in so far as he has the idea of the human body only, in other words, the idea which constitutes the nature of the human mind <a href='#prop13'>Proposition 13</a>; therefore <a href='#prop11'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>, the human mind does not involve an adequate knowledge of the human body.

      <p id='prop25-proof'>Proof &mdash; We have shown that the idea of a modification of the human body involves the nature of an external body, in so far as that external body conditions the human body in a given manner.  But, in so far as the external body is an individual, which has no reference to the human body, the knowledge or idea thereof is in God (<a href='#prop9'>Proposition 9</a>), in so far as God is regarded as affected by the idea of a further thing, which (<a href='#prop7'>Proposition 7</a>) is naturally prior to the said external body.  Wherefore an adequate knowledge of the external body is not in God, in so far as he has the idea of the modification of the human body; in other words, the idea of the modification of the human body does not involve an adequate knowledge of the external body.

But, in so far as the human body is affected in any way by a given external body, thus far (<a href='#prop16'>Proposition 16</a> and <a href='#prop16-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 16</a>) it perceives that external body.

      <p>The ideas of the modifications of the human body, in so far as they have reference only to the human mind, are not clear and distinct, but confused.</p>
      <p id='prop28-proof'>Proof &mdash; The ideas of the modifications of the human body involve the nature both of the human body and of external bodies (<a href='#prop16'>Proposition 16</a>); they must involve the nature not only of the human body but also of its parts; for the modifications are modes (<a href='#postulate3'>Postulate 3</a>), whereby the parts of the human body, and, consequently, the human body as a whole are affected.   But (<a href='#prop24'>Proposition 24</a> and <a href='#prop25'>Proposition 25</a>) the adequate knowledge of external bodies, as also of the parts composing the human body, is not in God, in so far as he is regarded as affected by the human mind, but in so far as he is regarded as affected by other ideas.

      <p id='prop29-corollary'>Corollary &mdash; Hence it follows that the human mind, when it perceives things after the common order of nature, has not an adequate but only a confused and fragmentary knowledge of itself, of its own body, and of external bodies.  For the mind does not know itself, except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of body (<a href='#prop23'>Proposition 23</a>).  It only perceives its own body (<a href='#prop19'>Proposition 19</a>) through the ideas of the modifications, and only perceives external bodies through the same means; thus, in so far as it has such ideas of modification, it has not an adequate knowledge of itself (<a href='#prop29'>Proposition 29</a>), nor of its own body (<a href='#prop27'>Proposition 27</a>), nor of external bodies (<a href='#prop25'>Proposition 25</a>), but only a fragmentary and confused knowledge thereof (<a href='#prop28'>Proposition 28</a> and <a href='#prop28-note'>note</a>).

      <p>We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of our body.</p>
      <p id='prop30-note'>Proof &mdash; The duration of our body does not depend on its essence (<a href='#axiom1'>Axiom 1</a>), nor on the absolute nature of God (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop21'>Proposition 21 of Part 1</a>).  But (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop28'>Proposition 28 of Part 1</a>) it is conditioned to exist and operate by causes, which in their turn are conditioned to exist and operate in a fixed and definite relation by other causes, these last again being conditioned by others, and so on to infinity.  The duration of our body therefore depends on the common order of nature, or the constitution of things.  Now, however a thing may be constituted, the adequate knowledge of that thing is in God, in so far as he has the ideas of all things, and not in so far as he has the idea of the human body only.

(<a href='ethics-1.html#prop28'>Proposition 28 of Part 1</a>)  As we have shown in the foregoing proposition, from this common property of particular things, we have only a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of our body; we must draw a similar conclusion with regard to the duration of particular things, namely, that we can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration thereof.

      <p>Falsity consists in the privation of knowledge, which inadequate, fragmentary, or confused ideas involve.</p>
      <p id='prop35-proof'>Proof &mdash; There is nothing positive in ideas, which causes them to be called false (<a href='#prop33'>Proposition 33</a>); but falsity cannot consist in simple privation (for minds, not bodies, are said to err and to be mistaken), neither can it consist in absolute ignorance, for ignorance and error are not identical; wherefore it consists in the privation of knowledge, which inadequate, fragmentary, or confused ideas involve.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop35-note'>Note &mdash; In the (<a href='#prop17-note'>Note to Proposition 17</a>) I explained how error consists in the privation of knowledge, but in order to throw more light on the subject I will give an example.  For instance, men are mistaken in thinking themselves free; their opinion is made up of consciousness of their own actions, and ignorance of the causes by which they are conditioned.  Their idea of freedom, therefore, is simply their ignorance of any cause for their actions.  As for their saying that human actions depend on the will, this is a mere phrase without any idea to correspond thereto.  What the will is, and how it moves the body, they none of them know; those who boast of such knowledge, and feign dwellings and habitations for the soul, are wont to provoke either laughter or disgust.  So, again, when we look at the sun, we imagine that it is distant from us about two hundred feet; this error does not lie solely in this fancy, but in the fact that, while we thus imagine, we do not know the sun's true distance or the cause of the fancy.  For although we afterwards learn, that the sun is distant from us more than six hundred of the earth's diameters, we none the less shall fancy it to be near; for we do not imagine the sun as near us, because we are ignorant of its true distance, but because the modification of our body involves the essence of the sun, in so far as our said body is affected thereby.</p>

Let it now be granted, that the human body is affected by an external body through that, which it has in common therewith, namely, A; the idea of this modification will involve the property A (<a href='#prop16'>Proposition 16</a>), and therefore (<a href='#prop7-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 7</a>) the idea of this modification, in so far as it involves the property A, will be adequate in God, in so far as God is affected by the idea of the human body; that is (<a href='#prop13'>Proposition 13</a>), in so far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind; therefore (<a href='#prop11-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>) this idea is also adequate in the human mind.

For when we say that an idea in the human mind follows from ideas which are therein adequate, we say, in other words <a href='prop11-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>, that an idea is in the divine intellect, whereof God is the cause, not in so far as he is infinite, nor in so far as he is affected by the ideas of very many particular things, but only in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind.</p>
      <p id='prop40-note1'>Note 1. &mdash; I have thus set forth the cause of those notions, which are common to all men, and which form the basis of our ratiocination.  But there are other causes of certain axioms or notions, which it would be to the purpose to set forth by this method of ours; for it would thus appear what notions are more useful than others, and what notions have scarcely any use at all.  Furthermore, we should see what notions are common to all men, and what notions are only clear and distinct to those who are unshackled by prejudice, and we should detect those which are ill&mdash;founded.  Again we should discern whence the notions called secondary derived their origin, and consequently the axioms on which they are founded, and other points of interest connected with these questions.  But I have decided to pass over the subject here, partly because I have set it aside for another treatise, partly because I am afraid of wearying the reader by too great prolixity.  Nevertheless, in order not to omit anything necessary to be known, I will briefly set down the causes, whence are derived the terms styled transcendental, such as Being, Thing, Something.  These terms arose from the fact, that the human body, being limited, is only capable of distinctly forming a certain number of images 
      (what an image is I explained in the 
      <a href='prop17-note'>Note to Proposition 17</a>
      2. xvii. note) within itself at the same time; if this number be exceeded, the images will begin to be confused; if this number of images, of which the body is capable of forming distinctly within itself, be largely exceeded, all will become entirely confused one with another.  This being so, it is evident (from <a href='prop17-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 17</a> and <a href='prop18'>Proposition 18</a>) that the human mind can distinctly imagine as many things simultaneously, as its body can form images simultaneously.  When the images become quite confused in the body, the mind also imagines all bodies confusedly without any distinction, and will comprehend them, as it were, under one attribute, namely, under the attribute of Being, Thing, &amp;c.  The same conclusion can be drawn from the fact that images are not always equally vivid, and from other analogous causes, which there is no need to explain here; for the purpose which we have in view it is sufficient for us to consider one only.  All may be reduced to this, that these terms represent ideas in the highest degree confused.  From similar causes arise those notions, which we call general, such as man, horse, dog, &amp;c.  They arise, to wit, from the fact that so many images, for instance, of men, are formed simultaneously in the human mind, that the powers of imagination break down, not indeed utterly, but to the extent of the mind losing count of small differences between individuals (e.g. colour, size, &amp;c.) and their definite number, and only distinctly imagining that, in which all the individuals, in so far as the body is affected by them, agree; for that is the point, in which each of the said individuals chiefly affected the body; this the mind expresses by the name man, and this it predicates of an infinite number of particular individuals.  For, as we have said, it is unable to imagine the definite number of individuals.  We must, however, bear in mind, that these general notions are not formed by all men in the same way, but vary in each individual according as the point varies, whereby the body has been most often affected and which the mind most easily imagines or remembers.  For instance, those who have most often regarded with admiration the stature of man, will by the name of man understand an animal of erect stature; those who have been accustomed to regard some other attribute, will form a different general image of man, for instance, that man is a laughing animal, a tw &mdash; footed animal without feathers, a rational animal, and thus, in other cases, everyone will form general images of things according to the habit of his body.</p>
      <p>It is thus not to be wondered at, that among philosophers, who seek to explain things in nature merely by the images formed of them, so many controversies should have arisen.</p>
      <p id='prop40-note2'>Note 2. &mdash; From all that has been said above it is clear, that we, in many cases, perceive and form our general notions &mdash; 
        <ol>
          <li>From particular things represented to our intellect fragmentarily, confusedly, and without order through our senses <a href='prop29-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 29</a>; I have settled to call such perceptions by the name of knowledge from the mere suggestions of experience.</li>
          <li>From symbols, e.g., from the fact of having read or heard certain words we remember things and form certain ideas concerning them, similar to those through which we imagine things <a href='prop18-note'>Note to Proposition 18</a>.  I shall call both these ways of regarding things knowledge of the first kind, opinion, or imagination.</li>
          <li>From the fact that we have notions common to all men, and adequate ideas of the properties of things (<a href='prop38-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 38</a>, <a href='prop39'>Proposition 39</a> and its <a href='prop39-corollary'>Corollary</a>, and <a href='prop40'>Proposition 40</a>); this I call reason and knowledge of the second kind.  Besides these two kinds of knowledge, there is, as I will hereafter show, a third kind of knowledge, which we will call intuition.  This kind of knowledge proceeds from an adequate idea of the absolute essence of certain attributes of God to the adequate knowledge of the essence of things.  I will illustrate all three kinds of knowledge by a single example.  Three numbers are given for finding a fourth, which shall be to the third as the second is to the first.  Tradesmen without hesitation multiply the second by the third, and divide the product by the first; either because they have not forgotten the rule which they received from a master without any proof, or because they have often made trial of it with simple numbers, or by virtue of the proof of the nineteenth proposition of the seventh book of Euclid, namely, in virtue of the general property of proportionals.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>But with very simple numbers there is no need of this.  For instance, one, two, three, being given, everyone can see that the fourth proportional is six; and this is much clearer, because we infer the fourth number from an intuitive grasping of the ratio, which the first bears to the second.</p>

      <p>Knowledge of the first kind is the only source of falsity, knowledge of the second and third kinds is necessarily true.</p>
      <p id='prop41-proof'>Proof &mdash; To knowledge of the first kind we have (in the foregoing note) assigned all those ideas, which are inadequate and confused; therefore this kind of knowledge is the only source of falsity (<a href='prop35'>Proposition 35</a>).  Furthermore, we assigned to the second and third kinds of knowledge those ideas which are adequate; therefore these kinds are necessarily true (<a href='prop34'>Proposition 34</a>).  Q.E.D.</p>

      <p>Knowledge of the second and third kinds, not knowledge of the first kind, teaches us to distinguish the true from the false.</p>
      <p id='prop42-proof'>Proof &mdash; This proposition is self-evident.  He, who knows how to distinguish between true and false, must have an adequate idea of true and false.  That is (<a href='prop40'>Proposition 40</a> and its <a href='prop40-note2'>Note 2 to Proposition 40</a>), he must know the true and the false by the second or third kind of knowledge.</p>

      <p>He, who has a true idea, simultaneously knows that he has a true idea, and cannot doubt of the truth of the thing perceived.</p>
      <p id='prop43-proof'>Proof &mdash; A true idea in us is an idea which is adequate in God, in so far as he is displayed through the nature of the human mind (<a href='prop11-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>).  Let us suppose that there is in God, in so far as he is displayed through the human mind, an adequate idea, A.  The idea of this idea must also necessarily be in God, and be referred to him in the same way as the idea A (by <a href='prop20'>Proposition 20</a>), whereof the proof is of universal application).  But the idea A is supposed to be referred to God, in so far as he is displayed through the human mind; therefore, the idea of the idea A must be referred to God in the same manner; that is (by <a href='prop11-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>), the adequate idea of the idea A will be in the mind, which has the adequate idea A; therefore he, who has an adequate idea or knows a thing truly (<a href='prop34'>Proposition 34</a>), must at the same time have an adequate idea or true knowledge of his knowledge; that is, obviously, he must be assured.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop43-note'>Note &mdash; I explained in the note to 2. xxi. what is meant by the idea of an idea; but we may remark that the foregoing proposition is in itself sufficiently plain.  No one, who has a true idea, is ignorant that a true idea involves the highest certainty.  For to have a true idea is only another expression for knowing a thing perfectly, or as well as possible.  No one, indeed, can doubt of this, unless he thinks that an idea is something lifeless, like a picture on a panel, and not a mode of thinking&mdash;namely, the very act of understanding.  And who, I ask, can know that he understands anything, unless he do first understand it?  In other words, who can know that he is sure of a thing, unless he be first sure of that thing?  Further, what can there be more clear, and more certain, than a true idea as a standard of truth?  Even as light displays both itself and darkness, so is truth a standard both of itself and of falsity.</p>
      <p>I think I have thus sufficiently answered these questions&mdash;namely, if a true idea is distinguished from a false idea, only in so far as it is said to agree with its object, a true idea has no more reality or perfection than a false idea (since the two are only distinguished by an extrinsic mark); consequently, neither will a man who has a true idea have any advantage over him who has only false ideas.  Further, how comes it that men have false ideas?  Lastly, how can anyone be sure, that he has ideas which agree with their objects?  These questions, I repeat, I have, in my opinion, sufficiently answered.  The difference between a true idea and a false idea is plain: from what was said in 2. xxxv., the former is related to the latter as being is to not&mdash;being.  The causes of falsity I have set forth very clearly in 2. xix. and 2. xxxv. with the note.  From what is there stated, the difference between a man who has true ideas, and a man who has only false ideas, is made apparent.  As for the last question&mdash;as to how a man can be sure that he has ideas that agree with their objects, I have just pointed out, with abundant clearness, that his knowledge arises from the simple fact, that he has an idea which corresponds with its object&mdash;in other words, that truth is its own standard.  We may add that our mind, in so far as it perceives things truly, is part of the infinite intellect of God (<a href='prop11-corollary'>Corollary to Proposition 11</a>); therefore, the clear and distinct ideas of the mind are as necessarily true as the ideas of God.</p>

    <dd>
      <p>It is not in the nature of reason to regard things as contingent, but as necessary.</p>
      <p id='prop44-proof'>Proof &mdash; It is in the nature of reason to perceive things truly (<a href='prop41'>Proposition 41</a>), namely (<a href='ethics-1.html#axiom6'>Axiom 6 of Part 1</a>), as they are in themselves&mdash;that is (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop29'>Proposition 29 of Part 1</a>), not as contingent, but as necessary.  Q.E.D.</p>
      <p id='prop44-corollary1'>Corollary 1 &mdash; Hence it follows, that it is only through our imagination that we consider things, whether in respect to the future or the past, as contingent.</p>
      <p id='prop44-corollary1-note'>Note &mdash; How this way of looking at things arises, I will briefly explain.  We have shown above (<a href='prop17'>Proposition 17</a> and its <a href='prop17-corollary'>Corollary</a>) that the mind always regards things as present to itself, even though they be not in existence, until some causes arise which exclude their existence and presence.  Further (<a href='prop18'>Proposition 18</a>), we showed that, if the human body has once been affected by two external bodies simultaneously, the mind, when it afterwards imagines one of the said external bodies, will straightway remember the other&mdash;that is, it will regard both as present to itself, unless there arise causes which exclude their existence and presence.  Further, no one doubts that we imagine time, from the fact that we imagine bodies to be moved some more slowly than others, some more quickly, some at equal speed.  Thus, let us suppose that a child yesterday saw Peter for the first time in the morning, Paul at noon, and Simon in the evening; then, that today he again sees Peter in the morning.  It is evident, from <a href='prop18'>Proposition 18</a>, that, as soon as he sees the morning light, he will imagine that the sun will traverse the same parts of the sky, as it did when he saw it on the preceding day; in other words, he will imagine a complete day, and, together with his imagination of the morning, he will imagine Peter; with noon, he will imagine Paul; and with evening, he will imagine Simon&mdash;that is, he will imagine the existence of Paul and Simon in relation to a future time; on the other hand, if he sees Simon in the evening, he will refer Peter and Paul to a past time, by imagining them simultaneously with the imagination of a past time.  If it should at any time happen, that on some other evening the child should see James instead of Simon, he will, on the following morning, associate with his imagination of evening sometimes Simon, sometimes James, not both together: for the child is supposed to have seen, at evening, one or other of them, not both together.  His imagination will therefore waver; and, with the imagination of future evenings, he will associate first one, then the other&mdash;that is, he will imagine them in the future, neither of them as certain, but both as contingent.  This wavering of the imagination will be the same, if the imagination be concerned with things which we thus contemplate, standing in relation to time past or time present: consequently, we may imagine things as contingent, whether they be referred to time present, past, or future.</p>
      <p id='prop44-corollary1'>Corollary 2 &mdash; It is in the nature of reason to perceive things under a certain form of eternity (sub quâdam æternitatis specie).</p>
      <p id='prop44-corollary1-proof'>Proof &mdash; It is in the nature of reason to regard things, not as contingent, but as necessary (<a href='prop34'>Proposition 44</a>).  Reason perceives this necessity of things (<a href='prop41'>Proposition 41</a>) truly&mdash;that is (<a href='ethics-1.html#axiom6'>Axiom 6 of Part 1</a>), as it is in itself.  But (<a href='ethics-1.html#prop16'>Proposition 16</a>) this necessity of things is the very necessity of the eternal nature of God; therefore, it is in the nature of reason to regard things under this form of eternity.  We may add that the bases of reason are the notions (<a href='prop38'>Proposition 38</a>), which answer to things common to all, and which (<a href='prop37'>Proposition 37</a>) do not answer to the essence of any particular thing: which must therefore be conceived without any relation to time, under a certain form of eternity.</p>

      <p>PROP. 46.  The knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God which every idea involves is adequate and perfect.</p>

      <p>Proof &mdash; The proof of the last proposition is universal; and whether a thing be considered as a part or a whole, the idea thereof, whether of the whole or of a part (by the last Prop.), will involve God's eternal and infinite essence.  Wherefore, that, which gives knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God, is common to all, and is equally in the part and in the whole; therefore (2. xxxviii.) this knowledge will be adequate.  Q.E.D.</p>

      <p>PROP. 47.  The human mind has an adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God.</p>

      <p>Proof &mdash; The human mind has ideas (2. xxii.), from which (2.  xxiii.) it perceives itself and its own body (2. xix.) and external bodies (2. xvi. Coroll. i. and 2. xvii.) as actually existing; therefore (2. xlv. and xlvi.) it has an adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God.  Q.E.D.</p>

      <p>Note &mdash; Hence we see, that the infinite essence and the eternity of God are known to all.  Now as all things are in God, and are conceived through God, we can from this knowledge infer many things, which we may adequately know, and we may form that third kind of knowledge of which we spoke in the note to 2. xl., and of the excellence and use of which we shall have occasion to speak in Part 5.  Men have not so clear a knowledge of God as they have of general notions, because they are unable to imagine God as they do bodies, and also because they have associated the name God with images of things that they are in the habit of seeing, as indeed they can hardly avoid doing, being, as they are, men, and continually affected by external bodies.  Many errors, in truth, can be traced to this head, namely, that we do not apply names to things rightly.  For instance, when a man says that the lines drawn from the centre of a circle to its circumference are not equal, he then, at all events, assuredly attaches a meaning to the word circle different from that assigned by mathematicians.  So again, when men make mistakes in calculation, they have one set of figures in their mind, and another on the paper.  If we could see into their minds, they do not make a mistake; they seem to do so, because we think, that they have the same numbers in their mind as they have on the paper.  If this were not so, we should not believe them to be in error, any more than I thought that a man was in error, whom I lately heard exclaiming that his entrance hall had flown into a neighbour's hen, for his meaning seemed to me sufficiently clear.  Very many controversies have arisen from the fact, that men do not rightly explain their meaning, or do not rightly interpret the meaning of others.  For, as a matter of fact, as they flatly contradict themselves, they assume now one side, now another, of the argument, so as to oppose the opinions, which they consider mistaken and absurd in their opponents.</p>

      <p>PROP. 48.  In the mind there is no absolute or free will; but the mind is determined to wish this or that by a cause, which has also been determined by another cause, and this last by another cause, and so on to infinity.</p>

      <p>Proof &mdash; The mind is a fixed and definite mode of thought (2.  xi.), therefore it cannot be the free cause of its actions (1.  xvii. Coroll. ii.); in other words, it cannot have an absolute faculty of positive or negative volition; but (by 1. xxviii.) it must be determined by a cause, which has also been determined by another cause, and this last by another, &amp;c.  Q.E.D.</p>

      <p>Note &mdash; In the same way it is proved, that there is in the mind no absolute faculty of understanding, desiring, loving, &amp;c.  Whence it follows, that these and similar faculties are either entirely fictitious, or are merely abstract and general terms, such as we are accustomed to put together from particular things.  Thus the intellect and the will stand in the same relation to this or that idea, or this or that volition, as "lapidity" to this or that stone, or as "man" to Peter and Paul.  The cause which leads men to consider themselves free has been set forth in the Appendix to Part 1.  But, before I proceed further, I would here remark that, by the will to affirm and decide, I mean the faculty, not the desire.  I mean, I repeat, the faculty, whereby the mind affirms or denies what is true or false, not the desire, wherewith the mind wishes for or turns away from any given thing.  After we have proved, that these faculties of ours are general notions, which cannot be distinguished from the particular instances on which they are based, we must inquire whether volitions themselves are anything besides the ideas of things.  We must inquire, I say, whether there is in the mind any affirmation or negation beyond that, which the idea, in so far as it is an idea, involves.  On which subject see the following proposition, and 2. Def. iii., lest the idea of pictures should suggest itself.  For by ideas I do not mean images such as are formed at the back of the eye, or in the midst of the brain, but the conceptions of thought.</p>

      <p>PROP. 49.  There is in the mind no volition or affirmation and negation, save that which an idea, inasmuch as it is an idea, involves.</p>

      <p>Proof &mdash; There is in the mind no absolute faculty of positive or negative volition, but only particular volitions, namely, this or that affirmation, and this or that negation.  Now let us conceive a particular volition, namely, the mode of thinking whereby the mind affirms, that the three interior angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles.  This affirmation involves the conception or idea of a triangle, that is, without the idea of a triangle it cannot be conceived.  It is the same thing to say, that the concept A must involve the concept B, as it is to say, that A cannot be conceived without B.  Further, this affirmation cannot be made (2. Ax. iii.) without the idea of a triangle.  Therefore, this affirmation can neither be nor be conceived, without the idea of a triangle.  Again, this idea of a triangle must involve this same affirmation, namely, that its three interior angles are equal to two right angles.  Wherefore, and vice versâ, this idea of a triangle can neither be nor be conceived without this affirmation, therefore, this affirmation belongs to the essence of the idea of a triangle, and is nothing besides.  What we have said of this volition (inasmuch as we have selected it at random) may be said of any other volition, namely, that it is nothing but an idea.  Q.E.D.</p>

      <p>Corollary &mdash; Will and understanding are one and the same.</p>

      <p>Proof &mdash; Will and understanding are nothing beyond the individual volitions and ideas (2. xlviii. and note).  But a particular volition and a particular idea are one and the same (by the foregoing Prop.); therefore, will and understanding are one and the same.  Q.E.D.</p>

      <p>Note &mdash; We have thus removed the cause which is commonly assigned for error.  For we have shown above, that falsity consists solely in the privation of knowledge involved in ideas which are fragmentary and confused.  Wherefore, a false idea, inasmuch as it is false, does not involve certainty.  When we say, then, that a man acquiesces in what is false, and that he has no doubts on the subject, we do not say that he is certain, but only that he does not doubt, or that he acquiesces in what is false, inasmuch as there are no reasons, which should cause his imagination to waver (see 2. xliv. note).  Thus, although the man be assumed to acquiesce in what is false, we shall never say that he is certain.  For by certainty we mean something positive (2. xliii. and note), not merely the absence of doubt.</p>

      <p>However, in order that the foregoing proposition may be fully explained, I will draw attention to a few additional points, and I will furthermore answer the objections which may be advanced against our doctrine.  Lastly, in order to remove every scruple, I have thought it worth while to point out some of the advantages, which follow therefrom.  I say "some," for they will be better appreciated from what we shall set forth in the fifth part.</p>

      <p>I begin, then, with the first point, and warn my readers to make an accurate distinction between an idea, or conception of the mind, and the images of things which we imagine.  It is further necessary that they should distinguish between idea and words, whereby we signify things.  These three&mdash;namely, images, words, and ideas&mdash;are by many persons either entirely confused together, or not distinguished with sufficient accuracy or care, and hence people are generally in ignorance, how absolutely necessary is a knowledge of this doctrine of the will, both for philosophic purposes and for the wise ordering of life.  Those who think that ideas consist in images which are formed in us by contact with external bodies, persuade themselves that the ideas of those things, whereof we can form no mental picture, are not ideas, but only figments, which we invent by the free decree of our will; they thus regard ideas as though they were inanimate pictures on a panel, and, filled with this misconception, do not see that an idea, inasmuch as it is an idea, involves an affirmation or negation.  Again, those who confuse words with ideas, or with the affirmation which an idea involves, think that they can wish something contrary to what they feel, affirm, or deny.  This misconception will easily be laid aside by one, who reflects on the nature of knowledge, and seeing that it in no wise involves the conception of extension, will therefore clearly understand, that an idea (being a mode of thinking) does not consist in the image of anything, nor in words.  The essence of words and images is put together by bodily motions, which in no wise involve the conception of thought.</p>


      <p>These few words on this subject will suffice: I will therefore pass on to consider the objections, which may be raised against our doctrine.  Of these, the first is advanced by those, who think that the will has a wider scope than the understanding, and that therefore it is different therefrom.  The reason for their holding the belief, that the will has wider scope than the understanding, is that they assert, that they have no need of an increase in their faculty of assent, that is of affirmation or negation, in order to assent to an infinity of things which we do not perceive, but that they have need of an increase in their faculty of understanding.  The will is thus distinguished from the intellect, the latter being finite and the former infinite.  Secondly, it may be objected that experience seems to teach us especially clearly, that we are able to suspend our judgment before assenting to things which we perceive; this is confirmed by the fact that no one is said to be deceived, in so far as he perceives anything, but only in so far as he assents or dissents.</p>

      <p>For instance, he who feigns a winged horse, does not therefore admit that a winged horse exists; that is, he is not deceived, unless he admits in addition that a winged horse does exist.  Nothing therefore seems to be taught more clearly by experience, than that the will or faculty of assent is free and different from the faculty of understanding.  Thirdly, it may be objected that one affirmation does not apparently contain more reality than another; in other words, that we do not seem to need for affirming, that what is true is true, any greater power than for affirming, that what is false is true.  We have, however, seen that one idea has more reality or perfection than another, for as objects are some more excellent than others, so also are the ideas of them some more excellent than others; this also seems to point to a difference between the understanding and the will.  Fourthly, it may be objected, if man does not act from free will, what will happen if the incentives to action are equally balanced, as in the case of Buridan's ass?  Will he perish of hunger and thirst?  If I say that he would, I shall seem to have in my thoughts an ass or the statue of a man rather than an actual man.  If I say that he would not, he would then determine his own action, and would consequently possess the faculty of going and doing whatever he liked.  Other objections might also be raised, but, as I am not bound to put in evidence everything that anyone may dream, I will only set myself to the task of refuting those I have mentioned, and that as briefly as possible.</p>

      <p>To the first objection I answer, that I admit that the will has a wider scope than the understanding, if by the understanding be meant only clear and distinct ideas; but I deny that the will has a wider scope than the perceptions, and the faculty of forming conceptions; nor do I see why the faculty of volition should be called infinite, any more than the faculty of feeling: for, as we are able by the same faculty of volition to affirm an infinite number of things (one after the other, for we cannot affirm an infinite number simultaneously), so also can we, by the same faculty of feeling, feel or perceive (in succession) an infinite number of bodies.  If it be said that there is an infinite number of things which we cannot perceive, I answer, that we cannot attain to such things by any thinking, nor, consequently, by any faculty of volition.  But, it may still be urged, if God wished to bring it about that we should perceive them, he would be obliged to endow us with a greater faculty of perception, but not a greater faculty of volition than we have already.  This is the same as to say that, if God wished to bring it about that we should understand an infinite number of other entities, it would be necessary for him to give us a greater understanding, but not a more universal idea of entity than that which we have already, in order to grasp such infinite entities.  We have shown that will is a universal entity or idea, whereby we explain all particular volitions&mdash;in other words, that which is common to all such volitions.</p>

      <p>As, then, our opponents maintain that this idea, common or universal to all volitions, is a faculty, it is little to be wondered at that they assert, that such a faculty extends itself into the infinite, beyond the limits of the understanding: for what is universal is predicated alike of one, of many, and of an infinite number of individuals.</p>

      <p>To the second objection I reply by denying, that we have a free power of suspending our judgment: for, when we say that anyone suspends his judgment, we merely mean that he sees, that he does not perceive the matter in question adequately.  Suspension of judgment is, therefore, strictly speaking, a perception, and not free will.  In order to illustrate the point, let us suppose a boy imagining a horse, and perceive nothing else.  Inasmuch as this imagination involves the existence of the horse (2. xvii. Coroll.), and the boy does not perceive anything which would exclude the existence of the horse, he will necessarily regard the horse as present: he will not be able to doubt of its existence, although he be not certain thereof.  We have daily experience of such a state of things in dreams; and I do not suppose that there is anyone, who would maintain that, while he is dreaming, he has the free power of suspending his judgment concerning the things in his dream, and bringing it about that he should not dream those things, which he dreams that he sees; yet it happens, notwithstanding, that even in dreams we suspend our judgment, namely, when we dream that we are dreaming.</p>

      <p>Further, I grant that no one can be deceived, so far as actual perception extends&mdash;that is, I grant that the mind's imaginations, regarded in themselves, do not involve error (2.  xvii. note); but I deny, that a man does not, in the act of perception, make any affirmation.  For what is the perception of a winged horse, save affirming that a horse has wings?  If the mind could perceive nothing else but the winged horse, it would regard the same as present to itself: it would have no reasons for doubting its existence, nor any faculty of dissent, unless the imagination of a winged horse be joined to an idea which precludes the existence of the said horse, or unless the mind perceives that the idea which it possess of a winged horse is inadequate, in which case it will either necessarily deny the existence of such a horse, or will necessarily be in doubt on the subject.</p>

      <p>I think that I have anticipated my answer to the third objection, namely, that the will is something universal which is predicated of all ideas, and that it only signifies that which is common to all ideas, namely, an affirmation, whose adequate essence must, therefore, in so far as it is thus conceived in the abstract, be in every idea, and be, in this respect alone, the same in all, not in so far as it is considered as constituting the idea's essence: for, in this respect, particular affirmations differ one from the other, as much as do ideas.  For instance, the affirmation which involves the idea of a circle, differs from that which involves the idea of a triangle, as much as the idea of a circle differs from the idea of a triangle.</p>

      <p>Further, I absolutely deny, that we are in need of an equal power of thinking, to affirm that that which is true is true, and to affirm that that which is false is true.  These two affirmations, if we regard the mind, are in the same relation to one another as being and not&mdash;being; for there is nothing positive in ideas, which constitutes the actual reality of falsehood (2. xxxv. note, and xlvii. note).</p>

      <p>We must therefore conclude, that we are easily deceived, when we confuse universals with singulars, and the entities of reason and abstractions with realities.  As for the fourth objection, I am quite ready to admit, that a man placed in the equilibrium described  (namely, as perceiving nothing but hunger and thirst, a certain food and a certain drink, each equally distant from him) would die of hunger and thirst.  If I am asked, whether such an one should not rather be considered an ass than a man; I answer, that I do not know, neither do I know how a man should be considered, who hangs himself, or how we should consider children, fools, madmen, &amp;c.</p>

      <p>It remains to point out the advantages of a knowledge of this doctrine as bearing on conduct, and this may be easily gathered from what has been said.  The doctrine is good, </p>

      <p>1. Inasmuch as it teaches us to act solely according to the decree of God, and to be partakers in the Divine nature, and so much the more, as we perform more perfect actions and more and more understand God.  Such a doctrine not only completely tranquilizes our spirit, but also shows us where our highest happiness or blessedness is, namely, solely in the knowledge of God, whereby we are led to act only as love and piety shall bid us.  We may thus clearly understand, how far astray from a true estimate of virtue are those who expect to be decorated by God with high rewards for their virtue, and their best actions, as for having endured the direst slavery; as if virtue and the service of God were not in itself happiness and perfect freedom.</p>

      <p>2. Inasmuch as it teaches us, how we ought to conduct ourselves with respect to the gifts of fortune, or matters which are not in our power, and do not follow from our nature.  For it shows us, that we should await and endure fortune's smiles or frowns with an equal mind, seeing that all things follow from the eternal decree of God by the same necessity, as it follows from the essence of a triangle, that the three angles are equal to two right angles.</p>

      <p>3. This doctrine raises social life, inasmuch as it teaches us to hate no man, neither to despise, to deride, to envy, or to be angry with any.  Further, as it tells us that each should be content with his own, and helpful to his neighbour, not from any womanish pity, favour, or superstition, but solely by the guidance of reason, according as the time and occasion demand, as I will show in Part 3.</p>

      <p>4. Lastly, this doctrine confers no small advantage on the commonwealth; for it teaches how citizens should be governed and led, not so as to become slaves, but so that they may freely do whatsoever things are best.</p>

      <p>I have thus fulfilled the promise made at the beginning of this note, and I thus bring the second part of my treatise to a close.  I think I have therein explained the nature and properties of the human mind at sufficient length, and, considering the difficulty of the subject, with sufficient clearness.  I have laid a foundation, whereon may be raised many excellent conclusions of the highest utility and most necessary to be known, as will, in what follows, be partly made plain.</p>

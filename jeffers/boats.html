<h1>Boats in a Fog</h1>
<h2>by Robinson Jeffers</h2>
<p>
Sports and gallantries, the stage, the arts, the antics of dancers,<br/>
The exuberant voices of music,<br/>
Have charm for children but lack nobility; it is bitter earnestness<br/>
That makes beauty; the mind<br/>
Knows, grown adult.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
A sudden fog-drift muffled the ocean,<br/>
A throbbing of engines moved in it,<br/>
At length, a stone's throw out, between the rocks and the vapor,<br/>
One by one moved shadows<br/>
Out of the mystery, shadows, fishing-boats, trailing each other<br/>
Following the cliff for guidance,<br/>
Holding a difficult path between the peril of the sea-fog<br/>
And the foam on the shore granite.<br/>
One by one, trailing their leader, six crept by me,<br/>
Out of the vapor and into it,<br/>
The throb of their engines subdued by the fog, patient and cautious,<br/>
Coasting all round the peninsula<br/>
Back to the buoys in Monterey harbor. A flight of pelicans<br/>
Is nothing lovelier to look at;<br/>
The flight of the planets is nothing nobler; all the arts lose virtue<br/>
Against the essential reality<br/>
Of creatures going about their business among the equally<br/>
Earnest elements of nature.

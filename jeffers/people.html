<h1>People and a Heron</h1>
<h2>by Robinson Jeffers</h2>
<p>
A desert of weed and water-darkened stone under my western windows<br/>
The ebb lasted all afternoon,<br/>
And many pieces of humanity, men, women, and children, gathering shellfish,<br/>
Swarmed with voices of gulls the sea-breach.<br/>
At twilight they went off together, the verge was left vacant, an evening heron<br/>
Bent broad wings over the black ebb,<br/>
And left me wondering why a lone bird was dearer to me than many people.<br/>
Well: rare is dear: but also I suppose<br/>
Well reconciled with the world but not with our own natures we grudge to see them<br/>
Reflected on the world for a mirror.

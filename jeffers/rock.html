<h1>To the Rock That Will Be a Cornerstone of the House</h1>
<h2>by Robinson Jeffers</h2>
<p>
Old garden of grayish and ochre lichen,<br/>
How long a rime since the brown people who have vanished from here<br/>
Built fires beside you and nestled by you<br/>
Out of the ranging sea-wind? A hundred years, two hundred,<br/>
You have been dissevered from humanity<br/>
And only known the stubble squirrels and the headland rabbits,<br/>
Or the long-fetlocked plowhorses<br/>
Breaking the hilltop in December, sea-gulls following,<br/>
Screaming in the black furrow; no one<br/>
Touched you with love, the gray hawk and the red hawk touched you<br/>
Where now my hand lies. So I have brought you<br/>
Wine and white milk and honey for the hundred years of famine<br/>
And the hundred cold ages of sea-wind.
</p>
<p>
I did not dream the taste of wine could bind with granite,<br/>
Nor honey and milk please you; but sweetly<br/>
They mingle down the storm-worn cracks among the mosses,<br/>
Interpenetrating the silent<br/>
Wing-prints of ancient weathers long at peace, and the older<br/>
Scars of primal fire, and the stone<br/>
Endurance that is waiting millions of years to carry<br/>
A corner of the house, this also destined.<br/>
Lend me the stone strength of the past and I will lend you<br/>
The wings of the future, for I have them.<br/>
How dear you will be to me when I too grow old, old comrade.

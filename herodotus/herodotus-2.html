<h2>
      BOOK V. THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED TERPSICHORE
    </h2>
<p>
      1. In the meantime those of the Persians who had been left behind in
      Europe by Dareios, of whom Megabazos was the commander, had subdued the
      people of Perinthos first of the Hellespontians, since they refused to be
      subject to Dareios. These had in former times also been hardly dealt with
      by the Paionians: for the Paionians from the Strymon had been commanded by
      an oracle of their god to march against the Perinthians; and if the
      Perinthians, when encamped opposite to them, should shout aloud and call
      to them by their name, they were to attack them; but if they should not
      shout to them, they were not to attack them: and thus the Paionians
      proceeded to do. Now when the Perinthians were encamped opposite to them
      in the suburb of their city, a challenge was made and a single combat took
      place in three different forms; for they matched a man against a man, and
      a horse against a horse, and a dog against a dog. Then, as the Perinthians
      were getting the better in two of the three, in their exultation they
      raised a shout of <i>paion</i>, <a href="#linknote-1" id="linknoteref-1" class="pginternal">1</a> and the Paionians conjectured that this was the
      very thing which was spoken of in the oracle, and said doubtless to one
      another, "Now surely the oracle is being accomplished for us, now it is
      time for us to act." So the Paionians attacked the Perinthians when they
      had raised the shout of paion, and they had much the better in the fight,
      and left but few of them alive.
    </p>
<p>
      2. Thus it happened with respect to those things which had been done to
      them in former times by the Paionians; and at this time, although the
      Perinthians proved themselves brave men in defence of their freedom, the
      Persians and Megabazos got the better of them by numbers. Then after
      Perinthos had been conquered, Megabazos marched his army through the
      length of Thracia, forcing every city and every race of those who dwell
      there to submit to the king, for so it had been commanded him by Dareios,
      to subdue Thracia.
    </p>
<p>
      3. Now the Thracian race is the most numerous, except the Indians, in all
      the world: and if it should come to be ruled over by one man, or to agree
      together in one, it would be irresistible in fight and the strongest by
      far of all nations, in my opinion. Since however this is impossible for
      them and cannot ever come to pass among them, <a href="#linknote-2" id="linknoteref-2" class="pginternal">2</a> they are in fact weak for
      that reason. They have many names, belonging to their various tribes in
      different places; but they all follow customs which are nearly the same in
      all respects, except the Getai and Trausians and those who dwell above the
      Crestonians.
    </p>
<p>
      4. Of these the practices of the Getai, who believe themselves to be
      immortal, have been spoken of by me already: <a href="#linknote-3" id="linknoteref-3" class="pginternal">3</a> and the Trausians perform
      everything else in the same manner as the other Thracians, but in regard
      to those who are born and die among them they do as follows:—when a
      child has been born, the nearest of kin sit round it and make lamentation
      for all the evils of which he must fulfil the measure, now that he is
      born, <a href="#linknote-301" id="linknoteref-301" class="pginternal">301</a>
      enumerating the whole number of human ills; but when a man is dead, they
      cover him up in the earth with sport and rejoicing, saying at the same
      time from what great evils he has escaped and is now in perfect bliss.
    </p>
<p>
      5. Those who dwell above the Crestonians do as follows:—each man has
      many wives, and when any man of them is dead, a great competition takes
      place among his wives, with much exertion on the part of their friends,
      about the question of which of them was most loved by their husband; and
      she who is preferred by the decision and so honoured, is first praised by
      both men and women, then her throat is cut over the tomb by her nearest of
      kin, and afterwards she is buried together with her husband; and the
      others are exceedingly grieved at it, for this is counted as the greatest
      reproach to them.
    </p>
<p>
      6. Of the other Thracians the custom is to sell their children to be
      carried away out of the country; and over their maidens they do not keep
      watch, but allow them to have commerce with whatever men they please, but
      over their wives they keep very great watch; and they buy their wives for
      great sums of money from their parents. To be pricked with figures is
      accounted a mark of noble rank, and not to be so marked is a sign of low
      birth. <a href="#linknote-4" id="linknoteref-4" class="pginternal">4</a>
      Not to work is counted most honourable, and to be a worker of the soil is
      above all things dishonourable: to live on war and plunder is the most
      honourable thing.
    </p>
<p>
      7. These are their most remarkable customs; and of the gods they worship
      only Ares and Dionysos and Artemis. Their kings, however, apart from the
      rest of the people, worship Hermes more than all gods, and swear by him
      alone; and they say that they are descended from Hermes. 8. The manner of
      burial for the rich among them is this:—for three days they expose
      the corpse to view, and they slay all kinds of victims and feast, having
      first made lamentation. Then they perform the burial rites, either
      consuming the body with fire or covering it up in the earth without
      burning; and afterwards when they have heaped up a mound they celebrate
      games with every kind of contest, in which reasonably the greatest prizes
      are assigned for single combat. <a href="#linknote-5" id="linknoteref-5" class="pginternal">5</a> This is the manner of burial among the Thracians.
    </p>
<p>
      9. Of the region lying further on towards the North of this country no one
      can declare accurately who the men are who dwell in it; but the parts
      which lie immediately beyond the Ister are known to be uninhabited and
      vast in extent. The only men of whom I can hear who dwell beyond the Ister
      are those who are said to be called Sigynnai, and who use the Median
      fashion of dress. Their horses, it is said, have shaggy hair all over
      their bodies, as much as five fingers long; and these are small and
      flat-nosed and too weak to carry men, but when yoked in chariots they are
      very high-spirited; therefore the natives of the country drive chariots.
      The boundaries of this people extend, it is said, to the parts near the
      Enetoi, who live on the Adriatic; and people say that they are colonists
      from the Medes. In what way however these have come to be colonists from
      the Medes I am not able for my part to conceive, but everything is
      possible in the long course of ages. However that may be, the Ligurians
      who dwell in the region inland above Massalia call traders <i>sigynnai</i>,
      and the men of Cyprus give the same name to spears.
    </p>
<p>
      10. Now the Thracians say that the other side of the Ister is occupied by
      bees, and that by reason of them it is not possible to pass through and
      proceed further: but to me it seems that when they so speak, they say that
      which is not probable; for these creatures are known to be intolerant of
      cold, and to me it seems that the regions which go up towards the pole are
      uninhabitable by reason of the cold climate. These then are the tales
      reported about this country; and however that may be, Megabazos was then
      making the coast-regions of it subject to the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      11. Meanwhile Dareios, so soon as he had crossed over the Hellespont and
      come to Sardis, called to mind the service rendered to him by Histiaios
      the Milesian and also the advice of the Mytilenian Coës, and having sent
      for them to come to Sardis he offered them a choice of rewards. Histiaios
      then, being despot of Miletos, did not make request for any government in
      addition to that, but he asked for the district of Myrkinos which belonged
      to the Edonians, desiring there to found a city. Histiaios chose this for
      himself; but Coës, not being a despot but a man of the people, asked to be
      made despot of Mitylene.
    </p>
<p>
      12. After the desires of both had been fulfilled, they betook themselves
      to that which they had chosen: and at this same time it chanced that
      Dareios saw a certain thing which made him desire to command Megabazos to
      conquer the Paionians and remove them forcibly from Europe into Asia: and
      the thing was this:—There were certain Paionians named Pigres and
      Mantyas, who when Dareios had crossed over into Asia, came to Sardis,
      because they desired themselves to have rule over the Paionians, and with
      them they brought their sister, who was tall and comely. Then having
      watched for a time when Dareios took his seat publicly in the suburb of
      the Lydian city, they dressed up their sister in the best way they could,
      and sent her to fetch water, having a water-jar upon her head and leading
      a horse after her by a bridle round her arm, and at the same time spinning
      flax. Now when the woman passed out of the city by him, Dareios paid
      attention to the matter, for that which was done by the woman was not of
      Persian nor yet of Lydian fashion, nor indeed after the manner of any
      people of Asia. He sent therefore some of his spearmen, bidding them watch
      what the woman would do with the horse. They accordingly followed after
      her; and she having arrived at the river watered the horse, and having
      watered him and filled her jar with the water, she passed along by the
      same way, bearing the water upon her head, leading the horse after her by
      a bridle round her arm, and at the same time turning the spindle.
    </p>
<p>
      13. Then Dareios, marvelling both at that which he heard from those who
      went to observe and also at that which he saw himself, bade them bring her
      into his presence: and when she was brought, her brothers also came, who
      had been watching these things at no great distance off. So then when
      Dareios asked of what country she was, the young men said that they were
      Paionians and that she was their sister; and he replied: "Who then are
      these Paionians, and where upon the earth do they dwell?" and he asked
      them also what they desired, that they had come to Sardis. They declared
      to him that they had come to give themselves up to him, and that Paionia
      was a country situated upon the river Strymon, and that the Strymon was
      not far from the Hellespont, and finally that they were colonists from the
      Teucrians of Troy. All these things severally they told him; and he asked
      whether all the women of that land were as industrious as their sister;
      and they very readily replied to this also, saying that it was so, for it
      was with a view to that very thing that they had been doing this.
    </p>
<p>
      14. Then Dareios wrote a letter to Megabazos, whom he had left to command
      his army in Thrace, bidding him remove the Paionians from their place of
      habitation and bring them to the king, both themselves and their children
      and their wives. Then forthwith a horseman set forth to ride in haste
      bearing the message to the Hellespont, and having passed over to the other
      side he gave the paper to Megabazos. So he having read it and having
      obtained guides from Thrace, set forth to march upon Paionia:
    </p>
<p>
      15. and the Paionians, being informed that the Persians were coming
      against them, gathered all their powers together and marched out in the
      direction of the sea, supposing that the Persians when they invaded them
      would make their attack on that side. The Paionians then were prepared, as
      I say, to drive off the army of Megabazos when it came against them; but
      the Persians hearing that the Paionians had gathered their powers and were
      guarding the entrance which lay towards the sea, directed their course
      with guides along the upper road; and passing unperceived by the Paionians
      they fell upon their cities, which were left without men, and finding them
      without defenders they easily took possession of them. The Paionians when
      they heard that their cities were in the hands of the enemy, at once
      dispersed, each tribe to its own place of abode, and proceeded to deliver
      themselves up to the Persians. Thus then it happened that these tribes of
      the Paionians, namely the Siropaionians, <a href="#linknote-6" id="linknoteref-6" class="pginternal">6</a> the Paioplians and all up to
      the lake Prasias, were removed from their place of habitation and brought
      to Asia;
    </p>
<p>
      16, but those who dwell about mount Pangaion, and about the Doberians and
      Agrianians and Odomantians, <a href="#linknote-7" id="linknoteref-7" class="pginternal">7</a> and about the lake Prasias itself, were not
      conquered at all by Megabazos. He tried however to remove even those who
      lived in the lake and who had their dwellings in the following manner:—a
      platform fastened together and resting upon lofty piles stood in the
      middle of the water of the lake, with a narrow approach to it from the
      mainland by a single bridge. The piles which supported the platform were
      no doubt originally set there by all the members of the community working
      together, but since that time they continue to set them by observance of
      this rule, that is to say, every man who marries brings from the mountain
      called Orbelos three piles for each wife and sets them as supports; and
      each man takes to himself many wives. And they have their dwelling thus,
      that is each man has possession of a hut upon the platform in which he
      lives and of a trap-door <a href="#linknote-8" id="linknoteref-8" class="pginternal">8</a> leading through the platform down to the lake:
      and their infant children they tie with a rope by the foot, for fear that
      they should roll into the water. To their horses and beasts of burden they
      give fish for fodder; and of fish there is so great quantity that if a man
      open the trap-door and let down an empty basket by a cord into the lake,
      after waiting quite a short time he draws it up again full of fish. Of the
      fish there are two kinds, and they call them <i>paprax</i> and <i>tilon</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      17. So then those of the Paionians who had been conquered were being
      brought to Asia: and Megabazos meanwhile, after he had conquered the
      Paionians, sent as envoys to Macedonia seven Persians, who after himself
      were the men of most repute in the army. These were being sent to Amyntas
      to demand of him earth and water for Dareios the king. Now from lake
      Prasias there is a very short way into Macedonia; for first, quite close
      to the lake, there is the mine from which after this time there came in
      regularly a talent of silver every day to Alexander; and after the mine,
      when you have passed over the mountain called Dysoron, you are in
      Macedonia.
    </p>
<p>
      18. These Persians then, who had been sent to Amyntas, having arrived came
      into the presence of Amyntas and proceeded to demand earth and water for
      king Dareios. This he was willing to give, and also he invited them to be
      his guests; and he prepared a magnificent dinner and received the Persians
      with friendly hospitality. Then when dinner was over, the Persians while
      drinking pledges to one another <a href="#linknote-9" id="linknoteref-9" class="pginternal">9</a> said thus: "Macedonian guest-friend, it is the
      custom among us Persians, when we set forth a great dinner, then to bring
      in also our concubines and lawful wives to sit beside us. Do thou then,
      since thou didst readily receive us and dost now entertain us
      magnificently as thy guests, and since thou art willing to give to king
      Dareios earth and water, consent to follow our custom." To this Amyntas
      replied: "Persians, among us the custom is not so, but that men should be
      separate from women. Since however ye being our masters make this request
      in addition, this also shall be given you." Having so said Amyntas
      proceeded to send for the women; and when they came being summoned, they
      sat down in order opposite to the Persians. Then the Persians, seeing
      women of comely form, spoke to Amyntas and said that this which had been
      done was by no means well devised; for it was better that the women should
      not come at all, than that they should come and should not seat themselves
      by their side, but sit opposite and be a pain to their eyes. So Amyntas
      being compelled bade them sit by the side of the Persians; and when the
      women obeyed, forthwith the Persians, being much intoxicated, began to
      touch their breasts, and some no doubt also tried to kiss them.
    </p>
<p>
      19. Amyntas seeing this kept quiet, notwithstanding that he felt anger,
      because he excessively feared the Persians; but Alexander the son of
      Amyntas, who was present and saw this, being young and without experience
      of calamity was not able to endure any longer; but being impatient of it
      he said to Amyntas: "My father, do thou grant that which thy age demands,
      and go away to rest, nor persevere longer in the drinking; but I will
      remain here and give to our guests all that is convenient." On this
      Amyntas, understanding that Alexander was intending to do some violence,
      said: "My son, I think that I understand thy words, as the heat of anger
      moves thee, namely that thou desirest to send me away and then do some
      deed of violence: therefore I ask of thee not to do violence to these men,
      that it may not be our ruin, but endure to see that which is being done:
      as to my departure, however, in that I will do as thou sayest."
    </p>
<p>
      20. When Amyntas after having made of him this request had departed,
      Alexander said to the Persians: "With these women ye have perfect freedom,
      guests, to have commerce with all, if ye so desire, or with as many of
      them as ye will. About this matter ye shall be they who give the word; but
      now, since already the hour is approaching for you to go to bed and I see
      that ye have well drunk, let these women go away, if so it is pleasing to
      you, to bathe themselves; and when they have bathed, then receive them
      back into your company." Having so said, since the Persians readily
      agreed, he dismissed the women, when they had gone out, to the women's
      chambers; and Alexander himself equipped men equal in number to the women
      and smooth-faced, in the dress of the women, and giving them daggers he
      led them into the banqueting-room; and as he led them in, he said thus to
      the Persians: "Persians, it seems to me that ye have been entertained with
      a feast to which nothing was wanting; for other things, as many as we had,
      and moreover such as we were able to find out and furnish, are all
      supplied to you, and there is this especially besides, which is the chief
      thing of all, that is, we give you freely in addition our mothers and our
      sisters, in order that ye may perceive fully that ye are honoured by us
      with that treatment which ye deserve, and also in order that ye may report
      to the king who sent you that a man of Hellas, ruler under him of the
      Macedonians, entertained you well at board and bed." Having thus said
      Alexander caused a Macedonian man in the guise of a woman to sit by each
      Persian, and they, when the Persians attempted to lay hands on them, slew
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      21. So these perished by this fate, both they themselves and their company
      of servants; for there came with them carriages and servants and all the
      usual pomp of equipage, and this was all made away with at the same time
      as they. Afterwards in no long time a great search was made by the
      Persians for these men, and Alexander stopped them with cunning by giving
      large sums of money and his own sister, whose name was Gygaia;—by
      giving, I say, these things to Bubares a Persian, commander of those who
      were searching for the men who had been killed, Alexander stopped their
      search.
    </p>
<p>
      22. Thus the death of these Persians was kept concealed. And that these
      descendants of Perdiccas are Hellenes, as they themselves say, I happen to
      know myself, and not only so, but I will prove in the succeeding history
      that they are Hellenes. <a href="#linknote-10" id="linknoteref-10" class="pginternal">10</a> Moreover the Hellanodicai, who manage the games
      at Olympia, decided that they were so: for when Alexander wished to
      contend in the games and had descended for this purpose into the arena,
      the Hellenes who were to run against him tried to exclude him, saying that
      the contest was not for Barbarians to contend in but for Hellenes: since
      however Alexander proved that he was of Argos, he was judged to be a
      Hellene, and when he entered the contest of the foot-race his lot came out
      with that of the first. <a href="#linknote-11" id="linknoteref-11" class="pginternal">11</a>
</p>
<p>
      23. Thus then it happened with regard to these things: and at the same
      time Megabazos had arrived at the Hellespont bringing with him the
      Paionians; and thence after passing over the straits he came to Sardis.
      Then, since Histiaios the Milesian was already engaged in fortifying with
      a wall the place which he had asked and obtained from Dareios as a reward
      for keeping safe the bridge of boats (this place being that which is
      called Myrkinos, lying along the bank of the river Strymon), Megabazos,
      having perceived that which was being done by Histiaios, as soon as he
      came to Sardis bringing the Paionians, said thus to Dareios: "O king, what
      a thing is this that thou hast done, granting permission to a Hellene who
      is skilful and cunning to found a city in Thracia in a place where there
      is forest for shipbuilding in abundance and great quantity of wood for
      oars and mines of silver and great numbers both of Hellenes and Barbarians
      living round, who when they have obtained a leader will do that which he
      shall command them both by day and by night. Therefore stop this man from
      doing so, that thou be not involved in a domestic war: and stop him by
      sending for him in a courteous manner; but when thou hast got him in thy
      hands, then cause that he shall never again return to the land of the
      Hellenes.".
    </p>
<p>
      24. Thus saying Megabazos easily persuaded Dareios, who thought that he
      was a true prophet of that which was likely to come to pass: and upon that
      Dareios sent a messenger to Myrkinos and said as follows: "Hisiaios, king
      Dareios saith these things:—By taking thought I find that there is
      no one more sincerely well disposed than thou art to me and to my power;
      and this I know having learnt by deeds not words. Now therefore, since I
      have it in my mind to accomplish great matters, come hither to me by all
      means, that I may communicate them to thee." Histiaios therefore, trusting
      to these sayings and at the same time accounting it a great thing to
      become a counsellor of the king, came to Sardis; and when he had come
      Dareios spoke to him as follows: "Histiaios, I sent for thee for this
      reason, namely because when I had returned from the Scythians and thou
      wert gone away out of the sight of my eyes, never did I desire to see
      anything again within so short a time as I desired then both to see thee
      and that thou shouldst come to speech with me; since I perceived that the
      most valuable of all possessions is a friend who is a man of understanding
      and also sincerely well-disposed, both which qualities I know exist in
      thee, and I am able to bear witness of them in regard to my affairs. Now
      therefore (for thou didst well in that thou camest hither) this is that
      which I propose to thee:—leave Miletos alone and also thy
      newly-founded city in Thracia, and coming with me to Susa, have whatsoever
      things I have, eating at my table and being my counseller.".
    </p>
<p>
      25. Thus said Dareios, and having appointed Artaphrenes <a href="#linknote-12" id="linknoteref-12" class="pginternal">12</a> his
      own brother and the son of his father to be governor of Sardis, he marched
      away to Susa taking with him Histiaios, after he had first named Otanes to
      be commander of those who dwelt along the sea coasts. This man's father
      Sisamnes, who had been made one of the Royal Judges, king Cambyses slew,
      because he had judged a cause unjustly for money, and flayed off all his
      skin: then after he had torn away the skin he cut leathern thongs out of
      it and stretched them across the seat where Sisamnes had been wont to sit
      to give judgment; and having stretched them in the seat, Cambyses
      appointed the son of that Sisamnes whom he had slain and flayed, to be
      judge instead of his father, enjoining him to remember in what seat he was
      sitting to give judgment..
    </p>
<p>
      26. This Otanes then, who was made to sit in that seat, had now become the
      successor of Megabazos in the command: and he conquered the Byzantians and
      Calchedonians, and he conquered Antandros in the land of Troas, and
      Lamponion; and having received ships from the Lesbians he conquered Lemnos
      and Imbros, which were both at that time still inhabited by Pelasgians..
    </p>
<p>
      27. Of these the Lemnians fought well, and defending themselves for a long
      time were at length brought to ruin; <a href="#linknote-13" id="linknoteref-13" class="pginternal">13</a> and over those of them
      who survived the Persians set as governor Lycaretos the brother of that
      Maiandrios who had been king of Samos. This Lycaretos ruled in Lemnos till
      his death. And the cause of it <a href="#linknote-14" id="linknoteref-14" class="pginternal">14</a> was this:—he continued to reduce all to
      slavery and subdue them, accusing some of desertion to the Scythians and
      others of doing damage to the army of Dareios as it was coming back from
      Scythia.
    </p>
<p>
      28. Otanes then effected so much when he was made commander: and after
      this for a short time there was an abatement <a href="#linknote-15" id="linknoteref-15" class="pginternal">15</a> of evils; and then again
      evils began a second time to fall upon the Ionians, arising from Naxos and
      Miletos. For Naxos was superior to all the other islands in wealth, and
      Miletos at the same time had just then come to the very height of its
      prosperity and was the ornament <a href="#linknote-16" id="linknoteref-16" class="pginternal">16</a> of Ionia; but before
      these events for two generations of men it had been afflicted most
      violently by faction until the Parians reformed it; for these the
      Milesians chose of all the Hellenes to be reformers of their State..
    </p>
<p>
      29. Now the Parians thus reconciled their factions:—the best men of
      them came to Miletos, and seeing that the Milesians were in a grievously
      ruined state, they said that they desired to go over their land: and while
      doing this and passing through the whole territory of Miletos, whenever
      they saw in the desolation of the land any field that was well cultivated,
      they wrote down the name of the owner of that field. Then when they had
      passed through the whole land and had found but few of such men, as soon
      as they returned to the city they called a general gathering and appointed
      these men to manage the State, whose fields they had found well
      cultivated; for they said that they thought these men would take care of
      the public affairs as they had taken care of their own: and the rest of
      the Milesians, who before had been divided by factions, they commanded to
      be obedient to these men.
    </p>
<p>
      30. The Parians then had thus reformed the Milesians; but at the time of
      which I speak evils began to come to Ionia from these States <a href="#linknote-17" id="linknoteref-17" class="pginternal">17</a> in
      the following manner:—From Naxos certain men of the wealthier class
      <a href="#linknote-18" id="linknoteref-18" class="pginternal">18</a>
      were driven into exile by the people, and having gone into exile they
      arrived at Miletos. Now of Miletos it happened that Aristagoras son of
      Molpagoras was ruler in charge, being both a son-in-law and also a cousin
      of Histiaios the son of Lysagoras, whom Dareios was keeping at Susa: for
      Histiaios was despot of Miletos, and it happened that he was at Susa at
      this time when the Naxians came, who had been in former times
      guest-friends of Histiaios. So when the Naxians arrived, they made request
      of Aristagoras, to see if perchance he would supply them with a force, and
      so they might return from exile to their own land: and he, thinking that
      if by his means they should return to their own State, he would be ruler
      of Naxos, but at the same time making a pretext of the guest-friendship of
      Histiaios, made proposal to them thus: "I am not able to engage that I can
      supply you with sufficient force to bring you back from exile against the
      will of those Naxians who have control of the State; for I hear that the
      Naxians have an army which is eight thousand shields strong and many ships
      of war: but I will use every endeavour to devise a means; and my plan is
      this:—it chances that Artaphrenes is my friend: now Artaphrenes, ye
      must know, <a href="#linknote-1801" id="linknoteref-1801" class="pginternal">1801</a> is a son of Hystaspes and brother of
      Dareios the king; and he is ruler of all the people of the sea-coasts in
      Asia, with a great army and many ships. This man then I think will do
      whatsoever we shall request of him." Hearing this the Naxians gave over
      the matter to Aristagoras to manage as best he could, and they bade him
      promise gifts and the expenses of the expedition, saying that they would
      pay them; for they had full expectation that when they should appear at
      Naxos, the Naxians would do all their bidding, and likewise also the other
      islanders. For of these islands, that is the Cyclades, not one was as yet
      subject to Dareios.
    </p>
<p>
      31. Aristagoras accordingly having arrived at Sardis, said to Artaphrenes
      that Naxos was an island not indeed large in size, but fair nevertheless
      and of fertile soil, as well as near to Ionia, and that there was in it
      much wealth and many slaves: "Do thou therefore send an expedition against
      this land, and restore it to those who are now exiles from it: and if thou
      shalt do this, first I have ready for thee large sums of money apart from
      the expenses incurred for the expedition (which it is fair that we who
      conduct it should supply), and next thou wilt gain for the king not only
      Naxos itself but also the islands which are dependent upon it, Paros and
      Andros and the others which are called Cyclades; and setting out from
      these thou wilt easily attack Euboea, an island which is large and wealth,
      as large indeed as Cyprus, and very easy to conquer. To subdue all these a
      hundred ships are sufficient." He made answer in these words: "Thou makest
      thyself a reporter of good things to the house of the king; and in all
      these things thou advisest well, except as to the number of the ships: for
      instead of one hundred there shall be prepared for thee two hundred by the
      beginning of the spring. And it is right that the king himself also should
      join in approving this matter.".
    </p>
<p>
      32. So Aristagoras hearing this went back to Miletos greatly rejoiced; and
      Artaphrenes meanwhile, when he had sent to Susa and communicated that
      which was said by Aristagoras, and Dareios himself also had joined in
      approving it, made ready two hundred triremes and a very great multitude
      both of Persians and their allies, and appointed to be commander of these
      Megabates a Persian, one of the Achaimenidai and a cousin to himself and
      to Dareios, to whose daughter afterwards Pausanias the son of Cleombrotus
      the Lacedaemonian (at least if the story be true) betrothed himself,
      having formed a desire to become a despot of Hellas. Having appointed
      Megabates, I say, to be commander, Artaphrenes sent away the armament to
      Aristagoras..
    </p>
<p>
      33. So when Megabates had taken force together with the Naxians, he sailed
      with the pretence of going to the Hellespont; but when he came to Chios,
      he directed his ships to Caucasa, in order that he might from thence pass
      them over to Naxos with a North Wind. Then, since it was not fated that
      the Naxians should be destroyed by this expedition, there happened an
      event which I shall narrate. As Megabates was going round to visit the
      guards set in the several ships, it chanced that in a ship of Myndos there
      was no one on guard; and he being very angry bade his spearmen find out
      the commander of the ship, whose name was Skylax, and bind him in an
      oar-hole of his ship in such a manner <a href="#linknote-19" id="linknoteref-19" class="pginternal">19</a> that his head should be
      outside and his body within. When Skylax was thus bound, some one reported
      to Aristagoras that Megabates had bound his guest-friend of Myndos and was
      doing to him shameful outrage. He accordingly came and asked the Persian
      for his release, and as he did not obtain anything of that which he
      requested, he went himself and let him loose. Being informed of this
      Megabates was exceedingly angry and broke out in rage against Aristagoras;
      and he replied: "What hast thou to do with these matters? Did not
      Artaphrenes send thee to obey me, and to sail whithersoever I should
      order? Why dost thou meddle with things which concern thee not?" Thus said
      Aristagoras; and the other being enraged at this, when night came on sent
      men in a ship to Naxos to declare to the Naxians all the danger that
      threatened them..
    </p>
<p>
      34. For the Naxians were not at all expecting that this expedition would
      be against them: but when they were informed of it, forthwith they brought
      within the wall the property which was in the fields, and provided for
      themselves food and drink as for a siege, and strengthened their wall. <a href="#linknote-20" id="linknoteref-20" class="pginternal">20</a> These
      then were making preparations as for war to come upon them; and the others
      meanwhile having passed their ships over from Chios to Naxos, found them
      well defended when they made their attack, and besieged them for four
      months. Then when the money which the Persians had brought with them had
      all been consumed by them, and not only that, but Aristagoras himself had
      spent much in addition, and the siege demanded ever more and more, they
      built walls for the Naxian exiles and departed to the mainland again with
      ill success..
    </p>
<p>
      35. And so Aristagoras was not able to fulfil his promise to Artaphrenes;
      and at the same time he was hard pressed by the demand made to him for the
      expenses of the expedition, and had fears because of the ill success of
      the armament and because he had become an enemy of Megabates; and he
      supposed that he would be deprived of his rule over Miletos. Having all
      these various fears he began to make plans of revolt: for it happened also
      that just at this time the man who had been marked upon the head had come
      from Hisiaios who was at Susa, signifying that Aristagoras should revolt
      from the king. For Histiaios, desiring to signify to Aristagoras that he
      should revolt, was not able to do it safely in any other way, because the
      roads were guarded, but shaved off the hair of the most faithful of his
      slaves, and having marked his head by pricking it, waited till the hair
      had grown again; and as soon as it was grown, he sent him away to Miletos,
      giving him no other charge but this, namely that when he should have
      arrived at Miletos he should bid Aristagoras shave his hair and look at
      his head: and the marks, as I have said before, signified revolt. This
      thing Histiaios was doing, because he was greatly vexed by being detained
      at Susa. He had great hopes then that if a revolt occurred he would be let
      go to the sea-coast; but if no change was made at Miletos <a href="#linknote-2001" id="linknoteref-2001" class="pginternal">2001</a>
      he had no expectation of ever returning thither again.
    </p>
<p>
      36. Accordingly Hisiaios with this intention was sending the messenger;
      and it chanced that all these things happened to Aristagoras together at
      the same time. He took counsel therefore with his partisans, declaring to
      them both his own opinion and the message from Hisiaios; and while all the
      rest expressed an opinion to the same effect, urging him namely to make
      revolt, Hecataios the historian urged first that they should not undertake
      war with the king of the Persians, enumerating all the nations over whom
      Dareios was ruler, and his power: and when he did not succeed in
      persuading him, he counselled next that they should manage to make
      themselves masters of the sea. Now this, he continued, could not come to
      pass in any other way, so far as he could see, for he knew that the force
      of the Milesians was weak, but if the treasures should be taken <a href="#linknote-21" id="linknoteref-21" class="pginternal">21</a> which
      were in the temple at Branchidai, which Croesus the Lydian dedicated as
      offerings, he had great hopes that they might become masters of the sea;
      and by this means they would not only themselves have wealth at their
      disposal, but the enemy would not be able to carry the things off as
      plunder. Now these treasures were of great value, as I have shown in the
      first part of the history. <a href="#linknote-22" id="linknoteref-22" class="pginternal">22</a> This opinion did not prevail; but nevertheless
      it was resolved to make revolt, and that one of them should sail to Myus,
      to make the force which had returned from Naxos and was then there, and
      endeavour to seize the commanders who sailed in the ships..
    </p>
<p>
      37. So Iatragoras was sent for this purpose and seized by craft Oliatos
      the son of Ibanollis of Mylasa, and Histiaios the son of Tymnes of
      Termera, and Coës the son of Erxander, to whom Dareios had given Mytilene
      as a gift, and Aristagoras the son of Heracleides of Kyme, and many
      others; and then Aristagoras openly made revolt and devised all that he
      could to the hurt of Dareios. And first he pretended to resign the
      despotic power and give to Miletos equality, <a href="#linknote-23" id="linknoteref-23" class="pginternal">23</a> in order that the
      Milesians might be willing to revolt with him: then afterwards he
      proceeded to do this same thing in the rest of Ionia also; and some of the
      despots he drove out, but those whom he had taken from the ships which had
      sailed with him to Naxis, these he surrendered, because he desired to do a
      pleasure to their cities, delivering them over severally to that city from
      which each one came..
    </p>
<p>
      38. Now the men of Mitylene, so soon as they received Coës into their
      hands, brought him out and stoned him to death; but the men of Kyme let
      their despot go, and so also most of the others let them go. Thus then the
      despots were deposed in the various cities; and Aristagoras the Milesian,
      after having deposed the despots, bade each people appoint commanders in
      their several cities, and then himself set forth as an envoy to Lacedemon;
      for in truth it was necessary that he should find out some powerful
      alliance.
    </p>
<p>
      39. Now at Sparta Anaxandrides the son of Leon was no longer surviving as
      king, but had brought his life to an end; and Cleomenes the son of
      Anaxandrides was holding the royal power, not having obtained it by merit
      but by right of birth. For Anaxandrides had to wife his own sister's
      daughter and she was by him much beloved, but no children were born to him
      by her. This being so, the Ephors summoned him before them and said: "If
      thou dost not for thyself take thought in time, yet we cannot suffer this
      to happen, that the race of Eurysthenes should become extinct. Do thou
      therefore put away from thee the wife whom thou now hast, since, as thou
      knowest, she bears thee no children, and marry another: and in doing so
      thou wilt please the Spartans." He made answer saying that he would do
      neither of these two things, and that they did not give him honourable
      counsel, in that they advised him to send away the wife whom he had,
      though she had done him no wrong, and to take to his house another; and in
      short he would not follow their advice..
    </p>
<p>
      40. Upon this the Ephors and the Senators deliberated together and
      proposed to Anaxandrides as follows: "Since then we perceive that thou art
      firmly attached to the wife whom thou now hast, consent to do this, and
      set not thyself against it, lest the Spartans take some counsel about thee
      other than might be wished. We do not ask of thee the putting away of the
      wife whom thou hast; but do thou give to her all that thou givest now and
      at the same time take to thy house another wife in addition to this one,
      to bear thee children." When they spoke to him after this manner,
      Anaxandrides consented, having two wives, a thing which was not by any
      means after the Spartan fashion..
    </p>
<p>
      41. Then when no long time had elapsed, the wife who had come in
      afterwards bore this Cleomenes of whom we spoke; and just when she was
      bringing to the light an heir to the kingdom of the Spartans, the former
      wife, who had during the time before been childless, then by some means
      conceived, chancing to do so just at that time: and though she was in
      truth with child, the kinsfolk of the wife who had come in afterwards,
      when they heard of it cried out against her and said that she was making a
      vain boast, and that she meant to pass off another child as her own. Since
      then they made a great show of indignation, as the time was fast drawing
      near, the Ephors being incredulous sat round and watched the woman during
      the birth of her child: and she bore Dorieos and then straightway
      conceived Leonidas and after him at once Cleombrotos,—nay, some even
      say that Cleombrotos and Leonidas were twins. The wife however who had
      born Cleomenes and had come in after the first wife, being the daughter of
      Primetades the son of Demarmenos, did not bear a child again..
    </p>
<p>
      42. Now Cleomenes, it is said, was not quite in his right senses but on
      the verge of madness, <a href="#linknote-24" id="linknoteref-24" class="pginternal">24</a> while Dorieos was of all his equals in age the
      first, and felt assured that he would obtain the kingdom by merit. Seeing
      then that he had this opinion, when Anaxandrides died and the
      Lacedemonians followed the usual custom established the eldest, namely
      Cleomenes, upon the throne, Dorieos being indignant and not thinking it
      fit that he should be a subject of Cleomenes, asked the Spartans to give
      him a company of followers and led them out to found a colony, without
      either inquiring of the Oracle at Delphi to what land he should go to make
      a settlement, or doing any of the things which are usually done; but being
      vexed he sailed away with his ships to Libya, and the Theraians were his
      guides thither. Then having come to Kinyps <a href="#linknote-25" id="linknoteref-25" class="pginternal">25</a> he made a settlement in
      the fairest spot of all Libya, along the banks of the river; but
      afterwards in the third year he was driven out from thence by the Macai
      and the Libyans <a href="#linknote-26" id="linknoteref-26" class="pginternal">26</a> and the Carthaginians, and returned to
      Peloponnesus..
    </p>
<p>
      43. Then Antichares a man of Eleon gave him counsel out of the oracles of
      Laïos to make a settlement at Heracleia <a href="#linknote-27" id="linknoteref-27" class="pginternal">27</a> in Sicily, saying that
      the whole land of Eryx belonged to the Heracleidai, since Heracles himself
      had won it: and hearing this he went forthwith to Delphi to inquire of the
      Oracle whether he would be able to conquer the land to which he was
      setting forth; and the Pythian prophetess replied to him that he would
      conquer it. Dorieos therefore took with him the armament which he
      conducted before to Libya, and voyaged along the coast of Italy. <a href="#linknote-28" id="linknoteref-28" class="pginternal">28</a>
</p>
<p>
      44. Now at this time, the men of Sybaris say that they and their king
      Telys were about to make an expedition against Croton, and the men of
      Croton being exceedingly alarmed asked Dorieos to help them and obtained
      their request. So Dorieos joined them in an expedition against Sybaris and
      helped them to conquer Sybaris. This is what the men of Sybaris say of the
      doings of Dorieos and his followers; but those of Croton say that no
      stranger helped them in the war against the Sybarites except Callias
      alone, a diviner of Elis and one of the descendants of Iamos, and he in
      the following manner:—he ran away, they say, from Telys the despot
      of the Sybarites, when the sacrifices did not prove favourable, as he was
      sacrificing for the expedition against Croton, and so he came to them.
    </p>
<p>
      45. Such, I say, are the tales which these tell, and they severally
      produce as evidence of them the following facts:—the Sybarites point
      to a sacred enclosure and temple by the side of the dried-up bed of the
      Crathis, <a href="#linknote-29" id="linknoteref-29" class="pginternal">29</a>
      which they say that Dorieos, after he had joined in the capture of the
      city, set up to Athene surnamed "of the Crathis"; and besides they
      consider the death of Dorieos himself to be a very strong evidence,
      thinking that he perished because he acted contrary to the oracle which
      was given to him; for if he had not done anything by the way but had
      continued to do that for which he was sent, he would have conquered the
      land of Eryx and having conquered it would have become possessor of it,
      and he and his army would not have perished. On the other hand the men of
      Croton declare that many things were granted in the territory of Croton as
      special gifts to Callias the Eleisan, of which the descendants of Callias
      were still in possession down to my time, and that nothing was granted to
      Dorieos or the descendants of Dorieos: but if Dorieos had in fact helped
      them in the way with Sybaris, many times as much, they say, would have
      been given to him as to Callias. These then are the evidences which the
      two sides produce, and we may assent to whichever of them we think
      credible..
    </p>
<p>
      46. Now there sailed with Dorieos others also of the Spartans, to be
      joint-founders with him of the colony, namely Thessalos and Paraibates and
      Keleas and Euryleon; and these when they had reached Sicily with all their
      armament, were slain, being defeated in battle by the Phenicians and the
      men of Egesta; and Euryleon only of the joint-founders survived this
      disaster. This man then having collected the survivors of the expedition,
      took possession of Minoa the colony of Selinus, and he helped to free the
      men of Selinus from their despot Peithagoras. Afterwards, when he had
      deposed him, he laid hands himself upon the despotism in Selinus and
      became sole ruler there, though but for a short time; for the men of
      Selinus rose in revolt against him and slew him, notwithstanding that he
      had fled for refuge to the altar of Zeus Agoraios. <a href="#linknote-30" id="linknoteref-30" class="pginternal">30</a>
</p>
<p>
      47. There had accompanied Dorieos also and died with him Philip the son of
      Butakides, a man of Croton, who having betrothed himself to the daughter
      of Telys the Sybarite, became an exile from Croton; and then being
      disappointed of this marriage he sailed away to Kyrene, whence he set
      forth and accompanied Dorieos with a trireme of his own, himself supplying
      the expenses of the crew. Now this man had been a victor at the Olympic
      games, and he was the most beautiful of the Hellenes who lived in his
      time; and on account of his beauty he obtained from the men of Egesta that
      which none else ever obtained from them, for they established a
      hero-temple over his tomb, and they propitiate him still with sacrifices.
    </p>
<p>
      48. In this manner Dorieos ended his life: but if he had endured to be a
      subject of Cleomenes and had remained in Sparta, he would have been king
      of Lacedemon; for Cleomenes reigned no very long time, and died leaving no
      son to succeed him but a daughter only, whose name was Gorgo.
    </p>
<p>
      49. However, Aristagoras the despot of Miletos arrived at Sparta while
      Cleomenes was reigning: and accordingly with him he came to speech,
      having, as the Lacedemonians say, a tablet of bronze, on which was
      engraved a map <a href="#linknote-31" id="linknoteref-31" class="pginternal">31</a> of the whole Earth, with all the sea and all
      the rivers. And when he came to speech with Cleomenes he said to him as
      follows: "Marvel not, Cleomenes, at my earnestness in coming hither, for
      the case is this.—That the sons of the Ionians should be slaves
      instead of free is a reproach and a grief most of all indeed to ourselves,
      but of all others most to you, inasmuch as ye are the leaders of Hellas.
      Now therefore I entreat you by the gods of Hellas to rescue from slavery
      the Ionians, who are your own kinsmen: and ye may easily achieve this, for
      the Barbarians are not valiant in fight, whereas ye have attained to the
      highest point of valour in that which relates to war: and their fighting
      is of this fashion, namely with bows and arrows and a short spear, and
      they go into battle wearing trousers and with caps <a href="#linknote-32" id="linknoteref-32" class="pginternal">32</a> on their heads. Thus they
      are easily conquered. Then again they who occupy that continent have good
      things in such quantity as not all the other nations of the world together
      possess; first gold, then silver and bronze and embroidered garments and
      beasts of burden and slaves; all which ye might have for yourselves, if ye
      so desired. And the nations moreover dwell in such order one after the
      other as I shall declare:—the Ionians here; and next to them the
      Lydians, who not only dwell in a fertile land, but are also exceedingly
      rich in gold and silver," <a href="#linknote-33" id="linknoteref-33" class="pginternal">33</a>—and as he said this he pointed to the map
      of the Earth, which he carried with him engraved upon the tablet,—"and
      here next to the Lydians," continued Aristagoras, "are the Eastern
      Phrygians, who have both the greatest number of sheep and cattle <a href="#linknote-34" id="linknoteref-34" class="pginternal">34</a> of
      any people that I know, and also the most abundant crops. Next to the
      Phrygians are the Cappadokians, whom we call Syrians; and bordering upon
      them are the Kilikians, coming down to this <a href="#linknote-35" id="linknoteref-35" class="pginternal">35</a> sea, in which lies the
      island of Cyprus here; and these pay five hundred talents to the king for
      their yearly tribute. Next to these Kilikians are the Armenians, whom thou
      mayest see here, and these also have great numbers of sheep and cattle.
      Next to the Armenians are the Matienians occupying this country here; and
      next to them is the land of Kissia here, in which land by the banks of
      this river Choaspes is situated that city of Susa where the great king has
      his residence, and where the money is laid up in treasuries. After ye have
      taken this city ye may then with good courage enter into a contest with
      Zeus in the matter of wealth. Nay, but can it be that ye feel yourselves
      bound to take upon you the risk of <a href="#linknote-36" id="linknoteref-36" class="pginternal">36</a> battles against
      Messenians and Arcadians and Argives, who are equally matched against you,
      for the sake of land which is not much in extent nor very fertile, and for
      confines which are but small, though these peoples have neither gold nor
      silver at all, for the sake of which desire incites one to fight and to
      die,—can this be, I say, and will ye choose some other way now, when
      it is possible for you easily to have the rule over all Asia?" Aristagoras
      spoke thus, and Cleomenes answered him saying: "Guest-friend from Miletos,
      I defer my answer to thee until the day after to-morrow." <a href="#linknote-37" id="linknoteref-37" class="pginternal">37</a>
</p>
<p>
      50. Thus far then they advanced at that time; and when the appointed day
      arrived for the answer, and they had come to the place agreed upon,
      Cleomenes asked Aristagoras how many days' journey it was from the sea of
      the Ionians to the residence of the king. Now Aristagoras, who in other
      respects acted cleverly and imposed upon him well, in this point made a
      mistake: for whereas he ought not to have told him the truth, at least if
      he desired to bring the Spartans out to Asia, he said in fact that it was
      a journey up from the sea of three months: and the other cutting short the
      rest of the account which Aristagoras had begun to give of the way, said:
      "Guest-friend from Miletos, get thee away from Sparta before the sun has
      set; for thou speakest a word which sounds not well in the ears of the
      Lacedemonians, desiring to take them a journey of three months from the
      sea.".
    </p>
<p>
      51. Cleomenes accordingly having so said went away to his house: but
      Aristagoras took the suppliant's branch and went to the house of
      Cleomenes; and having entered in as a suppliant, he bade Cleomenes send
      away the child and listen to him; for the daughter of Cleomenes was
      standing by him, whose name was Gorgo, and this as it chanced was his only
      child, being of the age now of eight or nine years. Cleomenes however bade
      him say that which he desired to say, and not to stop on account of the
      child. Then Aristagoras proceeded to promise him money, beginning with ten
      talents, if he would accomplish for him that for which he was asking; and
      when Cleomenes refused, Aristagoras went on increasing the sums of money
      offered, until at last he had promised fifty talents, and at that moment
      the child cried out: "Father, the stranger will do thee hurt, <a href="#linknote-38" id="linknoteref-38" class="pginternal">38</a> if
      thou do not leave him and go." Cleomenes, then, pleased by the counsel of
      the child, departed into another room, and Aristagoras went away from
      Sparta altogether, and had no opportunity of explaining any further about
      the way up from the sea to the residence of the king.
    </p>
<p>
      52. As regards this road the truth is as follows.—Everywhere there
      are royal stages <a href="#linknote-39" id="linknoteref-39" class="pginternal">39</a> and excellent resting-places, and the whole
      road runs through country which is inhabited and safe. Through Lydia and
      Phrygia there extend twenty stages, amounting to ninety-four and a half
      leagues; <a href="#linknote-40" id="linknoteref-40" class="pginternal">40</a>
      and after Phrygia succeeds the river Halys, at which there is a gate <a href="#linknote-4001" id="linknoteref-4001" class="pginternal">4001</a>
      which one must needs pass through in order to cross the river, and a
      strong guard-post is established there. Then after crossing over into
      Cappadokia it is twenty-eight stages, being a hundred and four leagues, by
      this way to the borders of Kilikia; and on the borders of the Kilikians
      you will pass through two several gates and go by two several guard-posts:
      then after passing through these it is three stages, amounting to fifteen
      and a half leagues, to journey through Kilikia; and the boundary of
      Kilikia and Armenia is a navigable river called Euphrates. In Armenia the
      number of stages with resting-places is fifteen, and of leagues fifty-six
      and a half, and there is a guard-post on the way: then from Armenia, when
      one enters the land of Matiene, <a href="#linknote-41" id="linknoteref-41" class="pginternal">41</a> there are thirty-four
      stages, amounting to a hundred and thirty-seven leagues; and through this
      land flow four navigable rivers, which cannot be crossed but by ferries,
      first the Tigris, then a second and third called both by the same name, <a href="#linknote-42" id="linknoteref-42" class="pginternal">42</a>
      though they are not the same river nor do they flow from the same region
      (for the first-mentioned of them flows from the Armenian land and the
      other <a href="#linknote-43" id="linknoteref-43" class="pginternal">43</a>
      from that of the Matienians), and the fourth of the rivers is called
      Gyndes, the same which once Cyrus divided into three hundred and sixty
      channels. <a href="#linknote-44" id="linknoteref-44" class="pginternal">44</a>
      Passing thence into the Kissian land, there are eleven stages, forty-two
      and a half leagues, to the river Choaspes, which is also a navigable
      stream; and upon this is built the city of Susa. The number of these
      stages amounts in all to one hundred and eleven..
    </p>
<p>
      53. This is the number of stages with resting-places, as one goes up from
      Sardis to Susa: and if the royal road has been rightly measured as regards
      leagues, and if the league <a href="#linknote-45" id="linknoteref-45" class="pginternal">45</a> is equal to thirty furlongs, <a href="#linknote-46" id="linknoteref-46" class="pginternal">46</a> (as
      undoubtedly it is), the number of furlongs from Sardis to that which is
      called the palace of Memnon is thirteen thousand five hundred, the number
      of leagues being four hundred and fifty. So if one travels a hundred and
      fifty furlongs each day, just ninety days are spent on the journey. <a href="#linknote-47" id="linknoteref-47" class="pginternal">47</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      54. Thus the Milesian Aristagoras, when he told Cleomenes the Lacedemonian
      that the journey up from the sea to the residence of the king was one of
      three months, spoke correctly: but if any one demands a more exact
      statement yet than this, I will give him that also: for we ought to reckon
      in addition to this the length of the road from Ephesos to Sardis; and I
      say accordingly that the whole number of furlongs from the sea of Hellas
      to Susa (for by that name the city of Memnon is known) is fourteen
      thousand and forty; for the number of furlongs from Ephesos to Sardis is
      five hundred and forty: thus the three months' journey is lengthened by
      three days added.
    </p>
<p>
      55. Aristagoras then being driven out of Sparta proceeded to Athens; which
      had been set free from the rule of despots in the way which I shall tell.—When
      Hipparchos the son of Peisistratos and brother of the despot Hippias,
      after seeing a vision of a dream which signified it to him plainly, <a href="#linknote-48" id="linknoteref-48" class="pginternal">48</a> had
      been slain by Aristogeiton and Harmodios, who were originally by descent
      Gephyraians, the Athenians continued for four years after this to be
      despotically governed no less than formerly,—nay, even more..
    </p>
<p>
      56. Now the vision of a dream which Hipparchos had was this:—in the
      night before the Panathenaia it seemed to Hipparchos that a man came and
      stood by him, tall and of fair form, and riddling spoke to him these
      verses:
    </p>
<pre>
 "With enduring soul as a lion endure unendurable evil:
  No one of men who doth wrong shall escape from the judgment appointed."
</pre>
<p>
      These verses, as soon as it was day, he publicly communicated to the
      interpreters of dreams; but afterwards he put away thought of the vision
      <a href="#linknote-49" id="linknoteref-49" class="pginternal">49</a>
      and began to take part in that procession during which he lost his life.
    </p>
<p>
      57. Now the Gephyraians, of whom were those who murdered Hipparchos,
      according to their own account were originally descended from Eretria; but
      as I find by carrying inquiries back, they were Phenicians of those who
      came with Cadmos to the land which is now called Boeotia, and they dwelt
      in the district of Tanagra, which they had had allotted to them in that
      land. Then after the Cadmeians had first been driven out by the Argives,
      these Gephyraians next were driven out by the Boeotians and turned then
      towards Athens: and the Athenians received them on certain fixed
      conditions to be citizens of their State, laying down rules that they
      should be excluded from a number of things not worth mentioning here..
    </p>
<p>
      58. Now these Phenicians who came with Cadmos, of whom were the
      Gephyraians, brought in among the Hellenes many arts when they settled in
      this land of Boeotia, and especially letters, which did not exist, as it
      appears to me, among the Hellenes before this time; and at first they
      brought in those which are used by the Phenician race generally, but
      afterwards, as time went on, they changed with their speech the form of
      the letters also. During this time the Ionians were the race of Hellenes
      who dwelt near them in most of the places where they were; and these,
      having received letters by instruction of the Phenicians, changed their
      form slightly and so made use of them, and in doing so they declared them
      to be called "phenicians," as was just, seeing that the Phenicians had
      introduced them into Hellas. Also the Ionians from ancient time call paper
      "skins," because formerly, paper being scarce, they used skins of goat and
      sheep; nay, even in my own time many of the Barbarians write on such
      skins..
    </p>
<p>
      59. I myself too once saw Cadmeian characters in the temple of Ismenian
      Apollo at Thebes of the Boeotians, engraved on certain <a href="#linknote-4901" id="linknoteref-4901" class="pginternal">4901</a>
      tripods, and in most respects resembling the Ionic letters: one of these
      tripods has the inscription,
    </p>
<pre>
 "Me Amphitryon offered from land Teleboian returning:" <a href="#linknote-50" id="linknoteref-50" class="pginternal">50</a>
</pre>
<p>
      this inscription would be of an age contemporary with Laïos the son of
      Labdacos, the son of Polydoros, the son of Cadmos..
    </p>
<p>
      60. Another tripod says thus in hexameter rhythm:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Me did Scaios offer to thee, far-darting Apollo,
  Victor in contest of boxing, a gift most fair in thine honour:"
</pre>
<p>
      now Scaios would be the son of Hippocoön (at least if it were really he
      who offered it, and not another with the same name as the son of
      Hippocoön), being of an age contemporary with OEdipus the son of Laïos:
      61, and the third tripod, also in hexameter rhythm, says:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Me Laodamas offered to thee, fair-aiming Apollo,
  He, of his wealth, <a href="#linknote-51" id="linknoteref-51" class="pginternal">51</a> being king, as a gift most fair in thine honor:"
</pre>
<p>
      now it was in the reign of this very Laodamas the son of Eteocles that the
      Cadmeians were driven out by the Argives and turned to go to the
      Enchelians; and the Gephyraians being then left behind were afterwards
      forced by the Boeotians to retire to Athens. Moreover they have temples
      established in Athens, in which the other Athenians have no part, and
      besides others which are different from the rest, there is especially a
      temple of Demeter Achaia and a celebration of her mysteries.
    </p>
<p>
      62. I have told now of the vision of a dream seen by Hipparchos, and also
      whence the Gephrynians were descended, of which race were the murderers of
      Hipparchos; and in addition to this I must resume and continue the story
      which I was about to tell at first, how the Athenians were freed from
      despots. When Hippias was despot and was dealing harshly with the
      Athenians because of the death of Hipparchos, the Alcmaionidai, who were
      of Athenian race and were fugitives from the sons of Peisistratos, <a href="#linknote-52" id="linknoteref-52" class="pginternal">52</a> as
      they did not succeed in their attempt made together with the other
      Athenian exiles to return by force, but met with great disaster when they
      attempted to return and set Athens free, after they had fortified
      Leipsydrion which is above Paionia,—these Alomaionidai after that,
      still devising every means against the sons of Peisistratos, accepted the
      contract to build and complete the temple at Delphi, that namely which now
      exists but then did not as yet: and being wealthy and men of repute
      already from ancient time, they completed the temple in a manner more
      beautiful than the plan required, and especially in this respect, that
      having agreed to make the temple of common limestone, <a href="#linknote-53" id="linknoteref-53" class="pginternal">53</a> they
      built the front parts of it in Parian marble.
    </p>
<p>
      63. So then, as the Athenians say, these men being settled at Delphi
      persuaded the Pythian prophetess by gifts of money, that whenever men of
      the Spartans should come to inquire of the Oracle, either privately or
      publicly sent, she should propose to them to set Athens free. The
      Lacedemonians therefore, since the same utterance was delivered to them on
      all occasions, sent Anchimolios the son of Aster, who was of repute among
      their citizens, with an army to drive out the sons of Peisistratos from
      Athens, although these were very closely connected with them by
      guest-friendship; for they held that the concerns of the god <a href="#linknote-5301" id="linknoteref-5301" class="pginternal">5301</a>
      should be preferred to those of men: and this force they sent by sea in
      ships. He therefore, having put in to shore at Phaleron, disembarked his
      army; but the sons of Peisistratos being informed of this beforehand
      called in to their aid an auxiliary force from Thessaly, for they had made
      an alliance with the Thessalians; and the Thessalians at their request
      sent by public resolution a body of a thousand horse and also their king
      Kineas, a man of Conion. <a href="#linknote-54" id="linknoteref-54" class="pginternal">54</a> So having obtained these as allies, the sons of
      Peisistratos contrived as follows:—they cut down the trees in the
      plain of Phaleron and made this district fit for horsemen to ride over,
      and after that they sent the cavalry to attack the enemy's camp, who
      falling upon it slew (besides many others of the Lacedemonians)
      Anchimolios himself also: and the survivors of them they shut up in their
      ships. Such was the issue of the first expedition from Lacedemon: and the
      burial-place of Anchimolios is at Alopecai in Attica, near the temple of
      Heracles which is at Kynosarges..
    </p>
<p>
      64. After this the Lacedemonians equipped a larger expedition and sent it
      forth against Athens; and they appointed to be commander of the army their
      king Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides, and sent it this time not by sea
      but by land. With these, when they had invaded the land of Attica, first
      the Thessalian horse engaged battle; and in no long time they were routed
      and there fell of them more than forty men; so the survivors departed
      without more ado and went straight back to Thessaly. Then Cleomenes came
      to the city together with those of the Athenians who desired to be free,
      and began to besiege the despots shut up in the Pelasgian wall.
    </p>
<p>
      65. And the Lacedemonians would never have captured the sons of
      Peisistratos at all; for they on their side had no design to make a long
      blockade, and the others were well provided with food and drink; so that
      they would have gone away back to Sparta after besieging them for a few
      days only: but as it was, a thing happened just at this time which was
      unfortunate for those, and at the same time of assistance to these; for
      the children of the sons of Peisistratos were captured, while being
      secretly removed out of the country: and when this happened, all their
      matters were thereby cast into confusion, and they surrendered receiving
      back their children on the terms which the Athenians desired, namely that
      they should depart out of Attica within five days. After this they
      departed out of the country and went to Sigeion on the Scamander, after
      their family had ruled over the Athenians for six-and-thirty years. These
      also were originally Pylians and sons of Neleus, descended from the same
      ancestors as the family of Codros and Melanthos, who had formerly become
      kings of Athens being settlers from abroad. Hence too Hippocrates had
      given to his son the name of Peisistratos as a memorial, calling him after
      Peisistratos the son of Nestor.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus the Athenians were freed from despots; and the things worthy to be
      narrated which they did or suffered after they were liberated, up to the
      time when Ionia revolted from Dareios and Aristagoras the Milesian came to
      Athens and asked them to help him, these I will set forth first before I
      proceed further.
    </p>
<p>
      66. Athens, which even before that time was great, then, after having been
      freed from despots, became gradually yet greater; and in it two men
      exercised power, namely Cleisthenes a descendant of Alcmaion, the same who
      is reported to have bribed the Pythian prophetess, and Isagoras, the son
      of Tisander, of a family which was highly reputed, but of his original
      descent I am not able to declare; his kinsmen however offer sacrifices to
      the Carian Zeus. These men came to party strife for power; and then
      Cleisthenes was being worsted in the struggle, he made common cause with
      the people. After this he caused the Athenians to be in ten tribes, who
      were formerly in four; and he changed the names by which they were called
      after the sons of Ion, namely Geleon, Aigicoreus, Argades, and Hoples, and
      invented for them names taken from other heroes, all native Athenians
      except Ajax, whom he added as a neighbour and ally, although he was no
      Athenian.
    </p>
<p>
      67. Now in these things it seems to me that this Cleisthenes was imitating
      his mother's father Cleisthenes the despot of Sikyon: for Cleisthenes when
      he went to war with Argos first caused to cease in Sikyon the contests of
      rhapsodists, which were concerned with the poems of Homer, because Argives
      and Argos are celebrated in them almost everywhere; then secondly, since
      there was (as still there is) in the market-place itself of the Sikyonians
      a hero-temple of Adrastos the son of Talaos, Cleisthenes had a desire to
      cast him forth out of the land, because he was an Argive. So having come
      to Delphi he consulted the Oracle as to whether he should cast out
      Adrastos; and the Pythian prophetess answered him saying that Adrastos was
      king of the Sikyonians, whereas he was a stoner <a href="#linknote-55" id="linknoteref-55" class="pginternal">55</a> of them. So since the god
      did not permit him to do this, he went away home and considered means by
      which Adrastos should be brought to depart of his own accord: and when he
      thought that he had discovered them, he sent to Thebes in Boeotia and said
      that he desired to introduce into his city Melanippos the son of Astacos,
      and the Thebans gave him leave. So Cleisthenes introduced Melanippos into
      his city, and appointed for him a sacred enclosure within the precincts of
      the City Hall <a href="#linknote-56" id="linknoteref-56" class="pginternal">56</a> itself, and established him there in the
      strongest position. Now Cleisthenes introduced Melanippos (for I must
      relate this also) because he was the greatest enemy of Adrastos, seeing
      that he had killed both his brother Mekisteus and his son-in-law Tydeus:
      and when he had appointed the sacred enclosure for him, he took away the
      sacrifices and festivals of Adrastos and gave them to Melanippos. Now the
      Sikyonians were accustomed to honour Adrastos with very great honours; for
      this land was formerly the land of Polybos, and Adrastos was daughter's
      son to Polybos, and Polybos dying without sons gave his kingdom to
      Adrastos: the Sikyonians then not only gave other honours to Adrastos, but
      also with reference to his sufferings they specially honoured him with
      tragic choruses, not paying the honour to Dionysos but to Adrastos.
      Cleisthenes however gave back the choruses to Dionysos, and the other
      rites besides this he gave to Melannipos..
    </p>
<p>
      68. Thus he had done to Adrastos; and he also changed the names of the
      Dorian tribes, in order that the Sikyonians might not have the same tribes
      as the Argives; in which matter he showed great contempt of the
      Sikyonians, for the names he gave were taken from the names of a pig and
      an ass by changing only the endings, except in the case of his own tribe,
      to which he gave a name from his own rule. These last then were called
      Archelaoi, <a href="#linknote-57" id="linknoteref-57" class="pginternal">57</a>
      while of the rest those of one tribe were called Hyatai, <a href="#linknote-58" id="linknoteref-58" class="pginternal">58</a> of
      another Oneatai, <a href="#linknote-59" id="linknoteref-59" class="pginternal">59</a> and of the remaining tribe Choireatai. <a href="#linknote-60" id="linknoteref-60" class="pginternal">60</a> These
      names of tribes were used by the men of Sikyon not only in the reign of
      Cleisthenes, but also beyond that for sixty years after his death; then
      however they considered the matter and changed them into Hylleis,
      Pamphyloi, and Dymanatai, adding to these a fourth, to which they gave the
      name Aigialeis after Aigialeus the son of Adrastos.
    </p>
<p>
      69. Thus had the Cleisthenes of Sikyon done: and the Athenian Cleisthenes,
      who was his daughter's son and was called after him, despising, as I
      suppose, the Ionians, as he the Dorians, imitated his namesake Cleisthenes
      in order that the Athenians might not have the same tribes as the Ionians:
      for when at the time of which we speak he added to his own party the whole
      body of the common people of the Athenians, which in former time he had
      despised, <a href="#linknote-61" id="linknoteref-61" class="pginternal">61</a>
      he changed the names of the tribes and made them more in number than they
      had been; he made in fact ten rulers of tribes instead of four, and by
      tens also he distributed the demes in the tribes; and having added the
      common people to his party he was much superior to his opponents..
    </p>
<p>
      70. Then Isagoras, as he was being worsted in his turn, contrived a plan
      in opposition to him, that is to say, he called in Cleomenes the
      Lacedemonian to help him, who had been a guest-friend to himself since the
      siege of the sons of Peisistratos; moreover Cleomenes was accused of being
      intimate with the wife of Isagoras. First then Cleomenes sent a herald to
      Athens demanding the expulsion of Cleisthenes and with him many others of
      the Athenians, calling them the men who were under the curse: <a href="#linknote-62" id="linknoteref-62" class="pginternal">62</a> this
      message he sent by instruction of Isagoras, for the Alcmaionidai and their
      party were accused of the murder to which reference was thus made, while
      he and his friends had no part in it..
    </p>
<p>
      71. Now the men of the Athenians who were "under the curse" got this name
      as follows:—there was one Kylon among the Athenians, a man who had
      gained the victory at the Olympic games: this man behaved with arrogance,
      wishing to make himself despot; and having formed for himself an
      association of men of his own age, he endeavoured to seize the Acropolis:
      but not being able to get possession of it, he sat down as a suppliant
      before the image of the goddess. <a href="#linknote-63" id="linknoteref-63" class="pginternal">63</a> These men were taken from
      their place as suppliants by the presidents of the naucraries, who then
      administered affairs at Athens, on the condition that they should be
      liable to any penalty short of death; and the Alcmaionidai are accused of
      having put them to death. This had occurred before the time of
      Peisistratos..
    </p>
<p>
      72. Now when Cleomenes sent demanding the expulsion of Cleisthenes and of
      those under the curse, Cleisthenes himself retired secretly; but after
      that nevertheless Cleomenes appeared in Athens with no very large force,
      and having arrived he proceeded to expel as accursed seven hundred
      Athenian families, of which Isagoras had suggested to him the names.
      Having done this he next endeavoured to dissolve the Senate, and he put
      the offices of the State into the hands of three hundred, who were the
      partisans of Isagoras. The Senate however making opposition, and not being
      willing to submit, Cleomenes with Isagoras and his partisans seized the
      Acropolis. Then the rest of the Athenians joined together by common
      consent and besieged them for two days; and on the third day so many of
      them as were Lacedemonians departed out of the country under a truce. Thus
      was accomplished for Cleomenes the ominous saying which was uttered to
      him: for when he had ascended the Acropolis with the design of taking
      possession of it, he was going to the sanctuary of the goddess, as to
      address her in prayer; but the priestess stood up from her seat before he
      had passed through the door, and said, "Lacedemonian stranger, go back and
      enter not into the temple, for it is not lawful for Dorians to pass in
      hither." He said: "Woman, I am not a Dorian, but an Achaian." So then,
      paying no attention to the ominous speech, he made his attempt and then
      was expelled again with the Lacedemonians; but the rest of the men the
      Athenians laid in bonds to be put to death, and among them Timesitheos the
      Delphian, with regard to whom I might mention very great deeds of strength
      and courage which he performed..
    </p>
<p>
      73. These then having been thus laid in bonds were put to death; and the
      Athenians after this sent for Cleisthenes to return, and also for the
      seven hundred families which had been driven out by Cleomenes: and then
      they sent envoys to Sardis, desiring to make an alliance with the
      Persians; for they were well assured that the Lacedemonians and Cleomenes
      had been utterly made their foes. So when these envoys had arrived at
      Sardis and were saying that which they had been commanded to say,
      Artaphrenes the son of Hystaspes, the governor of Sardis, asked what men
      these were who requested to be allies of the Persians, and where upon the
      earth they dwelt; and having heard this from the envoys, he summed up his
      answer to them thus, saying that if the Athenians were willing to give
      earth and water to Dareios, he was willing to make alliance with them, but
      if not, he bade them begone: and the envoys taking the matter upon
      themselves said that they were willing to do so, because they desired to
      make the alliance..
    </p>
<p>
      74. These, when they returned to their own land, were highly censured: and
      Cleomenes meanwhile, conceiving that he had been outrageously dealt with
      by the Athenians both with words and with deeds, was gathering together an
      army from the whole of the Peloponnese, not declaring the purpose for
      which he was gathering it, but desiring to take vengeance on the people of
      the Athenians, and intending to make Isagoras despot; for he too had come
      out of the Acropolis together with Cleomenes. Cleomenes then with a large
      army entered Eleusis, while at the same time the Boeotians by agreement
      with him captured Oinoe and Hysiai, the demes which lay upon the extreme
      borders of Attica, and the Chalkidians on the other side invaded and began
      to ravage various districts of Attica. The Athenians then, though attacked
      on more sides than one, thought that they would remember the Boeotians and
      Chalkidians afterwards, and arrayed themselves against the Peloponnesians
      who were in Eleusis..
    </p>
<p>
      75. Then as the armies were just about the join battle, the Corinthians
      first, considering with themselves that they were not acting rightly,
      changed their minds and departed; and after that Demaratos the son of
      Ariston did the same, who was king of the Spartans as well as Cleomenes,
      though he had joined with him in leading the army out from Lacedemon and
      had not been before this at variance with Cleomenes. In consequence of
      this dissension a law was laid down at Sparta that it should not be
      permitted, when an army went out, that both the kings should go with it,
      for up to this time both used to go with it, and that as one of the kings
      was set free from service, so one of the sons of Tyndareus <a href="#linknote-64" id="linknoteref-64" class="pginternal">64</a> also
      should be left behind; for before this time both of these two were called
      upon by them for help and went with the armies.
    </p>
<p>
      76. At this time then in Eleusis the rest of the allies, seeing that the
      kings of the Lacedemonians did not agree and also that the Corinthians had
      deserted their place in the ranks, themselves too departed and got them
      away quickly. And this was the fourth time that the Dorians had come to
      Attica, twice having invaded it to make war against it, and twice to help
      the mass of the Athenian people,—first when they at the same time
      colonised Megara (this expedition may rightly be designated as taking
      place when Codros was king of the Athenians), for the second and third
      times when they came making expeditions from Sparta to drive out the sons
      of Peisistratos, and fourthly on this occasion, when Cleomenes at the head
      of the Peloponnesians invaded Eleusis: thus the Dorians invaded Athens
      then for the fourth time.
    </p>
<p>
      77. This army then having been ingloriously broken up, the Athenians after
      that, desiring to avenge themselves, made expedition first against the
      Chalkidians; and the Boeotians came to the Euripos to help the
      Chalkidians. The Athenians, therefore, seeing those who had come to help,
      <a href="#linknote-6401" id="linknoteref-6401" class="pginternal">6401</a>
      resolved first to attack the Boeotians before the Chalkidians. Accordingly
      they engaged battle with the Boeotians, and had much the better of them,
      and after having slain very many they took seven hundred of them captive.
      On this very same day the Athenians passed over into Euboea and engaged
      battle with the Chalkidians as well; and having conquered these also, they
      left four thousand holders of allotments in the land belonging to the
      "Breeders of Horses": <a href="#linknote-65" id="linknoteref-65" class="pginternal">65</a> now the wealthier of the Chalkidians were
      called the Breeders of Horses. And as many of them as they took captive,
      they kept in confinement together with the Boeotians who had been
      captured, bound with fetters; and then after a time they let them go,
      having fixed their ransom at two pounds of silver apiece: <a href="#linknote-66" id="linknoteref-66" class="pginternal">66</a> but
      their fetters, in which they had been bound, they hung up on the
      Acropolis; and these were still existing even to my time hanging on walls
      which had been scorched with fire by the Mede, <a href="#linknote-67" id="linknoteref-67" class="pginternal">67</a> and just opposite the
      sanctuary which lies towards the West. The tenth part of the ransom also
      they dedicated for an offering, and made of it a four-horse chariot of
      bronze, which stands on the left hand as you enter the Propylaia in the
      Acropolis, and on it is the following inscription:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Matched in the deeds of war with the tribes of Boeotia and Chalkis
    The sons of Athens prevailed, conquered and tamed them in fight:
  In chains of iron and darkness they quenched their insolent spirit;
    And to Athene present these, of their ransom a tithe."
</pre>
<p>
      78. The Athenians accordingly increased in power; and it is evident, not
      by one instance only but in every way, that Equality <a href="#linknote-68" id="linknoteref-68" class="pginternal">68</a> is an excellent thing,
      since the Athenians while they were ruled by despots were not better in
      war that any of those who dwelt about them, whereas after they had got rid
      of despots they became far the first. This proves that when they were kept
      down they were wilfully slack, because they were working for a master,
      whereas when they had been set free each one was eager to achieve
      something for himself.
    </p>
<p>
      79. These then were faring thus: and the Thebans after this sent to the
      god, desiring to be avenged on the Athenians; the Pythian prophetess
      however said that vengeance was not possible for them by their own
      strength alone, but bade them report the matter to the "many-voiced" and
      ask help of those who were "nearest" to them. So when those who were sent
      to consult the Oracle returned, they made a general assembly and reported
      the oracle; and then the Thebans heard them say that they were to ask help
      of those who were nearest to them, they said: "Surely those who dwell
      nearest to us are the men of Tanagra and Coroneia and Thespiai; and these
      always fight zealously on our side and endure the war with us to the end:
      what need is there that we ask of these? Rather perhaps that is not the
      meaning of the oracle.".
    </p>
<p>
      80. While they commented upon it thus, at length one perceived "that which
      the oracle means to tell us. Asopos is said to have had two daughters born
      to him, Thebe and Egina; and as these are sisters, I think that the god
      gave us for answer that we should ask the men of Egina to become our
      helpers." Then as there seemed to be no opinion expressed which was better
      than this, they sent forthwith and asked the men of Egina to help them,
      calling upon them in accordance with the oracle; and they, when these made
      request, said that they sent with them the sons of Aiacos to help them..
    </p>
<p>
      81. After that the Thebans, having made an attempt with the alliance of
      the sons of Aiacos and having been roughly handled by the Athenians, sent
      again and gave them back the sons of Aiacos and asked them for men. So the
      Eginetans, exalted by great prosperity and calling to mind an ancient
      grudge against the Athenians, then on the request of the Thebans commenced
      a war against the Athenians without notice: for while the Athenians were
      intent on the Boeotians, they sailed against them to Attica with ships of
      war, and they devastated Phaleron and also many demes in the remainder of
      the coast region, and so doing they deeply stirred the resentment of the
      Athenians. <a href="#linknote-69" id="linknoteref-69" class="pginternal">69</a>
</p>
<p>
      82. Now the grudge which was due beforehand from the Eginetans to the
      Athenians came about from a beginning which was as follows:—The land
      of the Epidaurians yielded to its inhabitants no fruit; and accordingly
      with reference to this calamity the Epidaurians went to inquire at Delphi,
      and the Pythian prophetess bade them set up images of Damia and Auxesia,
      and said that when they had set up these, they would meet with better
      fortune. The Epidaurians then asked further whether they should make
      images of bronze or of stone; and the prophetess bade them not use either
      of these, but make them of the wood of a cultivated olive-tree. The
      Epidaurians therefore asked the Athenians to allow them to cut for
      themselves an olive-tree, since they thought that their olives were the
      most sacred; nay some say that at that time there were no olives in any
      part of the earth except at Athens. The Athenians said that they would
      allow them on condition that they should every year bring due offerings to
      Athene Polias <a href="#linknote-70" id="linknoteref-70" class="pginternal">70</a> and to Erechtheus. The Epidaurians, then,
      having agreed to these terms, obtained that which they asked, and they
      made images out of these olive-trees and set them up: and their land bore
      fruit and they continued to fulfil towards the Athenians that which they
      had agreed to do..
    </p>
<p>
      83. Now during this time and also before this the Eginetans were subject
      to the Epidaurians, and besides other things they were wont to pass over
      to Epidauros to have their disputes with one another settled by law: <a href="#linknote-71" id="linknoteref-71" class="pginternal">71</a> but
      after this time they built for themselves ships and made revolt from the
      Epidaurians, moved thereto by wilfulness. So as they were at variance with
      them, they continued to inflict damage on them, since in fact they had
      command of the sea, and especially they stole away from them these images
      of Damia and Auxesia, and they brought them and set them up in the inland
      part of their country at a place called Oia, which is about twenty
      furlongs distant from their city. Having set them up in this spot they
      worshipped them with sacrifices and choruses of women accompanied with
      scurrilous jesting, ten men being appointed for each of the deities to
      provide the choruses: and the choruses spoke evil of no man, but only of
      the women of the place. Now the Epidaurians also had the same rites; and
      they have also rites which may not be divulged..
    </p>
<p>
      84. These images then having been stolen, the Epidaurians no longer
      continued to fulfil towards the Athenians that which they had agreed. The
      Athenians accordingly sent and expressed displeasure to the Epidaurians;
      and they declared saying that they were doing no wrong; for during the
      time when they had the images in their country they continued to fulfil
      that which they had agreed upon, but since they had been deprived of them,
      it was not just that they should make the offerings any more; and they
      bade them demand these from the men of Egina, who had the images. So the
      Athenians sent to Egina and demanded the images back; but the Eginetans
      said that they had nothing to do with the Athenians.
    </p>
<p>
      85. The Athenians then report that in one single trireme were despatched
      those of their citizens who were sent by the State after this demand; who
      having come to Egina, attempted to tear up from off their pedestals the
      images, (alleging that they were made of wood which belonged to the
      Athenians), in order to carry them back with them: but not being able to
      get hold of them in this manner (say the Athenians) they threw ropes round
      them and were pulling them, when suddenly, as they pulled, thunder came on
      and an earthquake at the same time with the thunder; and the crew of the
      trireme who were pulling were made beside themselves by these, and being
      brought to this condition they killed one another as if they were enemies,
      until at last but one of the whole number was left; and he returned alone
      to Phaleron..
    </p>
<p>
      86. Thus the Athenians report that it came to pass: but the Eginetans say
      that it was not with a single ship that the Athenians came; for a single
      ship, and even a few more than one, they could have easily repelled, even
      if they had not happened to have ships of their own: but they say that the
      Athenians sailed upon their country with a large fleet of ships, and they
      gave way before them and did not fight a sea-battle. They cannot however
      declare with certainty whether they gave way thus because they admitted
      that they were not strong enough to fight the battle by sea, or because
      they intended to do something of the kind which they actually did. The
      Athenians then, they say, as no one met them in fight, landed from their
      ships and made for the images; but not being able to tear them up from
      their pedestals, at last they threw ropes round them and began to pull,
      until the images, as they were being pulled, did both the same thing (and
      here they report something which I cannot believe, but some other man
      may), for they say that the images fell upon their knees to them and that
      they continue to be in that position ever since this time. The Athenians,
      they say, were doing thus; and meanwhile they themselves (say the
      Eginetans), being informed that the Athenians were about to make an
      expedition against them, got the Argives to help them; and just when the
      Athenians had disembarked upon the Eginetan land, the Argives had come to
      their rescue, and not having been perceived when they passed over from
      Epidauros to the island, they fell upon the Athenians before these had
      heard anything of the matter, cutting them off secretly from the way to
      their ships; and at this moment it was that the thunder and the earthquake
      came upon them..
    </p>
<p>
      87. This is the report which is given by the Argives and Eginetans both,
      and it is admitted by the Athenians also that but one alone of them
      survived and came back to Attica: only the Argives say that this one
      remained alive from destruction wrought by them upon the army of Athens,
      while the Athenians say that the divine power was the destroyer. However,
      even this one man did not remain alive, but perished, they say, in the
      following manner:—when he returned to Athens he reported the
      calamity which had happened; and the wives of the men who had gone on the
      expedition to Egina, hearing it and being very indignant that he alone of
      all had survived, came round this man and proceeded to stab him with the
      brooches of their mantles, each one of them asking of him where her
      husband was. Thus he was slain; and to the Athenians it seemed that the
      deed of the women was a much more terrible thing even than the calamity
      which had happened; and not knowing, it is said, how they should punish
      the women in any other way, they changed their fashion of dress to that of
      Ionia,—for before this the women of the Athenians wore Dorian dress,
      very like that of Corinth,—they changed it therefore to the linen
      tunic, in order that they might not have use for brooches..
    </p>
<p>
      88. In truth however this fashion of dress is not Ionian originally but
      Carian, for the old Hellenic fashion of dress for women was universally
      the same as that which we now call Dorian. Moreover it is said that with
      reference to these events the Argives and Eginetans made it a custom among
      themselves in both countries <a href="#linknote-72" id="linknoteref-72" class="pginternal">72</a> to have the brooches made half as large again
      as the size which was then established in use, and that their women should
      offer brooches especially in the temple of these goddesses, <a href="#linknote-73" id="linknoteref-73" class="pginternal">73</a> and
      also that they should carry neither pottery of Athens nor anything else of
      Athenian make to the temple, but that it should be the custom for the
      future to drink there from pitchers made in the lands themselves.
    </p>
<p>
      89. The women of the Argives and Eginetans from this time onwards because
      of the quarrel with the Athenians continued to wear brooches larger than
      before, and still do so even to my time; and the origin of the enmity of
      the Athenians towards the Eginetans came in the manner which has been
      said. So at this time, when the Thebans invaded them, the Eginetans
      readily came to the assistance of the Boeotians, calling to mind what
      occurred about the images. The Eginetans then were laying waste, as I have
      said, the coast regions of Attica; and when the Athenians were resolved to
      make an expedition against the Eginetans, an oracle came to them from
      Delphi bidding them stay for thirty years reckoned from the time of the
      wrong done by the Eginetans, and in the one-and-thirtieth year to appoint
      a sacred enclosure for Aiacos and then to begin the war against the
      Eginetans, and they would succeed as they desired; but if they should make
      an expedition against them at once, they would suffer in the meantime very
      much evil and also inflict very much, but at last they would subdue them.
      When the Athenians heard the report of this, they appointed a sacred
      enclosure for Aiacos, namely that which is now established close to the
      market-place, but they could not endure to hear that they must stay for
      thirty years, when they had suffered injuries from the Eginetans..
    </p>
<p>
      90. While however they were preparing to take vengeance, a matter arose
      from the Lacedemonians which provided a hindrance to them: for the
      Lacedemonians, having learnt that which had been contrived by the
      Alcmaionidai with respect to the Pythian prophetess, and that which had
      been contrived by the Pythian prophetess against themselves and the sons
      of Peisistratos, were doubly grieved, not only because they had driven out
      into exile men who were their guest-friends, but also because after they
      had done this no gratitude was shown to them by the Athenians. Moreover in
      addition to this, they were urged on by the oracles which said that many
      injuries would be suffered by them from the Athenians; of which oracles
      they had not been aware of before, but they had come to know them, since
      Cleomenes had brought them to Sparta. In fact Cleomenes had obtained from
      the Acropolis of the Athenians those oracles which the sons of
      Peisistratos possessed before and had left in the temple when they were
      driven out; and Cleomenes recovered them after they had been left behind..
    </p>
<p>
      91. At this time, then, when the Lacedemonians had recovered the oracles
      and when they saw that the Athenians were increasing in power and were not
      at all willing to submit to them, observing that the Athenian race now
      that it was free was becoming <a href="#linknote-74" id="linknoteref-74" class="pginternal">74</a> a match for their own, whereas when held down
      by despots it was weak and ready to be ruled,—perceiving, I say, all
      these things, they sent for Hippias the son of Peisistratos to come from
      Sigeion on the Hellespont, whither the family of Peisistratos go for
      refuge; <a href="#linknote-75" id="linknoteref-75" class="pginternal">75</a>
      and when Hippias had come upon the summons, the Spartans sent also for
      envoys to come from their other allies and spoke to them as follows:
      "Allies, we are conscious within ourselves that we have not acted rightly;
      for incited by counterfeit oracles we drove out into exile men who were
      very closely united with us as guest-friends and who undertook the task of
      rendering Athens submissive to us, and then after having done this we
      delivered over the State to a thankless populace, which so soon as it had
      raised its head, having been freed by our means drove out us and our king
      with wanton outrage; and now exalted with pride <a href="#linknote-76" id="linknoteref-76" class="pginternal">76</a> it is increasing in
      power, so that the neighbours of these men first of all, that is the
      Boeotians and Chalkidians, have already learnt, and perhaps some others
      also will afterwards learn, that they committed an error. <a href="#linknote-7601" id="linknoteref-7601" class="pginternal">7601</a>
      As however we erred in doing those things of which we have spoken, we will
      try now to take vengeance on them, going thither together with you; <a href="#linknote-77" id="linknoteref-77" class="pginternal">77</a> since
      it was for this very purpose that we sent for Hippias, whom ye see here,
      and for you also, to come from your cities, in order that with common
      counsel and a common force we might conduct him to Athens and render back
      to him that which we formerly took away."
    </p>
<p>
      92. Thus they spoke; but the majority of the allies did not approve of
      their words. The rest however kept silence, but the Corinthian Socles <a href="#linknote-78" id="linknoteref-78" class="pginternal">78</a> spoke
      as follows: (a) "Surely now the heaven shall be below the earth, and the
      earth raised up on high above the heaven, and men shall have their
      dwelling in the sea, and fishes shall have that habitation which men had
      before, seeing that ye, Lacedemonians, are doing away with free
      governments <a href="#linknote-79" id="linknoteref-79" class="pginternal">79</a> and are preparing to bring back despotism again
      into our cities, than which there is no more unjust or more murderous
      thing among men. For if in truth this seems to you to be good, namely that
      the cities should be ruled by despots, do ye yourselves first set up a
      despot in your own State, and then endeavour to establish them also for
      others: but as it is, ye are acting unfairly towards your allies, seeing
      that ye have had no experience of despots yourselves and provide with the
      greatest care at Sparta that this may never come to pass. If however ye
      had had experience of it, as we have had, ye would be able to contribute
      juster opinions of it than at present. (b) For the established order of
      the Corinthian State was this:—the government was an oligarchy, and
      the oligarchs, who were called Bacchiadai, had control over the State and
      made marriages among themselves. <a href="#linknote-80" id="linknoteref-80" class="pginternal">80</a> Now one of these men,
      named Amphion, had a daughter born to him who was lame, and her name was
      Labda. This daughter, since none of the Bacchiadai wished to marry her,
      was taken to wife by Aëtion the son of Echecrates, who was of the deme of
      Petra, but by original descent a Lapith and of the race of Caineus.
      Neither from this wife nor from another were children born to him,
      therefore he set out to Delphi to inquire about offspring; and as he
      entered, forthwith the prophetess addressed him in these lines:
    </p>
<pre>
  "'Much to be honoured art thou, yet none doth render thee honour. <a href="#linknote-81" id="linknoteref-81" class="pginternal">81</a>
  Labda conceives, and a rolling rock will she bear, which shall ruin
  Down on the heads of the kings, and with chastisement visit Corinthos.'
</pre>
<p>
      This answer given to Aëtion was by some means reported to the Bacchiadai,
      to whom the oracle which had come to Corinth before this was not
      intelligible, an oracle which had reference to the same thing as that of
      Aëtion and said thus:
    </p>
<pre>
 "'An eagle conceives in the rocks <a href="#linknote-82" id="linknoteref-82" class="pginternal">82</a> and shall bear a ravening lion,
  Strong and fierce to devour, who the knees of many shall loosen.
  Ponder this well in your minds, I bid you, Corinthians, whose dwelling
  Lies about fair Peirene's spring and in craggy Corinthos.' <a href="#linknote-83" id="linknoteref-83" class="pginternal">83</a>
</pre>
<p>
      (c) This oracle, I say, having come before to the Bacchiadai was obscure;
      but afterwards when they heard that which had come to Aëtion, forthwith
      they understood the former also, that it was in accord with that of
      Aëtion; and understanding this one also they kept quiet, desiring to
      destroy the offspring which should be born to Aëtion. Then, so soon as his
      wife bore a child, they sent ten of their own number to the deme in which
      Aëtion had his dwelling, to slay the child; and when these had come to
      Petra and had passed into the court of Aëtion's house, they asked for the
      child; and Labda, not knowing anything of the purpose for which they had
      come, and supposing them to be asking for the child on account of friendly
      feeling towards its father, brought it and placed it in the hands of one
      of them. Now they, it seems, had resolved by the way that the first of
      them who received the child should dash it upon the ground. However, when
      Labda brought and gave it, it happened by divine providence that the child
      smiled at the man who had received it; and when he perceived this, a
      feeling of compassion prevented him from killing it, and having this
      compassion he delivered it to the next man, and he to the third. Thus it
      passed through the hands of all the ten, delivered from one to another,
      since none of them could bring himself to destroy its life. So they gave
      the child back to its mother and went out; and then standing by the doors
      they abused and found fault with one another, laying blame especially on
      the one who had first received the child, because he had not done
      according to that which had been resolved; until at last after some time
      they determined again to enter and all to take a share in the murder. (d)
      From the offspring of Aëtion however it was destined that evils should
      spring up for Corinth: for Labda was listening to all this as she stood
      close by the door, and fearing lest they should change their mind and take
      the child a second time and kill it, she carried it and concealed it in
      the place which seemed to her the least likely to be discovered, that is
      to say a corn-chest, <a href="#linknote-84" id="linknoteref-84" class="pginternal">84</a> feeling sure that if they should return and
      come to a search, they were likely to examine everything: and this in fact
      happened. So when they had come, and searching had failed to find it, they
      thought it best to return and say to those who had sent them that they had
      done all that which they had been charged by them to do. (e) They then
      having departed said this; and after this the son of Aëtion grew, and
      because he had escaped this danger, the name of Kypselos was given him as
      a surname derived from the corn-chest. Then when Kypselos had grown to
      manhood and was seeking divination, a two-edged <a href="#linknote-85" id="linknoteref-85" class="pginternal">85</a> answer was given him at
      Delphi, placing trust in which he made an attempt upon Corinth and
      obtained possession of it. Now the answer was as follows:
    </p>
<pre>
 "'Happy is this man's lot of a truth, who enters my dwelling,
  Offspring of Aëtion, he shall rule in famous Corinthos,
  Kypselos, he and his sons, but his children's children no longer.'
</pre>
<p>
      Such was the oracle: and Kypselos when he became despot was a man of this
      character,—many of the Corinthians he drove into exile, many he
      deprived of their wealth, and very many more of their lives. (f) And when
      he had reigned for thirty years and had brought his life to a prosperous
      end, his son Periander became his successor in the despotism. Now
      Periander at first was milder than his father; but after he had had
      dealings through messengers with Thrasybulos the despot of Miletos, he
      became far more murderous even than Kypselos. For he sent a messenger to
      Thrasybulos and asked what settlement of affairs was the safest for him to
      make, in order that he might best govern his State: and Thrasybulos led
      forth the messenger who had come from Periander out of the city, and
      entered into a field of growing corn; and as he passed through the crop of
      corn, while inquiring and asking questions repeatedly <a href="#linknote-86" id="linknoteref-86" class="pginternal">86</a> of
      the messenger about the occasion of his coming from Corinth, he kept
      cutting off the heads of those ears of corn which he saw higher than the
      rest; and as he cut off their heads he cast them away, until he had
      destroyed in this manner the finest and richest part of the crop. So
      having passed through the place and having suggested no word of counsel,
      he dismissed the messenger. When the messenger returned to Corinth,
      Periander was anxious to hear the counsel which had been given; but he
      said that Thrasybulos had given him no counsel, and added that he wondered
      at the deed of Periander in sending him to such a man, for the man was out
      of his senses and a waster of his own goods,—relating at the same
      time that which he had seen Thrasybulos do. (g) So Periander,
      understanding that which had been done and perceiving that Thrasybulos
      counselled him to put to death those who were eminent among his subjects,
      began then to display all manner of evil treatment to the citizens of the
      State; for whatsoever Kypselos had left undone in killing and driving into
      exile, this Periander completed. And in one day he stripped all the wives
      of the Corinthians of their clothing on account of his own wife Melissa.
      For when he had sent messengers to the Thesprotians on the river Acheron
      to ask the Oracle of the dead about a deposit made with him by a
      guest-friend, Melissa appeared and said she would not tell in what place
      the deposit was laid, for she was cold and had no clothes, since those
      which he had buried with her were of no use to her, not having been burnt;
      and this, she said, would be an evidence to him that she was speaking the
      truth, namely that when the oven was cold, Periander had put his loaves
      into it. When the report of this was brought back to Periander, the token
      made him believe, because he had had commerce with Melissa after she was
      dead; and straightway after receiving the message he caused proclamation
      to be made that all the wives of the Corinthians should come out to the
      temple of Hera. They accordingly went as to a festival in their fairest
      adornment; and he having set the spearmen of his guard in ambush, stripped
      them all alike, both the free women and their attendant; and having
      gathered together all their clothes in a place dug out, he set fire to
      them, praying at the same time to Melissa. Then after he had done this and
      had sent a second time, the apparition of Melissa told him in what spot he
      had laid the deposit entrusted to him by his guest-friend.
    </p>
<p>
      "Such a thing, ye must know, Lacedemonians, is despotism, and such are its
      deeds: and we Corinthians marvelled much at first when we saw that ye were
      sending for Hippias, and now we marvel even more because ye say these
      things; and we adjure you, calling upon the gods of Hellas, not to
      establish despotisms in the cities. If however ye will not cease from your
      design, but endeavour to restore Hippias contrary to that which is just,
      know that the Corinthians at least do not give their consent to that which
      ye do."
    </p>
<p>
      93. Socles being the envoy of Corinth thus spoke, and Hippias made answer
      to him, calling to witness the same gods as he, that assuredly the
      Corinthians would more than all others regret the loss of the sons of
      Peisistratos, when the appointed days should have come for them to be
      troubled by the Athenians. Thus Hippias made answer, being acquainted with
      the oracles more exactly than any other man: but the rest of the allies,
      who for a time had restrained themselves and kept silence, when they heard
      Socles speak freely, gave utterance every one of them to that which they
      felt, and adopted the opinion of the Corinthian envoy, adjuring the
      Lacedemonians not to do any violence to a city of Hellas.
    </p>
<p>
      94. Thus was this brought to an end: and Hippias being dismissed from
      thence had Anthemus offered to him by Amyntas king of the Macedonians and
      Iolcos by the Thessalians. He however accepted neither of these, but
      retired again to Sigeion; which city Peisistratos had taken by force of
      arms from the Mytilenians, and having got possession of it, had appointed
      his own natural son Hegesistratos, born of an Argive woman, to be despot
      of it: he however did not without a struggle keep possession of that which
      he received from Peisistratos; for the Mytilenians and Athenians carried
      on war for a long time, having their strongholds respectively at
      Achilleion and at Sigeion, the one side demanding that the place be
      restored to them, and the Athenians on the other hand not admitting this
      demand, but proving by argument that the Aiolians had no better claim to
      the territory of Ilion than they and the rest of the Hellenes, as many as
      joined with Menelaos in exacting vengeance for the rape of Helen..
    </p>
<p>
      95. Now while these carried on the war, besides many other things of
      various kinds which occurred in the battles, once when a fight took place
      and the Athenians were conquering, Alcaios the poet, taking to flight,
      escaped indeed himself, but the Athenians retained possession of his arms
      and hung them up on the walls of the temple of Athene which is at Sigeion.
      About this matter Alcaios composed a song and sent it to Mytilene,
      reporting therein his misadventure to one Melanippos, who was his friend.
      Finally Periander the son of Kypselos made peace between the Athenians and
      the Mytilenians, <a href="#linknote-87" id="linknoteref-87" class="pginternal">87</a> for to him they referred the matter as
      arbitrator; and he made peace between them on the condition that each
      should continue to occupy that territory which they then possessed..
    </p>
<p>
      96. Sigeion then in this matter had come under the rule of the Athenians.
      And when Hippias had returned to Asia from Lacedemon, he set everything in
      motion, stirring up enmity between the Athenians and Artaphrenes, and
      using every means to secure that Athens should come under the rule of
      himself and of Dareios. Hippias, I say, was thus engaged; and the
      Athenians meanwhile hearing of these things sent envoys to Sardis, and
      endeavoured to prevent the Persians from following the suggestions of the
      exiled Athenians. Artaphrenes however commanded them, if they desired to
      be preserved from ruin, to receive Hippias back again. This proposal the
      Athenians were not by any means disposed to accept when it was reported;
      and as they did not accept this, it became at once a commonly received
      opinion among them that they were enemies of the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      97. While they had these thoughts and had been set at enmity with the
      Persians, at this very time Aristagoras the Milesian, ordered away from
      Sparta by Cleomenes the Lacedemonian, arrived at Athens; for this was the
      city which had most power of all the rest besides Sparta. And Aristagoras
      came forward before the assembly of the people and said the same things as
      he had said at Sparta about the wealth which there was in Asia, and about
      the Persian manner of making war, how they used neither shield nor spear
      and were easy to overcome. Thus I say he said, and also he added this,
      namely that the Milesians were colonists from the Athenians, and that it
      was reasonable that the Athenians should rescue them, since they had such
      great power; and there was nothing which he did not promise, being very
      urgent in his request, until at last he persuaded them: for it would seem
      that it is easier to deceive many than one, seeing that, though he did not
      prove able to deceive Cleomenes the Lacedemonian by himself, yet he did
      this to thirty thousand Athenians. The Athenians then, I say, being
      persuaded, voted a resolution to despatch twenty ships to help the
      Ionians, and appointed to command them Melanthios one of their citizens,
      who was in all things highly reputed. These ships proved to be the
      beginning of evils for the Hellenes and the Barbarians.
    </p>
<p>
      98. Aristagoras however sailed on before and came to Miletos; and then
      having devised a plan from which no advantage was likely to come for the
      Ionians (nor indeed was he doing what he did with a view to that, but in
      order to vex king Dareios), he sent a man to Phrygia to the Piaonians who
      had been taken captive by Megabazos from the river Strymon, and who were
      dwelling in a district and village of Phrygia apart by themselves; and
      when the messenger came to the Paionians he spoke these words: "Paionians,
      Aristagoras the despot of Miletos sent me to offer to you salvation, if ye
      shall be willing to do as he says; for now all Ionia has revolted from the
      king and ye have an opportunity of coming safe to your own land: to reach
      the sea shall be your concern, and after this it shall be thenceforth
      ours." The Paionians hearing this received it as a most welcome proposal,
      and taking with them their children and their women they began a flight to
      the sea; some of them however were struck with fear and remained in the
      place where they were. Having come to the coast the Paionians crossed over
      thence to Chios, and when they were already in Chios there arrived in
      their track a large body of Persian horsemen pursuing the Paionians.
      These, as they did not overtake them, sent over to Chios to bid the
      Paionians return back: the Paionians however did not accept their
      proposal, but the men of Chios conveyed them from Chios to Lesbos, and the
      Lesbians brought them to Doriscos, and thence they proceeded by land and
      came to Paionia.
    </p>
<p>
      99. Aristagoras meanwhile, when the Athenians had arrived with twenty
      ships, bringing with them also five triremes of the Eretrians, joined
      the expedition not for the sake of the Athenians but of the Milesians
      themselves, to repay them a debt which they owed (for the Milesians in
      former times had borne with the Eretrians the burden of all that war which
      they had with the Chalkidians at the time when the Chalkidians on their
      side were helped by the Samians against the Eretrians and Milesians),—when
      these, I say, had arrived and the other allies were on the spot,
      Aristagoras proceeded to make a march upon Sardis. On this march he did
      not go himself, but remained at Miletos and appointed others to be in
      command of the Milesians, namely his brother Charopinos and of the other
      citizens one Hermophantos. <a href="#linknote-8701" id="linknoteref-8701" class="pginternal">8701</a>
</p>
<p>
      100. With this force then the Ionians came to Ephesos, and leaving their
      ships at Coresos in the land of Ephesos, went up themselves in a large
      body, taking Ephesians to guide them in their march. So they marched along
      by the river Caÿster, and then when they arrived after crossing the range
      of Tmolos, they took Sardis without any resistance, all except the
      citadel, but the citadel Artaphrenes himself saved from capture, having
      with him a considerable force of men..
    </p>
<p>
      101. From plundering this city after they had taken it they were prevented
      by this:—the houses in Sardis were mostly built of reeds, and even
      those of them which were of brick had their roofs thatched with reeds: of
      these houses one was set on fire by a soldier, and forthwith the fire
      going on from house to house began to spread over the whole town. So then
      as the town was on fire, the Lydians and all the Persians who were in the
      city being cut off from escape, since the fire was prevailing in the
      extremities round about them, and not having any way out of the town,
      flowed together to the market-place and to the river Pactolos, which
      brings down gold-dust for them from Tmolos, flowing through the middle of
      their market-place, and then runs out into the river Hermos, and this into
      the sea;—to this Pactolos, I say, and to the market-place the
      Lydians and Persians gathered themselves together, and were compelled to
      defend themselves. The Ionians then, seeing some of the enemy standing on
      their defence and others in great numbers coming on to the attack, were
      struck with fear and retired to the mountain called Tmolos, and after that
      at nightfall departed to go to their ships.
    </p>
<p>
      102. Sardis was then destroyed by fire, and in it also the temple of the
      native goddess Hybebe; which the Persians alleged afterwards as a reason
      for setting on fire in return the temples in the land of the Hellenes.
      However at the time of which I speak the Persians who occupied districts
      within the river Halys, informed beforehand of this movement, were
      gathering together and coming to the help of the Lydians; and, as it
      chanced, they found when they came that the Ionians no longer were in
      Sardis; but they followed closely in their track and came up with them at
      Ephesos: and the Ionians stood indeed against them in array, but when they
      joined battle they had very much the worse; and besides other persons of
      note whom the Persians slaughtered, there fell also Eualkides commander of
      the Eretrians, a man who had won wreaths in contests of the games and who
      was much celebrated by Simonides of Keos: and those of them who survived
      the battle dispersed to their various cities.
    </p>
<p>
      103. Thus then they fought at that time; and after the battle the
      Athenians left the Ionians together, and when Aristagoras was urgent in
      calling upon them by messengers for assistance, they said that they would
      not help them: the Ionians, however, though deprived of the alliance of
      the Athenians, none the less continued to prepare for the war with the
      king, so great had been the offences already committed by them against
      Dareios. They sailed moreover to the Hellespont and brought under their
      power Byzantion and all the other cities which are in those parts; and
      then having sailed forth out of the Hellespont, they gained in addition
      the most part of Caria to be in alliance with them: for even Caunos, which
      before was not willing to be their ally, then, after they had burnt
      Sardis, was added to them also..
    </p>
<p>
      104. The Cyprians too, excepting those of Amathus, were added voluntarily
      to their alliance; for these also had revolted from the Medes in the
      following manner:—there was one Onesilos, younger brother of Gorgos
      king of Salamis, and son of Chersis, the son of Siromos, the son of
      Euelthon. This man in former times too had been wont often to advise
      Gorgos to make revolt from the king, and at this time, when he heard that
      the Ionians had revolted, he pressed him very hard and endeavoured to urge
      him to it. Since however he could not persuade Gorgos, Onesilos watched
      for a time when he had gone forth out of the city of Salamis, and then
      together with the men of his own faction he shut him out of the gates.
      Gorgos accordingly being robbed of the city went for refuge to the Medes,
      and Onesilos was ruler of Salamis and endeavoured to persuade all the men
      of Cyprus to join him in revolt. The others then he persuaded; but since
      those of Amathus were not willing to do as he desired, he sat down before
      their city and besieged it.
    </p>
<p>
      105. Onesilos then was besieging Amathus; and meanwhile, when it was
      reported to king Dareios that Sardis had been captured and burnt by the
      Athenians and the Ionians together, and that the leader of the league for
      being about these things <a href="#linknote-88" id="linknoteref-88" class="pginternal">88</a> was the Milesian Aristagoras, it is said that
      at first being informed of this he made no account of the Ionians, because
      he knew that they at all events would not escape unpunished for their
      revolt, but he inquired into who the Athenians were; and when he had been
      informed, he asked for his bow, and having received it and placed an arrow
      upon the string, he discharged it upwards towards heaven, and as he shot
      into the air he said: "Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance
      upon the Athenians!" Having so said he charged one of his attendants, that
      when dinner was set before the king he should say always three times:
      "Master, remember the Athenians.".
    </p>
<p>
      106. When he had given this charge, he called into his presence Histiaios
      the Milesian, whom Dareios had now been keeping with him for a long time,
      and said: "I am informed, Histiaios, that thy deputy, to whom thou didst
      depute the government of Miletos, has made rebellion against me; for he
      brought in men against me from the other continent and persuaded the
      Ionians also,—who shall pay the penalty to me for that which they
      did,—these, I say, he persuaded to go together with them, and thus
      he robbed me of Sardis. Now therefore how thinkest thou that this is well?
      and how without thy counsels was anything of this kind done? Take heed
      lest thou afterwards find reason to blame thyself for this." Histiaios
      replied: "O king, what manner of speech is this that thou hast uttered,
      saying that I counselled a matter from which it was likely that any
      vexation would grow for thee, either great or small? What have I to seek
      for in addition to that which I have, that I should do these things; and
      of what am I in want? for I have everything that thou hast, and I am
      thought worthy by thee to hear all thy counsels. Nay, but if my deputy is
      indeed acting in any such manner as thou hast said, be assured that he has
      done it merely on his own account. I however, for my part, do not even
      admit the report to be true, that the Milesians and my deputy are acting
      in any rebellious fashion against thy power: but if it prove that they are
      indeed doing anything of that kind, and if that which thou hast heard, O
      king, be the truth, learn then what a thing thou didst in removing me away
      from the sea-coast; for it seems that the Ionians, when I had gone out of
      the sight of their eyes, did that which they had long had a desire to do;
      whereas if I had been in Ionia, not a city would have made the least
      movement. Now therefore as quickly as possible let me set forth to go to
      Ionia, that I may order all these matters for thee as they were before,
      and deliver into thy hands this deputy of Miletos who contrived these
      things: and when I have done this after thy mind, I swear by the gods of
      the royal house that I will not put off from me the tunic which I wear
      when I go down to Ionia, until I have made Sardinia tributary to thee,
      which is the largest of all islands.".
    </p>
<p>
      107. Thus saying Histiaios endeavoured to deceive the king, and Dareios
      was persuaded and let him go, charging him, when he should have
      accomplished that which he had promised, to return to him again at Susa.
    </p>
<p>
      108. In the meantime, while the news about Sardis was going up to the
      king, and while Dareios, after doing that which he did with the bow, came
      to speech with Histiaios, and Histiaios having been let go by Dareios was
      making his journey to the sea-coast,—during all that time the events
      were happening which here follow.—As Onesilos of Salamis was
      besieging those of Amathus, it was reported to him that Artybios a
      Persian, bringing with him in ships a large Persian army, was to be
      expected shortly to arrive in Cyprus. Being informed of this, Onesilos
      sent heralds to different places in Ionia to summon the Ionians to his
      assistance; and they took counsel together and came without delay with a
      large force. Now the Ionians arrived in Cyprus just at the time when the
      Persians having crossed over in ships from Kilikia were proceeding by land
      to attack Salamis, while the Phenicians with the ships were sailing round
      the headland which is called the "Keys of Cyprus.".
    </p>
<p>
      109. This being the case, the despots of Cyprus called together the
      commanders of the Ionians and said: "Ionians, we of Cyprus give you a
      choice which enemy ye will rather fight with, the Persians or the
      Phenicians: for if ye will rather array yourselves on land and make trial
      of the Persians in fight, it is time now for you to disembark from your
      ships and array yourselves on the land, and for us to embark in your ships
      to contend against the Phenicians; but if on the other hand ye will rather
      make trial of the Phenicians,—whichever of these two ye shall
      choose, ye must endeavour that, so far as it rests with you, both Ionia
      and Cyprus shall be free." To this the Ionians replied: "We were sent out
      by the common authority of the Ionians to guard the sea, and not to
      deliver our ships to the Cyprians and ourselves fight with the Persians on
      land. We therefore will endeavour to do good service in that place to
      which we were appointed; and ye must call to mind all the evils which ye
      suffered from the Medes, when ye were in slavery to them, and prove
      yourselves good men.".
    </p>
<p>
      110. The Ionians made answer in these words; and afterwards, when the
      Persians had come to the plain of Salamis, the kings of the Cyprians set
      in order their array, choosing the best part of the troops of Salamis and
      of Soloi to be arrayed against the Persians and setting the other Cyprians
      against the rest of the enemy's troops; and against Artybios, the
      commander of the Persians, Onesilos took up his place in the array by his
      own free choice.
    </p>
<p>
      111. Now Artybios was riding a horse which had been trained to rear up
      against a hoplite. Onesilos accordingly being informed of this, and having
      a shield-bearer, by race of Caria, who was of very good repute as a
      soldier and full of courage besides, <a href="#linknote-89" id="linknoteref-89" class="pginternal">89</a> said to this man: "I am
      informed that the horse of Artybios rears upright and works both with his
      feet and his mouth against any whom he is brought to attack. Do thou
      therefore consider the matter, and tell me forthwith which of the two thou
      wilt rather watch for and strike, the horse or Artybios himself." To this
      his attendant replied: "O king, I am ready to do both or either of these
      two things, and in every case to do that which thou shalt appoint for me;
      but I will declare to thee the way in which I think it will be most
      suitable <a href="#linknote-90" id="linknoteref-90" class="pginternal">90</a>
      for thy condition. I say that it is right for one who is king and
      commander to fight with a king and commander; for if thou shalt slay the
      commander of the enemy, it turns to great glory for thee; and again, if he
      shall slay thee, which heaven forbid, even death when it is at the hands
      of a worthy foe is but half to be lamented: but for us who are under thy
      command it is suitable to fight with the others who are under his command
      and with his horse: and of the tricks of the horse have thou no fear at
      all, for I engage to thee that after this at least he shall never stand
      against any man more." Thus he spoke; and shortly afterwards the opposed
      forces joined battle both on land and with their ships..
    </p>
<p>
      112. On that day the Ionians for their part greatly distinguished
      themselves and overcame the Phenicians, and of them the Samians were best:
      and meanwhile on land, when the armies met, they came to close quarters
      and fought; and as regards the two commanders, what happened was this:—when
      Artybios came to fight with Onesilos sitting upon his horse, Onesilos, as
      he had concerted with his shield-bearer, struck at Artybios himself, when
      he came to fight with him; and when the horse put its hoofs against the
      shield of Onesilos, then the Carian struck with a falchion <a href="#linknote-91" id="linknoteref-91" class="pginternal">91</a> and
      smote off the horse's feet..
    </p>
<p>
      113 So Artybios the commander of the Persians fell there on the spot
      together with his horse: and while the others also were fighting, Stesenor
      the despot of Curion deserted them, having with him a large force of men,—now
      these Curians are said to be settlers from Argos,—and when the
      Curians had deserted, forthwith also the war-chariots of the men of
      Salamis proceeded to do the same as the Curians. When these things took
      place, the Persians had the advantage over the Cyprians; and after their
      army had been put to rout, many others fell and among them Onesilos the
      son of Chersis, he who brought about the revolt of the Cyprians, and also
      the king of the Solians, Aristokypros the son of Philokypros,—that
      Philokypros whom Solon the Athenian, when he came to Cyprus, commended in
      verse above all other despots..
    </p>
<p>
      114. So the men of Amathus cut off the head of Onesilos, because he had
      besieged them; and having brought it to Amathus they hung it over the gate
      of the city: and as the head hung there, when it had now become a hollow,
      a swarm of bees entered into it and filled it with honeycomb. This having
      so come to pass, the Amathusians consulted an Oracle about the head, and
      they received an answer bidding them take it down and bury it and
      sacrifice to Onesilos every year as a hero; and if they did this, it would
      go better with them..
    </p>
<p>
      115. The Amathusians accordingly continued to do so even to my time. But
      the Ionians who had fought the sea-fight in Cyprus, when they perceived
      that the fortunes of Onesilos were ruined and that the cities of the
      Cyprians were besieged, except Salamis, and that this city had been
      delivered over by the Salaminians to Gorgos the former king,—as soon
      as they perceived this, the Ionians sailed away back to Ionia. Now of the
      cities in Cyprus Soloi held out for the longest time under the siege; and
      the Persians took it in the fifth month by undermining the wall round.
    </p>
<p>
      116. The Cyprians then, after they had made themselves free for one year,
      had again been reduced to slavery afresh: and meanwhile Daurises, who was
      married to a daughter of Dareios, and Hymaies and Otanes, who were also
      Persian commanders and were married also to daughters of Dareios, after
      they had pursued those Ionians who had made the expedition to Sardis and
      defeating them in battle had driven them by force to their ships,—after
      this distributed the cities amongst themselves and proceeded to sack
      them..
    </p>
<p>
      117. Daurises directed his march to the cities on the Hellespont, and he
      took Dardanos and Abydos and Percote and Lampsacos and Paisos, of these he
      took on each day one; and as he was marching from Paisos against the city
      of Parion, the report came that the Carians had made common cause with the
      Ionians and were in revolt from the Persians. He turned back therefore
      from the Hellespont and marched his army upon Caria..
    </p>
<p>
      118. And, as it chanced, a report of this was brought to the Carians
      before Daurises arrived; and the Carians being informed of it gathered
      together at the place which is called the "White Pillars" and at the river
      Marsyas, which flows from the region of Idrias and runs out into the
      Maiander. When the Carians had been gathered together there, among many
      other counsels which were given, the best, as it seems to me, was that of
      Pixodaros the son of Mausolos, a man of Kindye, who was married to the
      daughter of the king of the Kilikians, Syennesis. The opinion of this man
      was to the effect that the Carians should cross over the Maiander and
      engage battle with the Persians having the river at their backs, in order
      that the Carians, not being able to fly backwards and being compelled to
      remain where they were, might prove themselves even better men in fight
      than they naturally would. This opinion did not prevail; but they resolved
      that the Persians rather than themselves should have the Maiander at their
      backs, evidently <a href="#linknote-92" id="linknoteref-92" class="pginternal">92</a> in order that if there should be a flight of
      the Persians and they should be worsted in the battle, they might never
      return home, but might fall into the river..
    </p>
<p>
      119. After this, when the Persians had come and had crossed the Maiander,
      the Carians engaged with the Persians on the river Marsyas and fought a
      battle which was obstinately contested and lasted long; but at length they
      were worsted by superior numbers: and of the Persians there fell as many
      as two thousand, but of the Carians ten thousand. Then those of them who
      escaped were shut up in Labraunda <a href="#linknote-93" id="linknoteref-93" class="pginternal">93</a> within the sanctuary of
      Zeus Stratios, which is a large sacred grove of plane-trees; now the
      Carians are the only men we know who offer sacrifices to Zeus Stratios.
      These men then, being shut up there, were taking counsel together about
      their safety, whether they would fare better if they delivered themselves
      over to the Persians or if they left Asia altogether..
    </p>
<p>
      120. And while they were thus taking counsel, there came to their aid the
      Milesians and their allies. Then the Carians dismissed the plans which
      they were before considering and prepared to renew the war again from the
      beginning: and when the Persians came to attack them, they engaged with
      them and fought a battle, and they were worsted yet more completely than
      before; and while many were slain of all parties, <a href="#linknote-94" id="linknoteref-94" class="pginternal">94</a> the Milesians suffered
      most..
    </p>
<p>
      121. Then afterwards the Carians repaired this loss and retrieved their
      defeat; for being informed that the Persians had set forth to march upon
      their cities, they laid an ambush on the road which is by Pedasos, <a href="#linknote-95" id="linknoteref-95" class="pginternal">95</a> and
      the Persians falling into it by night were destroyed both they and their
      commanders, namely Daurises and Amorges and Sisimakes; and with them died
      also Myrsos the son of Gyges. Of this ambush the leader was Heracleides
      the son of Ibanollis, a man of Mylasa.
    </p>
<p>
      122. These then of the Persians were thus destroyed; and meanwhile
      Hymaies, who was another of those who pursued after the Ionians that had
      made the expedition to Sardis, directed his march to the Propontis and
      took Kios in Mysia; and having conquered this city, when he was informed
      that Daurises had left the Hellespont and was marching towards Caria, he
      left the Propontis and led his army to the Hellespont: and he conquered
      all the Aiolians who occupy the district of Ilion, and also the Gergithes,
      who were left behind as a remnant of the ancient Teucrians. While
      conquering these tribes Hymaies himself ended his life by sickness in the
      land of Troas..
    </p>
<p>
      123. He thus brought his life to an end; and Artaphrenes the governor of
      the province of Sardis was appointed with Otanes the third of the
      commanders to make the expedition against Ionia and that part of Aiolia
      which bordered upon it. Of Ionia these took the city of Clazomenai, and of
      the Aiolians Kyme.
    </p>
<p>
      124. While the cities were thus being taken, Aristagoras the Milesian,
      being, as he proved in this instance, not of very distinguished courage,
      since after having disturbed Ionia and made preparation of great matters
      <a href="#linknote-96" id="linknoteref-96" class="pginternal">96</a> he
      counselled running away when he saw these things, (moreover it had become
      clear to him that it was impossible to overcome king Dareios),—he, I
      say, having regard to these things, called together those of his own party
      and took counsel with them, saying that it was better that there should be
      a refuge prepared for them, in case that they should after all be driven
      out from Miletos, and proposing the question whether he should lead them
      from thence to Sardinia, to form a colony there, or to Myrkinos in the
      land of the Edonians, which Histiaios had been fortifying, having received
      it as a gift from Dareios. This was the question proposed by Aristagoras..
    </p>
<p>
      125. Now the opinion of Hecataios the son of Hegesander the historian <a href="#linknote-97" id="linknoteref-97" class="pginternal">97</a> was
      that he should not take a colony to either of these places, but build a
      wall of defence for himself in the island of Leros and keep still, if he
      should be forced to leave Miletos; and afterwards with this for his
      starting point he would be able to return to Miletos..
    </p>
<p>
      126. This was the counsel of Hecataios; but Aristagoras was most inclined
      to go forth to Myrkinos. He therefore entrusted the government of Miletos
      to Pythagoras, a man of repute among the citizens, and he himself sailed
      away to Thrace, taking with him every one who desired to go; and he took
      possession of the region for which he had set out. But starting from this
      to make war, he perished by the hands of the Thracians, that is both
      Aristagoras himself and his army, when he was encamped about a certain
      city and the Thracians desired to go out from it under a truce.

      moreover he expressed wonder at that which had happened, pretending that
      he knew nothing of the state of affairs. Then Artaphrenes seeing that he
      was using dissimulation said, having knowledge of the truth about the
      revolt: "Thus it is with thee, Histiaios, about these matters,—this
      shoe was stitched by thee, and put on by Aristagoras.".
    </p>
<p>
      2. Thus said Artaphrenes with reference to the revolt; and Histiaios
      fearing Artaphrenes because he understood the matter, ran away the next
      night at nightfall and went to the sea-coast, having deceived king
      Dareios, seeing that he had engaged to subdue Sardinia the largest of
      islands, and instead of that he was endeavouring to take upon himself
      leadership of the Ionians in the war against Dareios. Then having crossed
      over to Chios he was put in bonds by the Chians, being accused by them of
      working for a change of their State by suggestion of Dareios. When however
      the Chians learnt the whole story and heard that he was an enemy to the
      king, they released him..
    </p>
<p>
      3. Then Histiaios, being asked by the Ionians for what reason he had so
      urgently charged Aristagoras to revolt from the king and had wrought so
      great an evil for the Ionians, did not by any means declare to them that
      which had been in truth the cause, but reported to them that king Dareios
      had resolved to remove the Phenicians from their land and to settle them
      in Ionia, and the Ionians in Phenicia; and for this reason, he said, he
      had given the charge. Thus he attempted to alarm the Ionians, although the
      king had never resolved to do so at all.
    </p>
<p>
      4. After this Histiaios acting through a messenger, namely Hermippos a man
      of Atarneus, sent papers to the Persians who were at Sardis, implying that
      he had already talked matters over with them about a revolt: and Hermippos
      did not deliver them to those to whom he was sent, but bore the papers and
      put them into the hands of Artaphrenes. He then, perceiving all that was
      being done, bade Hermippos bear the papers sent by Histiaios and deliver
      them to those to whom he was sent to bear them, and to deliver to him the
      replies sent back by the Persians to Histiaios. These things having been
      discovered, Artaphrenes upon that put to death many of the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      5. As regards Sardis therefore there was confusion of the design; and when
      Histiaios had been disappointed of this hope, the Chians attempted to
      restore him to Miletos at the request of Histiaios himself. The Milesians,
      however, who had been rejoiced before to be rid of Aristagoras, were by no
      means eager to receive another despot into their land, seeing that they
      had tasted of liberty: and in fact Histiaios, attempting to return to
      Miletos by force and under cover of night, was wounded in the thigh by one
      of the Milesians. He then, being repulsed from his own city, returned to
      Chios; and thence, as he could not persuade the Chians to give him ships,
      he crossed over to Mytilene and endeavoured to persuade the Lesbians to
      give him ships. So they manned eight triremes and sailed with Histiaios to
      Byzantion, and stationing themselves there they captured the ships which
      sailed out of the Pontus, excepting where the crews of them said that they
      were ready to do the bidding of Histiaios.
    </p>
<p>
      6. While Histiaios and the men of Mytilene were acting thus, a large army
      both of sea and land forces was threatening to attack Miletos itself; for
      the commanders of the Persians had joined together to form one single army
      and were marching upon Miletos, considering the other towns of less
      account. Of their naval force the most zealous were the Phenicians, and
      with them also served the Cyprians, who had just been subdued, and the
      Kilikians and Egyptians..
    </p>
<p>
      7. These, I say, were advancing upon Miletos and the rest of Ionia; and
      meanwhile the Ionians being informed of this were sending deputies <a href="#link6note-1" id="link6noteref-1" class="pginternal">1</a> chosen
      from themselves to the Panionion. <a href="#link6note-2" id="link6noteref-2" class="pginternal">2</a> When these had arrived at
      that place and took counsel together, they resolved not to gather a
      land-army to oppose the Persians, but that the Milesians should defend
      their walls by themselves, and that the Ionians should man their fleet,
      leaving out not one of their ships, and having done so should assemble as
      soon as possible at Lade, to fight a sea-battle in defence of Miletos. Now
      Lade is a small island lying opposite the city of the Milesians..
    </p>
<p>
      8. Then the Ionians manned their ships and came thither, and with them
      also those Aiolians who inhabit Lesbos; and they were drawn up in order
      thus:—the extremity of the line towards the East was held by the
      Milesians themselves, who furnished eighty ships; next to them were the
      Prienians with twelve ships and the men of Myus with three; next to those
      of Myus were the Teians with seventeen ships, and after the Teians the
      Chians with a hundred; after these were stationed the men of Erythrai and
      of Phocaia, the former furnishing eight ships and the latter three; next
      to the Phocaians were the Lesbians with seventy ships, and last, holding
      the extremity of the line towards the West, were stationed the Samians
      with sixty ships. Of all these the total number proved to be three hundred
      and fifty-three triremes..
    </p>
<p>
      9. These were the ships of the Ionians; and of the Barbarians the number
      of ships was six hundred. When these too were come to the Milesian coast
      and their whole land-army was also there, then the commanders of the
      Persians, being informed of the number of the Ionian ships, were struck
      with fear lest they should be unable to overcome them, and thus on the one
      hand should not be able to conquer Miletos from not having command of the
      sea, and at the same time should run a risk of being punished by Dareios.
      Reflecting upon these things they gathered together the despots of the
      Ionians who were exiles with the Medes, having been deposed from their
      governments by Aristagoras the Milesian, and who chanced to be then
      joining in the expedition against Miletos,—of these men they called
      together those who were present and spoke to them as follows: "Ionians,
      now let each one of you show himself a benefactor of the king's house,
      that is to say, let each one of you endeavour to detach his own countrymen
      from the body of the alliance: and make your proposals promising at the
      same time that they shall suffer nothing unpleasant on account of the
      revolt, and neither their temples nor their private houses shall be burnt,
      nor shall they have any worse treatment than they had before this; but if
      they will not do so, but will by all means enter into a contest with us,
      threaten them and tell them this, which in truth shall happen to them,
      namely that if they are worsted in the fight they shall be reduced to
      slavery, and we shall make their sons eunuchs, and their maidens we shall
      remove to Bactria, and deliver their land to others.".
    </p>
<p>
      10. They thus spoke; and the despots of Ionia sent each one by night to
      his own people announcing to them this. The Ionians however, that is those
      to whom these messages came, continued obstinate and would not accept the
      thought of treason to their cause; and each people thought that to them
      alone the Persians were sending this message.
    </p>
<p>
      11. This happened as soon as the Persians came to Miletos; and after this
      the Ionians being gathered together at Lade held meetings; and others no
      doubt also made speeches to them, but especially the Phocaian commander
      Dionysios, who said as follows: "Seeing that our affairs are set upon the
      razor's edge, Ionians, whether we shall be free or slaves, and slaves too
      to be dealt with as runaways, now therefore if ye shall be willing to take
      upon yourselves hardships, ye will have labour for the time being, but ye
      will be able to overcome the enemy and be free; whereas if ye continue to
      be self-indulgent and without discipline, I have no hope for you that ye
      will not pay the penalty to the king for your revolt. Nay, but do as I
      say, and deliver yourselves over to me; and I engage, if the gods grant
      equal conditions, that either the enemy will not fight with us, or that
      fighting he shall be greatly discomfited.".
    </p>
<p>
      12. Hearing this the Ionians delivered themselves to Dionysios; and he
      used to bring the ships out every day in single file, <a href="#link6note-3" id="link6noteref-3" class="pginternal">3</a> that
      he might practise the rowers by making the ships break through one
      another's line, <a href="#link6note-4" id="link6noteref-4" class="pginternal">4</a> and that he might get the fighting-men in the
      ships under arms; an then for the rest of the day he would keep the ships
      at anchor; and thus he gave the Ionians work to do during the whole day.
      For seven days then they submitted and did that which he commanded; but on
      the day after these the Ionians, being unaccustomed to such toils and
      being exhausted with hard work and hot sun, spoke to one another thus:
      "Against which of the deities have we offended, that we thus fill up the
      measure of evil? for surely we have delivered ourselves to a Phocaian, an
      impostor, who furnishes but three ships: and he has taken us into his
      hands and maltreats us with evil dealing from which we can never recover;
      and many of us in fact have fallen into sicknesses, and many others, it
      may be expected, will suffer the same thing shortly; and for us it is
      better to endure anything else in the world rather than these ills, and to
      undergo the slavery which will come upon us, whatever that shall be,
      rather than to be oppressed by that which we have now. Come, let us not
      obey him after this any more." So they said, and forthwith after this
      every one refused to obey him, and they pitched their tents in the island
      like an army, and kept in the shade, and would not go on board their ships
      or practise any exercises.
    </p>
<p>
      13. Perceiving this which was being done by the Ionians, the commanders of
      the Samians then at length accepted from Aiakes the son of Syloson those
      proposals which Aiakes sent before at the bidding of the Persians, asking
      them to leave the alliance of the Ionians; the Samians, I say, accepted
      these proposals, perceiving that there was great want of discipline on the
      part of the Ionians, while at the same time it was clear to them that it
      was impossible to overcome the power of the king; and they well knew also
      that even if they should overcome the present naval force of Dareios, <a href="#link6note-5" id="link6noteref-5" class="pginternal">5</a>
      another would be upon them five times as large. Having found an occasion
      <a href="#link6note-6" id="link6noteref-6" class="pginternal">6</a>
      then, so soon as they saw that the Ionians refused to be serviceable, they
      counted it gain for themselves to save their temples and their private
      property. Now Aiakes, from whom the Samians accepted the proposals, was
      the son of Syloson, the son of Aiakes, and being despot of Samos he had
      been deprived of his rule by Aristagoras the Milesian, like the other
      despots of Ionia..
    </p>
<p>
      14. So when the Phenicians sailed to the attack, the Ionians also put out
      their ships from shore against them, sailing in single file: and when they
      came near and engaged battle with one another, as regards what followed I
      am not able exactly to record which of the Ionians showed themselves
      cowards or good men in this sea-fight, for they throw blame upon one
      another. The Samians however, it is said, according to their agreement
      with Aiakes put up their sails then and set forth from their place in the
      line to sail back to Samos, excepting only eleven ships: of these the
      captains stayed in their places and took part in the sea-fight, refusing
      to obey the commanders of their division; and the public authority of the
      Samians granted them on account of this to have their names written up on
      a pillar with their fathers' names also, <a href="#link6note-601" id="link6noteref-601" class="pginternal">601</a> as having proved
      themselves good men; and this pillar exists still in the market-place.
      Then the Lesbians also, when they saw that those next them in order were
      taking to flight, did the same things as the Samians had done, and so also
      most of the Ionians did the very same thing..
    </p>
<p>
      15. Of those which remained in their places in the sea-fight the Chians
      suffered very severely, <a href="#link6note-7" id="link6noteref-7" class="pginternal">7</a> since they displayed brilliant deeds of valour
      and refused to play the coward. These furnished, as was before said, a
      hundred ships and in each of them forty picked men of their citizens
      served as fighting-men; <a href="#link6note-8" id="link6noteref-8" class="pginternal">8</a> and when they saw the greater number of their
      allies deserting them, they did not think fit to behave like the cowards
      among them, but left along with a few only of their allies they continued
      to fight and kept breaking through the enemy's line; until at last, after
      they had conquered many ships of the enemy, they lost the greater number
      of their own..
    </p>
<p>
      16. The Chians then with the remainder of their ships fled away to their
      own land; but those of the Chians whose ships were disabled by the damage
      which they had received, being pursued fled for refuge to Mycale; and
      their ships they ran ashore there and left them behind, while the men
      proceeded over the mainland on foot: and when the Chians had entered the
      Ephesian territory on their way, then since <a href="#link6note-801" id="link6noteref-801" class="pginternal">801</a> they came into it by
      night and at a time when a festival of Thesmophoria was being celebrated
      by the women of the place, the Ephesians, not having heard beforehand how
      it was with the Chians and seeing that an armed body had entered their
      land, supposed certainly that they were robbers and had a design upon the
      women; so they came out to the rescue in a body and slew the Chians.
    </p>
<p>
      17. Such was the fortune which befell these men: but Dionysios the
      Phocaian, when he perceived that the cause of the Ionians was ruined,
      after having taken three ships of the enemy sailed away, not to Pocaia any
      more, for he knew well that it would be reduced to slavery together with
      the rest of Ionia, and he sailed forthwith straight to Phenicia; and
      having there sunk merchant ships and taken a great quantity of goods, he
      sailed thence to Sicily. Then with that for his starting-point he became a
      freebooter, not plundering any Hellenes, but Carthaginians and Tyrsenians
      only.
    </p>
<p>
      18. The Persians, then, being conquerors of the Ionians in the sea-fight,
      besieged Miletos by land and sea, undermining the walls and bringing
      against it all manner of engines; and they took it completely <a href="#link6note-9" id="link6noteref-9" class="pginternal">9</a> in the
      sixth year from the revolt of Aristagoras, and reduced the people to
      slavery; so that the disaster agreed with the oracle which had been
      uttered with reference to Miletos..
    </p>
<p>
      19. For when the Argives were inquiring at Delphi about the safety of
      their city, there was given to them an oracle which applied to both, that
      is to say, part of it had reference to the Argives themselves, while that
      which was added afterwards referred to the Milesians. The part of it which
      had reference to the Argives I will record when I reach that place in the
      history, <a href="#link6note-10" id="link6noteref-10" class="pginternal">10</a> but that which the Oracle uttered with
      reference to the Milesians, who were not there present, is as follows:
    </p>
<pre>
 "And at that time, O Miletos, of evil deeds the contriver,
  Thou shalt be made for many a glorious gift and a banquet:
  Then shall thy wives be compelled to wash the feet of the long-haired,
  And in Didyma then my shrine shall be tended by others."
</pre>
<p>
      At the time of which I speak these things came upon the Milesians, since
      most of the men were killed by the Persians, who are long-haired, and the
      women and children were dealt with as slaves; and the temple at Didyma,
      with the sacred building and the sanctuary of the Oracle, was first
      plundered and then burnt. Of the things in this temple I have made mention
      frequently in other parts of the history. <a href="#link6note-11" id="link6noteref-11" class="pginternal">11</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      20. After this the Milesians who had been taken prisoner were conducted to
      Susa; and king Dareios did to them no other evil, but settled them upon
      the Sea called Erythraian, in the city of Ampe, by which the Tigris flows
      when it runs out into the sea. Of the Milesian land the Persians
      themselves kept the surroundings of the city and the plain, but the
      heights they gave to the Carians of Pedasa for a possession.
    </p>
<p>
      21. When the Milesians suffered this treatment from the Persians, the men
      of Sybaris, who were dwelling in Laos and Skidros, being deprived of their
      own city, did not repay like with like: for when Sybaris was taken by the
      men of Croton, the Milesians all from youth upwards shaved their heads and
      put on great mourning: for these cities were more than all others of which
      we know bound together by ties of friendship. Not like the Sybarites were
      the Athenians; for these made it clear that they were grieved at the
      capture of Miletos, both in many other ways and also by this, that when
      Phrynichos had composed a drama called the "Capture of Miletos" and had
      put it on the stage, the body of spectators fell to weeping, and the
      Athenians moreover fined the poet a thousand drachmas on the ground that
      he had reminded them of their own calamities; and they ordered also that
      no one in future should represent this drama.
    </p>
<p>
      22. Miletos then had been stripped bare of its former inhabitants: but of
      the Samians they who had substance were by no means satisfied with that
      which had been concerted by the commanders of their fleet with the Medes;
      and taking counsel forthwith after the sea-fight it seemed good to them,
      before their despot Aiakes arrived in the country, to sail away and make a
      colony, and not to stay behind and be slaves of the Medes and of Aiakes:
      for just at this time the people of Zancle in Sicily were sending
      messengers to Ionia and inviting the Ionians to come to the "Fair Strand,"
      <a href="#link6note-1101" id="link6noteref-1101" class="pginternal">1101</a>
      desiring there to found a city of Ionians. Now this which is called the
      Fair Strand is in the land of the Sikelians and on that side of Sicily
      which lies towards Tyrsenia. So when these gave the invitation, the
      Samians alone of all the Ionians set forth, having with them those of the
      Milesians who had escaped: and in the course of this matter it happened as
      follows:—
    </p>
<p>
      23. The Samians as they made their way towards Sicily reached Locroi
      Epizephyroi, and at the same time the people of Zancle, both themselves
      and their king, whose name was Skythes, were encamped about a city of the
      Sikelians, desiring to conquer it. Perceiving these things, Anaxilaos the
      despot of Rhegion, being then at variance with those of Zancle,
      communicated with the Samians and persuaded them that they ought to leave
      the Fair Strand alone, to which they were sailing, and take possession of
      Zancle instead, since it was left now without men to defend it. The
      Samians accordingly did as he said and took possession of Zancle; and upon
      this the men of Zancle, being informed that their city was possessed by an
      enemy, set out to rescue it, and invited Hippocrates the despot of Gela to
      help them, for he was their ally. When however Hippocrates also with his
      army had come up to their rescue, first he put Skythes the ruler of the
      Zanclaians in fetters, on the ground that he had been the cause of the
      city being lost, and together with him his brother Pythogenes, and sent
      them away to the town of Incyos; <a href="#link6note-12" id="link6noteref-12" class="pginternal">12</a> then he betrayed the
      cause of the remaining Zanclaians by coming to terms with the Samians and
      exchanging oaths with them; and in return for this it had been promised by
      the Samians that Hippocrates should receive as his share the half of all
      the movable goods in the city and of the slaves, and the whole of the
      property in the fields round. So the greater number of the Zanclaians he
      put in bonds and kept himself as slaves, but the chief men of them, three
      hundred in number, he gave to the Samians to put to death; which however
      the Samians did not do.
    </p>
<p>
      24. Now Skythes the ruler of the Zanclaians escaped from Incyos to Himera,
      and thence he came to Asia and went up to the court of Dareios: and
      Dareios accounted him the most righteous of all the men who had come up to
      him from Hellas; for he obtained leave of the king and went away to
      Sicily, and again came back from Sicily to the king; and at last he
      brought his life to an end among the Persians in old age and possessing
      great wealth. The Samians then, having got rid of the rule of the Medes,
      had gained for themselves without labour the fair city of Zancle.
    </p>
<p>
      25. After the sea-battle which was fought for Miletos, the Phenicians by
      the command of the Persians restored to Samos Aiakes the son of Syloson,
      since he had been to them of much service and had done for them great
      things; and the Samians alone of all who revolted from Dareios, because of
      the desertion of their ships which were in the sea-fight, <a href="#link6note-13" id="link6noteref-13" class="pginternal">13</a>
      had neither their city nor their temples burnt. Then after the capture of
      Miletos the Persians forthwith got possession of Caria, some of the cities
      having submitted to their power voluntarily, while others of them they
      brought over by force.
    </p>
<p>
      26. Thus it came to pass as regards these matters: and meanwhile Histiaios
      the Milesian, who was at Byzantion and was seizing the merchant vessels of
      the Ionians as they sailed forth out of the Pontus, received the report of
      that which had happened about Miletos. Upon that he entrusted the matters
      which had to do with the Hellespont to Bisaltes the son of Apollophanes, a
      man of Abydos, while he himself with the Lesbians sailed to Chios; and
      when a body of the Chians who were on guard did not allow him to approach,
      he fought with them at that spot in the Chian land which is called the
      "Hollows." <a href="#link6note-14" id="link6noteref-14" class="pginternal">14</a> Histiaios then not only slew many of these,
      but also, taking Polichne of the Chians as his base, he conquered with the
      help of the Lesbians the remainder of the Chians as well, since they had
      suffered great loss by the sea-fight..
    </p>
<p>
      27. And heaven is wont perhaps to give signs beforehand whenever great
      evils are about to happen to a city or a race of men; for to the Chians
      also before these events remarkable signs had come. In the first place
      when they had sent to Delphi a chorus of a hundred youths, two only
      returned home, the remaining ninety-eight of them having been seized by a
      plague and carried off; and then secondly in their city about the same
      time, that is shortly before the sea-fight, as some children were being
      taught <a href="#link6note-15" id="link6noteref-15" class="pginternal">15</a>
      in school the roof fell in upon them, so that of a hundred and twenty
      children only one escaped. These signs God showed to them beforehand; and
      after this the sea-fight came upon them and brought their State down upon
      its knees; and as the Chians had suffered great loss, he without
      difficulty effected the conquest of them.
    </p>
<p>
      28. Thence Histiaios made an expedition against Thasos, taking with him a
      large force of Ionians and Aiolians; and while he was encamped about the
      town of Thasos, a report came to him that the Phenicians were sailing up
      from Miletos to conquer the rest of Ionia. Being informed of this he left
      Thasos unconquered and himself hastened to Lesbos, taking with him his
      whole army. Then, as his army was in want of food, <a href="#link6note-16" id="link6noteref-16" class="pginternal">16</a> he crossed over from
      Lesbos to reap the corn in Atarneus and also that in the plain of the
      Caïcos, which belonged to the Mysians. In these parts there chanced to be
      a Persian named Harpagos commanding a considerable force; and this man
      fought a battle with him after he had landed, and he took Histiaios
      himself prisoner and destroyed the greater part of his army..
    </p>
<p>
      29. And Histiaios was taken prisoner in the following manner:—As the
      Hellenes were fighting with the Persians at Malene in the district of
      Atarneus, after they had been engaged in close combat for a long time, the
      cavalry at length charged and fell upon the Hellenes; and the cavalry in
      fact decided the battle. <a href="#link6note-17" id="link6noteref-17" class="pginternal">17</a> So when the Hellenes had been turned to
      flight, Histiaios trusting that he would not be put to death by the king
      on account of his present fault, conceived a love of life, so that when he
      was being caught in his flight by a Persian and was about to be run
      through by him in the moment of his capture, he spoke in Persian and made
      himself known, saying that he was Histiaios the Milesian..
    </p>
<p>
      30. If then upon being taken prisoner he had been brought to king Dareios,
      he would not, as I think, have suffered any harm, but Dareios would have
      forgiven the crime with which he was charged; as it was, however, for this
      very reason and in order that he might not escape from punishment and
      again become powerful with the king, Artaphrenes the governor of Sardis
      and Harpagos who had captured him, when he had reached Sardis on his way
      to the king, put him to death there and then, and his body they impaled,
      but embalmed his head and brought it up to Dareios at Susa. Dareios having
      been informed of this, found fault with those who had done so, because
      they had not brought him up to his presence alive; and he bade wash the
      head of Histiaios and bestow upon it proper care, and then bury it, as
      that of one who had been greatly a benefactor both of the king himself and
      of the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      31. Thus it happened about Histiaios; and meanwhile the Persian fleet,
      after wintering near Miletos, when it put to sea again in the following
      year conquered without difficulty the islands lying near the mainland,
      Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos; and whenever they took one of the islands, the
      Barbarians, as each was conquered, swept the inhabitants off it; <a href="#link6note-18" id="link6noteref-18" class="pginternal">18</a>
      and this they do in the following manner:—they extend themselves
      from the sea on the North to the sea on the South, each man having hold of
      the hand of the next, and then they pass through the whole island hunting
      the people out of it. They took also the Ionian cities on the mainland in
      the same manner, except that they did not sweep off the inhabitants thus,
      for it was not possible..
    </p>
<p>
      32. Then the commanders of the Persians proved not false to the threats
      with which they had threatened the Ionians when these were encamped
      opposite to them: for in fact when they conquered the cities, they chose
      out the most comely of the boys and castrated them, making eunuchs of
      them, and the fairest of the maidens they carried off by force to the
      king; and not only this, but they also burnt the cities together with the
      temples. Thus for the third time had the Ionians been reduced to slavery,
      first by the Lydians and then twice in succession by the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      33. Departing from Ionia the fleet proceeded to conquer all the places of
      the Hellespont on the left as one sails in, for those on the right had
      been subdued already by the Persians themselves, approaching them by land.
      Now the cities of the Hellespont in Europe are these:—first comes
      the Chersonese, in which there are many cities, then Perinthos, the
      strongholds of the Thracian border, Selymbria, and Byzantion. The people
      of Byzantion and those of Calchedon opposite did not even wait for the
      coming of the Persian ships, but had left their own land first and
      departed, going within the Euxine; and there they settled in the city of
      Mesambria. <a href="#link6note-19" id="link6noteref-19" class="pginternal">19</a> So the Phenicians, having burnt these places
      which have been mentioned, directed their course next to Proconnesos and
      Artake; and when they had delivered these also to the flames, they sailed
      back to the Chersonese to destroy the remaining cities which they had not
      sacked when they touched there before: but against Kyzicos they did not
      sail at all; for the men of Kyzicos even before the time when the
      Phenicians sailed in had submitted to the king of their own accord, and
      had made terms with Oibares the son of Megabazos, the Persian governor at
      Daskyleion. <a href="#link6note-20" id="link6noteref-20" class="pginternal">20</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      34. In the Chersonese then the Phenicians made themselves masters of all
      the other cities except the city of Cardia. Of these cities up to that
      time Miltiades the son of Kimon, the son of Stesagoras, had been despot,
      Miltiades the son of Kypselos having obtained this government in the
      manner which here follows:—The inhabitants of this Chersonese were
      Dolonkian Thracians; and these Dolonkians, being hard pressed in war by
      the Apsinthians, sent their kings to Delphi to consult the Oracle about
      the war. And the Pythian prophetess answered them that they must bring
      into their land as founder of a settlement the man who should first offer
      them hospitality as they returned from the temple. The Dolonkians then
      passed along the Sacred Road through the land of the Phokians and of the
      Boeotians, and as no man invited them, they turned aside and came to
      Athens..
    </p>
<p>
      35. Now at that time in Athens the government was held by Peisistratos,
      but Miltiades also the son of Kypselos had some power, who belonged to a
      family which kept four-horse chariot teams, and who was descended
      originally from Aiacos and Egina, though in more recent times his family
      was Athenian, Philaios the son of Ajax having been the first of his house
      who became an Athenian. This Miltiades was sitting in the entrance of his
      own dwelling, and seeing the Dolonkians going by with dress that was not
      of the native Athenian fashion and with spears, he shouted to them; and
      when they approached, he offered them lodging and hospitality. They then
      having accepted and having been entertained by him, proceeded to declare
      all the utterances of the Oracle; and having declared it they asked him to
      do as the god had said: and Miltiades when he heard it was at once
      disposed to agree, because he was vexed by the rule of Peisistratos and
      desired to be removed out of the way. He set out therefore forthwith to
      Delphi to inquire of the Oracle whether he should do that which the
      Dolonkians asked of him:.
    </p>
<p>
      36, and as the Pythian prophetess also bade him do so, Miltiades the son
      of Kypselos, who had before this been victor at Olympia with a four-horse
      chariot, now taking with him of the Athenians everyone who desired to
      share in the expedition, sailed with the Dolonkians and took possession of
      the land: and they who had invited him to come to them made him despot
      over them. First then he made a wall across the isthmus of the Chersonese
      from the city of Cardia to Pactye, in order that the Apsinthians might not
      be able to invade the land and do them damage. Now the number of furlongs
      <a href="#link6note-21" id="link6noteref-21" class="pginternal">21</a>
      across the isthmus at this place is six-and-thirty, and from this isthmus
      the Chersonese within is altogether four hundred and twenty furlongs in
      length..
    </p>
<p>
      37. Having made a wall then across the neck of the Chersonese and having
      in this manner repelled the Apsinthians, Miltiades made war upon the
      people of Lampsacos first of all others; and the people of Lampsacos laid
      an ambush and took him prisoner. Now Miltiades had come to be a friend <a href="#link6note-22" id="link6noteref-22" class="pginternal">22</a> of
      Croesus the Lydian; and Croesus accordingly, being informed of this event,
      sent and commanded the people of Lampsacos to let Miltiades go; otherwise
      he threatened to destroy them utterly like a pine-tree. <a href="#link6note-23" id="link6noteref-23" class="pginternal">23</a>
      Then when the people of Lampsacos were perplexed in their counsels as to
      what that saying should mean with which Croesus had threatened them,
      namely that he would destroy them utterly like a pine-tree, at length one
      of the elder men with difficulty perceived the truth, and said that a pine
      alone of all trees when it has been cut down does not put forth any
      further growth but perishes, being utterly destroyed. The people of
      Lampsacos therefore fearing Croesus loosed Miltiades and let him go..
    </p>
<p>
      38. He then escaped by means of Croesus, but afterwards he brought his
      life to an end leaving no son to succeed him, but passing over his rule
      and his possessions to Stesagoras, who was the son of Kimon, his brother
      on the mother's side: <a href="#link6note-24" id="link6noteref-24" class="pginternal">24</a> and the people of the Chersonese still offer
      sacrifices to him after his death as it is usual to do to a founder, and
      hold in his honour a contest of horse-races and athletic exercises, in
      which none of the men of Lampsacos are allowed to contend. After this
      there was war with those of Lampsacos; and it happened to Stesagoras also
      that he died without leaving a son, having been struck on the head with an
      axe in the City Hall by a man who pretended to be a deserter, but who
      proved himself to be in fact an enemy and a rather hot one moreover..
    </p>
<p>
      39. Then after Stesagoras also had ended his life in this manner,
      Miltiades son of Kimon and brother of that Stesagoras who was dead, was
      sent in a trireme to the Chersonese to take possession of the government
      by the sons of Peisistratos, who had dealt well with him at Athens also,
      pretending that they had had no share in the death of his father Kimon, of
      which in another part of the history I will set forth how it came to pass.
      <a href="#link6note-25" id="link6noteref-25" class="pginternal">25</a>
      Now Miltiades, when he came to the Chersonese, kept himself within his
      house, paying honours in all appearance <a href="#link6note-26" id="link6noteref-26" class="pginternal">26</a> to the memory of his
      brother Stesagoras; and the chief men of the inhabitants of the Chersonese
      in every place, being informed of this, gathered themselves together from
      all the cities and came in a body to condole with him, and when they had
      come they were laid in bonds by him. Miltiades then was in possession of
      the Chersonese, supporting a body of five hundred mercenary troops; and he
      married the daughter of Oloros the king of the Thracians, who was named
      Hegesipyle.
    </p>
<p>
      40. Now this Miltiades son of Kimon had at the time of which we speak but
      lately returned <a href="#link6note-27" id="link6noteref-27" class="pginternal">27</a> to the Chersonese; and after he had returned,
      there befell him other misfortunes worse than those which had befallen him
      already; for two years before this he had been a fugitive out of the land
      from the Scythians, since the nomad Scythians provoked by king Dareios had
      joined all in a body and marched as far as this Chersonese, and Miltiades
      had not awaited their attack but had become a fugitive from the
      Chersonese, until at last the Scythians departed and the Dolonkians
      brought him back again. These things happened two years before the
      calamities which now oppressed him:.
    </p>
<p>
      41, and now, being informed that the Phenicians were at Tenedos, he filled
      five triremes with the property which he had at hand and sailed away for
      Athens. And having set out from the city of Cardia he was sailing through
      the gulf of Melas; and as he passed along by the shore of the Chersonese,
      the Phenicians fell in with his ships, and while Miltiades himself with
      four of his ships escaped to Imbros, the fifth of his ships was captured
      in the pursuit by the Phenicians. Of this ship it chanced that Metiochos
      the eldest of the sons of Miltiades was in command, not born of the
      daughter of Oloros the Thracian, but of another woman. Him the Phenicians
      captured together with his ship; and being informed about him, that he was
      the son of Miltiades, they brought him up to the king, supposing that they
      would lay up for themselves a great obligation; because it was Miltiades
      who had declared as his opinion to the Ionians that they should do as the
      Scythians said, at that time when the Scythians requested them to break up
      the bridge of boats and sail away to their own land. Dareios however, when
      the Phenicians brought up to him Metiochos the son of Miltiades, did
      Metiochos no harm but on the contrary very much good; for he gave him a
      house and possessions and a Persian wife, by whom he had children born who
      have been ranked as Persians. Miltiades meanwhile came from Imbros to
      Athens.
    </p>
<p>
      42. In the course of this year there was done by the Persians nothing more
      which tended to strife with the Ionians, but these things which follow
      were done in this year very much to their advantage.—Artaphrenes the
      governor of Sardis sent for envoys from all the cities and compelled the
      Ionians to make agreements among themselves, so that they might give
      satisfaction for wrongs and not plunder one another's land. This he
      compelled them to do, and also he measured their territories by parasangs,—that
      is the name which the Persians give to the length of thirty furlongs, <a href="#link6note-28" id="link6noteref-28" class="pginternal">28</a>—he
      measured, I say, by these, and appointed a certain amount of tribute for
      each people, which continues still unaltered from that time even to my own
      days, as it was appointed by Artaphrenes; and the tribute was appointed to
      be nearly of the same amount for each as it had been before..
    </p>
<p>
      43. These were things which tended to peace for the Ionians; but at the
      beginning of the spring, the other commanders having all been removed by
      the king, Mardonios the son of Gobryas came down to the sea, bringing with
      him a very large land-army and a very large naval force, being a young man
      and lately married to Artozostra daughter of king Dareios. When Mardonios
      leading this army came to Kilikia, he embarked on board a ship himself and
      proceeded together with the other ships, while other leaders led the
      land-army to the Hellespont. Mardonios however sailing along the coast of
      Asia came to Ionia: and here I shall relate a thing which will be a great
      marvel to those of the Hellenes who do not believe that to the seven men
      of the Persians Otanes declared as his opinion that the Persians ought to
      have popular rule; <a href="#link6note-29" id="link6noteref-29" class="pginternal">29</a> for Mardonios deposed all the despots of the
      Ionians and established popular governments in the cities. Having so done
      he hastened on to the Hellespont; and when there was collected a vast
      number of ships and a large land-army, they crossed over the Hellespont in
      the ships and began to make their way through Europe, and their way was
      directed against Eretria and Athens..
    </p>
<p>
      44. These, I say, furnished them the pretence for the expedition, but they
      had it in their minds to subdue as many as they could of the Hellenic
      cities; and in the first place they subdued with their ships the Thasians,
      who did not even raise a hand to defend themselves: then with the
      land-army they gained the Macedonians to be their servants in addition to
      those whom they had already; for all the nations on the East of the
      Macedonians <a href="#link6note-30" id="link6noteref-30" class="pginternal">30</a> had become subject to them already before
      this. Crossing over then from Thasos to the opposite coast, they proceeded
      on their way near the land as far as Acanthos, and then starting from
      Acanthos they attempted to get round Mount Athos; but as they sailed
      round, there fell upon them a violent North Wind, against which they could
      do nothing, and handled them very roughly, casting away very many of their
      ships on Mount Athos. It is said indeed that the number of the ships
      destroyed was three hundred, <a href="#link6note-3001" id="link6noteref-3001" class="pginternal">3001</a>, and more than
      twenty thousand men; for as this sea which is about Athos is very full of
      sea monsters, some were seized by these and so perished, while others were
      dashed against the rocks; and some of them did not know how to swim and
      perished for that cause, others again by reason of cold..
    </p>
<p>
      45. Thus fared the fleet; and meanwhile Mardonios and the land-army while
      encamping in Macedonia were attacked in the night by the Brygian
      Thracians, and many of them were slain by the Brygians and Mardonios
      himself was wounded. However not even these escaped being enslaved by the
      Persians, for Mardonios did not depart from that region until he had made
      them subject. But when he had subdued these, he proceeded to lead his army
      back, since he had suffered great loss with his land-army in fighting
      against the Brygians and with his fleet in going round Athos. So this
      expedition departed back to Asia having gained no honour by its contests.
    </p>
<p>
      46. In the next year after this Dareios first sent a messenger to the men
      of Thasos, who had been accused by their neighbours of planning revolt,
      and bade them take away the wall around their town and bring their ships
      to Abdera. The Thasians in fact, as they had been besieged by Histiaios
      the Milesian and at the same time had large revenues coming in, were using
      their money in building ships of war and in surrounding their city with a
      stronger wall. Now the revenues came to them from the mainland and from
      the mines: from the gold-mines in Scapte Hyle <a href="#link6note-31" id="link6noteref-31" class="pginternal">31</a> there came in generally
      eighty talents a year, and from those in Thasos itself a smaller amount
      than this but so much that in general the Thasians, without taxes upon the
      produce of their soil, had a revenue from the mainland and from the mines
      amounting yearly to two hundred talents, and when the amount was highest,
      to three hundred..
    </p>
<p>
      47. I myself saw these mines, and by much the most marvellous of them were
      those which the Phenicians discovered, who made the first settlement in
      this island in company with Thasos; and the island had the name which it
      now has from this Thasos the Phenician. These Phenician mines are in that
      part of Thasos which is between the places called Ainyra and Koinyra and
      opposite Samothrake, where there is a great mountain which has been all
      turned up in the search for metal. Thus it is with this matter: and the
      Thasians on the command of the king both razed their walls and brought all
      their ships to Abdera.
    </p>
<p>
      48. After this Dareios began to make trial of the Hellenes, what they
      meant to do, whether to make war with him or to deliver themselves up. He
      sent abroad heralds therefore, and appointed them to go some to one place
      and others to another throughout Hellas, bidding them demand earth and
      water for the king. These, I say, he sent to Hellas; and meanwhile he was
      sending abroad other heralds to his own tributary cities which lay upon
      the sea-coast, and he bade them have ships of war built and also vessels
      to carry horses..
    </p>
<p>
      49. They then were engaged in preparing these things; and meanwhile when
      the heralds had come to Hellas, many of those who dwelt upon the mainland
      gave that for which the Persian made demand, <a href="#link6note-32" id="link6noteref-32" class="pginternal">32</a> and all those who dwelt
      in the islands did so, to whomsoever they came to make their demand. The
      islanders, I say, gave earth and water to Dareios, and among them also
      those of Egina, and when these had done so, the Athenians went forthwith
      urgent against them, supposing that the Eginetans had given with hostile
      purpose against themselves, in order to make an expedition against them in
      combination with the Persians; and also they were glad to get hold of an
      occasion against them. Accordingly they went backward and forwards to
      Sparta and accused the Eginetans of that which they had done, as having
      proved themselves traitors to Hellas..
    </p>
<p>
      50. In consequence of this accusation Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides,
      king of the Spartans, crossed over to Egina meaning to seize those of the
      Eginetans who were the most guilty; but as he was attempting to seize
      them, certain of the Eginetans opposed him, and among them especially
      Crios the son of Polycritos, who said that he should not with impunity
      carry off a single Eginetan, for he was doing this (said he) without
      authority from the Spartan State, having been persuaded to it by the
      Athenians with money; otherwise he would have come and seized them in
      company with the other king: and this he said by reason of a message
      received from Demaratos. Cleomenes then as he departed from Egina, asked
      Crios <a href="#link6note-33" id="link6noteref-33" class="pginternal">33</a>
      what was his name, and he told him the truth; and Cleomenes said to him:
      "Surely now, O Ram, thou must cover over thy horns with bronze for thou
      wilt shortly have a great trouble to contend with."
    </p>
<p>
      51. Meanwhile Demaratos the son of Ariston was staying behind in Sparta
      and bringing charges against Cleomenes, he also being king of the Spartans
      but of the inferior house; which however is inferior in no other way (for
      it is descended from the same ancestor), but the house of Eurysthenes has
      always been honoured more, apparently because he was the elder brother..
    </p>
<p>
      52. For the Lacedemonians, who herein agree with none of the poets, say
      that Aristodemos the son of Aristomachos, the son of Cleodaios, the son of
      Hyllos, being their king, led them himself (and not the sons of
      Aristodemos) to this land which they now possess. Then after no long time
      the wife of Aristodemos, whose name was Argeia,—she was the
      daughter, they say, of Autesion, the son of Tisamenes, the son of
      Thersander, the son of Polyneikes,—she, it is said, brought forth
      twins; and Aristodemos lived but to see his children and then ended his
      life by sickness. So the Lacedemonians of that time resolved according to
      established custom to make the elder of the children their king; but they
      did not know which of them they should take, because they were like one
      another and of equal size; and when they were not able to make out, or
      even before this, they inquired of their mother; and she said that even
      she herself did not know one from the other. She said this, although she
      knew in truth very well, because she desired that by some means both might
      be made kings. The Lacedemonians then were in a strait; and being in a
      strait they sent to Delphi to inquire what they should do in the matter.
      And the Pythian prophetess bade them regard both children as their kings,
      but honour most the first in age. <a href="#link6note-34" id="link6noteref-34" class="pginternal">34</a> The prophetess, they
      say, thus gave answer to them; and when the Lacedemonians were at a loss
      none the less how to find out the elder of them, a Messenian whose name
      was Panites made a suggestion to them: this Panites, I say, suggested to
      the Lacedemonians that they should watch the mother and see which of the
      children she washed and fed before the other; and if she was seen to do
      this always in the same order, then they would have all that they were
      seeking and desiring to find out, but if she too was uncertain and did it
      in a different order at different times, it would be plain to them that
      even she had no more knowledge than any other, and they must turn to some
      other way. Then the Spartans following the suggestion of the Messenian
      watched the mother of the sons of Aristodemos and found that she gave
      honour thus to the first-born both in feeding and in washing; for she did
      not know with that design she was being watched. They took therefore the
      child which was honoured by its mother and brought it up as the first-born
      in the public hall, <a href="#link6note-35" id="link6noteref-35" class="pginternal">35</a> and to it was given the name of Eurysthenes,
      while the other was called Procles. These, when they had grown up, both
      themselves were at variance, they say, with one another, though they were
      brothers, throughout the whole time of their lives, and their descendants
      also continued after the same manner.
    </p>
<p>
      53. This is the report given by the Lacedemonians alone of all the
      Hellenes; but this which follows I write in accordance with that which is
      reported by the Hellenes generally,—I mean that the names of these
      kings of the Dorians are rightly enumerated by the Hellenes up to Perseus
      the son of Danae (leaving the god out of account), <a href="#link6note-36" id="link6noteref-36" class="pginternal">36</a> and proved to be of
      Hellenic race; for even from that time they were reckoned as Hellenes. I
      said "up to Perseus" and did not take the descent from a yet higher point,
      because there is no name mentioned of a mortal father for Perseus, as
      Amphitryon is for Heracles. Therefore with reason, as is evident, I have
      said "rightly up to Perseus"; but if one enumerates their ancestors in
      succession going back from Danae the daughter of Acrisios, the rulers of
      the Dorians will prove to be Egyptians by direct descent..
    </p>
<p>
      54. Thus I have traced the descent according to the account given by the
      Hellenes; but as the story is reported which the Persians tell, Perseus
      himself was an Assyrian and became a Hellene, whereas the ancestors of
      Perseus were not Hellenes; and as for the ancestors of Acrisios, who
      (according to this account) belonged not to Perseus in any way by kinship,
      they say that these were, as the Hellenes report, Egyptians..
    </p>
<p>
      55. Let it suffice to have said so much about these matters; and as to the
      question how and by what exploits being Egyptians they received the
      sceptres of royalty over the Dorians, we will omit these things, since
      others have told about them; but the things with which other narrators
      have not dealt, of these I will make mention.
    </p>
<p>
      56. These are the royal rights which have been given by the Spartans to
      their kings, namely, two priesthoods, of Zeus Lakedaimon and Zeus Uranios;
      <a href="#link6note-37" id="link6noteref-37" class="pginternal">37</a>
      and the right of making war against whatsoever land they please, and that
      no man of the Spartans shall hinder this right, or if he do, he shall be
      subject to the curse; and that when they go on expeditions the kings shall
      go out first and return last; that a hundred picked men shall be their
      guard upon expeditions; and that they shall use in their goings forth to
      war as many cattle as they desire, and take both the hides and the backs
      of all that are sacrificed..
    </p>
<p>
      57. These are their privileges in war; and in peace moreover things have
      been assigned to them as follows:—if any sacrifice is performed at
      the public charge, it is the privilege of the kings to sit down at the
      feast before all others, and that the attendants shall begin with them
      first, and serve to each of them a portion of everything double of that
      which is given to the other guests, and that they shall have the first
      pouring of libations and the hides of the animals slain in sacrifice; that
      on every new moon and seventh day of the month there shall be delivered at
      the public charge to each one of these a full-grown victim in the temple
      of Apollo, and a measure <a href="#link6note-38" id="link6noteref-38" class="pginternal">38</a> of barley-groats and a Laconian "quarter" <a href="#link6note-39" id="link6noteref-39" class="pginternal">39</a> of
      wine; and that at all the games they shall have seats of honour specially
      set apart for them: moreover it is their privilege to appoint as
      protectors of strangers <a href="#link6note-40" id="link6noteref-40" class="pginternal">40</a> whomsoever they will of the citizens, and to
      choose each two "Pythians:" now the Pythians are men sent to consult the
      god at Delphi, and they eat with the kings at the public charge. And if
      the kings do not come to the dinner, it is the rule that there shall be
      sent out for them to their houses two quarts <a href="#link6note-41" id="link6noteref-41" class="pginternal">41</a> of barley-groats for
      each one and half a pint <a href="#link6note-42" id="link6noteref-42" class="pginternal">42</a> of wine; but if they are present, double
      shares of everything shall be given them, and moreover they shall be
      honoured in this same manner when they have been invited to dinner by
      private persons. The kings also, it is ordained, shall have charge of the
      oracles which are given, but the Pythians also shall have knowledge of
      them. It is the rule moreover that the kings alone give decision on the
      following cases only, that is to say, about the maiden who inherits her
      father's property, namely who ought to have her, if her father have not
      betrothed her to any one, and about public ways; also if any man desires
      to adopt a son, he must do it in presence of the kings: and it is ordained
      that they shall sit in council with the Senators, who are in number
      eight-and-twenty, and if they do not come, those of the Senators who are
      most closely related to them shall have the privileges of the kings and
      give two votes besides their own, making three in all. <a href="#link6note-4201" id="link6noteref-4201" class="pginternal">4201</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      58. These rights have been assigned to the kings for their lifetime by the
      Spartan State; and after they are dead these which follow:—horsemen
      go round and announce that which has happened throughout the whole of the
      Laconian land, and in the city women go about and strike upon a copper
      kettle. Whenever this happens so, two free persons of each household must
      go into mourning, a man and a woman, and for those who fail to do this
      great penalties are appointed. Now the custom of the Lacedemonians about
      the deaths of their kings is the same as that of the Barbarians who dwell
      in Asia, for most of the Barbarians practise the same customs as regards
      the death of their kings. Whensoever a king of the Lacedemonians is dead,
      then from the whole territory of Lacedemon, not reckoning the Spartans, a
      certain fixed number of the "dwellers round" <a href="#link6note-43" id="link6noteref-43" class="pginternal">43</a> are compelled to go to
      the funeral ceremony:
    </p>
<p>
      59. and when there have been gathered together of these and of the Helots
      and of the Spartans themselves many thousands in the same place, with
      their women intermingled, they beat their foreheads with a good will and
      make lamentation without stint, saying that this one who has died last of
      their kings was the best of all: and whenever any of their kings has been
      killed in war, they prepare an image to represent him, laid upon a couch
      with fair coverings, and carry it out to be buried. Then after they have
      buried him, no assembly is held among them for ten days, nor is there any
      meeting for choice of magistrates, but they have mourning during these
      days. In another respect too these resemble the Persians; that is to say,
      when the king is dead and another is appointed king, this king who is
      newly coming in sets free any man of the Spartans who was a debtor to the
      king or to the State; while among the Persians the king who comes to the
      throne remits to all the cities the arrears of tribute which are due.
    </p>
<p>
      60. In the following point also the Lacedemonians resemble the Egyptians;
      that is to say, their heralds and fluteplayers and cooks inherit the
      crafts of their fathers, and a fluteplayer is the son of a fluteplayer, a
      cook of a cook, and a herald of a herald; other men do not lay hands upon
      the office because they have loud and clear voices, and so shut them out
      of it, but they practise their craft by inheritance from their fathers.
    </p>
<p>
      61. Thus are these things done: and at this time of which we speak, <a href="#link6note-44" id="link6noteref-44" class="pginternal">44</a>
      while Cleomenes was in Egina doing deeds <a href="#link6note-45" id="link6noteref-45" class="pginternal">45</a> which were for the
      common service of Hellas, Demaratos brought charges against him, not so
      much because he cared for the Eginetans as because he felt envy and
      jealousy of him. Then Cleomenes, after he returned from Egina, planned to
      depose Demaratos from being king, making an attempt upon him on account of
      this matter which follows:—Ariston being king in Sparta and having
      married two wives, yet had no children born to him; and since he did not
      acknowledge that he himself was the cause of this, he married a third
      wife; and he married her thus:—he had a friend, a man of the
      Spartans, to whom of all the citizens Ariston was most inclined; and it
      chanced that this man had a wife who was of all the women in Sparta the
      fairest by far, and one too who had become the fairest from having been
      the foulest. For as she was mean in her aspect, her nurse, considering
      that she was the daughter of wealthy persons and was of uncomely aspect,
      and seeing moreover that her parents were troubled by it,—perceiving
      I say these things, her nurse devised as follows:—every day she bore
      her to the temple of Helen, which is in the place called Therapne, lying
      above the temple of Phoebus; and whenever the nurse bore her thither, she
      placed her before the image and prayed the goddess to deliver the child
      from her unshapeliness. And once as the nurse was going away out of the
      temple, it is said that a woman appeared to her, and having appeared asked
      her what she was bearing in her arms; and she told her that she was
      bearing a child; upon which the other bade her show the child to her, but
      she refused, for it had been forbidden to her by the parents to show it to
      any one: but the woman continued to urge her by all means to show it to
      her. So then perceiving that the woman earnestly desired to see it, the
      nurse showed her the child. Then the woman stroking the head of the child
      said that she should be the fairest of all the women in Sparta; and from
      that day her aspect was changed. Afterwards when she came to the age for
      marriage, she was married to Agetos the son of Alkeides, this friend of
      Ariston of whom we spoke..
    </p>
<p>
      62. Now Ariston it seems was ever stung by the desire of this woman, and
      accordingly he contrived as follows:—he made an engagement himself
      with his comrade, whose wife this woman was, that he would give him as a
      gift one thing of his own possessions, whatsoever he should choose, and he
      bade his comrade make return to him in similar fashion. He therefore,
      fearing nothing for his wife, because he saw that Ariston also had a wife,
      agreed to this; and on these terms they imposed oaths on one another.
      After this Ariston on his part gave that which Agetos had chosen from the
      treasures of Ariston, whatever the thing was; and he himself, seeking to
      obtain from him the like return, endeavoured then to take away the wife of
      his comrade from him: and he said that he consented to give anything else
      except this one thing only, but at length being compelled by the oath and
      by the treacherous deception, <a href="#link6note-46" id="link6noteref-46" class="pginternal">46</a> he allowed her to be
      taken away from him..
    </p>
<p>
      63. Thus had Ariston brought into his house the third wife, having
      dismissed the second: and this wife, not having fulfilled the ten months
      <a href="#link6note-47" id="link6noteref-47" class="pginternal">47</a>
      but in a shorter period of time, bore him that Demaratos of whom we were
      speaking; and one of his servants reported to him as he was sitting in
      council <a href="#link6note-48" id="link6noteref-48" class="pginternal">48</a>
      with the Ephors, that a son had been born to him. He then, knowing the
      time when he took to him his wife, and reckoning the months upon his
      fingers, said, denying with an oath, "The child would not be mine." This
      the Ephors heard, but they thought it a matter of no importance at the
      moment; and the child grew up and Ariston repented of that which he had
      said, for he thought Demaratos was certainly his own son; and he gave him
      the name "Demaratos" for this reason, namely because before these things
      took place the Spartan people all in a body <a href="#link6note-49" id="link6noteref-49" class="pginternal">49</a> had made a vow <a href="#link6note-50" id="link6noteref-50" class="pginternal">50</a>
      praying that a son might be born to Ariston, as one who was pre-eminent in
      renown over all the kings who had ever arisen in Sparta.
    </p>
<p>
      64. For this reason the name Demaratos <a href="#link6note-51" id="link6noteref-51" class="pginternal">51</a> was given to him. And
      as time went on Ariston died, and Demaratos obtained the kingdom: but it
      was fated apparently that these things should become known and should
      cause Demaratos to be deposed from the kingdom; and therefore <a href="#link6note-52" id="link6noteref-52" class="pginternal">52</a>
      Demaratos came to be at variance greatly with Cleomenes both at the former
      time when he withdrew his army from Eleusis, and also now especially, when
      Cleomenes had crossed over to take those of the Eginetans who had gone
      over to the Medes..
    </p>
<p>
      65. Cleomenes then, being anxious to take vengeance on him, concerted
      matters with Leotychides the son of Menares, the son of Agis, who was of
      the same house as Demaratos, under condition that if he should set him up
      as king instead of Demaratos, he would go with him against the Eginetans.
      Now Leotychides had become a bitter foe of Demaratos on account of this
      matter which follows:—Leotychides had betrothed himself to Percalos
      the daughter of Chilon son of Demarmenos; and Demaratos plotted against
      him and deprived Leotychides of his marriage, carrying off Percalos
      himself beforehand, and getting her for his wife. Thus had arisen the
      enmity of Leotychides against Demaratos; and now by the instigation of
      Cleomenes Leotychides deposed against Demaratos, saying that he was not
      rightfully reigning over the Spartans, not being a son of Ariston: and
      after this deposition he prosecuted a suit against him, recalling the old
      saying which Ariston uttered at the time when his servant reported to him
      that a son was born to him, and he reckoning up the months denied with an
      oath, saying that it was not his. Taking his stand upon this utterance,
      Leotychides proceeded to prove that Demaratos was not born of Ariston nor
      was rightfully reigning over Sparta; and he produced as witnesses those
      Ephors who chanced then to have been sitting with Ariston in council and
      to have heard him say this..
    </p>
<p>
      66. At last, as there was contention about those matters, the Spartans
      resolved to ask the Oracle at Delphi whether Demaratos was the son of
      Ariston. The question then having been referred by the arrangement of
      Cleomenes to the Pythian prophetess, thereupon Cleomenes gained over to
      his side Cobon the son of Aristophantos, who had most power among the
      Delphians, and Cobin persuaded Perialla the prophetess of the Oracle <a href="#link6note-53" id="link6noteref-53" class="pginternal">53</a> to
      say that which Cleomenes desired to have said. Thus the Pythian
      prophetess, when those who were sent to consult the god asked her their
      question, gave decision that Demaratos was not the son of Ariston.
      Afterwards however these things became known, and both Cobon went into
      exile from Delphi and Perialla the prophetess of the Oracle was removed
      from her office.
    </p>
<p>
      67. With regard to the deposing of Demaratos from the kingdom it happened
      thus: but Demaratos became an exile from Sparta to the Medes on account of
      a reproach which here follows:—After he had been deposed from the
      kingdom Demaratos was holding a public office to which he had been
      elected. Now it was the time of the Gymnopaidiai; and as Demaratos was a
      spectator of them, Leotychides, who had now become king himself instead of
      Demaratos, sent his attendant and asked Demaratos in mockery and insult
      what kind of a thing it was to be a magistrate after having been king; and
      he vexed at the question made answer and said that he himself had now had
      experience of both, but Leotychides had not; this question however, he
      said, would be the beginning either of countless evil or countless good
      fortune for the Lacedemonians. Having thus said, he veiled his head and
      went forth out of the theatre to his own house; and forthwith he made
      preparations and sacrificed an ox to Zeus, and after having sacrificed he
      called his mother..
    </p>
<p>
      68. Then when his mother had come, he put into her hands some of the inner
      parts <a href="#link6note-54" id="link6noteref-54" class="pginternal">54</a>
      of the victim, and besought her, saying as follows: "Mother, I beseech
      thee, appealing to the other gods and above all to this Zeus the guardian
      of the household, <a href="#link6note-55" id="link6noteref-55" class="pginternal">55</a> to tell me the truth, who is really and truly
      my father. For Leotychides spoke in his contention with me, saying that
      thou didst come to Ariston with child by thy former husband; and others
      besides, reporting that which is doubtless an idle tale, <a href="#link6note-56" id="link6noteref-56" class="pginternal">56</a>
      say that thou didst go in to one of the servants, namely the keeper of the
      asses, and that I am his son. I therefore entreat thee by the gods to tell
      me the truth; for if thou hast done any of these things which are
      reported, thou hast not done them alone, but with many other women; and
      the report is commonly believed in Sparta that there was not in Ariston
      seed which should beget children; for if so, then his former wives also
      would have borne children.".
    </p>
<p>
      69. Thus he spoke, and she made answer as follows: "My son, since thou
      dost beseech me with entreaties to speak the truth, the whole truth shall
      be told to thee. When Ariston had brought me into his house, on the third
      night <a href="#link6note-57" id="link6noteref-57" class="pginternal">57</a>
      there came to me an apparition in the likeness of Ariston, and having lain
      with me it put upon me the garlands which it had on; and the apparition
      straitway departed, and after this Ariston came; and when he saw me with
      garlands, he asked who it was who had given me them; and I said that he
      had given them, but he did not admit it; and I began to take oath of it,
      saying that he did not well to deny it, for he had come (I said) a short
      time before and had lain with me and given me the garlands. Then Ariston,
      seeing that I made oath of it, perceived that the matter was of the gods;
      and first the garlands were found to be from the hero-temple which stands
      by the outer door of the house, which they call the temple of Astrabacos,
      <a href="#link6note-58" id="link6noteref-58" class="pginternal">58</a>
      and secondly the diviners gave answer that it was this same hero. Thus, my
      son, thou hast all, as much as thou desirest to learn; for either thou art
      begotten of this hero and the hero Astrabacos is thy father, or Ariston is
      thy father, for on that night I conceived thee: but as to that wherein thy
      foes most take hold of thee, saying that Ariston himself, when thy birth
      was announced to him, in the hearing of many declared that thou wert not
      his son, because the time, the ten months namely, had not yet been
      fulfilled, in ignorance of such matters he cast forth that saying; for
      women bring forth children both at the ninth month and also at the
      seventh, and not all after they have completed ten months; and I bore
      thee, my son, at the seventh month: and Ariston himself also perceived
      after no long time that he had uttered this saying in folly. Do not thou
      then accept any other reports about thy begetting, for thou hast heard in
      all the full truth; but to Leotychides and to those who report these
      things may their wives bear children by keepers of asses!"
    </p>
<p>
      70. Thus she spoke; and he, having learnt that which he desired to learn,
      took supplies for travelling and set forth to go to Elis, pretending that
      he was going to Delphi to consult the Oracle: but the Lacedemonians,
      suspecting that he was attempting to escape, pursued after him; and it
      chanced that before they came Demaratos had passed over to Zakynthos from
      Elis; and the Lacedemonians crossing over after him laid hands on his
      person and carried away his attendants from him. Afterwards however, since
      those of Zakynthos refused to give him up, he passed over from thence to
      Asia, to the presence of king Dareios; and Dareios both received him with
      great honour as a guest, and also gave him land and cities. Thus Demaratos
      had come to Asia, and such was the fortune which he had had, having been
      distinguished in the estimation of the Lacedemonians <a href="#link6note-59" id="link6noteref-59" class="pginternal">59</a> in
      many other ways both by deeds and by counsels, and especially having
      gained for them an Olympic victory with the four-horse chariot, being the
      only one who achieved this of all the kings who ever arose in Sparta.
    </p>
<p>
      71. Demaratos being deposed, Leotychides the son of Menares succeeded to
      the kingdom; and he had born to him a son Zeuxidemos, whom some of the
      Spartans called Kyniscos. This Zeuxidemos did not become king of Sparta,
      for he died before Leotychides, leaving a son Archidemos: and Leotychides
      having lost Zeuxidemos married a second wife Eurydame, the sister of
      Menios and daughter of Diactorides, by whom he had no male issue, but a
      daughter Lampito, whom Archidemos the son of Zeuxidemos took in marriage,
      she being given to him by Leotychides..
    </p>
<p>
      72. Leotychides however did not himself <a href="#link6note-60" id="link6noteref-60" class="pginternal">60</a> live to old age in
      Sparta, but paid a retribution for Demaratos as follows:—he went as
      commander of the Lacedemonians to invade Thessaly, and when he might have
      reduced all to subjection, he accepted gifts of money amounting to a large
      sum; and being taken in the act there in the camp, as he was sitting upon
      a glove full of money, he was brought to trial and banished from Sparta,
      and his house was razed to the ground. So he went into exile to Tegea and
      ended his life there..
    </p>
<p>
      73. These things happened later; but at this time, when Cleomenes had
      brought to a successful issue the affair which concerned Demaratos,
      forthwith he took with him Leotychides and went against the Eginetans,
      being very greatly enraged with them because of their insults towards him.
      So the Eginetans on their part, since both the kings had come against
      them, thought fit no longer to resist; and the Spartans selected ten men
      who were the most considerable among the Eginetans both by wealth and by
      birth, and took them away as prisoners, and among others also Crios <a href="#link6note-61" id="link6noteref-61" class="pginternal">61</a>
      the son of Polycritos and Casambos the son of Aristocrates, who had the
      greatest power among them; and having taken these away to the land of
      Attica, they deposited them as a charge with the Athenians, who were the
      bitterest enemies of the Eginetans.
    </p>
<p>
      74. After this Cleomenes, since it had become known that he had devised
      evil against Demaratos, was seized by fear of the Spartans and retired to
      Thessaly. Thence he came to Arcadia, and began to make mischief <a href="#link6note-62" id="link6noteref-62" class="pginternal">62</a>
      and to combine the Arcadians against Sparta; and besides other oaths with
      which he caused them to swear that they would assuredly follow him
      whithersoever he should lead them, he was very desirous also to bring the
      chiefs of the Arcadians to the city of Nonacris and cause them to swear by
      the water of Styx; for near this city it is said by the Arcadians <a href="#link6note-63" id="link6noteref-63" class="pginternal">63</a>
      that there is the water of Styx, and there is in fact something of this
      kind: a small stream of water is seen to trickle down from a rock into a
      hollow ravine, and round the ravine runs a wall of rough stones. Now
      Nonacris, where it happens that this spring is situated, is a city of
      Arcadia near Pheneos..
    </p>
<p>
      75. The Lacedemonians, hearing that Cleomenes was acting thus, were
      afraid, and proceeded to bring him back to Sparta to rule on the same
      terms as before: but when he had come back, forthwith a disease of madness
      seized him (who had been even before this somewhat insane <a href="#link6note-64" id="link6noteref-64" class="pginternal">64</a>),
      and whenever he met any of the Spartans, he dashed his staff against the
      man's face. And as he continued to do this and had gone quite out of his
      senses, his kinsmen bound him in stocks. Then being so bound, and seeing
      his warder left alone by the rest, he asked him for a knife; and the
      warder not being at first willing to give it, he threatened him with that
      which he would do to him afterwards if he did not; until at last the
      warder fearing the threats, for he was one of the Helots, gave him a
      knife. Then Cleomenes, when he had received the steel, began to maltreat
      himself from the legs upwards: for he went on cutting his flesh lengthways
      from the legs to the thighs and from the thighs to the loins and flanks,
      until at last he came to the belly; and cutting this into strips he died
      in that manner. And this happened, as most of the Hellenes report, because
      he persuaded the Pythian prophetess to advise that which was done about
      Demaratos; but as the Athenians alone report, it was because when he
      invaded Eleusis he laid waste the sacred enclosure of the goddesses; <a href="#link6note-65" id="link6noteref-65" class="pginternal">65</a>
      and according to the report of the Argives, because from their sanctuary
      dedicated to Argos he caused to come down those of the Argives who had
      fled for refuge from the battle and slew them, and also set fire to the
      grove itself, holding it in no regard..
    </p>
<p>
      76. For when Cleomenes was consulting the Oracle at Delphi, the answer was
      given him that he should conquer Argos; so he led the Spartans and came to
      the river Erasinos, which is said to flow from the Stymphalian lake; for
      this lake, they say, running out into a viewless chasm, appears again
      above ground in the land of Argos; and from thence onwards this water is
      called by the Argives Erasinos: having come, I say, to this river,
      Cleomenes did sacrifice to it; and since the sacrifices were not at all
      favourable for him to cross over, he said that he admired the Erasinos for
      not betraying the men of its country, but the Argives should not even so
      escape. After this he retired back from thence and led his army down to
      Thyrea; and having done sacrifice to the Sea by slaying a bull, he brought
      them in ships to the land of Tiryns and Nauplia..
    </p>
<p>
      77. Being informed of this, the Argives came to the rescue towards the
      sea; and when they had got near Tiryns and were at the place which is
      called Hesipeia, <a href="#link6note-66" id="link6noteref-66" class="pginternal">66</a> they encamped opposite to the Lacedemonians
      leaving no very wide space between the armies. There the Argives were not
      afraid of the open fighting, but only lest they should be conquered by
      craft; for to this they thought referred the oracle which the Pythian
      prophetess gave in common to these and to the Milesians, <a href="#link6note-67" id="link6noteref-67" class="pginternal">67</a>
      saying as follows:
    </p>
<pre>
 "But when the female at length shall conquer the male in the battle,
  Conquer and drive him forth, and glory shall gain among Argives,
  Then many wives of the Argives shall tear both cheeks in their mourning;
  So that a man shall say some time, of the men that came after,
  'Quelled by the spear it perished, the three-coiled terrible serpent,'
</pre>
<p>
      The conjunction of all these things caused fear to the Argives, and with a
      view to this they resolved to make use of the enemy's herald; and having
      so resolved they proceeded to do as follows:—whenever the Spartan
      herald proclaimed anything to the Lacedemonians, the Argives also did that
      same thing..
    </p>
<p>
      78. So Cleomenes, perceiving that the Argives were doing whatever the
      herald of the Lacedemonians proclaimed, passed the word to the
      Lacedemonians that when the herald should proclaim that they were to get
      breakfast, then they should take up their arms and go to attack the
      Argives. This was carried out even so by the Lacedemonians; for as the
      Argives were getting breakfast according to the herald's proclamation,
      they attacked them; and many of them they slew, but many more yet took
      refuge in the sacred grove of Argos, and upon these they kept watch,
      sitting round about the place. Then Cleomenes did this which follows:—
    </p>
<p>
      79. He had with him deserters, and getting information by inquiring of
      these, he sent a herald and summoned forth those of the Argives who were
      shut up in the sanctuary, mentioning each by name; and he summoned them
      forth saying that he had received their ransom. Now among the
      Peloponnesians ransom is two pounds weight of silver <a href="#link6note-68" id="link6noteref-68" class="pginternal">68</a>
      appointed to be paid for each prisoner. So Cleomenes summoned forth about
      fifty of the Argives one by one and slew them; and it chanced that the
      rest who were in the enclosure did not perceive that this was being done;
      for since the grove was thick, those within did not see how it fared with
      those who were without, at least until one of them climbed up a tree and
      saw from above that which was being done. Accordingly they then no longer
      came forth when they were called.
    </p>
<p>
      80. So Cleomenes thereupon ordered all the Helots to pile up brushwood
      round the sacred grove; and they obeying, he set fire to the grove. And
      when it was now burning, he asked one of the deserters to what god the
      grove was sacred, and the man replied that it was sacred to Argos. When he
      heard that, he groaned aloud and said, "Apollo who utterest oracles,
      surely thou hast greatly deceived me, saying that I should conquer Argos:
      I conjecture that the oracle has had its fulfilment for me already.".
    </p>
<p>
      81. After this Cleomenes sent away the greater part of his army to go back
      to Sparta, but he himself took a thousand of the best men and went to the
      temple of Hera to sacrifice: and when he wished to sacrifice upon the
      altar, the priest forbade him, saying that it was not permitted by
      religious rule for a stranger to sacrifice in that place. Cleomenes
      however bade the Helots take away the priest from the altar and scourge
      him, and he himself offered the sacrifice. Having so done he returned back
      to Sparta;.
    </p>
<p>
      82, and after his return his opponents brought him up before the Ephors,
      saying that he had received gifts and therefore had not conquered Argos,
      when he might easily have conquered it. He said to them,—but whether
      he was speaking falsely or whether truly I am not able with certainty to
      say,—however that may be, he spoke and said that when he had
      conquered the sanctuary of Argos, it seemed to him that the oracle of the
      god had had its fulfilment for him; therefore he did not think it right to
      make an attempt on the city, at least until he should have had recourse to
      sacrifice, and should have learnt whether the deity <a href="#link6note-69" id="link6noteref-69" class="pginternal">69</a> permitted him or
      whether she stood opposed to him: and as he was sacrificing for augury <a href="#link6note-70" id="link6noteref-70" class="pginternal">70</a> in
      the temple of Hera, a flame of fire blazed forth from the breasts of the
      image; and thus he knew the certainty of the matter, namely that he would
      not conquer Argos: for if fire had blazed forth from the head of the
      image, he would have been conqueror of the city from top to bottom, <a href="#link6note-71" id="link6noteref-71" class="pginternal">71</a>
      but since it blazed from the breasts, everything had been accomplished for
      him which the god desired should come to pass. Thus speaking he seemed to
      the Spartans to speak credibly and reasonably, and he easily escaped his
      pursuers. <a href="#link6note-72" id="link6noteref-72" class="pginternal">72</a>
</p>
<p>
      83. Argos however was so bereft of men that their slaves took possession
      of all the State, ruling and managing it until the sons of those who had
      perished grew to be men. Then these, endeavouring to gain Argos back to
      themselves, cast them out; and the slaves being driven forth gained
      possession of Tiryns by fighting. Now for a time these two parties had
      friendly relations with one another; but afterwards there came to the
      slaves a prophet named Cleander, by race a Phigalian from Arcadia: this
      man persuaded the slaves to attack their masters, and in consequence of
      this there was war between them for a long time, until at last with
      difficulty the Argives overcame them.
    </p>
<p>
      84. The Argives then say that this was the reason why Cleomenes went mad
      and had an evil end: but the Spartans themselves say that Cleomenes was
      not driven mad by any divine power, but that he had become a drinker of
      unmixed wine from having associated with Scythians, and that he went mad
      in consequence of this: for the nomad Scythians, they say, when Dareios
      had made invasion of their land, desired eagerly after this to take
      vengeance upon him; and they sent to Sparta and tried to make an alliance,
      and to arrange that while the Scythians themselves attempted an invasion
      of Media by the way of the river Phasis, the Spartans should set forth
      from Ephesos and go up inland, and then that they should meet in one
      place: and they say that Cleomenes when the Scythians had come for this
      purpose, associated with them largely, and that thus associating more than
      was fit, he learnt the practice of drinking wine unmixed with water; and
      for this cause (as the Spartans think) he went mad. Thenceforth, as they
      say themselves, when they desire to drink stronger wine, they say "Fill up
      in Scythian fashion." <a href="#link6note-73" id="link6noteref-73" class="pginternal">73</a> Thus the Spartans report about Cleomenes; but
      to me it seems that this was a retribution which Cleomenes paid for
      Demaratos.
    </p>
<p>
      85. Now when the Eginetans heard that Cleomenes had met his end, they sent
      messengers to Sparta to denounce Leotychides for the matter of the
      hostages which were being kept at Athens: and the Lacedemonians caused a
      court to assemble and judged that the Eginetans had been dealt with
      outrageously by Leotychides; and they condemned him to be taken to Egina
      and delivered up in place of the men who were being kept at Athens. Then
      when the Eginetans were about to take Leotychides, Theasides the son of
      Leoprepes, a man of repute in Sparta, said to them: "What are ye proposing
      <a href="#link6note-74" id="link6noteref-74" class="pginternal">74</a>
      to do, men of Egina? Do ye mean to take away the king of the Spartans,
      thus delivered up to you by his fellow-citizens? If the Spartans now being
      in anger have decided so, beware lest at some future time, if ye do this,
      they bring an evil upon your land which may destroy it." Hearing this the
      Eginetans abstained from taking him; but they came to an agreement that
      Leotychides should accompany them to Athens and restore the men to the
      Eginetans.
    </p>
<p>
      86. When however Leotychides came to Athens and asked for the deposit
      back, the Athenians, not being willing to give up the hostages, produced
      pretexts for refusing, and alleged that two kings had deposited them and
      they did not think it right to give them back to the one without the
      other: so since the Athenians said that they would not give them back,
      Leotychides spoke to them as follows:
    </p>
<p>
      (a) "Athenians, do whichever thing ye yourselves desire; for ye know that
      if ye give them up, ye do that which religion commands, and if ye refuse
      to give them up, ye do the opposite of this: but I desire to tell you what
      kind of a thing came to pass once in Sparta about a deposit. We Spartans
      report that there was in Lacedemon about two generations before my time on
      Glaucos the son of Epikydes. This man we say attained the highest merit in
      all things besides, and especially he was well reported of by all who at
      that time dwelt in Lacedemon for his uprightness: and we relate that in
      due time <a href="#link6note-75" id="link6noteref-75" class="pginternal">75</a> it happened to him thus:—a man of
      Miletos came to Sparta and desired to have speech with him, alleging the
      reasons which follow: 'I am a Milesian,' he said, 'and I am come hither
      desiring to have benefit from thy uprightness, Glaucos; for as there was
      much report of thy uprightness throughout all the rest of Hellas and also
      in Ionia, I considered with myself that Ionia is ever in danger, whereas
      Peloponnesus is safely established, and also that we never see wealth
      continue in the possession of the same persons long;—reflecting, I
      say, on these things and taking counsel with myself, I resolved to turn
      into money the half of my possessions, and to place it with thee, being
      well assured that if it were placed with thee I should have it safe. Do
      thou therefore, I pray thee, receive the money, and take and keep these
      tallies; and whosoever shall ask for the money back having the tokens
      answering to these, to him do thou restore it.' (b) The stranger who had
      come from Miletos said so much; and Glaucos accepted the deposit on the
      terms proposed. Then after a long time had gone by, there came to Sparta
      the sons of him who had deposited the money with Glaucos; and they came to
      speech with Glaucos, and producing the tokens asked for the money to be
      given back: but he repulsed them answering them again thus: 'I do not
      remember the matter, nor does my mind bring back to me any knowledge of
      those things whereof ye speak; but I desire to recollect and do all that
      is just; for if I received it, I desire to restore it honestly; and if on
      the other hand I did not receive it at all, I will act towards you in
      accordance with the customs of the Hellenes: <a href="#link6note-76" id="link6noteref-76" class="pginternal">76</a> therefore I defer the
      settling of the matter with you for three months from now.' (c) The
      Milesians accordingly went away grieved, for they supposed that they had
      been robbed of the money; but Glaucos set forth to Delphi to consult the
      Oracle: and when he inquired of the Oracle whether he should rob them of
      the money by an oath, the Pythian prophetess rebuked him with these lines:
    </p>
<pre>
  "'Glaucos, thou, Epikydes' son, yea, this for the moment,
   This, to conquer their word by an oath and to rob, is more gainful.
   Swear, since the lot of death waits also for him who swears truly.
   But know thou that Oath has a son, one nameless and handless and
   footless, Yet without feet he pursues, without hands he seizes, and
   wholly He shall destroy the race and the house of the man who offendeth.
   But for the man who swears truly his race is the better hereafter.'
</pre>
<p>
      Having heard this Glaucos entreated that the god would pardon him for that
      which he had said, but the prophetess said that to make trial of the god
      and to do the deed were things equivalent. (d) Glaucos then, having sent
      for the Milesians, gave back to them the money: but the reason for which,
      O Athenians, I set forth to relate to you this story, shall now be told.
      At the present time there is no descendant of Glaucos existing, nor any
      hearth which is esteemed to be that of Glaucos, but he has been utterly
      destroyed and rooted up out of Sparta. Thus it is good not even to
      entertain a thought about a deposit other than that of restoring it, when
      they who made it ask for it again."
    </p>
<p>
      87. When Leotychides had thus spoken, since not even so were the Athenians
      willing to listen to him, he departed back; and the Eginetans, before
      paying the penalty for their former wrongs wherein they did outrage to the
      Athenians to please the Thebans, <a href="#link6note-77" id="link6noteref-77" class="pginternal">77</a> acted as follows:—complaining
      of the conduct of the Athenians and thinking that they were being wronged,
      they made preparations to avenge themselves upon the Athenians; and since
      the Athenians were celebrating a four-yearly festival <a href="#link6note-78" id="link6noteref-78" class="pginternal">78</a> at
      Sunion, they lay in wait for the sacred ship which was sent to it and took
      it, the vessel being full of men who were the first among the Athenians;
      and having taken it they laid the men in bonds..
    </p>
<p>
      88. The Athenians after they had suffered this wrong from the Eginetans no
      longer delayed to contrive all things possible to their hurt. And there
      was <a href="#link6note-79" id="link6noteref-79" class="pginternal">79</a>
      in Egina a man of repute, one Nicodromos the son of Cnithos: <a href="#link6note-80" id="link6noteref-80" class="pginternal">80</a>
      this man had cause of complaint against the Eginetans for having before
      this driven him forth out of the island; and hearing now that the
      Athenians had resolved to do mischief to the Eginetans, he agreed with the
      Athenians to deliver up Egina to them, telling them on what day he would
      make his attempt and by what day it would be necessary for them to come to
      his assistance..
    </p>
<p>
      89. After this Nicodromos, according as he had agreed with the Athenians,
      seized that which is called the old city, but the Athenians did not come
      to his support at the proper time; for, as it chanced, they had not ships
      sufficient to fight with the Eginetans; so while they were asking the
      Corinthians to lend them ships, during this time their cause went to ruin.
      The Corinthians however, being at this time exceedingly friendly with
      them, gave the Athenians twenty ships at their request; and these they
      gave by selling them at five drachmas apiece, for by the law it was not
      permitted to give them as a free gift. Having taken these ships of which I
      speak and also their own, the Athenians with seventy ships manned in all
      sailed to Egina, and they were later by one day than the time agreed..
    </p>
<p>
      90. Nicodromos meanwhile, as the Athenians did not come to his support at
      the proper time, embarked in a ship and escaped from Egina, and with him
      also went others of the Eginetans; and the Athenians gave them Sunion to
      dwell in, starting from whence these men continued to plunder the
      Eginetans who were in the island..
    </p>
<p>
      91. This happened afterwards: but at the time of which we speak the
      well-to-do class among the Eginetans prevailed over the men of the people,
      who had risen against them in combination with Nicodromos, and then having
      got them into their power they were bringing their prisoners forth to
      execution. From this there came upon them a curse which they were not able
      to expiate by sacrifice, though they devised against it all they could;
      but they were driven forth from the island before the goddess became
      propitious to them. For they had taken as prisoners seven hundred of the
      men of the people and were bringing them forth to execution, when one of
      them escaped from his bonds and fled for refuge to the entrance of the
      temple of Demeter the Giver of Laws, <a href="#link6note-81" id="link6noteref-81" class="pginternal">81</a> and he took hold of the
      latch of the door and clung to it; and when they found that they could not
      drag him from it by pulling him away, they cut off his hands and so
      carried him off, and those hands remained clinging to the latch of the
      door..
    </p>
<p>
      92. Thus did the Eginetans to one another: and when the Athenians came,
      they fought against them with seventy ships, and being worsted in the
      sea-fight they called to their assistance the same whom they had summoned
      before, namely the Argives. These would no longer come to their help,
      having cause of complaint because the ships of Egina compelled by
      Cleomenes had put in to the land of Argos and their crews had landed with
      the Lacedemonians; with whom also had landed men from ships of Sikyon in
      this same invasion: and as a penalty for this there was laid upon them by
      the Argives a fine of a thousand talents, five hundred for each State. The
      Sikyonians accordingly, acknowledging that they had committed a wrong, had
      made an agreement to pay a hundred talents and be free from the penalty;
      the Eginetans however did not acknowledge their wrong, but were more
      stubborn. For this reason then, when they made request, none of the
      Argives now came to their help at the charge of the State, but volunteers
      came to the number of a thousand; and their leader was a commander named
      Eurybates, a man who had practised the five contests. <a href="#link6note-82" id="link6noteref-82" class="pginternal">82</a> Of
      these men the greater number never returned back, but were slain by the
      Athenians in Egina; and the commander himself, Eurybates, fighting in
      single combat <a href="#link6note-83" id="link6noteref-83" class="pginternal">83</a> killed in this manner three men and was
      himself slain by the fourth, Sophanes namely of Dekeleia.
    </p>
<p>
      93. The Eginetans however engaged in contest with the Athenians in ships,
      when these were in disorder, and defeated them; and they took of them four
      ships together with their crews.
    </p>
<p>
      94. So the Athenians were at war with the Eginetans; and meanwhile the
      Persian was carrying forward his design, since he was put in mind ever by
      his servant to remember the Athenians, and also because of the sons of
      Peisistratos were near at hand and brought charges continually against the
      Athenians, while at the same time Dareios himself wished to take hold of
      this pretext and subdue those nations of Hellas which had not given him
      earth and water. Mardonios then, since he had fared miserably in his
      expedition, he removed from his command; and appointing other generals to
      command he despatched them against Eretria and Athens, namely Datis, who
      was a Mede by race, and Artaphrenes the son of Artaphrenes, a nephew of
      the king: and he sent them forth with the charge to reduce Athens and
      Eretria to slavery and to bring the slaves back into his presence..
    </p>
<p>
      95. When these who had been appointed to command came in their march from
      the king to the Aleïan plain in Kilikia, taking with them a large and
      well-equipped land-army, then while they were encamping there, the whole
      naval armament came up, which had been appointed for several nations to
      furnish; and there came to them also the ships for carrying horses, which
      in the year before Dareios had ordered his tributaries to make ready. In
      these they placed their horses, and having embarked the land-army in the
      ships they sailed for Ionia with six hundred triremes. After this they did
      not keep their ships coasting along the mainland towards the Hellespont
      and Thrace, but they started from Samos and made their voyage by the
      Icarian Sea <a href="#link6note-84" id="link6noteref-84" class="pginternal">84</a> and between the islands; because, as I think,
      they feared more than all else the voyage round Athos, seeing that in the
      former year <a href="#link6note-85" id="link6noteref-85" class="pginternal">85</a> while making the passage by this way they had
      come to great disaster. Moreover also Naxos compelled them, since it had
      not been conquered at the former time. <a href="#link6note-86" id="link6noteref-86" class="pginternal">86</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      96. And when they had arrived at Naxos, coming against it from the Icarian
      Sea (for it was against Naxos first that the Persians intended to make
      expedition, remembering the former events), the Naxians departed forthwith
      fleeing to the mountains, and did not await their attack; but the Persians
      made slaves of those of them whom they caught and set fire to both the
      temples and the town. Having so done they put out to sea to attack the
      other islands.
    </p>
<p>
      97. While these were doing thus, the Delians also had left Delos and fled
      away to Tenos; and when the armament was sailing in thither, Datis sailed
      on before and did not allow the ships to anchor at the island of Delos,
      but at Rhenaia on the other side of the channel; and he himself, having
      found out by inquiry where the men of Delos were, sent a herald and
      addressed them thus: "Holy men, why are ye fled away and departed, having
      judged of me that which is not convenient? for even I of myself have
      wisdom at least so far, and moreover it has been thus commanded me by the
      king, not to harm at all that land in which the two divinities were born,
      neither the land itself nor the inhabitants of it. Now therefore return to
      your own possessions and dwell in your island." Thus he proclaimed by a
      herald to the Delians; and after this he piled up and burned upon the
      altar three hundred talents' weight of frankincense.
    </p>
<p>
      98. Datis having done these things sailed away with his army to fight
      against Eretria first, taking with him both Ionians and Aiolians; and
      after he had put out to sea from thence, Delos was moved, not having been
      shaken (as the Delians reported to me) either before that time or since
      that down to my own time; and this no doubt the god <a href="#link6note-8601" id="link6noteref-8601" class="pginternal">8601</a>
      manifested as a portent to men of the evils that were about to be; for in
      the time of Dareios the son of Hystaspes and Xerxes the son of Dareios and
      Artoxerxes the son of Xerxes, three generations following upon one
      another, there happened more evils to Hellas than during the twenty other
      generations which came before Dareios, some of the evils coming to it from
      the Persians, and others from the leaders themselves of Hellas warring
      together for supremacy. Thus it was not unreasonable that Delos should be
      moved, which was before unmoved. [And in an oracle it was thus written
      about it: <a href="#link6note-87" id="link6noteref-87" class="pginternal">87</a>
</p>
<pre>
 "Delos too will I move, unmoved though it hath been aforetime."]
</pre>
<p>
      Now in the Hellenic tongue the names which have been mentioned have this
      meaning—Dareios means "compeller," <a href="#link6note-88" id="link6noteref-88" class="pginternal">88</a> Xerxes "warrior," <a href="#link6note-89" id="link6noteref-89" class="pginternal">89</a>
      Artoxerxes "great warrior." <a href="#link6note-90" id="link6noteref-90" class="pginternal">90</a> Thus then might the Hellenes rightly call
      these kings in their own tongue.
    </p>
<p>
      99. The Barbarians then, when they had departed from Delos, touched at the
      islands as they went, and from them received additional forces and took
      sons of the islanders as hostages: and when in sailing round about the
      islands they put in also to Carystos, seeing that the Carystians would
      neither give them hostages nor consent to join in an expedition against
      cities that were their neighbours, meaning Eretria and Athens, they began
      to besiege them and to ravage their land; until at last the Carystians
      also came over to the will of the Persians..
    </p>
<p>
      100. The Eretrians meanwhile being informed that the armament of the
      Persians was sailing to attack them, requested the Athenians to help them;
      and the Athenians did not refuse their support, but gave as helpers those
      four thousand to whom had been allotted the land of the wealthy <a href="#link6note-91" id="link6noteref-91" class="pginternal">91</a>
      Chalkidians. The Eretrians however, as it turned out, had no sound plan of
      action, for while they sent for the Athenians, they had in their minds two
      different designs: some of them, that is, proposed to leave the city and
      go to the heights of Euboea; while others of them, expecting to win gain
      for themselves from the Persian, were preparing to surrender the place.
      Having got knowledge of how things were as regards both these plans,
      Aischines the son of Nothon, one of the leaders of the Eretrians, told the
      whole condition of their affairs to those of the Athenians who had come,
      and entreated them to depart and go to their own land, that they might not
      also perish. So the Athenians did according to this counsel given to them
      by Aischines..
    </p>
<p>
      101. And while these passed over to Oropos and saved themselves, the
      Persians sailed on and brought their ships to land about Temenos and
      Chioreai and Aigilea in the Eretrian territory; and having taken
      possession of these places, <a href="#link6note-9101" id="link6noteref-9101" class="pginternal">9101</a> forthwith they
      began to disembark their horses and prepared to advance against the enemy.
      The Eretrians however did not intend to come forth against them and fight;
      but their endeavour was if possible to hold out by defending their walls,
      since the counsel prevailed not to leave the city. Then a violent assault
      was made upon the wall, and for six days there fell many on both sides;
      but on the seventh day Euphorbos the son of Alkimachos and Philagros the
      son of Kyneos, men of repute among the citizens, gave up the city to the
      Persians. These having entered the city plundered and set fire to the
      temples in retribution for the temples which were burned at Sardis, and
      also reduced the people to slavery according to the commands of Dareios.
    </p>
<p>
      102. Having got Eretria into their power, they stayed a few days and then
      sailed for the land of Attica, pressing on <a href="#link6note-92" id="link6noteref-92" class="pginternal">92</a> hard and supposing that
      the Athenians would do the same as the Eretrians had done. And since
      Marathon was the most convenient place in Attica for horsemen to act and
      was also very near to Eretria, therefore Hippias the son of Peisistratos
      was guiding them thither..
    </p>
<p>
      103. When the Athenians had information of this, they too went to Marathon
      to the rescue of their land; and they were led by ten generals, of whom
      the tenth was Miltiades, whose father Kimon of Stesagoras had been
      compelled to go into exile from Athens because of Peisistratos the son of
      Hippocrates: and while he was in exile it was his fortune to win a victory
      at the Olympic games with a four-horse chariot, wherein, as it happened,
      he did the same thing as his half-brother Miltiades <a href="#link6note-93" id="link6noteref-93" class="pginternal">93</a> had done, who had the
      same mother as he. Then afterwards in the next succeeding Olympic games he
      gained a victory with the same mares and allowed Peisistratos to be
      proclaimed as victor; and having resigned to him the victory he returned
      to his own native land under an agreement for peace. Then after he had won
      with the same mares at another Olympic festival, it was his hap to be
      slain by the sons of Peisistratos, Peisistratos himself being no longer
      alive. These killed him near the City Hall, having set men to lie in wait
      for him by night; and the burial-place of Kimon is in the outskirts of the
      city, on the other side of the road which is called the way through Coile,
      and just opposite him those mares are buried which won in three Olympic
      games. This same thing was done also by the mares belonging to Euagoras
      the Laconian, but besides these by none others. Now the elder of the sons
      of Kimon, Stesagoras, was at that time being brought up in the house of
      his father's brother Miltiades in the Chersonese, while the younger son
      was being brought up at Athens with Kimon himself, having been named
      Miltiades after Miltiades the settler of the Chersonese..
    </p>
<p>
      104. This Miltiades then at the time of which we speak had come from the
      Chersonese and was a general of the Athenians, after escaping death in two
      forms; for not only did the Phenicians, who had pursued after him as far
      as Imbros, endeavour earnestly to take him and bring him up to the
      presence of the king, but also after this, when he had escaped from these
      and had come to his own native land and seemed to be in safety from that
      time forth, his opponents, who had laid wait for him there, brought him up
      before a court and prosecuted him for his despotism in the Chersonese.
      Having escaped these also, he had then been appointed a general of the
      Athenians, being elected by the people.
    </p>
<p>
      105. First of all, while they were still in the city, the generals sent
      off to Sparta a herald, namely Pheidippides <a href="#link6note-94" id="link6noteref-94" class="pginternal">94</a> an Athenian and for the
      rest a runner of long day-courses and one who practised this as his
      profession. With this man, as Pheidippides himself said and as he made
      report to the Athenians, Pan chanced to meet by mount Parthenion, which is
      above Tegea; and calling aloud the name of Pheidippides, Pan bade him
      report to the Athenians and ask for what reason they had no care of him,
      though he was well disposed to the Athenians and had been serviceable to
      them on many occasions before that time, and would be so also yet again.
      Believing that this tale was true, the Athenians, when their affairs had
      been now prosperously settled, established under the Acropolis a temple of
      Pan; and in consequence of this message they propitiate him with sacrifice
      offered every year and with a torch-race..
    </p>
<p>
      106. However at that time, the time namely when he said that Pan appeared
      to him, this Pheidippides having been sent by the generals was in Sparta
      on the next day after that on which he left the city of the Athenians; and
      when he had come to the magistrates he said: "Lacedemonians, the Athenians
      make request of you to come to their help and not to allow a city most
      anciently established among the Hellenes to fall into slavery by the means
      of Barbarians; for even now Eretria has been enslaved, and Hellas has
      become the weaker by a city of renown." He, as I say, reported to them
      that with which he had been charged, and it pleased them well to come to
      help the Athenians; but it was impossible for them to do so at once, since
      they did not desire to break their law; for it was the ninth day of the
      month, and on the ninth day they said they would not go forth, nor until
      the circle of the moon should be full. <a href="#link6note-95" id="link6noteref-95" class="pginternal">95</a>
</p>
<p>
      107. These men were waiting for the full moon: and meanwhile Hippias the
      son of Peisistratos was guiding the Barbarians in to Marathon, after
      having seen on the night that was just past a vision in his sleep of this
      kind,—it seemed to Hippias that he lay with his own mother. He
      conjectured then from the dream that he should return to Athens and
      recover his rule, and then bring his life to an end in old age in his own
      land. From the dream, I say, he conjectured this; and after this, as he
      guided them in, first he disembarked the slaves from Eretria on the island
      belonging to the Styrians, called Aigleia; <a href="#link6note-96" id="link6noteref-96" class="pginternal">96</a> and then, as the ships
      came in to shore at Marathon, he moored them there, and after the
      Barbarians had come from their ships to land, he was engaged in disposing
      them in their places. While he was ordering these things, it came upon him
      to sneeze and cough more violently than was his wont. Then since he was
      advanced in years, most of his teeth were shaken thereby, and one of these
      teeth he cast forth by the violence of the cough: <a href="#link6note-97" id="link6noteref-97" class="pginternal">97</a> and the tooth having
      fallen from him upon the sand, he was very desirous to find it; since
      however the tooth was not to be found when he searched, he groaned aloud
      and said to those who were by him: "This land is not ours, nor shall we be
      able to make it subject to us; but so much part in it as belonged to me
      the tooth possesses."
    </p>
<p>
      108. Hippias then conjectured that his vision had been thus fulfilled: and
      meanwhile, after the Athenians had been drawn up in the sacred enclosure
      of Heracles, there joined them the Plataians coming to their help in a
      body: for the Plataians had given themselves to the Athenians, and the
      Athenians before this time undertook many toils on behalf of them; and
      this was the manner in which they gave themselves:—Being oppressed
      by the Thebans, the Plataians at first desired to give themselves to
      Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides and to the Lacedemonians, who chanced to
      come thither; but these did not accept them, and said to them as follows:
      "We dwell too far off, and such support as ours would be to you but cold
      comfort; for ye might many times be reduced to slavery before any of us
      had information of it: but we counsel you rather to give yourselves to the
      Athenians, who are both neighbours and also not bad helpers." Thus the
      Lacedemonians counselled, not so much on account of their goodwill to the
      Plataians as because they desired that the Athenians should have trouble
      by being involved in a conflict with the Boetians. The Lacedemonians, I
      say, thus counselled the men of Plataia; and they did not fail to follow
      their counsel, but when the Athenians were doing sacrifice to the twelve
      gods, they sat down as suppliants at the altar and so gave themselves.
      Then the Thebans having been informed of these things marched against the
      Plataians, and the Athenians came to their assistance: and as they were
      about to join battle, the Corinthians did not permit them to do so, but
      being by chance there, they reconciled their strife; and both parties
      having put the matter into their hands, they laid down boundaries for the
      land, with the condition that the Thebans should leave those of the
      Boeotians alone who did not desire to be reckoned with the other
      Boeotians. The Corinthians having given this decision departed; but as the
      Athenians were going back, the Boeotians attacked them, and having
      attacked them they were worsted in the fight. Upon that the Athenians
      passed beyond the boundaries which the Corinthians had set to be for the
      Plataians, and they made the river Asopos itself to be the boundary of the
      Thebans towards the land of Plataia and towards the district of Hysiai.
      The Plataians then had given themselves to the Athenians in the manner
      which has been said, and at this time they came to Marathon to bring them
      help.
    </p>
<p>
      109. Now the opinions of the generals of the Athenians were divided, and
      the one party urged that they should not fight a battle, seeing that they
      were too few to fight with the army of the Medes, while the others, and
      among them Miltiades, advised that they should do so: and when they were
      divided and the worse opinion was like to prevail, then, since he who had
      been chosen by lot <a href="#link6note-98" id="link6noteref-98" class="pginternal">98</a> to be polemarch of the Athenians had a vote in
      addition to the ten (for in old times the Athenians gave the polemarch an
      equal vote with the generals) and at that time the polemarch was
      Callimachos of the deme of Aphidnai, to him came Miltiades and said as
      follows: "With thee now it rests, Callimachos, either to bring Athens
      under slavery, or by making her free to leave behind thee for all the time
      that men shall live a memorial such as not even Harmodios and Aristogeiton
      have left. For now the Athenians have come to a danger the greatest to
      which they have ever come since they were a people; and on the one hand,
      if they submit to the Medes, it is determined what they shall suffer,
      being delivered over to Hippias, while on the other hand, if this city
      shall gain the victory, it may become the first of the cities of Hellas.
      How this may happen and how it comes to thee of all men <a href="#link6note-99" id="link6noteref-99" class="pginternal">99</a> to
      have the decision of these matters, I am now about to tell. Of us the
      generals, who are ten in number, the opinions are divided, the one party
      urging that we fight a battle and the others that we do not fight. Now if
      we do not, I expect that some great spirit of discord will fall upon the
      minds of the Athenians and so shake them that they shall go over to the
      Medes; but if we fight a battle before any unsoundness appear in any part
      of the Athenian people, then we are able to gain the victory in the fight,
      if the gods grant equal conditions. These things then all belong to thee
      and depend on thee; for if thou attach thyself to my opinions, thou hast
      both a fatherland which is free and a native city which shall be the first
      among the cities of Hellas; but if thou choose the opinion of those who
      are earnest against fighting, thou shalt have the opposite of those good
      things of which I told thee.".
    </p>
<p>
      110. Thus speaking Miltiades gained Callimachos to his side; and the
      opinion of the polemarch being added, it was thus determined to fight a
      battle. After this, those generals whose opinion was in favour of
      fighting, as the turn of each one of them to command for the day <a href="#link6note-100" id="link6noteref-100" class="pginternal">100</a>
      came round, gave over their command to Miltiades; and he, accepting it,
      would not however yet bring about a battle, until his own turn to command
      had come..
    </p>
<p>
      111. And when it came round to him, then the Athenians were drawn up for
      battle in the order which here follows:—On the right wing the
      polemarch Callimachos was leader (for the custom of the Athenians then was
      this, that the polemarch should have the right wing); and he leading, next
      after him came the tribes in order as they were numbered one after
      another, and last were drawn up the Plataians occupying the left wing: for
      <a href="#link6note-101" id="link6noteref-101" class="pginternal">101</a>
      ever since this battle, when the Athenians offer sacrifices in the solemn
      assemblies <a href="#link6note-102" id="link6noteref-102" class="pginternal">102</a> which are made at the four-yearly festivals,
      <a href="#link6note-103" id="link6noteref-103" class="pginternal">103</a>
      the herald of the Athenians prays thus, "that blessings <a href="#link6note-104" id="link6noteref-104" class="pginternal">104</a>
      may come to the Athenians and to the Plataians both." On this occasion
      however, when the Athenians were being drawn up at Marathon something of
      this kind was done:—their army being made equal in length of front
      to that of the Medes, came to drawn up in the middle with a depth of but
      few ranks, and here their army was weakest, while each wing was
      strengthened with numbers..
    </p>
<p>
      112. And when they had been arranged in their places and the sacrifices
      proved favourable, then the Athenians were let go, and they set forth at a
      run to attack the Barbarians. Now the space between the armies was not
      less than eight furlongs: <a href="#link6note-105" id="link6noteref-105" class="pginternal">105</a> and the Persians seeing them advancing to
      the attack at a run, made preparations to receive them; and in their minds
      they charged the Athenians with madness which must be fatal, seeing that
      they were few and yet were pressing forwards at a run, having neither
      cavalry nor archers. <a href="#link6note-106" id="link6noteref-106" class="pginternal">106</a> Such was the thought of the Barbarians; but
      the Athenians when all in a body they had joined in combat with the
      Barbarians, fought in a memorable fashion: for they were the first of all
      the Hellenes about whom we know who went to attack the enemy at a run, and
      they were the first also who endured to face the Median garments and the
      men who wore them, whereas up to this time the very name of the Medes was
      to the Hellenes a terror to hear..
    </p>
<p>
      113. Now while they fought in Marathon, much time passed by; and in the
      centre of the army, where the Persians themselves and the Sacans were
      drawn up, the Barbarians were winning,—here, I say, the Barbarians
      had broken the ranks of their opponents and were pursuing them inland, but
      on both wings the Athenians and the Plataians severally were winning the
      victory; and being victorious they left that part of the Barbarians which
      had been routed to fly without molestation, and bringing together the two
      wings they fought with those who had broken their centre, and the
      Athenians were victorious. So they followed after the Persians as they
      fled, slaughtering them, until they came to the sea; and then they called
      for fire and began to take hold of the ships..
    </p>
<p>
      114. In this part of the work was slain the polemarch Callimachos after
      having proved himself a good man, and also one of the generals, Stesilaos
      the son of Thrasylaos, was killed; and besides this Kynegeiros the son of
      Euphorion while taking hold <a href="#link6note-107" id="link6noteref-107" class="pginternal">107</a> there of the
      ornament at the stern of a ship had his hand cut off with an axe and fell;
      and many others also of the Athenians who were men of note were killed..
    </p>
<p>
      115. Seven of the ships the Athenians got possession of in this manner,
      but with the rest the Barbarians pushed off from land, and after taking
      the captives from Eretria off the island where they had left them, they
      sailed round Sunion, purposing to arrive at the city before the Athenians.
      And an accusation became current among the Athenians to the effect that
      they formed this design by contrivance of the Alcmaionidai; for these, it
      was said, having concerted matters with the Persians, displayed to them a
      shield when they had now embarked in their ships..
    </p>
<p>
      116. These then, I say, were sailing round Sunion; and meanwhile the
      Athenians came to the rescue back to the city as speedily as they could,
      and they arrived there before the Barbarians came; and having arrived from
      the temple of Heracles at Marathon they encamped at another temple of
      Heracles, namely that which is in Kynosarges. The Barbarians however came
      and lay with their ships in the sea which is off Phaleron, (for this was
      then the seaport of the Athenians), they anchored their ships, I say, off
      this place, and then proceeded to sail back to Asia.
    </p>
<p>
      117. In this fight at Marathon there were slain of the Barbarians about
      six thousand four hundred men, and of the Athenians a hundred and ninety
      and two. Such was the number which fell on both sides; and it happened
      also that a marvel occurred there of this kind:—an Athenian,
      Epizelos the son of Cuphagoras, while fighting in the close combat and
      proving himself a good man, was deprived of the sight of his eyes, neither
      having received a blow in any part of his body nor having been hit with a
      missile, and for the rest of his life from this time he continued to be
      blind: and I was informed that he used to tell about that which had
      happened to him a tale of this kind, namely that it seemed to him that a
      tall man in full armour stood against him, whose beard overshadowed his
      whole shield; and this apparition passed him by, but killed his comrade
      who stood next to him. Thus, as I was informed, Epizelos told the tale.
    </p>
<p>
      118. Datis, however, as he was going with his army to Asia, when he had
      come to Myconos saw a vision in his sleep; and of what nature the vision
      was it is not reported, but as soon as day dawned he caused a search to be
      made of the ships, and finding in a Phenician ship an image of Apollo
      overlaid with gold, he inquired from whence it had been carried off. Then
      having been informed from what temple it came, he sailed in his own ship
      to Delos: and finding that the Delians had returned then to the island, he
      deposited the image in the temple and charged the men of Delos to convey
      it back to Delion in the territory of the Thebans, which is situated by
      the sea-coast just opposite Chalkis. Datis having given this charge sailed
      away: the Delians however did not convey the statue back, but after an
      interval of twenty years the Thebans themselves brought it to Delion by
      reason of an oracle..
    </p>
<p>
      119. Now as to those Eretrians who had been reduced to slavery, Datis and
      Artaphrenes, when they reached Asia in their voyage, brought them up to
      Susa; and king Dareios, though he had great anger against the Eretrians
      before they were made captive, because the Eretrians had done wrong to him
      unprovoked, yet when he saw that they had been brought up to him and were
      in his power, he did them no more evil, but established them as settlers
      in the Kissian land upon one of his own domains, of which the name is
      Ardericca: and this is distant two hundred and ten furlongs from Susa and
      forty from the well which produces things of three different kinds; for
      they draw from it asphalt, salt and oil, in the manner which here follows:—the
      liquid is drawn with a swipe, to which there is fastened half a skin
      instead of a bucket, and a man strikes this down into it and draws up, and
      then pours it into a cistern, from which it runs through into another
      vessel, taking three separate ways. The asphalt and the salt become solid
      at once, and the oil <a href="#link6note-108" id="link6noteref-108" class="pginternal">108</a> which is called by the Persians <i>rhadinake</i>,
      is black and gives out a disagreeable smell. Here king Dareios established
      the Eretrians as settlers; and even to my time they continued to occupy
      this land, keeping still their former language. Thus it happened with
      regard to the Eretrians.
    </p>
<p>
      120. Of the Lacedemonians there came to Athens two thousand after the full
      moon, making great haste to be in time, so that they arrived in Attica on
      the third day after leaving Sparta: and though they had come too late for
      the battle, yet they desired to behold the Medes; and accordingly they
      went out to Marathon and looked at the bodies of the slain: then
      afterwards they departed home, commending the Athenians and the work which
      they had done.
    </p>
<p>
      121. Now it is a cause of wonder to me, and I do not accept the report,
      that the Alcmaionidai could ever have displayed to the Persians a shield
      by a previous understanding, with the desire that the Athenians should be
      under the Barbarians and under Hippias; seeing that they are evidently
      proved to have been haters of despots as much or more than Callias the son
      of Phainippos and father of Hipponicos, while Callias for his part was the
      only man of all the Athenians who dared, when Peisistratos was driven out
      of Athens, to buy his goods offered for sale by the State, and in other
      ways also he contrived against him everything that was most hostile:
    </p>
<p>
      122. Of this Callias it is fitting that every one should have remembrance
      for many reasons: first because of that which has been before said, namely
      that he was a man of excellence in freeing his country; and then also for
      that which he did at the Olympic games, wherein he gained a victory in the
      horse-race and was second in the chariot-race, and he had before this been
      a victor at the Pythian games, so that he was distinguished in the sight
      of all Hellenes by the sums which he expended; and finally because he
      showed himself a man of such liberality towards his daughters, who were
      three in number; for when they came to be of ripe age for marriage, he
      gave them a most magnificent dowry and also indulged their inclinations;
      for whomsoever of all the Athenians each one of them desired to choose as
      a husband for herself, to that man he gave her.] <a href="#link6note-109" id="link6noteref-109" class="pginternal">109</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      123, and similarly, <a href="#link6note-110" id="link6noteref-110" class="pginternal">110</a> the Alcmaionidai were haters of despots
      equally or more <a href="#link6note-111" id="link6noteref-111" class="pginternal">111</a> than he. Therefore this is a cause of wonder
      to me, and I do not admit the accusation that these they were who
      displayed the shield; seeing that they were in exile from the despots
      during their whole time, and that by their contrivance the sons of
      Peisistratos gave up their rule. Thus it follows that they were the men
      who set Athens free much more than Harmodios and Aristogeiton, as I judge:
      for these my slaying Hipparchos exasperated the rest of the family of
      Peisistratos, and did not at all cause the others to cease from their
      despotism; but the Alcmaionidai did evidently set Athens free, at least if
      these were in truth the men who persuaded the Pythian prophetess to
      signify to the Lacedemonians that they should set Athens free, as I have
      set forth before..
    </p>
<p>
      124. It may be said however that they had some cause of complaint against
      the people of the Athenians, and therefore endeavoured to betray their
      native city. But on the contrary there were no men in greater repute than
      they, among the Athenians at least, nor who had been more highly honoured.
      Thus it is not reasonable to suppose that by them a shield should have
      been displayed for any such purpose. A shield was displayed, however; that
      cannot be denied, for it was done: but as to who it was who displayed it,
      I am not able to say more than this.
    </p>
<p>
      125. Now the family of Alcmaionidai was distinguished in Athens in the
      earliest times also, and from the time of Alcmaion and of Megacles after
      him they became very greatly distinguished. For first Alcmaion the son of
      Megacles showed himself a helper of the Lydians from Sardis who came from
      Croesus to the Oracle at Delphi, and assisted them with zeal; and Croesus
      having heard from the Lydians who went to the Oracle that this man did him
      service, sent for him to Sardis; and when he came, he offered to give him
      a gift of as much gold as he could carry away at once upon his own person.
      With a view to this gift, its nature being such, Alcmaion made
      preparations and used appliances as follows:—he put on a large tunic
      leaving a deep fold in the tunic to hang down in front, and he draw on his
      feet the widest boots which he could find, and so went to the treasury to
      which they conducted him. Then he fell upon a heap of gold-dust, and first
      he packed in by the side of his legs so much of the gold as his boots
      would contain, and then he filled the whole fold of the tunic with the
      gold and sprinkled some of the gold dust on the hair of his head and took
      some into his mouth, and having so done he came forth out of the treasury,
      with difficulty dragging along his boots and resembling anything in the
      world rather than a man; for his mouth was stuffed full, and every part of
      him was swelled out: and upon Croesus came laughter when he saw him, and
      he not only gave him all that, but also presented him in addition with
      more not inferior in value to that. Thus this house became exceedingly
      wealthy, and thus the Alcmaion of whom I speak became a breeder of
      chariot-horses and won a victory at Olympia..
    </p>
<p>
      126. Then in the next generation after this, Cleisthenes the despot of
      Sikyon exalted the family, so that it became of much more note among the
      Hellenes than it had been formerly. For Cleisthenes the son of Arisonymos,
      the son of Myron, the son of Andreas, had a daughter whose name was
      Agariste; and as to her he formed a desire to find out the best man of all
      the Hellenes and to assign her to him in marriage. So when the Olympic
      games were being held and Cleisthenes was victor in them with a four-horse
      chariot, he caused a proclamation to be made, that whosoever of the
      Hellenes thought himself worthy to be the son-in-law of Cleisthenes should
      come on the sixtieth day, or before that if he would, to Sikyon; for
      Cleisthenes intended to conclude the marriage within a year, reckoning
      from the sixtieth day. Then all those of the Hellenes who had pride either
      in themselves or in their high descent, <a href="#link6note-112" id="link6noteref-112" class="pginternal">112</a> came as wooers, and
      for them Cleisthenes had a running-course and a wrestling-place made and
      kept them expressly for their use..
    </p>
<p>
      127. From Italy came Smindyrides the son of Hippocrates of Sybaris, who of
      all men on earth reached the highest point of luxury (now Sybaris at this
      time was in the height of its prosperity), and Damasos of Siris, the son
      of that Amyris who was called the Wise; these came from Italy: from the
      Ionian gulf came Amphimnestos the son of Epistrophos of Epidamnos, this
      man from the Ionian gulf: from Aitolia came Males, the brother of that
      Titormos who surpassed all the Hellenes in strength and who fled from the
      presence of men to the furthest extremities of the Aitolian land: from
      Peloponnesus, Leokedes the son of Pheidon the despot of the Argives, that
      Pheidon who established for the Peloponnesians the measures which they
      use, and who went beyond all other Hellenes in wanton insolence, since he
      removed from their place the presidents of the games appointed by the
      Eleians and himself presided over the games at Olympia,—his son, I
      say, and Amiantos the son of Lycurgos an Arcadian from Trapezus, and
      Laphanes an Azanian from the city of Paios, son of that Euphorion who
      (according to the story told in Arcadia) received the Dioscuroi as guests
      in his house and from thenceforth was wont to entertain all men who came,
      and Onomastos the son of Agaios of Elis; these, I say, came from
      Peloponnesus itself: from Athens came Megacles the son of that Alcmaion
      who went to Croesus, and besides him Hippocleides the son of Tisander, one
      who surpassed the other Athenians in wealth and in comeliness of form:
      from Eretria, which at that time was flourishing, came Lysanias, he alone
      from Euboea: from Thessalia came Diactorides of Crannon, one of the family
      of the Scopadai: and from the Molossians, Alcon..
    </p>
<p>
      128. So many in number did the wooers prove to be: and when these had come
      by the appointed day, Cleisthenes first inquired of their native countries
      and of the descent of each one, and then keeping them for a year he made
      trial continually both of their manly virtue and of their disposition,
      training and temper, associating both with each one separately and with
      the whole number together: and he made trial of them both by bringing out
      to bodily exercises those of them who were younger, and also especially in
      the common feast: for during all the time that he kept them he did
      everything that could be done, and at the same time he entertained them
      magnificently. Now it chanced that those of the wooers pleased him most
      who had come from Athens, and of these Hippocleides the son of Tisander
      was rather preferred, both by reason of manly virtues and also because he
      was connected by descent with the family of Kypselos at Corinth.
    </p>
<p>
      129. Then when the appointed day came for the marriage banquet and for
      Cleisthenes himself to declare whom he selected from the whole number,
      Cleisthenes sacrificed a hundred oxen and feasted both the wooers
      themselves and all the people of Sikyon; and when the dinner was over, the
      wooers began to vie with one another both in music and in speeches for the
      entertainment of the company; <a href="#link6note-113" id="link6noteref-113" class="pginternal">113</a> and as the drinking
      went forward and Hippocleides was very much holding the attention of the
      others, <a href="#link6note-114" id="link6noteref-114" class="pginternal">114</a> he bade the flute-player play for him a
      dance-measure; and when the flute-player did so, he danced: and it so
      befell that he pleased himself in his dancing, but Cleisthenes looked on
      at the whole matter with suspicion. Then Hippocleides after a certain time
      bade one bring in a table; and when the table came in, first he danced
      upon it Laconian figures, and then also Attic, and thirdly he planted his
      head upon the table and gesticulated with his legs. Cleisthenes meanwhile,
      when he was dancing the first and the second time, though he abhorred the
      thought that Hippocleides should now become his son-in-law, because of his
      dancing and his shamelessness, yet restrained himself, not desiring to
      break out in anger against him; but when he saw that he thus gesticulated
      with his legs, he was no longer able to restrain himself, but said: "Thou
      hast danced away thy marriage however, <a href="#link6note-115" id="link6noteref-115" class="pginternal">115</a> son of Tisander!"
      and Hippocleides answered and said: "Hippocleides cares not!"
    </p>
<p>
      130. and hence comes this saying. Then Cleisthenes caused silence to be
      made, and spoke to the company as follows: "Men who are wooers of my
      daughter, I commend you all, and if it were possible I would gratify you
      all, neither selecting one of you to be preferred, nor rejecting the
      remainder. Since however it is not possible, as I am deliberating about
      one maiden only, to act so as to please all, therefore to those of you who
      are rejected from this marriage I give as a gift a talent of silver to
      each one for the worthy estimation ye had of me, in that ye desired to
      marry from my house, and for the time of absence from your homes; and to
      the son of Alcmaion, Megacles, I offer my daughter Agariste in betrothal
      according to the customs of the Athenians." Thereupon Megacles said that
      he accepted the betrothal, and so the marriage was determined by
      Cleisthenes.
    </p>
<p>
      131. Thus it happened as regards the judgment of the wooers, and thus the
      Alcmaionidai got renown over all Hellas. And these having been married,
      there was born to them that Cleisthenes who established the tribes and the
      democracy for the Athenians, he being called after the Sikyonian
      Cleisthenes, his mother's father; this son, I say, was born to Megacles,
      and also Hippocrates: and of Hippocrates came another Megacles and another
      Agariste, called after Agariste, the daughter of Cleisthenes, who having
      been married to Xanthippos the son of Ariphron and being with child, saw a
      vision in her sleep, and it seemed to her that she had brought forth a
      lion: then after a few days she bore to Xanthippos Pericles.
    </p>
<p>
      132. After the defeat at Marathon, Miltiades, who even before was well
      reputed with the Athenians, came then to be in much higher estimation: and
      when he asked the Athenians for seventy ships and an army with supplies of
      money, not declaring to them against what land he was intending to make an
      expedition, but saying that he would enrich them greatly if they would go
      with him, for he would lead them to a land of such a kind that they would
      easily get from it gold in abundance,—thus saying he asked for the
      ships; and the Athenians, elated by these words, delivered them over to
      him..
    </p>
<p>
      133. Then Miltiades, when he had received the army, proceeded to sail to
      Paris with the pretence that the Parians had first attacked Athens by
      making expedition with triremes to Marathon in company with the Persian:
      this was the pretext which he put forward, but he had also a grudge
      against the Parians on account of Lysagoras the son of Tisias, who was by
      race of Paros, for having accused him to Hydarnes the Persian. So when
      Miltiades had arrived at the place to which he was sailing, he began to
      besiege the Parians with his army, first having shut them up within their
      wall; and sending in to them a herald he asked for a hundred talents,
      saying that if they refused to give them, his army should not return back
      <a href="#link6note-116" id="link6noteref-116" class="pginternal">116</a>
      until it had conquered them completely. The Parians however had no design
      of giving any money to Miltiades, but contrived only how they might defend
      their city, devising various things besides and also this,—wherever
      at any time the wall proved to be open to attack, that point was raised
      when night came on to double its former height..
    </p>
<p>
      134. So much of the story is reported by all the Hellenes, but as to what
      followed the Parians alone report, and they say that it happened thus:—When
      Miltiades was at a loss, it is said, there came a woman to speech with
      him, who had been taken prisoner, a Parian by race whose name was Timo, an
      under-priestess <a href="#link6note-117" id="link6noteref-117" class="pginternal">117</a> of the Earth goddesses; <a href="#link6note-118" id="link6noteref-118" class="pginternal">118</a>
      she, they say, came into the presence of Miltiades and counselled him that
      if he considered it a matter of much moment to conquer Paros, he could do
      that which she should suggest to him; and upon that she told him her
      meaning. He accordingly passed through to the hill which is before the
      city and leapt over the fence of the temple of Demeter Giver of Laws, <a href="#link6note-119" id="link6noteref-119" class="pginternal">119</a>
      not being able to open the door; and then having leapt over he went on
      towards the sanctuary <a href="#link6note-120" id="link6noteref-120" class="pginternal">120</a> with the design of doing something within,
      whether it were that he meant to lay hands on some of the things which
      should not be touched, or whatever else he intended to do; and when he had
      reached the door, forthwith a shuddering fear came over him and he set off
      to go back the same way as he came, and as he leapt down from the wall of
      rough stones his thigh was dislocated, or, as others say, he struck his
      knee against the wall..
    </p>
<p>
      135. Miltiades accordingly, being in a wretched case, set forth to sail
      homewards, neither bringing wealth to the Athenians nor having added to
      them the possession of Paros, but having besieged the city for
      six-and-twenty days and laid waste the island: and the Parians being
      informed that Timo the under-priestess of the goddesses had acted as a
      guide to Miltiades, desired to take vengeance upon her for this, and they
      sent messengers to Delphi to consult the god, so soon as they had leisure
      from the siege; and these messengers they sent to ask whether they should
      put to death the under-priestess of the goddesses, who had been a guide to
      their enemies for the capture of her native city and had revealed to
      Miltiades the mysteries which might not be uttered to a male person. The
      Pythian prophetess however forbade them, saying that Timo was not the true
      author of these things, but since it was destined that Miltiades should
      end his life not well, she had appeared to guide him to his evil fate..
    </p>
<p>
      136. Thus the Pythian prophetess replied to the Parians: and the
      Athenians, when Miltiades had returned back from Paros, began to talk of
      him, and among the rest especially Xanthippos the son of Ariphron, who
      brought Miltiades up before the people claiming the penalty of death and
      prosecuted him for his deception of the Athenians: and Miltiades did not
      himself make his own defence, although he was present, for he was unable
      to do so because his thigh was mortifying; but he lay in public view upon
      a bed, while his friends made a defence for him, making mention much both
      of the battle which had been fought at Marathon and of the conquest of
      Lemnos, namely how he had conquered Lemnos and taken vengeance on the
      Pelasgians, and had delivered it over to the Athenians: and the people
      came over to his part as regards the acquittal from the penalty of death,
      but they imposed a fine of fifty talents for the wrong committed: and
      after this Miltiades died, his thigh having gangrened and mortified, and
      the fifty talents were paid by his son Kimon.
    </p>
<p>
      137. Now Miltiades son of Kimon had thus taken possession of the Lemnos:—After
      the Pelasgians had been cast out of Attica by the Athenians, whether
      justly or unjustly,—for about this I cannot tell except the things
      reported, which are these:—Hecataois on the one hand, the son of
      Hegesander, said in his history that it was done unjustly; for he said
      that when the Athenians saw the land which extends below Hymettos, which
      they had themselves given them <a href="#link6note-121" id="link6noteref-121" class="pginternal">121</a> to dwell in, as
      payment for the wall built round the Acropolis in former times, when the
      Athenians, I say, saw that this land was made good by cultivation, which
      before was bad and worthless, they were seized with jealousy and with
      longing to possess the land, and so drove them out, not alleging any other
      pretext: but according to the report of the Athenians themselves they
      drove them out justly; for the Pelasgians being settled under Hymettos
      made this a starting-point and committed wrong against them as follows:—the
      daughters and sons of the Athenians were wont ever to go for water to the
      spring of Enneacrunos; for at that time neither they nor the other
      Hellenes as yet had household servants; and when these girls came, the
      Pelasgians in wantonness and contempt of the Athenians would offer them
      violence; and it was not enough for them even to do this, but at last they
      were found in the act of plotting an attack upon the city: and the
      narrators say that they herein proved themselves better men than the
      Pelasgians, inasmuch as when they might have slain the Pelasgians, who had
      been caught plotting against them, they did not choose to do so, but
      ordered them merely to depart out of the land: and thus having departed
      out of the land, the Pelasgians took possession of several older places
      and especially of Lemnos. The former story is that which was reported by
      Hecataios, while the latter is that which is told by the Athenians..
    </p>
<p>
      138. These Pelasgians then, dwelling after that in Lemnos, desired to take
      vengeance on the Athenians; and having full knowledge also of the
      festivals of the Athenians, they got <a href="#link6note-122" id="link6noteref-122" class="pginternal">122</a> fifty-oared galleys
      and laid wait for the women of the Athenians when they were keeping
      festival to Artemis in Brauron; and having carried off a number of them
      from thence, they departed and sailed away home, and taking the women to
      Lemnos they kept them as concubines. Now when these women had children
      gradually more and more, they made it their practice to teach their sons
      both the Attic tongue and the manners of the Athenians. And these were not
      willing to associate with the sons of the Pelasgian women, and moreover if
      any of them were struck by any one of those, they all in a body came to
      the rescue and helped one another. Moreover the boys claimed to have
      authority over the other boys and got the better of them easily.
      Perceiving these things the Pelasgians considered the matter; and when
      they took counsel together, a fear came over them and they thought, if the
      boys were indeed resolved now to help one another against the sons of the
      legitimate wives, and were endeavouring already from the first to have
      authority over them, what would they do when they were grown up to be men?
      Then they determined to put to death the sons of the Athenian women, and
      this they actually did; and in addition to them they slew their mothers
      also. From this deed and from that which was done before this, which the
      women did when they killed Thoas and the rest, who were their own
      husbands, it has become a custom in Hellas that all deeds of great cruelty
      should be called "Lemnian deeds.".
    </p>
<p>
      139. After the Pelasgians had killed their own sons and wives, the earth
      did not bear fruit for them, nor did their women or their cattle bring
      forth young as they did before; and being hard pressed by famine and by
      childlessness, they sent to Delphi to ask for a release from the evils
      which were upon them; and the Pythian prophetess bade them pay such
      penalty to the Athenians as the Athenians themselves should appoint. The
      Pelasgians came accordingly to Athens and professed that they were willing
      to pay the penalty for all the wrong which they had done: and the
      Athenians laid a couch in the fairest possible manner in the City Hall,
      and having set by it a table covered with all good things, they bade the
      Pelasgians deliver up to them their land in that condition. Then the
      Pelasgians answered and said: "When with a North Wind in one single day a
      ship shall accomplish the voyage from your land to ours, then we will
      deliver it up," feeling assured that it was impossible for this to happen,
      since Attica lies far away to the South of Lemnos..
    </p>
<p>
      140. Such were the events which happened then: and very many years later,
      after the Chersonese which is by the Hellespont had come to be under the
      Athenians, Miltiades the son of Kimon, when the Etesian Winds blew
      steadily, accomplished the voyage in a ship from Elaius in the Chersonese
      to Lemnos, and proclaimed to the Pelasgians that they should depart out of
      the island, reminding them of the oracle, which the Pelasgians had never
      expected would be accomplished for them. The men of Hephaistia accordingly
      obeyed; but those of Myrina, not admitting that the Chersonese was Attica,
      suffered a siege, until at last these also submitted. Thus it was that the
      Athenians and Miltiades took possession of Lemnos.

<h2>
      BOOK VII. THE SEVENTH BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED POLYMNIA
    </h2>
<p>
      1. Now when the report came to Dareios the son of Hystaspes of the battle
      which was fought at Marathon, the king, who even before this had been
      greatly exasperated with the Athenians on account of the attack made upon
      Sardis, then far more than before displayed indignation, and was far more
      desirous of making a march against Hellas. Accordingly at once he sent
      messengers to the various cities and ordered that they should get ready a
      force, appointing to each people to supply much more than at the former
      time, and not only ships of war, but also horses and provisions and
      transport vessels; <a href="#link7note-1" id="link7noteref-1" class="pginternal">1</a> and when these commands were carried round, all
      Asia was moved for three years, for all the best men were being enlisted
      for the expedition against Hellas, and were making preparations. In the
      fourth year however the Egyptians, who had been reduced to subjection by
      Cambyses, revolted from the Persians; and then he was even more desirous
      of marching against both these nations.
    </p>
<p>
      2. While Dareios was thus preparing to set out against Egypt and against
      Athens, there arose a great strife among his sons about the supreme power;
      and they said that he must not make his expeditions until he had
      designated one of them to be king, according to the custom of the
      Persians. For to Dareios already before he became king three sons had been
      born of his former wife the daughter of Gobryas, and after he became king
      four other sons of Atossa the daughter of Cyrus: of the first the eldest
      was Artobazanes, and of those who had been born later, Xerxes. These being
      not of the same mother were at strife with one another, Artobazanes
      contending that he was the eldest of all the sons, and that it was a
      custom maintained by all men that the eldest should have the rule, and
      Xerxes arguing that he was the son of Atossa the daughter of Cyrus, and
      that Cyrus was he who had won for the Persians their freedom.
    </p>
<p>
      3. Now while Dareios did not as yet declare his judgment, it chanced that
      Demaratos also, the son of Ariston, had come up to Susa at this very same
      time, having been deprived of the kingdom in Sparta and having laid upon
      himself a sentence of exile from Lacedemon. This man, hearing of the
      difference between the sons of Dareios, came (as it is reported of him)
      and counselled Xerxes to say in addition to those things which he was wont
      to say, that he had been born to Dareios at the time when he was already
      reigning as king and was holding the supreme power over the Persians,
      while Artobazanes had been born while Dareios was still in a private
      station: it was not fitting therefore nor just that another should have
      the honour before him; for even in Sparta, suggested Demaratos, this was
      the custom, that is to say, if some of the sons had been born first,
      before their father began to reign, and another came after, born later
      while he was reigning, the succession of the kingdom belonged to him who
      had been born later. Xerxes accordingly made use of the suggestion of
      Demaratos; and Dareios perceiving that he spoke that which was just,
      designated him to be king. It is my opinion however that even without this
      suggestion Xerxes would have become king, for Atossa was all-powerful.
    </p>
<p>
      4. Then having designated Xerxes to the Persians as their king, Dareios
      wished to go on his expeditions. However in the next year after this and
      after the revolt of Egypt, it came to pass that Dareios himself died,
      having been king in all six-and-thirty years; and thus he did not succeed
      in taking vengeance either upon the revolted Egyptians or upon the
      Athenians.
    </p>
<p>
      5. Dareios being dead the kingdom passed to his son Xerxes. Now Xerxes at
      the first was by no means anxious to make a march against Hellas, but
      against Egypt he continued to gather a force. Mardonios however, the son
      of Gobryas, who was a cousin of Xerxes, being sister's son to Dareios, was
      ever at his side, and having power with him more than any other of the
      Persians, he kept continually to such discourse as this which follows,
      saying: "Master, it is not fitting that the Athenians, after having done
      to the Persians very great evil, should not pay the penalty for that which
      they have done. What if thou shouldest <a href="#link7note-2" id="link7noteref-2" class="pginternal">2</a> at this present time do
      that which thou hast in thy hands to do; and when thou hast tamed the land
      of Egypt, which has broken out insolently against us, then do thou march
      an army against Athens, that a good report may be made of thee by men, and
      that in future every one may beware of making expeditions against thy
      land." Thus far his speech had to do with vengeance, <a href="#link7note-3" id="link7noteref-3" class="pginternal">3</a> and to this he would make
      addition as follows, saying that Europe was a very fair land and bore all
      kinds of trees that are cultivated for fruit, and was of excellent
      fertility, and such that the king alone of all mortals was worthy to
      possess it.
    </p>
<p>
      6. These things he was wont to say, since he was one who had a desire for
      perilous enterprise and wished to be himself the governor of Hellas under
      the king. So in time he prevailed upon Xerxes and persuaded him to do
      this; for other things also assisted him and proved helpful to him in
      persuading Xerxes. In the first place there had come from Thessaly
      messengers sent by the Aleuadai, who were inviting the king to come
      against Hellas and were showing great zeal in his cause, (now these
      Aleuadai were kings of Thessaly): and then secondly those of the sons of
      Peisistratos who had come up to Susa were inviting him also, holding to
      the same arguments as the Aleuadai; and moreover they offered him yet more
      inducement in addition to these; for there was one Onomacritos an
      Athenian, who both uttered oracles and also had collected and arranged the
      oracles of Musaios; <a href="#link7note-4" id="link7noteref-4" class="pginternal">4</a> and with this man they had come up, after they
      had first reconciled the enmity between them. For Onomacritos had been
      driven forth from Athens by Hipparchos the son of Peisistratos, having
      been caught by Lasos of Hermion interpolating in the works of Musaios an
      oracle to the effect that the islands which lie off Lemnos should
      disappear <a href="#link7note-5" id="link7noteref-5" class="pginternal">5</a>
      under the sea. For this reason Hipparchos drove him forth, having before
      this time been very much wont to consult him. Now however he had gone up
      with them; and when he had come into the presence of the king, the sons of
      Peisistratos spoke of him in magnificent terms, and he repeated some of
      the oracles; and if there was in them anything which imported disaster to
      the Barbarians, of this he said nothing; but choosing out of them the most
      fortunate things he told how it was destined that the Hellespont should be
      yoked with a bridge by a Persian, and he set forth the manner of the
      march. He then thus urged Xerxes with oracles, while the sons of
      Peisistratos and the Aleuadai pressed him with their advice.
    </p>
<p>
      7. So when Xerxes had been persuaded to make an expedition against Hellas,
      then in the next year after the death of Dareios he made a march first
      against those who had revolted. Having subdued these and having reduced
      all Egypt to slavery much greater than it had suffered in the reign of
      Dareios, he entrusted the government of it to Achaimenes his own brother,
      a son of Dareios. Now this Achaimenes being a governor of Egypt was slain
      afterwards by Inaros the son of Psammetichos, a Libyan.
    </p>
<p>
      8. Xerxes then after the conquest of Egypt, being about to take in hand
      the expedition against Athens, summoned a chosen assembly of the best men
      among the Persians, that he might both learn their opinions and himself in
      the presence of all declare that which he intended to do; and when they
      were assembled, Xerxes spoke to them as follows: (a) "Persians, I shall
      not be the first to establish this custom in your nation, but having
      received it from others I shall follow it: for as I am informed by those
      who are older than myself, we never yet have kept quiet since we received
      this supremacy in succession to the Medes, when Cyrus overthrew Astyages;
      but God thus leads us, and for ourselves tends to good that we are busied
      about many things. Now about the nations which Cyrus and Cambyses and my
      father Dareios subdued and added to their possessions there is no need for
      me to speak, since ye know well: and as for me, from the day when I
      received by inheritance this throne upon which I sit <a href="#link7note-6" id="link7noteref-6" class="pginternal">6</a> I carefully considered
      always how in this honourable place I might not fall short of those who
      have been before me, nor add less power to the dominion of the Persians:
      and thus carefully considering I find a way by which not only glory may be
      won by us, together with a land not less in extent nor worse than that
      which we now possess, (and indeed more varied in its productions), but
      also vengeance and retribution may be brought about. Wherefore I have
      assembled you together now, in order that I may communicate to you that
      which I have it in my mind to do. (b) I design to yoke the Hellespont with
      a bridge, and to march an army through Europe against Hellas, in order
      that I may take vengeance on the Athenians for all the things which they
      have done both to the Persians and to my father. Ye saw how my father
      Dareios also was purposing to make an expedition against these men; but he
      has ended his life and did not succeed in taking vengeance upon them. I
      however, on behalf of him and also of the other Persians, will not cease
      until I have conquered Athens and burnt it with fire; seeing that they did
      wrong unprovoked to me and to my father. First they went to Sardis, having
      come with Aristagoras the Milesian our slave, and they set fire to the
      sacred groves and the temples; and then secondly, what things they did to
      us when we disembarked in their land, at the time when Datis and
      Artaphrenes were commanders of our army, ye all know well, as I think. <a href="#link7note-7" id="link7noteref-7" class="pginternal">7</a> (c)
      For these reasons <a href="#link7note-8" id="link7noteref-8" class="pginternal">8</a> I have resolved to make an expedition against
      them, and reckoning I find in the matter so many good things as ye shall
      hear:—if we shall subdue these and the neighbours of these, who
      dwell in the land of Pelops the Phrygian, we shall cause the Persian land
      to have the same boundaries as the heaven of Zeus; since in truth upon no
      land will the sun look down which borders ours, but I with your help shall
      make all the lands into one land, having passed through the whole extent
      of Europe. For I am informed that things are so, namely that there is no
      city of men nor any race of human beings remaining, which will be able to
      come to a contest with us, when those whom I just now mentioned have been
      removed out of the way. Thus both those who have committed wrong against
      us will have the yoke of slavery, and also those who have not committed
      wrong. (d) And ye will please me best if ye do this:—whensoever I
      shall signify to you the time at which ye ought to come, ye must appear
      every one of you with zeal for the service; and whosoever shall come with
      a force best equipped, to him I will give gifts such as are accounted in
      our land to be the most honourable. Thus must these things be done: but
      that I may not seem to you to be following my own counsel alone, I propose
      the matter for discussion, bidding any one of you who desires it, declare
      his opinion."
    </p>
<p>
      9. Having thus spoken he ceased; and after him Mardonios said: "Master,
      thou dost surpass not only all the Persians who were before thee, but also
      those who shall come after, since thou didst not only attain in thy words
      to that which is best and truest as regards other matters, but also thou
      wilt not permit the Ionians who dwell in Europe to make a mock of us,
      having no just right to do so: for a strange thing it would be if, when we
      have subdued and kept as our servants Sacans, Indians, Ethiopians,
      Assyrians, and other nations many in number and great, who have done no
      wrong to the Persians, because we desired to add to our dominions, we
      should not take vengeance on the Hellenes who committed wrong against us
      unprovoked. (a) Of what should we be afraid?—what gathering of
      numbers, or what resources of money? for their manner of fight we know,
      and as for their resources, we know that they are feeble; and we have
      moreover subdued already their sons, those I mean who are settled in our
      land and are called Ionians, Aiolians, and Dorians. Moreover I myself
      formerly made trial of marching against these men, being commanded thereto
      by thy father; and although I marched as far as Macedonia, and fell but
      little short of coming to Athens itself, no man came to oppose me in
      fight. (b) And yet it is true that the Hellenes make wars, but (as I am
      informed) very much without wise consideration, by reason of obstinacy and
      want of skill: for when they have proclaimed war upon one another, they
      find out first the fairest and smoothest place, and to this they come down
      and fight; so that even the victors depart from the fight with great loss,
      and as to the vanquished, of them I make no mention at all, for they are
      utterly destroyed. They ought however, being men who speak the same
      language, to make use of heralds and messengers and so to take up their
      differences and settle them in any way rather than by battles; but if they
      must absolutely war with one another, they ought to find out each of them
      that place in which they themselves are hardest to overcome, and here to
      make their trial. Therefore the Hellenes, since they use no good way, when
      I had marched as far as the land of Macedonia, did not come to the
      resolution of fighting with me. (c) Who then is likely to set himself
      against thee, O king, offering war, when thou art leading both all the
      multitudes of Asia and the whole number of the ships? I for my part am of
      opinion that the power of the Hellenes has not attained to such a pitch of
      boldness: but if after all I should prove to be deceived in my judgment,
      and they stirred up by inconsiderate folly should come to battle with us,
      they would learn that we are the best of all men in the matters of war.
      However that may be, let not anything be left untried; for nothing comes
      of itself, but from trial all things are wont to come to men."
    </p>
<p>
      10. Mardonios having thus smoothed over the resolution expressed by Xerxes
      had ceased speaking: and when the other Persians were silent and did not
      venture to declare an opinion contrary to that which had been proposed,
      then Artabanos the son of Hystaspes, being father's brother to Xerxes and
      having reliance upon that, spoke as follows: (a) "O king, if opinions
      opposed to one another be not spoken, it is not possible to select the
      better in making the choice, but one must accept that which has been
      spoken; if however opposite opinions be uttered, this is possible; just as
      we do not distinguish the gold which is free from alloy when it is alone
      by itself, but when we rub it on the touchstone in comparison with other
      gold, then we distinguish that which is the better. Now I gave advice to
      thy father Dareios also, who was my brother, not to march against the
      Scythians, men who occupied no abiding city in any part of the earth. He
      however, expecting that he would subdue the Scythians who were nomads, did
      not listen to me; but he made a march and came back from it with the loss
      of many good men of his army. But thou, O king, art intending to march
      against men who are much better than the Scythians, men who are reported
      to be excellent both by sea and on land: and the thing which is to be
      feared in this matter it is right that I should declare to thee. (b) Thou
      sayest that thou wilt yoke the Hellespont with a bridge and march an army
      through Europe to Hellas. Now supposing it chance that we are <a href="#link7note-9" id="link7noteref-9" class="pginternal">9</a>
      worsted either by land or by sea, or even both, for the men are reported
      to be valiant in fight, (and we may judge for ourselves that it is so,
      since the Athenians by themselves destroyed that great army which came
      with Datis and Artaphrenes to the Attic land),—suppose however that
      they do not succeed in both, yet if they shall attack with their ships and
      conquer in a sea-fight, and then sail to the Hellespont and break up the
      bridge, this of itself, O king, will prove to be a great peril. (c) Not
      however by any native wisdom of my own do I conjecture that this might
      happen: I am conjecturing only such a misfortune as all but came upon us
      at the former time, when thy father, having yoked the Bosphorus of Thracia
      and made a bridge over the river Ister, had crossed over to go against the
      Scythians. At that time the Scythians used every means of entreaty to
      persuade the Ionians to break up the passage, to whom it had been
      entrusted to guard the bridges of the Ister. At that time, if Histiaios
      the despot of Miletos had followed the opinion of the other despots and
      had not made opposition to them, the power of the Persians would have been
      brought to an end. Yet it is a fearful thing even to hear it reported that
      the whole power of the king had come to depend upon one human creature. <a href="#link7note-10" id="link7noteref-10" class="pginternal">10</a>
      (d) Do not thou therefore propose to go into any such danger when there is
      no need, but do as I say:—at the present time dissolve this
      assembly; and afterwards at whatever time it shall seem good to thee, when
      thou hast considered prudently with thyself, proclaim that which seems to
      thee best: for good counsel I hold to be a very great gain; since even if
      anything shall prove adverse, the counsel which has been taken is no less
      good, though it has been defeated by fortune; while he who took counsel
      badly at first, if good fortune should go with him has lighted on a prize
      by chance, but none the less for that his counsel was bad. (e) Thou seest
      how God strikes with thunderbolts the creatures which stand above the rest
      and suffers them not to make a proud show; while those which are small do
      not provoke him to jealousy: thou seest also how he hurls his darts ever
      at those buildings which are the highest and those trees likewise; for God
      is wont to cut short all those things which stand out above the rest. Thus
      also a numerous army is destroyed by one of few men in some such manner as
      this, namely when God having become jealous of them casts upon them panic
      or thundering from heaven, then they are destroyed utterly and not as
      their worth deserves; for God suffers not any other to have high thoughts
      save only himself. (f) Moreover the hastening of any matter breeds
      disasters, whence great losses are wont to be produced; but in waiting
      there are many good things contained, as to which, if they do not appear
      to be good at first, yet one will find them to be so in course of time.
      (g) To thee, O king, I give this counsel: but thou son of Gobryas,
      Mardonios, cease speaking foolish words about the Hellenes, since they in
      no way deserve to be spoken of with slight; for by uttering slander
      against the Hellenes thou art stirring the king himself to make an
      expedition, and it is to this very end that I think thou art straining all
      thy endeavour. Let not this be so; for slander is a most grievous thing:
      in it the wrongdoers are two, and the person who suffers wrong is one. The
      slanderer does a wrong in that he speaks against one who is not present,
      the other in that he is persuaded of the thing before he gets certain
      knowledge of it, and he who is not present when the words are spoken
      suffers wrong in the matter thus,—both because he has been slandered
      by the one and because he has been believed to be bad by the other. (h)
      However, if it be absolutely needful to make an expedition against these
      men, come, let the king himself remain behind in the abodes of the
      Persians, and let us both set to the wager our sons; and then do thou lead
      an army by thyself, choosing for thyself the men whom thou desirest, and
      taking an army as large as thou thinkest good: and if matters turn out for
      the king as thou sayest, let my sons be slain and let me also be slain in
      addition to them; but if in the way which I predict, let thy sons suffer
      this, and with them thyself also, if thou shalt return back. But if thou
      art not willing to undergo this proof, but wilt by all means lead an army
      against Hellas, then I say that those who are left behind in this land
      will hear <a href="#link7note-11" id="link7noteref-11" class="pginternal">11</a> that Mardonios, after having done a great
      mischief to the Persians, is torn by dogs and birds, either in the land of
      the Athenians, or else perchance thou wilt be in the land of the
      Lacedemonians (unless indeed this should have come to pass even before
      that upon the way), and that thou hast at length been made aware against
      what kind of men thou art persuading the king to march."
    </p>
<p>
      11. Artabanos thus spoke; and Xerxes enraged by it made answer as follows:
      "Artabanos, thou art my father's brother, and this shall save thee from
      receiving any recompense such as thy foolish words deserve. Yet I attach
      to thee this dishonour, seeing that thou art a coward and spiritless,
      namely that thou do not march with me against Hellas, but remain here
      together with the women; and I, even without thy help, will accomplish all
      the things which I said: for I would I might not be descended from
      Dareios, the son of Hystaspes, the son of Arsames, the son of Ariaramnes,
      the son of Teïspes, or from Cyrus, <a href="#link7note-12" id="link7noteref-12" class="pginternal">12</a> the son of Cambyses,
      the son of Teïspes, the son of Achaimenes, if I take not vengeance on the
      Athenians; since I know well that if we shall keep quiet, yet they will
      not do so, but will again <a href="#link7note-13" id="link7noteref-13" class="pginternal">13</a> march against our land, if we may judge by the
      deeds which have been done by them to begin with, since they both set fire
      to Sardis and marched upon Asia. It is not possible therefore that either
      side should retire from the quarrel, but the question before us is whether
      we shall do or whether we shall suffer; whether all these regions shall
      come to be under the Hellenes or all those under the Persians: for in our
      hostility there is no middle course. It follows then now that it is well
      for us, having suffered wrong first, to take revenge, that I may find out
      also what is this terrible thing which I shall suffer if I lead an army
      against these men,—men whom Pelops the Phrygian, who was the slave
      of my forefathers, so subdued that even to the present day both the men
      themselves and their land are called after the name of him who subdued
      them."
    </p>
<p>
      12. Thus far was it spoken then; but afterwards when darkness came on, the
      opinion of Artabanos tormented Xerxes continually; and making night his
      counsellor he found that it was by no means to his advantage to make the
      march against Hellas. So when he had thus made a new resolve, he fell
      asleep, and in the night he saw, as is reported by the Persians, a vision
      as follows:—Xerxes thought that a man tall and comely of shape came
      and stood by him and said: "Art thou indeed changing thy counsel, O
      Persian, of leading an expedition against Hellas, now that thou hast made
      proclamation that the Persians shall collect an army? Thou dost not well
      in changing thy counsel, nor will he who is here present with thee excuse
      thee from it; <a href="#link7note-1301" id="link7noteref-1301" class="pginternal">1301</a> but as thou didst take counsel in the day
      to do, by that way go."
    </p>
<p>
      13. After he had said this, Xerxes thought that he who had spoken flew
      away; and when day had dawned he made no account of this dream, but
      gathered together the Persians whom he had assembled also the former time
      and said to them these words: "Persians, pardon me that I make quick
      changes in my counsel; for in judgment not yet am I come to my prime, and
      they who advise me to do the things which I said, do not for any long time
      leave me to myself. However, although at first when I heard the opinion of
      Artabanos my youthful impulses burst out, <a href="#link7note-14" id="link7noteref-14" class="pginternal">14</a> so that I cast out
      unseemly words <a href="#link7note-15" id="link7noteref-15" class="pginternal">15</a> against a man older than myself; yet now I
      acknowledge that he is right, and I shall follow his opinion. Consider
      then I have changed my resolve to march against Hellas, and do ye remain
      still."
    </p>
<p>
      14. The Persians accordingly when they heard this were rejoiced and made
      obeisance: but when night had come on, the same dream again came and stood
      by Xerxes as he lay asleep and said: "Son of Dareios, it is manifest then
      that thou hast resigned this expedition before the assembly of the
      Persians, and that thou hast made no account of my words, as if thou hadst
      heard them from no one at all. Now therefore be well assured of this:—if
      thou do not make thy march forthwith, there shall thence spring up for
      thee this result, namely that, as thou didst in short time become great
      and mighty, so also thou shalt speedily be again brought low."
    </p>
<p>
      15. Xerxes then, being very greatly disturbed by fear of the vision,
      started up from his bed and sent a messenger to summon Artabanos; to whom
      when he came Xerxes spoke thus: "Artabanos, at the first I was not
      discreet, when I spoke to thee foolish words on account of thy good
      counsel; but after no long time I changed my mind and perceived that I
      ought to do these things which thou didst suggest to me. I am not able
      however to do them, although I desire it; for indeed, now that I have
      turned about and changed my mind, a dream appears haunting me and by no
      means approving that I should do so; and just now it has left me even with
      a threat. If therefore it is God who sends it to me, and it is his
      absolute will and pleasure that an army should go against Hellas, this
      same dream will fly to thee also, laying upon thee a charge such as it has
      laid upon me; and it occurs to my mind that this might happen thus, namely
      if thou shouldst take all my attire and put it on, and then seat thyself
      on my throne, and after that lie down to sleep in my bed."
    </p>
<p>
      16. Xerxes spoke to him thus; and Artabanos was not willing to obey the
      command at first, since he did not think himself worthy to sit upon the
      royal throne; but at last being urged further he did that which was
      commanded, first having spoken these words: (a) "It is equally good in my
      judgment, O king, whether a man has wisdom himself or is willing to follow
      the counsel of him who speaks well: and thou, who hast attained to both
      these good things, art caused to err by the communications of evil men;
      just as they say that the Sea, which is of all things the most useful to
      men, is by blasts of winds falling upon it prevented from doing according
      to its own nature. I however, when I was evil spoken of by thee, was not
      so much stung with pain for this, as because, when two opinions were laid
      before the Persians, the one tending to increase wanton insolence and the
      other tending to check it and saying that it was a bad thing to teach the
      soul to endeavour always to have something more than the present
      possession,—because, I say, when such opinions as these were laid
      before us, thou didst choose that one which was the more dangerous both
      for thyself and for the Persians. (b) And now that thou hast turned to the
      better counsel, thou sayest that when thou art disposed to let go the
      expedition against the Hellenes, a dream haunts thee sent by some god,
      which forbids thee to abandon thy enterprise. Nay, but here too thou dost
      err, my son, since this is not of the Deity; <a href="#link7note-16" id="link7noteref-16" class="pginternal">16</a> for the dreams of sleep
      which come roaming about to men, are of such nature as I shall inform
      thee, being by many years older than thou. The visions of dreams are wont
      to hover above us <a href="#link7note-17" id="link7noteref-17" class="pginternal">17</a> in such form <a href="#link7note-18" id="link7noteref-18" class="pginternal">18</a> for the most part as
      the things of which we were thinking during the day; and we in the days
      preceding were very much occupied with this campaign. (c) If however after
      all this is not such a thing as I interpret it to be, but is something
      which is concerned with God, thou hast summed the matter up in that which
      thou hast said: let it appear, as thou sayest, to me also, as to thee, and
      give commands. But supposing that it desires to appear to me at all, it is
      not bound to appear to me any the more if I have thy garments on me than
      if I have my own, nor any more if I take my rest in thy bed than if I am
      in thy own; for assuredly this thing, whatever it may be, which appears to
      thee in thy sleep, is not so foolish as to suppose, when it sees me, that
      it is thou, judging so because the garments are thine. That however which
      we must find out now is this, namely if it will hold me in no account, and
      not think fit to appear to me, whether I have my own garments or whether I
      have thine, but continue still to haunt thee; <a href="#link7note-19" id="link7noteref-19" class="pginternal">19</a> for if it shall indeed
      haunt thee perpetually, I shall myself also be disposed to say that it is
      of the Deity. But if thou hast resolved that it shall be so, and it is not
      possible to turn aside this thy resolution, but I must go to sleep in thy
      bed, then let it appear to me also, when I perform these things: but until
      then I shall hold to the opinion which I now have."
    </p>
<p>
      17. Having thus said Artabanos, expecting that he would prove that Xerxes
      was speaking folly, did that which was commanded him; and having put on
      the garments of Xerxes and seated himself in the royal throne, he
      afterwards went to bed: and when he had fallen asleep, the same dream came
      to him which used to come to Xerxes, and standing over Artabanos spoke
      these words: "Art thou indeed he who endeavours to dissuade Xerxes from
      making a march against Hellas, pretending to have a care of him? However,
      neither in the future nor now at the present shalt thou escape unpunished
      for trying to turn away that which is destined to come to pass: and as for
      Xerxes, that which he must suffer if he disobeys, hath been shown already
      to the man himself."
    </p>
<p>
      18. Thus it seemed to Artabanos that the dream threatened him, and at the
      same time was just about to burn out his eyes with hot irons; and with a
      loud cry he started up from his bed, and sitting down beside Xerxes he
      related to him throughout the vision of the dream, and then said to him as
      follows: "I, O king, as one who has seen before now many great things
      brought to their fall by things less, urged thee not to yield in all
      things to the inclination of thy youth, since I knew that it was evil to
      have desire after many things; remembering on the one hand the march of
      Cyrus against the Massagetai, what fortune it had, and also that of
      Cambyses against the Ethiopians; and being myself one who took part with
      Dareios in the campaign against the Scythians. Knowing these things I had
      the opinion that thou wert to be envied of all men, so long as thou
      shouldest keep still. Since however there comes a divine impulse, and, as
      it seems, a destruction sent by heaven is taking hold of the Hellenes, I
      for my part am both changed in myself and also I reverse my opinions; and
      do thou signify to the Persians the message which is sent to thee from
      God, bidding them follow the commands which were given by thee at first
      with regard to the preparations to be made; and endeavour that on thy side
      nothing may be wanting, since God delivers the matter into thy hands."
      These things having been said, both were excited to confidence by the
      vision, and so soon as it became day, Xerxes communicated the matter to
      the Persians, and Artabanos, who before was the only man who came forward
      to dissuade him, now came forward to urge on the design.
    </p>
<p>
      19. Xerxes being thus desirous to make the expedition, there came to him
      after this a third vision in his sleep, which the Magians, when they heard
      it, explained to have reference to the dominion of the whole Earth and to
      mean that all men should be subject to him; and the vision was this:—Xerxes
      thought that he had been crowned with a wreath of an olive-branch and that
      the shoots growing from the olive-tree covered the whole Earth; and after
      that, the wreath, placed as it was about his head, disappeared. When the
      Magians had thus interpreted the vision, forthwith every man of the
      Persians who had been assembled together departed to his own province and
      was zealous by all means to perform the commands, desiring each one to
      receive for himself the gifts which had been proposed: and thus Xerxes was
      gathering his army together, searching every region of the continent.
    </p>
<p>
      20. During four full years from the conquest of Egypt he was preparing the
      army and the things that were of service for the army, and in the course
      of the fifth year <a href="#link7note-20" id="link7noteref-20" class="pginternal">20</a> he began his campaign with a host of great
      multitude. For of all the armies of which we have knowledge this proved to
      be by far the greatest; so that neither that led by Dareios against the
      Scythians appears anything as compared with it, nor the Scythian host,
      when the Scythians pursuing the Kimmerians made invasion of the Median
      land and subdued and occupied nearly all the upper parts of Asia, for
      which invasion afterwards Dareios attempted to take vengeance, nor that
      led by the sons of Atreus to Ilion, to judge by that which is reported of
      their expedition, nor that of the Mysians and Teucrians, before the Trojan
      war, who passed over into Europe by the Bosphorus and not only subdued all
      the Thracians, but came down also as far as the Ionian Sea <a href="#link7note-21" id="link7noteref-21" class="pginternal">21</a>
      and marched southwards to the river Peneios.
    </p>
<p>
      21. All these expeditions put together, with others, if there be any,
      added to them, <a href="#link7note-22" id="link7noteref-22" class="pginternal">22</a> are not equal to this one alone. For what
      nation did Xerxes not lead out of Asia against Hellas? and what water was
      not exhausted, being drunk by his host, except only the great rivers? For
      some supplied ships, and others were appointed to serve in the land-army;
      to some it was appointed to furnish cavalry, and to others vessels to
      carry horses, while they served in the expedition themselves also; <a href="#link7note-23" id="link7noteref-23" class="pginternal">23</a>
      others were ordered to furnish ships of war for the bridges, and others
      again ships with provisions.
    </p>
<p>
      22. Then in the first place, since the former fleet had suffered disaster
      in sailing round Athos, preparations had been going on for about three
      years past with regard to Athos: for triremes lay at anchor at Elaius in
      the Chersonese, and with this for their starting point men of all nations
      belonging to the army worked at digging, compelled by the lash; and the
      men went to the work regularly in succession: moreover those who dwelt
      round about Athos worked also at the digging: and Bubares the son of
      Megabazos and Artachaies the son of Artaios, Persians both, were set over
      the work. Now Athos is a mountain great and famous, running down to the
      sea and inhabited by men: and where the mountain ends on the side of the
      mainland the place is like a peninsula with an isthmus about twelve
      furlongs <a href="#link7note-24" id="link7noteref-24" class="pginternal">24</a> across. Here it is plain land or hills of no
      great size, extending from the sea of the Acanthians to that which lies
      off Torone; and on this isthmus, where Athos ends, is situated a Hellenic
      city called Sane: moreover there are others beyond Sane <a href="#link7note-25" id="link7noteref-25" class="pginternal">25</a>
      and within the peninsula of Athos, all which at this time the Persian had
      resolved to make into cities of an island and no longer of the mainland;
      these are, Dion, Olophyxos, Acrothoon, Thyssos, Cleonai.
    </p>
<p>
      23. These are the cities which occupy Athos: and they dug as follows, the
      country being divided among the Barbarians by nations for the work:—at
      the city of Sane they drew a straight line across the isthmus, and when
      the channel became deep, those who stood lowest dug, while others
      delivered the earth as it was dug out to other men who stood above, as
      upon steps, and they again to others when it was received, until they came
      to those that were highest; and these bore it away and cast it forth. Now
      the others except the Phenicians had double toil by the breaking down of
      the steep edges of their excavation; for since they endeavoured to make
      the opening at the top and that at the bottom both of the same measure,
      some such thing was likely to result, as they worked: but the Phenicians,
      who are apt to show ability in their works generally, did so in this work
      also; for when they had had assigned to them by lot so much as fell to
      their share, they proceeded to dig, making the opening of the excavation
      at the top twice as wide as the channel itself was to be; and as the work
      went forward, they kept contracting the width; so that, when they came to
      the bottom, their work was made of equal width with that of the others.
      Now there is a meadow there, in which there was made for them a market and
      a place for buying and selling; and great quantities of corn came for them
      regularly from Asia, ready ground.
    </p>
<p>
      24. It seems to me, making conjecture of this work, that Xerxes when he
      ordered this to be dug was moved by a love of magnificence and by a desire
      to make a display of his power and to leave a memorial behind him; for
      though they might have drawn the ships across the isthmus with no great
      labour, he bade them dig a channel for the sea of such breadth that two
      triremes might sail through, propelled side by side. To these same men to
      whom the digging had been appointed, it was appointed also to make a
      bridge over the river Strymon, yoking together the banks.
    </p>
<p>
      25. These things were being done by Xerxes thus; and meanwhile he caused
      ropes also to be prepared for the bridges, made of papyrus and of white
      flax, <a href="#link7note-26" id="link7noteref-26" class="pginternal">26</a>
      appointing this to the Phenicians and Egyptians; and also he was making
      preparations to store provisions for his army on the way, that neither the
      army itself nor the baggage animals might suffer from scarcity, as they
      made their march against Hellas. Accordingly, when he had learnt by
      inquiry of the various places, he bade them make stores where it was most
      convenient, carrying supplies to different parts by merchant ships and
      ferry-boats from all the countries of Asia. So they conveyed the greater
      part of the corn <a href="#link7note-27" id="link7noteref-27" class="pginternal">27</a> to the place which is called Leuke Acte in
      Thrace, while others conveyed stores to Tyrodiza of the Perinthians,
      others to Doriscos, others to Eïon on the Strymon, and others to
      Macedonia, the work being distributed between them.
    </p>
<p>
      26. During the time that these were working at the task which had been
      proposed to them, the whole land-army had been assembled together and was
      marching with Xerxes to Sardis, setting forth from Critalla in Cappadokia;
      for there it had been ordered that the whole army should assemble, which
      was to go with Xerxes himself by the land: but which of the governors of
      provinces brought the best equipped force and received from the king the
      gifts proposed, I am not able to say, for I do not know that they even
      came to a competition in this matter. Then after they had crossed the
      river Halys and had entered Phrygia, marching through this land they came
      to Kelainai, where the springs of the river Maiander come up, and also
      those of another river not less than the Maiander, whose name is
      Catarractes; <a href="#link7note-28" id="link7noteref-28" class="pginternal">28</a> this rises in the market-place itself of
      Kelainai and runs into the Maiander: and here also is hanging up in the
      city the skin of Marsyas the Silenos, which is said by the Phrygians to
      have been flayed off and hung up by Apollo.
    </p>
<p>
      27. In this city Pythios the son of Atys, a Lydian, was waiting for the
      king and entertained his whole army, as well as Xerxes himself, with the
      most magnificent hospitality: moreover he professed himself ready to
      supply money for the war. So when Pythios offered money, Xerxes asked
      those of the Persians who were present, who Pythios was and how much money
      he possessed, that he made this offer. They said: "O king, this is he who
      presented thy father Dareios with the golden plane-tree and the golden
      vine; and even now he is in wealth the first of all men of whom we know,
      excepting thee only."
    </p>
<p>
      28. Marvelling at the conclusion of these words Xerxes himself asked of
      Pythios then, how much money he had; and he said: "O king, I will not
      conceal the truth from thee, nor will I allege as an excuse that I do not
      know my own substance, but I will enumerate it to thee exactly, since I
      know the truth: for as soon as I heard that thou wert coming down to the
      Sea of Hellas, desiring to give thee money for the war I ascertained the
      truth, and calculating I found that I had of silver two thousand talents,
      and of gold four hundred myriads <a href="#link7note-29" id="link7noteref-29" class="pginternal">29</a> of daric staters <a href="#link7note-30" id="link7noteref-30" class="pginternal">30</a>
      all but seven thousand: and with this money I present thee. For myself I
      have sufficient livelihood from my slaves and from my estates of land."
    </p>
<p>
      29. Thus he said; and Xerxes was pleased by the things which he had
      spoken, and replied: "Lydian host, ever since I went forth from the
      Persian land I have encountered no man up to this time who was desirous to
      entertain my army, or who came into my presence and made offer of his own
      free will to contribute money to me for the war, except only thee: and
      thou not only didst entertain my army magnificently, but also now dost
      make offer of great sums of money. To thee therefore in return I give
      these rewards,—I make thee my guest-friend, and I will complete for
      thee the four hundred myriads of staters by giving from myself the seven
      thousand, in order that thy four hundred myriads may not fall short by
      seven thousand, but thou mayest have a full sum in thy reckoning,
      completed thus by me. Keep possession of that which thou hast got for
      thyself, and be sure to act always thus; for if thou doest so, thou wilt
      have no cause to repent either at the time or afterwards."
    </p>
<p>
      30. Having thus said and having accomplished his promise, he continued his
      march onwards; and passing by a city of the Phrygians called Anaua and a
      lake whence salt is obtained, he came to Colossai, a great city of
      Phrygia, where the river Lycos falls into an opening of the earth and
      disappears from view, and then after an interval of about five furlongs it
      comes up to view again, and this river also flows into the Maiander.
      Setting forth from Colossai towards the boundaries of the Phrygians and
      Lydians, the army arrived at the city of Kydrara, where a pillar <a href="#link7note-3001" id="link7noteref-3001" class="pginternal">3001</a>
      is fixed, set up by Croesus, which declares by an inscription that the
      boundaries are there.
    </p>
<p>
      31. From Phrygia then he entered Lydia; and here the road parts into two,
      and that which goes to the left leads towards Caria, while that which goes
      to the right leads to Sardis; and travelling by this latter road one must
      needs cross the river Maiander and pass by the city of Callatebos, where
      men live whose trade it is to make honey of the tamarisk-tree and of
      wheat-flour. By this road went Xerxes and found a plane-tree, to which for
      its beauty he gave an adornment of gold, and appointed that some one
      should have charge of it always in undying succession; <a href="#link7note-31" id="link7noteref-31" class="pginternal">31</a>
      and on the next day he came to the city of the Lydians.
    </p>
<p>
      32. Having come to Sardis he proceeded first to send heralds to Hellas, to
      ask for earth and water, and also to give notice beforehand to prepare
      meals for the king; except that he sent neither to Athens nor Lacedemon to
      ask for earth, but to all the other States: and the reason why he sent the
      second time to ask for earth and water was this,—as many as had not
      given at the former time to Dareios when he sent, these he thought would
      certainly give now by reason of their fear: this matter it was about which
      he desired to have certain knowledge, and he sent accordingly.
    </p>
<p>
      33. After this he made his preparations intending to march to Abydos: and
      meanwhile they were bridging over the Hellespont from Asia to Europe. Now
      there is in the Chersonese of the Hellespont between the city of Sestos
      and Madytos, a broad foreland <a href="#link7note-32" id="link7noteref-32" class="pginternal">32</a> running down into the
      sea right opposite Abydos; this is the place where no long time afterwards
      the Athenians under the command of Xanthippos the son of Ariphron, having
      taken Artaÿctes a Persian, who was the governor of Sestos, nailed him
      alive to a board with hands and feet extended (he was the man who was wont
      to take women with him to the temple of Protesilaos at Elaius and to do
      things there which are not lawful).
    </p>
<p>
      34. To this foreland they on whom this work was laid were making their
      bridges, starting from Abydos, the Phenicians constructing the one with
      ropes of white flax, and the Egyptians the other, which was made with
      papyrus rope. Now from Abydos to the opposite shore is a distance of seven
      furlongs. But when the strait had been bridged over, a great storm came on
      and dashed together all the work that had been made and broke it up. Then
      when Xerxes heard it he was exceedingly enraged, and bade them scourge the
      Hellespont with three hundred strokes of the lash and let down into the
      sea a pair of fetters. Nay, I have heard further that he sent branders
      also with them to brand the Hellespont. However this may be, he enjoined
      them, as they were beating, to say Barbarian and presumptuous words as
      follows: "Thou bitter water, thy master lays upon thee this penalty,
      because thou didst wrong him not having suffered any wrong from him: and
      Xerxes the king will pass over thee whether thou be willing or no; but
      with right, as it seems, no man doeth sacrifice to thee, seeing that thou
      art a treacherous <a href="#link7note-33" id="link7noteref-33" class="pginternal">33</a> and briny stream." The sea he enjoined them to
      chastise thus, and also he bade them cut off the heads of those who were
      appointed to have charge over the bridging of the Hellespont.
    </p>
<p>
      36. Thus then the men did, to whom this ungracious office belonged; and
      meanwhile other chief-constructors proceeded to make the bridges; and thus
      they made them:—They put together fifty-oared galleys and triremes,
      three hundred and sixty to be under the bridge towards the Euxine Sea, and
      three hundred and fourteen to be under the other, the vessels lying in the
      direction of the stream of the Hellespont (though crosswise in respect to
      the Pontus), to support the tension of the ropes. <a href="#link7note-34" id="link7noteref-34" class="pginternal">34</a> They placed them
      together thus, and let down very large anchors, those on the one side <a href="#link7note-35" id="link7noteref-35" class="pginternal">35</a>
      towards the Pontus because of the winds which blow from within outwards,
      and on the other side, towards the West and the Egean, because of the
      South-East <a href="#link7note-36" id="link7noteref-36" class="pginternal">36</a> and South Winds. They left also an opening for
      a passage through, so that any who wished might be able to sail into the
      Pontus with small vessels, <a href="#link7note-37" id="link7noteref-37" class="pginternal">37</a> and also from the Pontus outwards. Having thus
      done, they proceeded to stretch tight the ropes, straining them with
      wooden windlasses, not now appointing the two kinds of rope to be used
      apart from one another, but assigning to each bridge two ropes of white
      flax and four of the papyrus ropes. The thickness and beauty of make was
      the same for both, but the flaxen ropes were heavier in proportion, <a href="#link7note-38" id="link7noteref-38" class="pginternal">38</a>
      and of this rope a cubit weighed one talent. When the passage was bridged
      over, they sawed up logs of wood, and making them equal in length to the
      breadth of the bridge they laid them above the stretched ropes, and having
      set them thus in order they again fastened them above. <a href="#link7note-39" id="link7noteref-39" class="pginternal">39</a>
      When this was done, they carried on brushwood, and having set the
      brushwood also in place, they carried on to it earth; and when they had
      stamped down the earth firmly, they built a barrier along on each side, so
      that the baggage-animals and horses might not be frightened by looking out
      over the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      37. When the construction of the bridges had been finished, and the works
      about Athos, both the embankments about the mouths of the channel, which
      were made because of the breaking of the sea upon the beach, that the
      mouths of it might not be filled up, and the channel itself, were reported
      to be fully completed, then, after they had passed the winter at Sardis,
      the army set forth from thence fully equipped, at the beginning of spring,
      to march to Abydos; and when it had just set forth, the Sun left his place
      in the heaven and was invisible, though there was no gathering of clouds
      and the sky was perfectly clear; and instead of day it became night. When
      Xerxes saw and perceived this, it became a matter of concern to him; and
      he asked the Magians what the appearance meant to portend. These declared
      that the god was foreshowing to the Hellenes a leaving <a href="#link7note-40" id="link7noteref-40" class="pginternal">40</a> of
      their cities, saying that the Sun was the foreshower of events for the
      Hellenes, but the Moon for the Persians. Having been thus informed, Xerxes
      proceeded on the march with very great joy.
    </p>
<p>
      38. Then as he was leading forth his army on its march, Pythios the
      Lydian, being alarmed by the appearance in the heavens and elated by the
      gifts which he had received, came to Xerxes, and said as follows: "Master,
      I would desire to receive from thee a certain thing at my request, which,
      as it chances, is for thee an easy thing to grant, but a great thing for
      me, if I obtain it." Then Xerxes, thinking that his request would be for
      anything rather than that which he actually asked, said that he would
      grant it, and bade him speak and say what he desired. He then, when he
      heard this, was encouraged, and spoke these words: "Master, I have, as it
      chances, five sons, and it is their fortune to be all going together with
      thee on the march against Hellas. Do thou, therefore, O king, have
      compassion upon me, who have come to so great an age, and release from
      serving in the expedition one of my sons, the eldest, in order that he may
      be caretaker both of myself and of my wealth: but the other four take with
      thyself, and after thou hast accomplished that which thou hast in thy
      mind, mayest thou have a safe return home."
    </p>
<p>
      38. Then Xerxes was exceedingly angry and made answer with these words:
      "Thou wretched man, dost thou dare, when I am going on a march myself
      against Hellas, and am taking my sons and my brothers and my relations and
      friends, dost thou dare to make any mention of a son of thine, seeing that
      thou art my slave, who ought to have been accompanying me thyself with thy
      whole household and thy wife as well? Now therefore be assured of this,
      that the passionate spirit of man dwells within the ears; and when it has
      heard good things, it fills the body with delight, but when it has heard
      the opposite things to this, it swells up with anger. As then thou canst
      not boast of having surpassed the king in conferring benefits formerly,
      when thou didst to us good deeds and madest offer to do more of the same
      kind, so now that thou hast turned to shamelessness, thou shalt receive
      not thy desert but less than thou deservest: for thy gifts of hospitality
      shall rescue from death thyself and the four others of thy sons, but thou
      shalt pay the penalty with the life of the one to whom thou dost cling
      most." Having answered thus, he forthwith commanded those to whom it was
      appointed to do these things, to find out the eldest of the sons of
      Pythios and to cut him in two in the middle; and having cut him in two, to
      dispose the halves, one on the right hand of the road and the other on the
      left, and that the army should pass between them by this way.
    </p>
<p>
      40. When these had so done, the army proceeded to pass between; and first
      the baggage-bearers led the way together with their horses, and after
      these the host composed of all kinds of nations mingled together without
      distinction: and when more than the half had gone by, an interval was left
      and these were separated from the king. For before him went first a
      thousand horsemen, chosen out of all the Persians; and after them a
      thousand spearmen chosen also from all the Persians, having the points of
      their spears turned down to the ground; and then ten sacred horses, called
      "Nesaian," <a href="#link7note-41" id="link7noteref-41" class="pginternal">41</a> with the fairest possible trappings. Now the
      horses are called Nesaian for this reason:—there is a wide plain in
      the land of Media which is called the Nesaian plain, and this plain
      produces the great horses of which I speak. Behind these ten horses the
      sacred chariot of Zeus was appointed to go, which was drawn by eight white
      horses; and behind the horses again followed on foot a charioteer holding
      the reins, for no human creature mounts upon the seat of that chariot.
      Then behind this came Xerxes himself in a chariot drawn by Nesaian horses,
      and by the side of him rode a charioteer, whose name was Patiramphes, son
      of Otanes a Persian.
    </p>
<p>
      41. Thus did Xerxes march forth out of Sardis; and he used to change,
      whenever he was so disposed, from the chariot to a carriage. And behind
      him went spearmen, the best and most noble of the Persians, a thousand in
      number, holding their spear-points in the customary way; <a href="#link7note-42" id="link7noteref-42" class="pginternal">42</a>
      and after them another thousand horsemen chosen out from the Persians; and
      after the horsemen ten thousand men chosen out from the remainder of the
      Persians. This body went on foot; and of these a thousand had upon their
      spears pomegranates of gold instead of the spikes at the butt-end, and
      these enclosed the others round, while the remaining nine thousand were
      within these and had silver pomegranates. And those also had golden
      pomegranates who had their spear-points turned towards the earth, while
      those who followed next after Xerxes had golden apples. Then to follow the
      ten thousand there was appointed a body of ten thousand Persian cavalry;
      and after the cavalry there was an interval of as much as two furlongs.
      Then the rest of the host came marching without distinction.
    </p>
<p>
      42. So the army proceeded on its march from Lydia to the river Caïcos and
      the land of Mysia; and then setting forth from the Caïcos and keeping the
      mountain of Cane on the left hand, it marched through the region of
      Atarneus to the city of Carene. From this it went through the plain of
      Thebe, passing by the cities of Adramytteion and Antandros of the
      Pelasgians; and taking mount Ida on the left hand, it came on to the land
      of Ilion. And first, when it had stopped for the night close under mount
      Ida, thunder and bolts of lightning fell upon it, and destroyed here in
      this place a very large number of men. <a href="#link7note-43" id="link7noteref-43" class="pginternal">43</a>
</p>
<p>
      43. Then when the army had come to the river Scamander,—which of all
      rivers to which they had come, since they set forth from Sardis and
      undertook their march, was the first of which the stream failed and was
      not sufficient for the drinking of the army and of the animals with it,—when,
      I say, Xerxes had come to this river, he went up to the Citadel of Priam,
      <a href="#link7note-44" id="link7noteref-44" class="pginternal">44</a>
      having a desire to see it; and having seen it and learnt by inquiry of all
      those matters severally, he sacrificed a thousand heifers to Athene of
      Ilion, and the Magians poured libations in honour of the heroes: and after
      they had done this, a fear fell upon the army in the night. Then at break
      of day he set forth from thence, keeping on his left hand the cities of
      Rhoition and Ophryneion and Dardanos, which last borders upon Abydos, and
      having on the right hand the Gergith Teucrians.
    </p>
<p>
      44. When Xerxes had come into the midst of Abydos, <a href="#link7note-45" id="link7noteref-45" class="pginternal">45</a> he had a desire to see
      all the army; and there had been made purposely for him beforehand upon a
      hill in this place a raised seat of white stone, <a href="#link7note-46" id="link7noteref-46" class="pginternal">46</a> which the people of
      Abydos had built at the command of the king given beforehand. There he
      took his seat, and looking down upon the shore he gazed both upon the
      land-army and the ships; and gazing upon them he had a longing to see a
      contest take place between the ships; and when it had taken place and the
      Phenicians of Sidon were victorious, he was delighted both with the
      contest and with the whole armament.
    </p>
<p>
      45. And seeing all the Hellespont covered over with the ships, and all the
      shores and the plains of Abydos full of men, then Xerxes pronounced
      himself a happy man, and after that he fell to weeping.
    </p>
<p>
      46. Artabanos his uncle therefore perceiving him,—the same who at
      first boldly declared his opinion advising Xerxes not to march against
      Hellas,—this man, I say, having observed that Xerxes wept, asked as
      follows: "O king, how far different from one another are the things which
      thou hast done now and a short while before now! for having pronounced
      thyself a happy man, thou art now shedding tears." He said: "Yea, for
      after I had reckoned up, it came into my mind to feel pity at the thought
      how brief was the whole life of man, seeing that of these multitudes not
      one will be alive when a hundred years have gone by." He then made answer
      and said: "To another evil more pitiful than this we are made subject in
      the course of our life; for in the period of life, short as it is, no man,
      either of these here or of others, is made by nature so happy, that there
      will not come to him many times, and not once only, the desire to be dead
      rather than to live; for misfortunes falling upon us and diseases
      disturbing our happiness make the time of life, though short indeed, seem
      long: thus, since life is full of trouble, death has become the most
      acceptable refuge for man; and God, having given him to taste of the
      sweetness of life, is discovered in this matter to be full of jealousy."
    </p>
<p>
      47. Xerxes made answer saying: "Artabanos, of human life, which is such as
      thou dost define it to be, let us cease to speak, and do not remember
      evils when we have good things in hand: but do thou declare to me this:—If
      the vision of the dream had not appeared with so much evidence, wouldest
      thou still be holding thy former opinion, endeavouring to prevent me from
      marching against Hellas, or wouldest thou have changed from it? Come, tell
      me this exactly." He answered saying: "O king, may the vision of the dream
      which appeared have such fulfilment as we both desire! but I am even to
      this moment full of apprehension and cannot contain myself, taking into
      account many things besides, and also seeing that two things, which are
      the greatest things of all, are utterly hostile to thee."
    </p>
<p>
      48. To this Xerxes made answer in these words: "Thou strangest of men, <a href="#link7note-47" id="link7noteref-47" class="pginternal">47</a> of
      what nature are these two things which thou sayest are utterly hostile to
      me? Is it that the land-army is to be found fault with in the matter of
      numbers, and that the army of the Hellenes appears to thee likely to be
      many times as large as ours? or dost thou think that our fleet will fall
      short of theirs? or even that both of these things together will prove
      true? For if thou thinkest that in these respects our power is deficient,
      one might make gathering at once of another force."
    </p>
<p>
      49. Then he made answer and said: "O king, neither with this army would
      any one who has understanding find fault, nor with the number of the
      ships; and indeed if thou shalt assemble more, the two things of which I
      speak will be made thereby yet more hostile: and these two things are—the
      land and the sea. For neither in the sea is there, as I suppose, a harbour
      anywhere large enough to receive this fleet of thine, if a storm should
      arise, and to ensure the safety of the ships till it be over; and yet not
      one alone <a href="#link7note-48" id="link7noteref-48" class="pginternal">48</a> ought this harbour to be, but there should be
      such harbours along the whole coast of the continent by which thou
      sailest; and if there are not harbours to receive thy ships, know that
      accidents will rule men and not men the accidents. Now having told thee of
      one of the two things, I am about to tell thee of the other. The land, I
      say, becomes hostile to thee in this way:—if nothing shall come to
      oppose thee, the land is hostile to thee by so much the more in proportion
      as thou shalt advance more, ever stealing on further and further, <a href="#link7note-49" id="link7noteref-49" class="pginternal">49</a>
      for there is no satiety of good fortune felt by men: and this I say, that
      with no one to stand against thee the country traversed, growing more and
      more as time goes on, will produce for thee famine. Man, however, will be
      in the best condition, if when he is taking counsel he feels fear,
      reckoning to suffer everything that can possibly come, but in doing the
      deed he is bold."
    </p>
<p>
      50. Xerxes made answer in these words: "Artabanos, reasonably dost thou
      set forth these matters; but do not thou fear everything nor reckon
      equally for everything: for if thou shouldest set thyself with regard to
      all matters which come on at any time, to reckon for everything equally,
      thou wouldest never perform any deed. It is better to have good courage
      about everything and to suffer half the evils which threaten, than to have
      fear beforehand about everything and not to suffer any evil at all: and
      if, while contending against everything which is said, thou omit to
      declare the course which is safe, thou dost incur in these matters the
      reproach of failure equally with him who says the opposite to this. This
      then, I say, is evenly balanced: but how should one who is but man know
      the course which is safe? I think, in no way. To those then who choose to
      act, for the most part gain is wont to come; but to those who reckon for
      everything and shrink back, it is not much wont to come. Thou seest the
      power of the Persians, to what great might it has advanced: if then those
      who came to be kings before me had had opinions like to thine, or, though
      not having such opinions, had had such counsellors as thou, thou wouldest
      never have seen it brought forward to this point. As it is however, by
      running risks they conducted it on to this: for great power is in general
      gained by running great risks. We therefore, following their example, are
      making our march now during the fairest season of the year; and after we
      have subdued all Europe we shall return back home, neither having met with
      famine anywhere nor having suffered any other thing which is unpleasant.
      For first we march bearing with us ourselves great store of food, and
      secondly we shall possess the corn-crops of all the peoples to whose land
      and nation we come; and we are making a march now against men who plough
      the soil, and not against nomad tribes."
    </p>
<p>
      51. After this Artabanos said: "O king, since thou dost urge us not to
      have fear of anything, do thou I pray thee accept a counsel from me; for
      when speaking of many things it is necessary to extend speech to a greater
      length. Cyrus the son of Cambyses subdued all Ionia except the Athenians,
      so that it was tributary to the Persians. These men therefore I counsel
      thee by no means to lead against their parent stock, seeing that even
      without these we are able to get the advantage over our enemies. For
      supposing that they go with us, either they must prove themselves doers of
      great wrong, if they join in reducing their mother city to slavery, or
      doers of great right, if they join in freeing her: now if they show
      themselves doers of great wrong, they bring us no very large gain in
      addition; but if they show themselves doers of great right, they are able
      then to cause much damage to thy army. Therefore lay to heart also the
      ancient saying, how well it has been said that at the first beginning of
      things the end does not completely appear."
    </p>
<p>
      52. To this Xerxes made answer: "Artabanos, of all the opinions which thou
      hast uttered, thou art mistaken most of all in this; seeing that thou
      fearest lest the Ionians should change side, about whom we have a most
      sure proof, of which thou art a witness thyself and also the rest are
      witnesses who went with Dareios on his march against the Scythians,—namely
      this, that the whole Persian army then came to be dependent upon these
      men, whether they would destroy or whether they would save it, and they
      displayed righteous dealing and trustworthiness, and nought at all that
      was unfriendly. Besides this, seeing that they have left children and
      wives and wealth in our land, we must not even imagine that they will make
      any rebellion. <a href="#link7note-50" id="link7noteref-50" class="pginternal">50</a> Fear not then this thing either, but have a
      good heart and keep safe my house and my government; for to thee of all
      men I entrust my sceptre of rule."
    </p>
<p>
      53. Having thus spoken and having sent Artabanos back to Susa, next Xerxes
      summoned to his presence the men of most repute among the Persians, and
      when they were come before him, he spoke to them as follows: "Persians, I
      assembled you together desiring this of you, that ye should show
      yourselves good men and should not disgrace the deeds done in former times
      by the Persians, which are great and glorious; but let us each one of us
      by himself, and all together also, be zealous in our enterprise; for this
      which we labour for is a common good for all. And I exhort you that ye
      preserve in the war without relaxing your efforts, because, as I am
      informed, we are marching against good men, and if we shall overcome them,
      there will not be any other army of men which will ever stand against us.
      Now therefore let us begin the crossing, after having made prayer to those
      gods who have the Persians <a href="#link7note-51" id="link7noteref-51" class="pginternal">51</a> for their allotted charge."
    </p>
<p>
      54. During this day then they were making preparation to cross over; and
      on the next day they waited for the Sun, desiring to see him rise, and in
      the meantime they offered all kinds of incense upon the bridges and
      strewed the way with branches of myrtle. Then, as the Sun was rising,
      Xerxes made libation from a golden cup into the sea, and prayed to the
      Sun, that no accident might befall him such as should cause him to cease
      from subduing Europe, until he had come to its furthest limits. After
      having thus prayed he threw the cup into the Hellespont and with it a
      golden mixing-bowl and a Persian sword, which they call <i>akinakes</i>:
      but whether he cast them into the sea as an offering dedicated to the Sun,
      or whether he had repented of his scourging of the Hellespont and desired
      to present a gift to the sea as amends for this, I cannot for certain say.
    </p>
<p>
      55. When Xerxes had done this, they proceeded to cross over, the whole
      army both the footmen and the horsemen going by one bridge, namely that
      which was on the side of the Pontus, while the baggage-animals and the
      attendants went over the other, which was towards the Egean. First the ten
      thousand Persians led the way, all with wreaths, and after them came the
      mixed body of the army made up of all kinds of nations: these on that day;
      and on the next day, first the horsemen and those who had their
      spear-points turned downwards, these also wearing wreaths; and after them
      the sacred horses and the sacred chariot, and then Xerxes himself and the
      spear-bearers and the thousand horsemen; and after them the rest of the
      army. In the meantime the ships also put out from shore and went over to
      the opposite side. I have heard however another account which says that
      the king crossed over the very last of all.
    </p>
<p>
      56. When Xerxes had crossed over into Europe, he gazed upon the army
      crossing under the lash; and his army crossed over in seven days and seven
      nights, going on continuously without any pause. Then, it is said, after
      Xerxes had now crossed over the Hellespont, a man of that coast exclaimed:
      "Why, O Zeus, in the likeness of a Persian man and taking for thyself the
      name of Xerxes instead of Zeus, art thou proposing to lay waste Hellas,
      taking with thee all the nations of men? for it was possible for thee to
      do so even without the help of these."
    </p>
<p>
      57. When all had crossed over, after they had set forth on their way a
      great portent appeared to them, of which Xerxes made no account, although
      it was easy to conjecture its meaning,—a mare gave birth to a hare.
      Now the meaning of this was easy to conjecture in this way, namely that
      Xerxes was about to march an army against Hellas very proudly and
      magnificently, but would come back again to the place whence he came,
      running for his life. There happened also a portent of another kind while
      he was still at Sardis,—a mule brought forth young and gave birth to
      a mule which had organs of generation of two kinds, both those of the male
      and those of the female, and those of the male were above. Xerxes however
      made no account of either of these portents, but proceeded on his way, and
      with him the land-army.
    </p>
<p>
      58. The fleet meanwhile was sailing out of the Hellespont and coasting
      along, going in the opposite direction to the land-army; for the fleet was
      sailing towards the West, making for the promontory of Sarpedon, to which
      it had been ordered beforehand to go, and there wait for the army; but the
      land-army meanwhile was making its march towards the East and the
      sunrising, through the Chersonese, keeping on its right the tomb of Helle
      the daughter of Athamas, and on its left the city of Cardia, and marching
      through the midst of a town the name of which is Agora. <a href="#link7note-52" id="link7noteref-52" class="pginternal">52</a>
      Thence bending round the gulf called Melas and having crossed over the
      river Melas, the stream of which did not suffice at this time for the army
      but failed,—having crossed, I say, this river, from which the gulf
      also has its name, it went on Westwards, passing by Ainos a city of the
      Aiolians, and by the lake Stentoris, until at last it came to Doriscos.
    </p>
<p>
      59. Now Doriscos is a sea-beach and plain of great extent in Thrace, and
      through it flows the great river Hebros: here a royal fortress had been
      built, the same which is now called Doriscos, and a garrison of Persians
      had been established in it by Dareios, ever since the time when he went on
      his march against the Scythians. It seemed then to Xerxes that the place
      was convenient to order his army and to number it throughout, and so he
      proceeded to do. The commanders of the ships at the bidding of Xerxes had
      brought all their ships, when they arrived at Doriscos, up to the
      sea-beach which adjoins Doriscos, on which there is situated both Sale a
      city of the Samothrakians, and also Zone, and of which the extreme point
      is the promontory of Serreion, which is well known; and the region
      belonged in ancient time to the Kikonians. To this beach then they had
      brought in their ships, and having drawn them up on land they were letting
      them get dry: and during this time he proceeded to number the army at
      Doriscos.
    </p>
<p>
      60. Now of the number which each separate nation supplied I am not able to
      give certain information, for this is not reported by any persons; but of
      the whole land-army taken together the number proved to be one hundred and
      seventy myriads: <a href="#link7note-53" id="link7noteref-53" class="pginternal">53</a> and they numbered them throughout in the
      following manner:—they gathered together in one place a body of ten
      thousand men, and packing them together <a href="#link7note-54" id="link7noteref-54" class="pginternal">54</a> as closely as they
      could, they drew a circle round outside: and thus having drawn a circle
      round and having let the ten thousand men go from it, they built a wall of
      rough stones round the circumference of the circle, rising to the height
      of a man's navel. Having made this, they caused others to go into the
      space which had been built round, until they had in this manner numbered
      them all throughout: and after they had numbered them, they ordered them
      separately by nations.
    </p>
<p>
      61. Now those who served were as follows:—The Persians with this
      equipment:—about their heads they had soft <a href="#link7note-55" id="link7noteref-55" class="pginternal">55</a> felt caps called <i>tiaras</i>,
      and about their body tunics of various colours with sleeves, presenting
      the appearance of iron scales like those of a fish, <a href="#link7note-56" id="link7noteref-56" class="pginternal">56</a> and about the legs
      trousers; and instead of the ordinary shields they had shields of
      wicker-work, <a href="#link7note-57" id="link7noteref-57" class="pginternal">57</a> under which hung quivers; and they had short
      spears and large bows and arrows of reed, and moreover daggers hanging by
      the right thigh from the girdle: and they acknowledged as their commander
      Otanes the father of Amestris the wife of Xerxes. Now these were called by
      the Hellenes in ancient time Kephenes; by themselves however and by their
      neighbours they were called Artaians: but when Perseus, the son of Danae
      and Zeus, came to Kepheus the son of Belos <a href="#link7note-58" id="link7noteref-58" class="pginternal">58</a> and took to wife his
      daughter Andromeda, there was born to them a son to whom he gave the name
      Perses, and this son he left behind there, for it chanced that Kepheus had
      no male offspring: after him therefore this race was named.
    </p>
<p>
      62. The Medes served in the expedition equipped in precisely the same
      manner; for this equipment is in fact Median and not Persian: and the
      Medes acknowledged as their commander Tigranes an Achaimenid. These in
      ancient time used to be generally called Arians; but when Medea the
      Colchian came from Athens to these Arians, they also changed their name.
      Thus the Medes themselves report about themselves. The Kissians served
      with equipment in other respects like that of the Persians, but instead of
      the felt caps they wore fillets: <a href="#link7note-59" id="link7noteref-59" class="pginternal">59</a>and of the Kissians
      Anaphes the son of Otanes was commander. The Hyrcanians were armed like
      the Persians, acknowledging as their leader Megapanos, the same who after
      these events became governor of Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      63. The Assyrians served with helmets about their heads made of bronze or
      plaited in a Barbarian style which it is not easy to describe; and they
      had shields and spears, and daggers like the Egyptian knives, <a href="#link7note-60" id="link7noteref-60" class="pginternal">60</a>
      and moreover they had wooden clubs with knobs of iron, and corslets of
      linen. These are by the Hellenes called Syrians, but by the Barbarians
      they have been called always <a href="#link7note-61" id="link7noteref-61" class="pginternal">61</a> Assyrians: [among these were the Chaldeans]:
      <a href="#link7note-62" id="link7noteref-62" class="pginternal">62</a>
      and the commander of them was Otaspes the son of Artachaies.
    </p>
<p>
      64. The Bactrians served wearing about their heads nearly the same
      covering as the Medes, and having native bows of reed and short spears.
      The Scaran Scythians had about their heads caps <a href="#link7note-63" id="link7noteref-63" class="pginternal">63</a> which were carried up
      to a point and set upright and stiff; and they wore trousers, and carried
      native bows and daggers, and besides this axes of the kind called <i>sagaris</i>.
      These were called Amyrgian Sacans, being in fact Scythians; for the
      Persians call all the Scythians Sacans: and of the Bactrians and Sacans
      the commander was Hystaspes, the son of Dareios and of Atossa the daughter
      of Cyrus.
    </p>
<p>
      65. The Indians wore garments made of tree-wool, and they had bows of reed
      and arrows of reed with iron points. Thus were the Indians equipped; and
      serving with the rest they had been assigned to Pharnazathres the son of
      Artabates.
    </p>
<p>
      66. The Arians <a href="#link7note-64" id="link7noteref-64" class="pginternal">64</a> were equipped with Median bows, and in other
      respects like the Bactrians: and of the Arians Sisamnes the son of
      Hydarnes was in command. The Parthians and Chorasmians and Sogdians and
      Gandarians and Dadicans served with the same equipment as the Bactrians.
      Of these the commanders were, Artabazos the son of Pharnakes of the
      Parthians and Chorasmians, Azanes the son of Artaios of the Sogdians, and
      Artyphios the son of Artabanos of the Gandarians and Dadicans. The
      Caspians served wearing coats of skin <a href="#link7note-65" id="link7noteref-65" class="pginternal">65</a> and having native bows
      of reed and short swords: <a href="#link7note-66" id="link7noteref-66" class="pginternal">66</a> thus were these equipped; and they
      acknowledged as their leader Ariomardos the brother of Artyphios. The
      Sarangians were conspicuous among the rest by wearing dyed garments; and
      they had boots reaching up to the knee, and Median bows and spears: of
      these the commander was Pherendates the son of Megabazos. The Pactyans
      were wearers of skin coats <a href="#link7note-67" id="link7noteref-67" class="pginternal">67</a> and had native bows and daggers: these
      acknowledged as their commander Artaÿntes the son of Ithamitres.
    </p>
<p>
      68. The Utians and Mycans and Paricanians were equipped like the Pactyans:
      of these the commanders were, Arsamenes the son of Dareios of the Utians
      and Mycans, and of the Paricanians Siromitres the son of Oiobazos.
    </p>
<p>
      69. The Arabians wore loose mantles <a href="#link7note-68" id="link7noteref-68" class="pginternal">68</a> girt up, and they
      carried at their right side bows that bent backward <a href="#link7note-69" id="link7noteref-69" class="pginternal">69</a> of great length. The
      Ethiopians had skins of leopards and lions tied upon them, and bows made
      of a slip <a href="#link7note-70" id="link7noteref-70" class="pginternal">70</a> of palm-wood, which were of great length, not
      less than four cubits, and for them small arrows of reed with a sharpened
      stone at the head instead of iron, the same stone with which they engrave
      seals: in addition to this they had spears, and on them was the sharpened
      horn of a gazelle by way of a spear-head, and they had also clubs with
      knobs upon them. Of their body they used to smear over half with white, <a href="#link7note-71" id="link7noteref-71" class="pginternal">71</a>
      when they went into battle, and the other half with red. <a href="#link7note-72" id="link7noteref-72" class="pginternal">72</a> Of
      the Arabians and the Ethiopians who dwelt above Egypt the commander was
      Arsames, the son of Dareios and of Artystone, the daughter of Cyrus, whom
      Dareios loved most of all his wives, and had an image made of her of
      beaten gold.
    </p>
<p>
      70. Of the Ethiopians above Egypt and of the Arabians the commander, I
      say, was Arsames; but the Ethiopians from the direction of the sunrising
      (for the Ethiopians were in two bodies) had been appointed to serve with
      the Indians, being in no way different from the other Ethiopians, but in
      their language and in the nature of their hair only; for the Ethiopians
      from the East are straight-haired, but those of Libya have hair more thick
      and woolly than that of any other men. These Ethiopians from Asia were
      armed for the most part like the Indians, but they had upon their heads
      the skin of a horse's forehead flayed off with the ears and the mane, and
      the mane served instead of a crest, while they had the ears of the horse
      set up straight and stiff: and instead of shields they used to make
      defences to hold before themselves of the skins of cranes.
    </p>
<p>
      71. The Libyans went with equipments of leather, and they used javelins
      burnt at the point. These acknowledged as their commander Massages the son
      of Oarizos.
    </p>
<p>
      72. The Paphlagonians served with plaited helmets upon their heads, small
      shields, and spears of no great size, and also javelins and daggers; and
      about their feet native boots reaching up to the middle of the shin. The
      Ligyans and Matienians and Mariandynoi and Syrians served with the same
      equipment as the Paphlagonians: these Syrians are called by the Persians
      Cappadokians. Of the Paphlagonians and Matienians the commander was Dotos
      the son of Megasidros, and of the Mariandynoi and Lygians and Syrians,
      Gobryas, who was the son of Dareios and Artystone.
    </p>
<p>
      73. The Phrygians had an equipment very like that of the Paphlagonians
      with some slight difference. Now the Phrygians, as the Macedonians say,
      used to be called Brigians during the time that they were natives of
      Europe and dwelt with the Macedonians; but after they had changed into
      Asia, with their country they changed also their name and were called
      Phrygians. The Armenians were armed just like the Phrygians, being
      settlers from the Phrygians. Of these two together the commander was
      Artochmes, who was married to a daughter of Dareios.
    </p>
<p>
      74. The Lydians had arms very closely resembling those of the Hellenes.
      Now the Lydians were in old time called Medonians, and they were named
      again after Lydos the son of Atys, changing their former name. The Mysians
      had upon their heads native helmets, and they bore small shields and used
      javelins burnt at the point. These are settlers from the Lydians, and from
      mount Olympos they are called Olympienoi. Of the Lydians and Mysians the
      commander was Artaphrenes the son of Artaphrenes, he who invaded Marathon
      together with Datis.
    </p>
<p>
      75. The Thracians served having fox-skins upon their heads and tunics
      about their body, with loose mantles of various colours thrown round over
      them; and about their feet and lower part of the leg they wore boots of
      deer-skin; and besides this they had javelins and round bucklers and small
      daggers. These when they had crossed over into Asia came to be called
      Bithynians, but formerly they were called, as they themselves report,
      Strymonians, since they dwelt upon the river Strymon; and they say that
      they were driven out of their abode by the Teucrians and Mysians. Of the
      Thracians who lived in Asia the commander was Bassakes the son of
      Artabanos.
    </p>
<p>
      76.... <a href="#link7note-73" id="link7noteref-73" class="pginternal">73</a>
      and they had small shields of raw ox-hide, and each man carried two
      hunting-spears of Lykian workmanship. <a href="#link7note-74" id="link7noteref-74" class="pginternal">74</a> On their heads they
      wore helmets of bronze, and to the helmets the ears and horns of an ox
      were attached, in bronze, and upon them also there were crests; and the
      lower part of their legs was wrapped round with red-coloured strips of
      cloth. Among these men there is an Oracle of Ares.
    </p>
<p>
      77. The Meonian Cabelians, who are called Lasonians, had the same
      equipment as the Kilikians, and what this was I shall explain when in the
      course of the catalogue I come to the array of the Kilikians. The Milyans
      had short spears, and their garments were fastened on with buckles; some
      of them had Lykian bows, and about their heads they had caps made of
      leather. Of all these Badres the son of Hystanes was in command.
    </p>
<p>
      78. The Moschoi had wooden caps upon their heads, and shields and small
      spears, on which long points were set. The Tibarenians and Macronians and
      Mossynoicoi served with equipment like that of the Moschoi, and these were
      arrayed together under the following commanders,—the Moschoi and
      Tibarenians under Ariomardos, who was the son of Dareios and of Parmys,
      the daughter of Smerdis son of Cyrus; the Macronians and Mossynoicoi under
      Artaÿctes the son of Cherasmis, who was governor of Sestos on the
      Hellespont.
    </p>
<p>
      79. The Mares wore on their heads native helmets of plaited work, and had
      small shields of hide and javelins; and the Colchians wore wooden helmets
      about their heads, and had small shields of raw ox-hide and short spears,
      and also knives. Of the Mares and Colchians the commander was Pharandates
      the son of Teaspis. The Alarodians and Saspeirians served armed like the
      Colchians; and of these the commander was Masistios the son of Siromitres.
    </p>
<p>
      80. The island tribes which came with the army from the Erythraian Sea,
      belonging to the islands in which the king settles those who are called
      the "Removed," <a href="#link7note-75" id="link7noteref-75" class="pginternal">75</a> had clothing and arms very like those of the
      Medes. Of these islanders the commander was Mardontes the son of Bagaios,
      who in the year after these events was a commander of the army at Mykale
      and lost his life in the battle.
    </p>
<p>
      81. These were the nations which served in the campaign by land and had
      been appointed to be among the foot-soldiers. Of this army those who have
      been mentioned were commanders; and they were the men who sit it in order
      by divisions and numbered it and appointed commanders of thousands and
      commanders of tens of thousands, but the commanders of hundreds and of
      tens were appointed by the commanders of ten thousands; and there were
      others who were leaders of divisions and nations.
    </p>
<p>
      82. These, I say, who have been mentioned were commanders of the army; and
      over these and over the whole army together that went on foot there were
      in command Mardonios the son of Gobryas, Tritantaichmes the son of that
      Artabanos who gave the opinion that they should not make the march against
      Hellas, Smerdomenes the son of Otanes (both these being sons of brothers
      of Dareios and so cousins of Xerxes), <a href="#link7note-76" id="link7noteref-76" class="pginternal">76</a> Masistes the son of
      Dareios and Atossa, Gergis the son of Ariazos, and Megabyzos the son of
      Zopyros.
    </p>
<p>
      83. These were generals of the whole together that went on foot, excepting
      the ten thousand; and of these ten thousand chosen Persians the general
      was Hydarnes the son of Hydarnes; and these Persians were called
      "Immortals," because, if any one of them made the number incomplete, being
      overcome either by death or disease, another man was chosen to his place,
      and they were never either more or fewer than ten thousand. Now of all the
      nations, the Persians showed the greatest splendour of ornament and were
      themselves the best men. They had equipment such as has been mentioned,
      and besides this they were conspicuous among the rest for great quantity
      of gold freely used; and they took with them carriages, and in them
      concubines and a multitude of attendants well furnished; and provisions
      for them apart from the soldiers were borne by camels and beasts of
      burden.
    </p>
<p>
      84. The nations who serve as cavalry are these; not all however supplied
      cavalry, but only as many as here follow:—the Persians equipped in
      the same manner as their foot-soldiers, except that upon their heads some
      of them had beaten-work of metal, either bronze or iron.
    </p>
<p>
      85. There are also certain nomads called Sagartians, Persian in race and
      in language and having a dress which is midway between that of the
      Persians and that of the Pactyans. These furnished eight thousand horse,
      and they are not accustomed to have any arms either of bronze or of iron
      excepting daggers, but they use ropes twisted of thongs, and trust to
      these when they go into war: and the manner of fighting of these men is as
      follows:—when they come to conflict with the enemy, they throw the
      ropes with nooses at the end of them, and whatsoever the man catches by
      the throw, <a href="#link7note-77" id="link7noteref-77" class="pginternal">77</a> whether horse or man, he draws to himself, and
      they being entangled in toils are thus destroyed.
    </p>
<p>
      86. This is the manner of fighting of these men, and they were arrayed
      next to the Persians. The Medes had the same equipment as their men on
      foot, and the Kissians likewise. The Indians were armed in the same manner
      as those of them who served on foot, and they both rode horses <a href="#link7note-78" id="link7noteref-78" class="pginternal">78</a>
      and drove chariots, in which were harnessed horses or wild asses. The
      Bactrians were equipped in the same way as those who served on foot, and
      the Caspians likewise. The Libyans too were equipped like those who served
      on foot, and these also all drove chariots. So too the Caspians <a href="#link7note-79" id="link7noteref-79" class="pginternal">79</a>
      and Paricanians were equipped like those who served on foot, and they all
      rode on camels, which in swiftness were not inferior to horses.
    </p>
<p>
      87. These nations alone served <a href="#link7note-80" id="link7noteref-80" class="pginternal">80</a> as cavalry, and the
      number of the cavalry proved to be eight myriads, <a href="#link7note-81" id="link7noteref-81" class="pginternal">81</a> apart from the camels
      and the chariots. Now the rest of the cavalry was arrayed in squadrons,
      but the Arabians were placed after them and last of all, for the horses
      could not endure the camels, and therefore they were placed last, in order
      that the horses might not be frightened.
    </p>
<p>
      88. The commanders of the cavalry were Harmamithras and Tithaios sons of
      Datis, but the third, Pharnuches, who was in command of the horse with
      them, had been left behind at Sardis sick: for as they were setting forth
      from Sardis, an accident befell him of an unwished-for kind,—as he
      was riding, a dog ran up under his horse's feet, and the horse not having
      seen it beforehand was frightened, and rearing up he threw Pharnuches off
      his back, who falling vomited blood, and his sickness turned to a
      consumption. To the horse however they forthwith at the first did as he
      commanded, that is to say, the servants led him away to the place where he
      had thrown his master and cut off his legs at the knees. Thus was
      Pharnuches removed from his command.
    </p>
<p>
      89. Of the triremes the number proved to be one thousand two hundred and
      seven, and these were they who furnished them:—the Phenicians,
      together with the Syrians <a href="#link7note-82" id="link7noteref-82" class="pginternal">82</a> who dwell in Palestine furnished three
      hundred; and they were equipped thus, that is to say, they had about their
      heads leathern caps made very nearly in the Hellenic fashion, and they
      wore corslets of linen, and had shields without rims and javelins. These
      Phenicians dwelt in ancient time, as they themselves report, upon the
      Erythraian Sea, and thence they passed over and dwell in the country along
      the sea coast of Syria; and this part of Syria and all as far as Egypt is
      called Palestine. The Egyptians furnished two hundred ships: these men had
      about their heads helmets of plaited work, and they had hollow shields
      with the rims large, and spears for sea-fighting, and large axes: <a href="#link7note-83" id="link7noteref-83" class="pginternal">83</a>
      the greater number of them wore corslets, and they had large knives.
    </p>
<p>
      90. These men were thus equipped; and the Cyprians furnished a hundred and
      fifty ships, being themselves equipped as follows,—their kings had
      their heads wound round with fillets, <a href="#link7note-84" id="link7noteref-84" class="pginternal">84</a> and the rest had
      tunics, <a href="#link7note-85" id="link7noteref-85" class="pginternal">85</a>
      but in other respects they were like the Hellenes. Among these there are
      various races as follows,—some of them are from Salamis and Athens,
      others from Arcadia, others from Kythnos, others again from Phenicia and
      others from Ethiopia, as the Cyprians themselves report.
    </p>
<p>
      91. The Kilikians furnished a hundred ships; and these again had about
      their heads native helmets, and for shields they carried targets made of
      raw ox-hide: they wore tunics <a href="#link7note-86" id="link7noteref-86" class="pginternal">86</a> of wool and each man
      had two javelins and a sword, this last being made very like the Egyptian
      knives. These in old time were called Hypachaians, and they got their
      later name from Kilix the son of Agenor, a Phenician. The Pamphylians
      furnished thirty ships and were equipped in Hellenic arms. These
      Pamphylians are of those who were dispersed from Troy together with
      Amphilochos and Calchas.
    </p>
<p>
      92. The Lykians furnished fifty ships; and they were wearers of corslets
      and greaves, and had bows of cornel-wood and arrows of reeds without
      feathers and javelins and a goat-skin hanging over their shoulders, and
      about their heads felt caps wreathed round with feathers; also they had
      daggers and falchions. <a href="#link7note-87" id="link7noteref-87" class="pginternal">87</a> The Lykians were formerly called Termilai,
      being originally of Crete, and they got their later name from Lycos the
      son of Pandion, an Athenian.
    </p>
<p>
      93. The Dorians of Asia furnished thirty ships; and these had Hellenic
      arms and were originally from the Peloponnese. The Carians supplied
      seventy ships; and they were equipped in other respects like Hellenes but
      they had also falchions and daggers. What was the former name of these has
      been told in the first part of the history. <a href="#link7note-88" id="link7noteref-88" class="pginternal">88</a>
</p>
<p>
      94. The Ionians furnished a hundred ships, and were equipped like
      Hellenes. Now the Ionians, so long time as they dwelt in the Peloponnese,
      in the land which is now called Achaia, and before the time when Danaos
      and Xuthos came to the Peloponnese, were called, as the Hellenes report,
      Pelasgians of the Coast-land, <a href="#link7note-89" id="link7noteref-89" class="pginternal">89</a> and then Ionians after
      Ion the son of Xuthos.
    </p>
<p>
      95. The islanders furnished seventeen ships, and were armed like Hellenes,
      this also being a Pelasgian race, though afterwards it came to be called
      Ionian by the same rule as the Ionians of the twelve cities, who came from
      Athens. The Aiolians supplied sixty ships; and these were equipped like
      Hellenes and used to be called Pelasgians in the old time, as the Hellenes
      report. The Hellespontians, excepting those of Abydos (for the men of
      Abydos had been appointed by the king to stay in their place and be guards
      of the bridges), the rest, I say, of those who served in the expedition
      from the Pontus furnished a hundred ships, and were equipped like
      Hellenes: these are colonists of the Ionians and Dorians.
    </p>
<p>
      96. In all the ships there served as fighting-men Persians, Medes, or
      Sacans;: and of the ships, those which sailed best were furnished by the
      Phenicians, and of the Phenicians the best by the men of Sidon. Over all
      these men and also over those of them who were appointed to serve in the
      land-army, there were for each tribe native chieftains, of whom, since I
      am not compelled by the course of the inquiry, I make no mention by the
      way; for in the first place the chieftains of each separate nation were
      not persons worthy of mention, and then moreover within each nation there
      were as many chieftains as there were cities. These went with the
      expedition too not as commanders, but like the others serving as slaves;
      for the generals who had the absolute power and commanded the various
      nations, that is to say those who were Persians, having already been
      mentioned by me.
    </p>
<p>
      97. Of the naval force the following were commanders,—Ariabignes the
      son of Dareios, Prexaspes the son of Aspathines, Megabazos the son of
      Megabates, and Achaimenes the son of Dareios; that is to say, of the
      Ionian and Carian force Ariabignes, who was the son of Dareios and of the
      daughter of Gobryas; of the Egyptians Achaimenes was commander, being
      brother of Xerxes by both parents; and of the rest of the armament the
      other two were in command: and galleys of thirty oars and of fifty oars,
      and light vessels, <a href="#link7note-90" id="link7noteref-90" class="pginternal">90</a> and long <a href="#link7note-91" id="link7noteref-91" class="pginternal">91</a> ships to carry horses
      had been assembled together, as it proved, to the number of three
      thousand.
    </p>
<p>
      98. Of those who sailed in the ships the men of most note after the
      commanders were these,—of Sidon, Tetramnestos son of Anysos; of
      Tyre, Matten <a href="#link7note-92" id="link7noteref-92" class="pginternal">92</a> son of Siromos; or Arados, Merbalos son of
      Agbalos; of Kilikia, Syennesis son of Oromedon; of Lykia, Kyberniscos son
      of Sicas; of Cyprus, Gorgos son of Chersis and Timonax son of Timagoras;
      of Caria, Histiaios son of Tymnes, Pigres son of Hysseldomos, <a href="#link7note-93" id="link7noteref-93" class="pginternal">93</a>
      and Damasithymos son of Candaules.
    </p>
<p>
      99. Of the rest of the officers I make no mention by the way (since I am
      not bound to do so), but only of Artemisia, at whom I marvel most that she
      joined the expedition against Hellas, being a woman; for after her husband
      died, she holding the power herself, although she had a son who was a
      young man, went on the expedition impelled by high spirit and manly
      courage, no necessity being laid upon her. Now her name, as I said, was
      Artemisia and she was the daughter of Lygdamis, and by descent she was of
      Halicarnassos on the side of her father, but of Crete by her mother. She
      was ruler of the men of Halicarnassos and Cos and Nisyros and Calydna,
      furnishing five ships; and she furnished ships which were of all the fleet
      reputed the best after those of the Sidonians, and of all his allies she
      set forth the best counsels to the king. Of the States of which I said
      that she was leader I declare the people to be all of Dorian race, those
      of Halicarnassos being Troizenians, and the rest Epidaurians. So far then
      I have spoken of the naval force.
    </p>
<p>
      100. Then when Xerxes had numbered the army, and it had been arranged in
      divisions, he had a mind to drive through it himself and inspect it: and
      afterwards he proceeded so to do; and driving through in a chariot by each
      nation, he inquired about them and his scribes wrote down the names, until
      he had gone from end to end both of the horse and of the foot. When he had
      done this, the ships were drawn down into the sea, and Xerxes changing
      from his chariot to a ship of Sidon sat down under a golden canopy and
      sailed along by the prows of the ships, asking of all just as he had done
      with the land-army, and having the answers written down. And the captains
      had taken their ships out to a distance of about four hundred feet from
      the beach and were staying them there, all having turned the prows of the
      ships towards the shore in an even line <a href="#link7note-94" id="link7noteref-94" class="pginternal">94</a> and having armed all
      the fighting-men as for war; and he inspected them sailing within, between
      the prows of the ships and the beach.
    </p>
<p>
      101. Now when he had sailed through these and had disembarked from his
      ship, he sent for Demaratos the son of Ariston, who was marching with him
      against Hellas; and having called him he asked as follows: "Demaratos, now
      it is my pleasure to ask thee somewhat which I desire to know. Thou art
      not only a Hellene, but also, as I am informed both by thee and by the
      other Hellenes who come to speech with me, of a city which is neither the
      least nor the feeblest of Hellas. Now therefore declare to me this, namely
      whether the Hellenes will endure to raise hands against me: for, as I
      suppose, even if all the Hellenes and the remaining nations who dwell
      towards the West should be gathered together, they are not strong enough
      in fight to endure my attack, supposing them to be my enemies. <a href="#link7note-95" id="link7noteref-95" class="pginternal">95</a> I
      desire however to be informed also of thy opinion, what thou sayest about
      these matters." He inquired thus, and the other made answer and said: "O
      king, shall I utter the truth in speaking to thee, or that which will give
      pleasure?" and he bade him utter the truth, saying that he should suffer
      nothing unpleasant in consequence of this, any more than he suffered
      before.
    </p>
<p>
      102. When Demaratos heard this, he spoke as follows: "O king, since thou
      biddest me by all means utter the truth, and so speak as one who shall not
      be afterwards convicted by thee of having spoken falsely, I say this:—with
      Hellas poverty is ever an inbred growth, while valour is one that has been
      brought in, being acquired by intelligence and the force of law; and of it
      Hellas makes use ever to avert from herself not only poverty but also
      servitude to a master. Now I commend all the Hellenes who are settled in
      those Dorian lands, but this which I am about to say has regard not to
      all, but to the Lacedemonians alone: of these I say, first that it is not
      possible that they will ever accept thy terms, which carry with them
      servitude for Hellas; and next I say that they will stand against thee in
      fight, even if all the other Hellenes shall be of thy party: and as for
      numbers, ask now how many they are, that they are able to do this; for
      whether it chances that a thousand of them have come out into the field,
      these will fight with thee, or if there be less than this, or again if
      there be more."
    </p>
<p>
      103. Xerxes hearing this laughed, and said: "Demaratos, what a speech is
      this which thou hast uttered, saying that a thousand men will fight with
      this vast army! Come tell me this:—thou sayest that thou wert
      thyself king of these men; wilt thou therefore consent forthwith to fight
      with ten men? and yet if your State is such throughout as thou dost
      describe it, thou their king ought by your laws to stand in array against
      double as many as another man; that is to say, if each of them is a match
      for ten men of my army, I expect of thee that thou shouldest be a match
      for twenty. Thus would be confirmed the report which is made by thee: but
      if ye, who boast thus greatly are such men and in size so great only as
      the Hellenes who come commonly to speech with me, thyself included, then
      beware lest this which has been spoken prove but an empty vaunt. For come,
      let me examine it by all that is probable: how could a thousand or ten
      thousand or even fifty thousand, at least if they were all equally free
      and were not ruled by one man, stand against so great an army? since, as
      thou knowest, we shall be more than a thousand coming about each one of
      them, supposing them to be in number five thousand. If indeed they were
      ruled by one man after our fashion, they might perhaps from fear of him
      become braver than it was their nature to be, or they might go compelled
      by the lash to fight with greater numbers, being themselves fewer in
      number; but if left at liberty, they would do neither of these things: and
      I for my part suppose that, even if equally matched in numbers, the
      Hellenes would hardly dare to fight with the Persians taken alone. With us
      however this of which thou speakest is found in single men, <a href="#link7note-96" id="link7noteref-96" class="pginternal">96</a>
      not indeed often, but rarely; for there are Persians of my spearmen who
      will consent to fight with three men of the Hellenes at once: but thou
      hast had no experience of these things and therefore thou speakest very
      much at random."
    </p>
<p>
      104. To this Demaratos replied: "O king, from the first I was sure that if
      I uttered the truth I should not speak that which was pleasing to thee;
      since however thou didst compel me to speak the very truth, I told thee of
      the matters which concern the Spartans. And yet how I am at this present
      time attached to them by affection thou knowest better than any; seeing
      that first they took away from me the rank and privileges which came to me
      from my fathers, and then also they have caused me to be without native
      land and an exile; but thy father took me up and gave me livelihood and a
      house to dwell in. Surely it is not to be supposed likely that the prudent
      man will thrust aside friendliness which is offered to him, but rather
      that he will accept it with full contentment. <a href="#link7note-97" id="link7noteref-97" class="pginternal">97</a> And I do not profess
      that I am able to fight either with ten men or with two, nay, if I had my
      will, I would not even fight with one; but if there were necessity or if
      the cause which urged me to the combat were a great one, I would fight
      most willingly with one of these men who says that he is a match for three
      of the Hellenes. So also the Lacedemonians are not inferior to any men
      when fighting one by one, and they are the best of all men when fighting
      in a body: for though free, yet they are not free in all things, for over
      them is set Law as a master, whom they fear much more even than thy people
      fear thee. It is certain at least that they do whatsoever that master
      commands; and he commands ever the same thing, that is to say, he bids
      them not flee out of battle from any multitude of men, but stay in their
      post and win the victory or lose their life. But if when I say these
      things I seem to thee to be speaking at random, of other things for the
      future I prefer to be silent; and at this time I spake only because I was
      compelled. May it come to pass however according to thy mind, O king."
    </p>
<p>
      105. He thus made answer, and Xerxes turned the matter to laughter and
      felt no anger, but dismissed him with kindness. Then after he had
      conversed with him, and had appointed Mascames son of Megadostes to be
      governor at this place Doriscos, removing the governor who had been
      appointed by Dareios, Xerxes marched forth his army through Thrace to
      invade Hellas.
    </p>
<p>
      106. And Mascames, whom he left behind here, proved to be a man of such
      qualities that to him alone Xerxes used to send gifts, considering him the
      best of all the men whom either he himself or Dareios had appointed to be
      governors,—he used to send him gifts, I say, every year, and so also
      did Artaxerxes the son of Xerxes to the descendants of Mascames. For even
      before this march governors had been appointed in Thrace and everywhere
      about the Hellespont; and these all, both those in Thrace and in the
      Hellespont, were conquered by the Hellenes after this expedition, except
      only the one who was at Doriscos; but Mascames at Doriscos none were ever
      <a href="#link7note-98" id="link7noteref-98" class="pginternal">98</a>
      able to conquer, though many tried. For this reason the gifts are sent
      continually for him from the king who reigns over the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      107. Of those however who were conquered by the Hellenes Xerxes did not
      consider any to be a good man except only Boges, who was at Eïon: him he
      never ceased commending, and he honoured very highly his children who
      survived him in the land of Persia. For in truth Boges proved himself
      worthy of great commendation, seeing that when he was besieged by the
      Athenians under Kimon the son of Miltiades, though he might have gone
      forth under a truce and so returned home to Asia, he preferred not to do
      this, for fear that the king should that it was by cowardice that he
      survived; and he continued to hold out till the last. Then when there was
      no longer any supply of provisions within the wall, he heaped together a
      great pyre, and he cut the throats of his children, his wife, his
      concubines and his servants, and threw them into the fire; and after this
      he scattered all the gold and silver in the city from the wall into the
      river Strymon, and having so done he threw himself into the fire. Thus he
      is justly commended even to this present time by the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      108. Xerxes from Doriscos was proceeding onwards to invade Hellas; and as
      he went he compelled those who successively came in his way, to join his
      march: for the whole country as far as Thessaly had been reduced to
      subjection, as has been set forth by me before, and was tributary under
      the king, having been subdued by Megabazos and afterwards by Mardonios.
      And he passed in his march from Doriscos first by the Samothrakian
      strongholds, of which that which is situated furthest towards the West is
      a city called Mesambria. Next to this follows Stryme, a city of the
      Thasians, and midway between them flows the river Lisos, which at this
      time did not suffice when supplying its water to the army of Xerxes, but
      the stream failed. This country was in old time called Gallaïke, but now
      Briantike; however by strict justice this also belongs to the Kikonians.
    </p>
<p>
      109. Having crossed over the bed of the river Lisos after it had been
      dried up, he passed by these Hellenic cities, namely Maroneia, Dicaia and
      Abdera. These I say he passed by, and also the following lakes of note
      lying near them,—the Ismarian lake, lying between Maroneia and
      Stryme; the Bistonian lake near Dicaia, into which two rivers pour their
      waters, the Trauos <a href="#link7note-99" id="link7noteref-99" class="pginternal">99</a> and the Compsantos; <a href="#link7note-100" id="link7noteref-100" class="pginternal">100</a> and at Abdera no
      lake indeed of any note was passed by Xerxes, but the river Nestos, which
      flows there into the sea. Then after passing these places he went by the
      cities of the mainland, <a href="#link7note-101" id="link7noteref-101" class="pginternal">101</a> near one of which there is, as it chances, a
      lake of somewhere about thirty furlongs in circumference, abounding in
      fish and very brackish; this the baggage-animals alone dried up, being
      watered at it: and the name of this city is Pistyros. <a href="#link7note-102" id="link7noteref-102" class="pginternal">102</a>
</p>
<p>
      110. These cities, I say, lying by the sea coast and belonging to
      Hellenes, he passed by, leaving them on the left hand; and the tribes of
      Thracians through whose country he marched were as follows, namely the
      Paitians, Kikonians, Bistonians, Sapaians, Dersaians, Edonians, Satrians.
      Of these they who were settled along the sea coast accompanied him with
      their ships, and those of them who dwelt inland and have been enumerated
      by me, were compelled to accompany him on land, except the Satrians:
    </p>
<p>
      111, the Satrians however never yet became obedient to any man, so far as
      we know, but they remain up to my time still free, alone of all the
      Thracians; for they dwell in lofty mountains, which are covered with
      forest of all kinds and with snow, and also they are very skilful in war.
      These are they who possess the Oracle of Dionysos; which Oracle is on
      their most lofty mountains. Of the Satrians those who act as prophets <a href="#link7note-103" id="link7noteref-103" class="pginternal">103</a>
      of the temple are the Bessians; it is a prophetess <a href="#link7note-104" id="link7noteref-104" class="pginternal">104</a> who utters the
      oracles, as at Delphi; and beyond this there is nothing further of a
      remarkable character. <a href="#link7note-105" id="link7noteref-105" class="pginternal">105</a>
</p>
<p>
      112. Xerxes having passed over the land which has been spoken of, next
      after this passed the strongholds of the Pierians, of which the name of
      the one is Phagres and of the other Pergamos. By this way, I say, he made
      his march, going close by the walls of these, and keeping Mount Pangaion
      on the right hand, which is both great and lofty and in which are mines
      both of gold and of silver possessed by the Pierians and Odomantians, and
      especially by the Satrians.
    </p>
<p>
      113. Thus passing by the Paionians, Doberians and Paioplians, who dwell
      beyond Pangaion towards the North Wind, he went on Westwards, until at
      last he came to the river Strymon and the city of Eïon, of which, so long
      as he lived, Boges was commander, the same about whom I was speaking a
      short time back. This country about Mount Pangaion is called Phyllis, and
      it extends Westwards to the river Angites, which flows into the Strymon,
      and Southwards it stretches to the Strymon itself; and at this river the
      Magians sacrificed for good omens, slaying white horses.
    </p>
<p>
      114. Having done this and many other things in addition to this, as charms
      for the river, at the Nine Ways <a href="#link7note-106" id="link7noteref-106" class="pginternal">106</a> in the land of the
      Edonians, they proceeded by the bridges, for they had found the Strymon
      already yoked with bridges; and being informed that this place was called
      the Nine Ways, they buried alive in it that number of boys and maidens,
      children of the natives of the place. Now burying alive is a Persian
      custom; for I am informed that Amestris also, the wife of Xerxes, when she
      had grown old, made return for her own life to the god who is said to be
      beneath the earth by burying twice seven children of Persians who were men
      of renown.
    </p>
<p>
      115. As the army proceeded on its march from the Strymon, it found after
      this a sea-beach stretching towards the setting of the sun, and passed by
      the Hellenic city, Argilos, which was there placed. This region and that
      which lies above it is called Bisaltia. Thence, keeping on the left hand
      the gulf which lies of Posideion, he went through the plain which is
      called the plain of Syleus, passing by Stageiros a Hellenic city, and so
      came to Acanthos, taking with him as he went each one of these tribes and
      also of those who dwell about Mount Pangaion, just as he did those whom I
      enumerated before, having the men who dwelt along the sea coast to serve
      in the ships and those who dwelt inland to accompany him on foot. This
      road by which Xerxes the king marched his army, the Thracians do not
      disturb nor sow crops over, but pay very great reverence to it down to my
      own time.
    </p>
<p>
      116. Then when he had come to Acanthos, Xerxes proclaimed a
      guest-friendship with the people of Acanthos and also presented them with
      the Median dress <a href="#link7note-107" id="link7noteref-107" class="pginternal">107</a> and commended them, perceiving that they
      were zealous to serve him in the war and hearing of that which had been
      dug.
    </p>
<p>
      117. And while Xerxes was in Acanthos, it happened that he who had been
      set over the making of the channel, Artachaies by name, died of sickness,
      a man who was highly esteemed by Xerxes and belonged to the Achaimenid
      family; also he was in stature the tallest of all the Persians, falling
      short by only four fingers of being five royal cubits <a href="#link7note-108" id="link7noteref-108" class="pginternal">108</a>
      in height, and he had a voice the loudest of all men; so that Xerxes was
      greatly grieved at the loss of him, and carried him forth and buried him
      with great honour, and the whole army joined in throwing up a mound for
      him. To this Artachaies the Acanthians by the bidding of an oracle do
      sacrifice as a hero, calling upon his name in worship.
    </p>
<p>
      118. King Xerxes, I say, was greatly grieved at the loss of Artachaies:
      and meanwhile the Hellenes who were entertaining his army and providing
      Xerxes with dinners had been brought to utter ruin, so that they were
      being driven from house and home; seeing that when the Thasians, for
      example, entertained the army of Xerxes and provided him with a dinner on
      behalf of their towns upon the mainland, Antipater the son of Orgeus, who
      had been appointed for this purpose, a man of repute among the citizens
      equal to the best, reported that four hundred talents of silver had been
      spent upon the dinner.
    </p>
<p>
      119. Just so or nearly so in the other cities also those who were set over
      the business reported the reckoning to be: for the dinner was given as
      follows, having been ordered a long time beforehand, and being counted by
      them a matter of great importance:—In the first place, so soon as
      they heard of it from the heralds who carried round the proclamation, the
      citizens in the various cities distributed corn among their several
      households, and all continued to make wheat and barley meal for many
      months; then they fed cattle, finding out and obtaining the finest animals
      for a high price; and they kept birds both of the land and of the water,
      in cages or in pools, all for the entertainment of the army. Then again
      they had drinking-cups and mixing-bowls made of gold and of silver, and
      all the other things which are placed upon the table: these were made for
      the king himself and for those who ate at his table; but for the rest of
      the army only the things appointed for food were provided. Then whenever
      the army came to any place, there was a tent pitched ready wherein Xerxes
      himself made his stay, while the rest of the army remained out in the open
      air; and when it came to be time for dinner, then the entertainers had
      labour; but the others, after they had been satiated with food and had
      spent the night there, on the next day tore up the tent and taking with
      them all the movable furniture proceeded on their march, leaving nothing,
      but carrying all away with them.
    </p>
<p>
      120. Then was uttered a word well spoken by Megacreon, a man of Abdera,
      who advised those of Abdera to go in a body, both themselves and their
      wives, to their temples, and to sit down as suppliants of the gods,
      entreating them that for the future also they would ward off from them the
      half of the evils which threatened; and he bade them feel great
      thankfulness to the gods for the past events, because king Xerxes had not
      thought good to take food twice in each day; for if it had been ordered to
      them beforehand to prepare breakfast also in like manner as the dinner, it
      would have remained for the men of Abdera either not to await the coming
      of Xerxes, or if they stayed, to be crushed by misfortune more than any
      other men upon the Earth.
    </p>
<p>
      121. They then, I say, though hard put to it, yet were performing that
      which was appointed to them; and from Acanthos Xerxes, after having
      commanded the generals to wait for the fleet at Therma, let the ships take
      their course apart from himself, (now this Therma is that which is
      situated on the Thermaic gulf, from which also this gulf has its name);
      and thus he did because he was informed that this was the shortest way:
      for from Doriscos as far as Acanthos the army had been making its march
      thus:—Xerxes had divided the whole land-army into three divisions,
      and one of them he had set to go along the sea accompanying the fleet, of
      which division Mardonios and Masistes were commanders; another third of
      the army had been appointed to go by the inland way, and of this the
      generals in command were Tritantaichmes and Gergis; and meanwhile the
      third of the subdivisions, with which Xerxes himself went, marched in the
      middle between them, and acknowledged as its commanders Smerdomenes and
      Megabyzos.
    </p>
<p>
      122. The fleet, when it was let go by Xerxes and had sailed right through
      the channel made in Athos (which went across to the gulf on which are
      situated the cities of Assa, Piloros, Singos and Sarte), having taken up a
      contingent from these cities also, sailed thence with a free course to the
      Thermaïc gulf, and turning round Ampelos the headland of Torone, it left
      on one side the following Hellenic cities, from which it took up
      contingents of ships and men, namely Torone, Galepsos, Sermyle, Mekyberna,
      Olynthos: this region is called Sithonia.
    </p>
<p>
      123. And the fleet of Xerxes, cutting across from the headland of Ampelos
      to that of Canastron, which runs out furthest to sea of all Pallene, took
      up there contingents of ships and men from Potidaia, Aphytis, Neapolis,
      Aige, Therambo, Skione, Mende and Sane, for these are the cities which
      occupy the region which now is called Pallene, but was formerly called
      Phlegra. Then sailing along the coast of this country also the fleet
      continued its course towards the place which has been mentioned before,
      taking up contingents also from the cities which come next after Pallene
      and border upon the Thermaïc gulf; and the names of them are these,—Lipaxos,
      Combreia, Lisai, Gigonos, Campsa, Smila, Aineia; and the region in which
      these cities are is called even to the present day Crossaia. Then sailing
      from Aineia, with which name I brought to an end the list of the cities,
      at once the fleet came into the Thermaïc gulf and to the region of
      Mygdonia, and so it arrived at the aforesaid Therma and at the cities of
      Sindos and Chalestra upon the river Axios. This river is the boundary
      between the land of Mygdonia and Bottiaia, of which district the narrow
      region which lies on the sea coast is occupied by the cities of Ichnai and
      Pella.
    </p>
<p>
      124. Now while his naval force was encamped about the river Axios an the
      city of Therma and the cities which lie between these two, waiting for the
      coming of the king, Xerxes and the land-army were proceeding from
      Acanthos, cutting through the middle by the shortest way <a href="#link7note-109" id="link7noteref-109" class="pginternal">109</a>
      with a view to reaching Therma: and he was proceeding through Paionia and
      Crestonia to the river Cheidoros, <a href="#link7note-110" id="link7noteref-110" class="pginternal">110</a> which beginning from
      the land of the Crestonians, runs through the region of Mygdonia and comes
      out alongside of the marsh which is by the river Axios.
    </p>
<p>
      125. As he was proceeding by this way, lions attacked the camels which
      carried his provisions; for the lions used to come down regularly by
      night, leaving their own haunts, but they touched nothing else, neither
      beast of burden nor man, but killed the camels only: and I marvel what was
      the cause, and what was it that impelled the lions to abstain from all
      else and to attack the camels only, creatures which they had never seen
      before, and of which they had had no experience.
    </p>
<p>
      126. Now there are in these parts both many lions and also wild oxen,
      those that have the very large horns which are often brought into Hellas:
      and the limit within which these lions are found is on the one side the
      river Nestos, which flows through Abdera, and on the other the Achelos,
      which flows through Acarnania; for neither do the East of the Nestos, in
      any part of Europe before you come to this, would you see a lion, nor
      again in the remaining part of the continent to the West of the Acheloos,
      but they are produced in the middle space between these rivers.
    </p>
<p>
      127. When Xerxes had reached Therma he established the army there; and his
      army encamping there occupied of the land along by the sea no less than
      this,—beginning from the city of Therma and from Mygdonia it
      extended as far as the river Lydias and the Haliacmon, which form the
      boundary between the lands of Bottiaia and Macedonia, mingling their
      waters together in one and the same stream. The Barbarians, I say, were
      encamped in these regions; and of the rivers which have been enumerated,
      only the river Cheidoros flowing from the Crestonian land was insufficient
      for the drinking of the army and failed in its stream.
    </p>
<p>
      128. Then Xerxes seeing from Therma the mountains of Thessaly, Olympos and
      Ossa, that they were of very great height, and being informed that in the
      midst between them there was a narrow channel, through which flows the
      Peneios, and hearing also that by this way there was a good road leading
      to Thessaly, formed a desire to sail thither and look at the outlet of the
      Peneios, because he was meaning to march by the upper road, through the
      land of the Macedonians who dwell inland, until he came to the
      Perraibians, passing by the city of Gonnos; for by this way he was
      informed that it was safest to go. And having formed this desire, so also
      he proceeded to do; that is, he embarked in a Sidonian ship, the same in
      which he used always to embark when he wished to do anything of this kind,
      and he displayed a signal for the others to put out to sea also, leaving
      there the land-army. Then when Xerxes had looked at the outlet of the
      Peneios, he was possessed by great wonder, and summoning his guides he
      asked them whether it was possible to turn the river aside and bring it
      out to the sea by another way.
    </p>
<p>
      129. Now it is said that Thessaly was in old time a lake, being enclosed
      on all sides by very lofty mountains: for the parts of it which lie
      towards the East are shut in by the ranges of Pelion and Ossa, which join
      one another in their lower slopes, the parts towards the North Wind by
      Olympos, those towards the West by Pindos and those towards the mid-day
      and the South Wind by Othrys; and the region in the midst, between these
      mountains which have been named, is Thessaly, forming as it were a hollow.
      Whereas then many rivers flow into it and among them these five of most
      note, namely Peneios, Apidanos, Onochonos, Enipeus and Pamisos, these,
      which collect their waters from the mountains that enclose Thessaly round,
      and flow into this plain, with names separate each one, having their
      outflow into the sea by one channel and that a narrow one, first mingling
      their waters all together in one and the same stream; and so soon as they
      are mingled together, from that point onwards the Peneios prevails with
      its name over the rest and causes the others to lose their separate names.
      And it is said that in ancient time, there not being yet this channel and
      outflow between the mountains, these rivers, and besides these rivers the
      lake Boibeïs also, had no names as they have now, but by their waters they
      made Thessaly to be all sea. The Thessalians themselves say that Poseidon
      made the channel through which the Peneios flows; and reasonably they
      report it thus, because whosoever believes that it is Poseidon who shakes
      the Earth and that the partings asunder produced by earthquake are the
      work of this god, would say, if he saw this, that it was made by Poseidon;
      for the parting asunder of the mountains is the work of an earthquake, as
      is evident to me.
    </p>
<p>
      130. So the guides, when Xerxes asked whether there was any other possible
      outlet to the sea for the Peneios, said with exact knowledge of the truth:
      "O king, for this river there is no other outgoing which extends to the
      sea, but this alone; for all Thessaly is circled about with mountains as
      with a crown." To this Xerxes is said to have replied: "The Thessalians
      then are prudent men. This it appears was that which they desired to guard
      against in good time <a href="#link7note-111" id="link7noteref-111" class="pginternal">111</a> when they changed their counsel, <a href="#link7note-112" id="link7noteref-112" class="pginternal">112</a>
      reflecting on this especially besides other things, namely that they had a
      country which, it appears, is easy to conquer and may quickly be taken:
      for it would have been necessary only to let the river flow over their
      land by making an embankment to keep it from going through the narrow
      channel and so diverting the course by which now it flows, in order to put
      all Thessaly under water except the mountains." This he said in reference
      to the sons of Aleuas, because they, being Thessalians, were the first of
      the Hellenes who gave themselves over to the king; for Xerxes thought that
      they offered him friendship on behalf of their whole nation. Having said
      thus and having looked at the place, he sailed back to Therma.
    </p>
<p>
      131. He then was staying in the region of Pieria many days, for the road
      over the mountains of Macedonia was being cut meanwhile by a third part of
      his army, that all the host might pass over by this way into the land of
      the Perraibians: and now the heralds returned who had been sent to Hellas
      to demand the gift of earth, some empty-handed and others bearing earth
      and water.
    </p>
<p>
      132. And among those who gave that which was demanded were the following,
      namely the Thessalians, Dolopians, Enianians, <a href="#link7note-113" id="link7noteref-113" class="pginternal">113</a> Perraibians,
      Locrians, Megnesians, Malians, Achaians of Phthiotis, and Thebans, with
      the rest of the Boeotians also excepting the Thespians and Plataians.
      Against these the Hellenes who took up war with the Barbarian made an
      oath; and the oath was this,—that whosoever being Hellenes had given
      themselves over to the Persian, not being compelled, these, if their own
      affairs should come to a good conclusion, they would dedicate as an
      offering <a href="#link7note-114" id="link7noteref-114" class="pginternal">114</a> to the god at Delphi.
    </p>
<p>
      133. Thus ran the oath which was taken by the Hellenes: Xerxes however had
      not sent to Athens or to Sparta heralds to demand the gift of earth, and
      for this reason, namely because at the former time when Dareios had sent
      for this very purpose, the one people threw the men who made the demand
      into the pit <a href="#link7note-115" id="link7noteref-115" class="pginternal">115</a> and the others into a well, and bade them
      take from thence earth and water and bear them to the king. For this
      reason Xerxes did not send men to make this demand. And what evil thing <a href="#link7note-116" id="link7noteref-116" class="pginternal">116</a>
      came upon the Athenians for having done this to the heralds, I am not able
      to say, except indeed that their land and city were laid waste; but I do
      not think that this happened for that cause:
    </p>
<p>
      134, on the Lacedemonians however the wrath fell of Talthybios, the herald
      of Agamemnon; for in Sparta there is a temple of Talthybios, and there are
      also descendants of Talthybios called Talthybiads, to whom have been given
      as a right all the missions of heralds which go from Sparta; and after
      this event it was not possible for the Spartans when they sacrificed to
      obtain favourable omens. This was the case with them for a long time; and
      as the Lacedemonians were grieved and regarded it as a great misfortune,
      and general assemblies were repeatedly gathered together and proclamation
      made, asking if any one of the Lacedemonians was willing to die for
      Sparta, at length Sperthias the son of Aneristos and Bulis the son of
      Nicolaos, Spartans of noble birth and in wealth attaining to the first
      rank, voluntarily submitted to pay the penalty to Xerxes for the heralds
      of Dareios which had perished at Sparta. Thus the Spartans sent these to
      the Medes to be put to death.
    </p>
<p>
      135. And not only the courage then shown by these men is worthy of
      admiration, but also the following sayings in addition: for as they were
      on their way to Susa they came to Hydarnes (now Hydarnes was a Persian by
      race and commander of those who dwelt on the sea coasts of Asia), and he
      offered them hospitality and entertained them; and while they were his
      guests he asked them as follows: "Lacedemonians, why is it that ye flee
      from becoming friends to the king? for ye may see that the king knows how
      to honour good men, when ye look at me and at my fortunes. So also ye,
      Lacedemonians, if ye gave yourselves to the king, since ye have the
      reputation with him already of being good men, would have rule each one of
      you over Hellenic land by the gift of the king." To this they made answer
      thus: "Hydarnes, thy counsel with regard to us is not equally balanced, <a href="#link7note-117" id="link7noteref-117" class="pginternal">117</a>
      for thou givest counsel having made trial indeed of the one thing, but
      being without experience of the other: thou knowest well what it is to be
      a slave, but thou hast never yet made trial of freedom, whether it is
      pleasant to the taste or no; for if thou shouldest make trial of it, thou
      wouldest then counsel us to fight for it not with spears only but also
      with axes."
    </p>
<p>
      136. Thus they answered Hydarnes; and then, after they had gone up to Susa
      and had come into the presence of the king, first when the spearmen of the
      guard commanded them and endeavoured to compel them by force to do
      obeisance to the king by falling down before him, they said that they
      would not do any such deed, though they should be pushed down by them head
      foremost; for it was not their custom to do obeisance to a man, and it was
      not for this that they had come. Then when they had resisted this, next
      they spoke these words or words to this effect: "O king of the Medes, the
      Lacedemonians sent us in place of the heralds who were slain in Sparta, to
      pay the penalty for their lives." When they said this, Xerxes moved by a
      spirit of magnanimity replied that he would not be like the Lacedemonians;
      for they had violated the rules which prevailed among all men by slaying
      heralds, but he would not do that himself which he blamed them for having
      done, nor would he free the Lacedemonians from their guilt by slaying
      these in return.
    </p>
<p>
      137. Thus the wrath of Talthybios ceased for the time being, even though
      the Spartans had done no more than this and although Sperthias and Bulis
      returned back to Sparta; but a long time after this it was roused again
      during the war between the Peloponnesians and Athenians, as the
      Lacedemonians report. This I perceive to have been most evidently the act
      of the Deity: for in that the wrath of Talthybios fell upon messengers and
      did not cease until it had been fully satisfied, so much was but in
      accordance with justice; but that it happened to come upon the sons of
      these men who went up to the king on account of the wrath, namely upon
      Nicolaos the son of Bulis and Aneristos the son of Sperthias (the same who
      conquered the men of Halieis, who came from Tiryns, by sailing into their
      harbour with a merchant ship filled with fighting men),—by this it
      is evident to me that the matter came to pass by the act of the Deity
      caused by this wrath. For these men, sent by the Lacedemonians as envoys
      to Asia, having been betrayed by Sitalkes the son of Teres king of the
      Thracians and by Nymphodoros the son of Pythes a man of Abdera, were
      captured at Bisanthe on the Hellespont; and then having been carried away
      to Attica they were put to death by the Athenians, and with them also
      Aristeas the son of Adeimantos the Corinthian. These things happened many
      years after the expedition of the king; and I return now to the former
      narrative.
    </p>
<p>
      138. Now the march of the king's army was in name against Athens, but in
      fact it was going against all Hellas: and the Hellenes being informed of
      this long before were not all equally affected by it; for some of them
      having given earth and water to the Persian had confidence, supposing that
      they would suffer no hurt from the Barbarian; while others not having
      given were in great terror, seeing that there were not ships existing in
      Hellas which were capable as regards number of receiving the invader in
      fight, and seeing that the greater part of the States were not willing to
      take up the war, but adopted readily the side of the Medes.
    </p>
<p>
      139. And here I am compelled by necessity to declare an opinion which in
      the eyes of most men would seem to be invidious, but nevertheless I will
      not abstain from saying that which I see evidently to be the truth. If the
      Athenians had been seized with fear of the danger which threatened them
      and had left their land, <a href="#link7note-118" id="link7noteref-118" class="pginternal">118</a> or again, without leaving their land, had
      stayed and given themselves up to Xerxes, none would have made any attempt
      by sea to oppose the king. If then none had opposed Xerxes by sea, it
      would have happened on the land somewhat thus:—even if many tunics
      of walls <a href="#link7note-119" id="link7noteref-119" class="pginternal">119</a> had been thrown across the Isthmus by the
      Peloponnesians, the Lacedemonians would have been deserted by their
      allies, not voluntarily but of necessity, since these would have been
      conquered city after city by the naval force of the Barbarian, and so they
      would have been left alone: and having been left alone and having
      displayed great deeds of valour, they would have met their death nobly.
      Either they would have suffered this fate, or before this, seeing the
      other Hellenes also taking the side of the Medes, they would have made an
      agreement with Xerxes; and thus in either case Hellas would have come to
      be under the rule of the Persians: for as to the good to be got from the
      walls thrown across the Isthmus, I am unable to discover what it would
      have been, when the king had command of the sea. As it is however, if a
      man should say that the Athenians proved to be the saviours of Hellas, he
      would not fail to hit the truth; for to whichever side these turned, to
      that the balance was likely to incline: and these were they who,
      preferring that Hellas should continue to exist in freedom, roused up all
      of Hellas which remained, so much, that is, as had not gone over to the
      Medes, and (after the gods at least) these were they who repelled the
      king. Nor did fearful oracles, which came from Delphi and cast them into
      dread, induce them to leave Hellas, but they stayed behind and endured to
      receive the invader of their land.
    </p>
<p>
      140. For the Athenians had sent men to Delphi to inquire and were
      preparing to consult the Oracle; and after these had performed the usual
      rites in the sacred precincts, when they had entered the sanctuary <a href="#link7note-120" id="link7noteref-120" class="pginternal">120</a>
      and were sitting down there, the Pythian prophetess, whose name was
      Aristonike, uttered to them this oracle:
    </p>
<pre>
   "Why do ye sit, O ye wretched? Flee thou <a href="#link7note-121" id="link7noteref-121" class="pginternal">121</a> to the uttermost
   limits, Leaving thy home and the heights of the wheel-round city
   behind thee! Lo, there remaineth now nor the head nor the body in
   safety,—Neither the feet below nor the hands nor the middle are
   left thee,—All are destroyed <a href="#link7note-122" id="link7noteref-122" class="pginternal">122</a> together; for fire and the
   passionate War-god, <a href="#link7note-123" id="link7noteref-123" class="pginternal">123</a> Urging the Syrian <a href="#link7note-124" id="link7noteref-124" class="pginternal">124</a> car to speed, doth
   hurl them <a href="#link7note-125" id="link7noteref-125" class="pginternal">125</a> to ruin. Not thine alone, he shall cause many more
   great strongholds to perish, Yes, many temples of gods to the
   ravening fire shall deliver,—Temples which stand now surely with
   sweat of their terror down-streaming, Quaking with dread; and lo!
   from the topmost roof to the pavement Dark blood trickles,
   forecasting the dire unavoidable evil. Forth with you, forth from
   the shrine, and steep your soul in the sorrow!" <a href="#link7note-126" id="link7noteref-126" class="pginternal">126</a>
</pre>
<p>
      141. Hearing this the men who had been sent by the Athenians to consult
      the Oracle were very greatly distressed; and as they were despairing by
      reason of the evil which had been prophesied to them, Timon the son of
      Androbulos, a man of the Delphians in reputation equal to the first,
      counselled them to take a suppliant's bough and to approach the second
      time and consult the Oracle as suppliants. The Athenians did as he advised
      and said: "Lord, <a href="#link7note-127" id="link7noteref-127" class="pginternal">127</a> we pray thee utter to us some better oracle
      about our native land, having respect to these suppliant boughs which we
      have come to thee bearing; otherwise surely we will not depart away from
      the sanctuary, but will remain here where we are now, even until we bring
      our lives to an end." When they spoke these words, the prophetess gave
      them a second oracle as follows:
    </p>
<pre>
   "Pallas cannot prevail to appease great Zeus in Olympos, Though she
   with words very many and wiles close-woven entreat him. But I will
   tell thee this more, and will clench it with steel adamantine: Then
   when all else shall be taken, whatever the boundary <a href="#link7note-128" id="link7noteref-128" class="pginternal">128</a> of Kecrops
   Holdeth within, and the dark ravines of divinest Kithairon, A
   bulwark of wood at the last Zeus grants to the Trito-born goddess
   Sole to remain unwasted, which thee and thy children shall profit.
   Stay thou not there for the horsemen to come and the footmen
   unnumbered; Stay thou not still for the host from the mainland to
   come, but retire thee, Turning thy back to the foe, for yet thou
   shalt face him hereafter. Salamis, thou the divine, thou shalt cause
   sons of women to perish, Or when the grain <a href="#link7note-129" id="link7noteref-129" class="pginternal">129</a> is scattered or
   when it is gathered together."
</pre>
<p>
      142. This seemed to them to be (as in truth it was) a milder utterance
      than the former one; therefore they had it written down and departed with
      it to Athens: and when the messengers after their return made report to
      the people, many various opinions were expressed by persons inquiring into
      the meaning of the oracle, and among them these, standing most in
      opposition to one another:—some of the elder men said they thought
      that the god had prophesied to them that the Acropolis should survive; for
      the Acropolis of the Athenians was in old time fenced with a thorn hedge;
      and they conjectured accordingly that this saying about the "bulwark of
      wood" referred to the fence: others on the contrary said that the god
      meant by this their ships, and they advised to leave all else and get
      ready these. Now they who said that the ships were the bulwark of wood
      were shaken in their interpretation by the two last verses which the
      prophetess uttered:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Salamis, thou the divine, thou shalt cause sons of women to perish,
  Or when the grain is scattered or when it is gathered together."
</pre>
<p>
      In reference to these verses the opinions of those who said that the ships
      were the bulwark of wood were disturbed; for the interpreters of oracles
      took these to mean that it was fated for them, having got ready for a
      sea-fight, to suffer defeat round about Salamis.
    </p>
<p>
      143. Now there was one man of the Athenians who had lately been coming
      forward to take a place among the first, whose name was Themistocles,
      called son of Neocles. This man said that the interpreters of oracles did
      not make right conjecture of the whole, and he spoke as follows, saying
      that if these words that had been uttered referred really to the
      Athenians, he did not think it would have been so mildly expressed in the
      oracle, but rather thus, "Salamis, thou the merciless," instead of
      "Salamis, thou the divine," at least if its settlers were destined to
      perish round about it: but in truth the oracle had been spoken by the god
      with reference to the enemy, if one understood it rightly, and not to the
      Athenians: therefore he counselled them to get ready to fight a battle by
      sea, for in this was their bulwark of wood. When Themistocles declared his
      opinion thus, the Athenians judged that this was to be preferred by them
      rather than the advice of the interpreters of oracles, who bade them not
      make ready for a sea-fight, nor in short raise their hands at all in
      opposition, but leave the land of Attica and settle in some other.
    </p>
<p>
      144. Another opinion too of Themistocles before this one proved the best
      at the right moment, when the Athenians, having got large sums of money in
      the public treasury, which had come in to them from the mines which are at
      Laureion, were intending to share it among themselves, taking each in turn
      the sum of ten drachmas. Then Themistocles persuaded the Athenians to give
      up this plan of division and to make for themselves with this money two
      hundred ships for the war, meaning by that the war with the Eginetans: for
      this war having arisen <a href="#link7note-130" id="link7noteref-130" class="pginternal">130</a> proved in fact the salvation of Hellas at
      that time, by compelling the Athenians to become a naval power. And the
      ships, not having been used for the purpose for which they had been made,
      thus proved of service at need to Hellas. These ships then, I say, the
      Athenians had already, having built them beforehand, and it was necessary
      in addition to these to construct others. They resolved then, when they
      took counsel after the oracle was given, to receive the Barbarian invading
      Hellas with their ships in full force, following the commands of the god,
      in combination with those of the Hellenes who were willing to join them.
    </p>
<p>
      145. These oracles had been given before to the Athenians: and when those
      Hellenes who had the better mind about Hellas <a href="#link7note-131" id="link7noteref-131" class="pginternal">131</a> came together to one
      place, and considered their affairs and interchanged assurances with one
      another, then deliberating together they thought it well first of all
      things to reconcile the enmities and bring to an end the wars which they
      had with one another. Now there were wars engaged <a href="#link7note-132" id="link7noteref-132" class="pginternal">132</a> between others also,
      and especially between the Athenians and the Eginetans. After this, being
      informed that Xerxes was with his army at Sardis, they determined to send
      spies to Asia to make observation of the power of the king; and moreover
      they resolved to send envoys to Argos to form an alliance against the
      Persian, and to send others to Sicily to Gelon the son of Deinomenes and
      also to Corcyra, to urge them to come to the assistance of Hellas, and
      others again to Crete; for they made it their aim that if possible the
      Hellenic race might unite in one, and that they might join all together
      and act towards the same end, since dangers were threatening all the
      Hellenes equally. Now the power of Gelon was said to be great, far greater
      than any other Hellenic power.
    </p>
<p>
      146. When they had thus resolved, they reconciled their enmities and then
      sent first three men as spies to Asia. These having come to Sardis and
      having got knowledge about the king's army, were discovered, and after
      having been examined by the generals of the land-army were being led off
      to die. For these men, I say, death had been determined; but Xerxes, being
      informed of this, found fault with the decision of the generals and sent
      some of the spearmen of his guard, enjoining them, if they should find the
      spies yet alive, to bring them to his presence. So having found them yet
      surviving they brought them into the presence of the king; and upon that
      Xerxes, being informed for what purpose they had come, commanded the
      spearmen to lead them round and to show them the whole army both foot and
      horse, and when they should have had their fill of looking at these
      things, to let them go unhurt to whatsoever land they desired.
    </p>
<p>
      147. Such was the command which he gave, adding at the same time this
      saying, namely that if the spies had been put to death, the Hellenes would
      not have been informed beforehand of his power, how far beyond description
      it was; while on the other hand by putting to death three men they would
      not very greatly have damaged the enemy; but when these returned back to
      Hellas, he thought it likely that the Hellenes, hearing of his power,
      would deliver up their freedom to him themselves, before the expedition
      took place which was being set in motion; and thus there would be no need
      for them to have the labour of marching an army against them. This opinion
      of his is like his manner of thinking at other times; <a href="#link7note-133" id="link7noteref-133" class="pginternal">133</a>
      for when Xerxes was in Abydos, he saw vessels which carried corn from the
      Pontus sailing out through the Hellespont on their way to Egina and the
      Peloponnese. Those then who sat by his side, being informed that the ships
      belonged to the enemy, were prepared to capture them, and were looking to
      the king to see when he would give the word; but Xerxes asked about them
      whither the men were sailing, and they replied: "Master, to thy foes,
      conveying to them corn": he then made answer and said: "Are we not also
      sailing to the same place as these men, furnished with corn as well as
      with other things necessary? How then do these wrong us, since they are
      conveying provisions for our use?"
    </p>
<p>
      148. The spies then, having thus looked at everything and after that
      having been dismissed, returned back to Europe: and meanwhile those of the
      Hellenes who had sworn alliance against the Persian, after the sending
      forth of the spies proceeded to send envoys next to Argos. Now the Argives
      report that the matters concerning themselves took place as follows:—They
      were informed, they say, at the very first of the movement which was being
      set on foot by the Barbarian against Hellas; and having been informed of
      this and perceiving that the Hellenes would endeavour to get their
      alliance against the Persians, they had sent messengers to inquire of the
      god at Delphi, and to ask how they should act in order that it might be
      best for themselves: because lately there had been slain of them six
      thousand men by the Lacedemonians and by Cleomenes the son of
      Anaxandrides, <a href="#link7note-134" id="link7noteref-134" class="pginternal">134</a> and this in fact was the reason that they
      were sending to inquire: and when they inquired, the Pythian prophetess
      made answer to them as follows:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Thou to thy neighbours a foe, by the gods immortal beloved,
  Keep thou thy spear <a href="#link7note-135" id="link7noteref-135" class="pginternal">135</a> within bounds, and sit well-guarded behind it:
  Guard well the head, and the head shall preserve the limbs and the body."
</pre>
<p>
      Thus, they say, the Pythian prophetess had replied to them before this;
      and afterwards when the messengers of the Hellenes came, as I said, to
      Argos, they entered the Council-chamber and spoke that which had been
      enjoined to them; and to that which was said the Council replied that the
      Argives were ready to do as they were requested, on condition that they
      got peace made with the Lacedemonians for thirty years and that they had
      half the leadership of the whole confederacy: and yet by strict right
      (they said) the whole leadership fell to their share, but nevertheless it
      was sufficient for them to have half.
    </p>
<p>
      149. Thus they report that the Council made answer, although the oracle
      forbade them to make the alliance with the Hellenes; and they were
      anxious, they say, that a truce from hostilities for thirty years should
      be made, although they feared the oracle, in order, as they allege, that
      their sons might grow to manhood in these years; whereas if a truce did
      not exist, they had fear that, supposing another disaster should come upon
      them in fighting against the Persian in addition to that which had
      befallen them already, they might be for all future time subject to the
      Lacedemonians. To that which was spoken by the Council those of the envoys
      who were of Sparta replied, that as to the truce they would refer the
      matter to their public assembly, <a href="#link7note-136" id="link7noteref-136" class="pginternal">136</a> but as to the
      leadership they had themselves been commissioned to make reply, and did in
      fact say this, namely that they had two kings, while the Argives had one;
      and it was not possible to remove either of the two who were of Sparta
      from the leadership, but there was nothing to prevent the Argive king from
      having an equal vote with each of their two. Then, say the Argives, they
      could not endure the grasping selfishness of the Spartans, but chose to be
      ruled by the Barbarians rather than to yield at all to the Lacedemonians;
      and they gave notice to the envoys to depart out of the territory of the
      Argives before sunset, or, if not, they would be dealt with as enemies.
    </p>
<p>
      150. The Argives themselves report so much about these matters: but there
      is another story reported in Hellas to the effect that Xerxes sent a
      herald to Argos before he set forth to make an expedition against Hellas,
      and this herald, they say, when he had come, spoke as follows: "Men of
      Argos, king Xerxes says to you these things:—We hold that Perses,
      from whom we are descended, was the son of Perseus, the son of Danae, and
      was born of the daughter of Kepheus, Andromeda; and according to this it
      would seem that we are descended from you. It is not fitting then that we
      should go forth on an expedition against those from whom we trace our
      descent, nor that ye should set yourselves in opposition to us by
      rendering assistance to others; but it is fitting that ye keep still and
      remain by yourselves: for if things happen according to my mind, I shall
      not esteem any people to be of greater consequence than you." Having heard
      this the Argives, it is said, considered it a great matter; and therefore
      at first they made no offer of help nor did they ask for any share; but
      afterwards, when the Hellenes tried to get them on their side, then, since
      they knew well that the Lacedemonians would not give them a share in the
      command, they asked for this merely in order that they might have a
      pretext for remaining still.
    </p>
<p>
      151. Also some of the Hellenes report that the following event, in
      agreement with this account, came to pass many years after these things:—there
      happened, they say, to be in Susa the city of Memnon <a href="#link7note-137" id="link7noteref-137" class="pginternal">137</a>
      envoys of the Athenians come about some other matter, namely Callias the
      son of Hipponicos and the others who went up with him; and the Argives at
      that very time had also sent envoys to Susa, and these asked Artoxerxes
      the son of Xerxes, whether the friendship which they had formed with
      Xerxes still remained unbroken, if they themselves desired to maintain it,
      <a href="#link7note-138" id="link7noteref-138" class="pginternal">138</a>
      or whether they were esteemed by him to be enemies; and king Artoxerxes
      said that it most certainly remained unbroken, and that there was no city
      which he considered to be more his friend than Argos.
    </p>
<p>
      152. Now whether Xerxes did indeed send a herald to Argos saying that
      which has been reported, and whether envoys of the Argives who had gone up
      to Susa inquired of Artoxerxes concerning friendship, I am not able to say
      for certain; nor do I declare any opinion about the matters in question
      other than that which the Argives themselves report: but I know this much,
      that if all the nations of men should bring together into one place the
      evils which they have suffered themselves, desiring to make exchange with
      their neighbours, each people of them, when they had examined closely the
      evils suffered by their fellows, would gladly carry away back with them
      those which they had brought. <a href="#link7note-139" id="link7noteref-139" class="pginternal">139</a> Thus it is not the
      Argives who have acted most basely of all. I however am bound to report
      that which is reported, though I am not bound altogether to believe it;
      and let this saying be considered to hold good as regards every narrative
      in the history: for I must add that this also is reported, namely that the
      Argives were actually those who invited the Persian to invade Hellas,
      because their war with the Lacedemonians had had an evil issue, being
      willing to suffer anything whatever rather than the trouble which was then
      upon them.
    </p>
<p>
      153. That which concerns the Argives has now been said: and meanwhile
      envoys had come to Sicily from the allies, to confer with Gelon, among
      whom was also Syagros from the Lacedemonians. Now the ancestor of this
      Gelon, he who was at Gela as a settler, <a href="#link7note-140" id="link7noteref-140" class="pginternal">140</a> was a native of the
      island of Telos, which lies off Triopion; and when Gela was founded by the
      Lindians of Rhodes and by Antiphemos, he was not left behind. Then in
      course of time his descendants became and continued to be priests of the
      mysteries of the Earth goddesses, <a href="#link7note-141" id="link7noteref-141" class="pginternal">141</a> an office which was
      acquired by Telines one of their ancestors in the following manner:—certain
      of the men of Gela, being worsted in a party struggle, had fled to
      Mactorion, the city which stands above Gela: these men Telines brought
      back to Gela from exile with no force of men but only with the sacred
      rites of these goddesses; but from whom he received them, or whether he
      obtained them for himself, <a href="#link7note-142" id="link7noteref-142" class="pginternal">142</a> this I am not able to say; trusting in these
      however, he brought the men back from exile, on the condition that his
      descendants should be priests of the mysteries of the goddesses. To me it
      has caused wonder also that Telines should have been able to perform so
      great a deed, considering that which I am told; for such deeds, I think,
      are not apt to proceed from every man, but from one who has a brave spirit
      and manly vigour, whereas Telines is said by the dwellers in Sicily to
      have been on the contrary a man of effeminate character and rather poor
      spirit.
    </p>
<p>
      154. He then had thus obtained the privilege of which I speak: and when
      Cleander the son of Pantares brought his life to an end, having been
      despot of Gela for seven years and being killed at last by Sabyllos a man
      of Gela, then Hippocrates succeeded to the monarchy, who was brother of
      Cleander. And while Hippocrates was despot, Gelon, who was a descendant of
      Telines the priest of the mysteries, was spearman of the guard <a href="#link7note-143" id="link7noteref-143" class="pginternal">143</a>
      to Hippocrates with many others and among them Ainesidemos the son of
      Pataicos. Then after no long time he was appointed by reason of valour to
      be commander of the whole cavalry; for when Hippocrates besieged
      successively the cities of Callipolis, Naxos, Zancle, Leontini, and also
      Syracuse and many towns of the Barbarians, in these wars Gelon showed
      himself a most brilliant warrior; and of the cities which I just now
      mentioned, not one except Syracuse escaped being reduced to subjection by
      Hippocrates: the Syracusans however, after they had been defeated in
      battle at the river Eloros, were rescued by the Corinthians and
      Corcyreans; these rescued them and brought the quarrel to a settlement on
      this condition, namely that the Syracusans should deliver up Camarina to
      Hippocrates. Now Camarina used in ancient time to belong to the men of
      Syracuse.
    </p>
<p>
      155. Then when it was the fate of Hippocrates also, after having been
      despot for the same number of years as his brother Cleander, to be killed
      at the city of Hybla, whither he had gone on an expedition against the
      Sikelians, then Gelon made a pretence of helping the sons of Hippocrates,
      Eucleides and Cleander, when the citizens were no longer willing to
      submit; but actually, when he had been victorious in a battle over the men
      of Gela, he robbed the sons of Hippocrates of the power and was ruler
      himself. After this stroke of fortune Gelon restored those of the
      Syracusans who were called "land-holders," <a href="#link7note-144" id="link7noteref-144" class="pginternal">144</a> after they had been
      driven into exile by the common people and by their own slaves, who were
      called Kyllyrians, <a href="#link7note-145" id="link7noteref-145" class="pginternal">145</a> these, I say, he restored from the city of
      Casmene to Syracuse, and so got possession of this last city also, for the
      common people of Syracuse, when Gelon came against them, delivered up to
      him their city and themselves.
    </p>
<p>
      156. So after he had received Syracuse into his power, he made less
      account of Gela, of which he was ruler also in addition, and he gave it in
      charge to Hieron his brother, while he proceeded to strengthen Syracuse.
      So forthwith that city rose and shot up to prosperity; for in the first
      place he brought all those of Camarina to Syracuse and made them citizens,
      and razed to the ground the city of Camarina; then secondly he did the
      same to more than half of the men of Gela, as he had done to those of
      Camarina: and as regards the Megarians of Sicily, when they were besieged
      and had surrendered by capitulation, the well-to-do men <a href="#link7note-146" id="link7noteref-146" class="pginternal">146</a>
      of them, though they had stirred up war with him and expected to be put to
      death for this reason, he brought to Syracuse and made them citizens, but
      the common people of the Megarians, who had no share in the guilt of this
      war and did not expect that they would suffer any evil, these also he
      brought to Syracuse and sold them as slaves to be carried away from
      Sicily: and the same thing he did moreover to the men of Euboia in Sicily,
      making a distinction between them: and he dealt thus with these two cities
      because he thought that a body of commons was a most unpleasant element in
      the State.
    </p>
<p>
      157. In the manner then which has been described Gelon had become a
      powerful despot; and at this time when the envoys of the Hellenes had
      arrived at Syracuse, they came to speech with him and said as follows:
      "The Lacedemonians and their allies sent us to get thee to be on our side
      against the Barbarian; for we suppose that thou art certainly informed of
      him who is about to invade Hellas, namely that a Persian is designing to
      bridge over the Hellespont, and to make an expedition against Hellas,
      leading against us out of Asia all the armies of the East, under colour of
      marching upon Athens, but in fact meaning to bring all Hellas to
      subjection under him. Do thou therefore, seeing that <a href="#link7note-147" id="link7noteref-147" class="pginternal">147</a>
      thou hast attained to a great power and hast no small portion of Hellas
      for thy share, being the ruler of Sicily, come to the assistance of those
      who are endeavouring to free Hellas, and join in making her free; for if
      all Hellas be gathered together in one, it forms a great body, and we are
      made a match in fight for those who are coming against us; but if some of
      us go over to the enemy and others are not willing to help, and the sound
      portion of Hellas is consequently small, there is at once in this a danger
      that all Hellas may fall to ruin. For do not thou hope that if the Persian
      shall overcome us in battle he will not come to thee, but guard thyself
      against this beforehand; for in coming to our assistance thou art helping
      thyself; and the matter which is wisely planned has for the most part a
      good issue afterwards."
    </p>
<p>
      158. The envoys spoke thus; and Gelon was very vehement with them,
      speaking to them as follows: "Hellenes, a selfish speech is this, with
      which ye have ventured to come and invite me to be your ally against the
      Barbarian; whereas ye yourselves, when I in former time requested of you
      to join with me in fighting against an army of Barbarians, contention
      having arisen between me and the Carthaginians, and when I charged you to
      exact vengeance of the men of Egesta for the death of Dorieos the son of
      Anaxandrides, <a href="#link7note-148" id="link7noteref-148" class="pginternal">148</a> while at the same time I offered to help in
      setting free the trading-places, from which great advantages and gains
      have been reaped by you,—ye, I say, then neither for my own sake
      came to my assistance, nor in order to exact vengeance for the death of
      Dorieos; and, so far as ye are concerned, all these parts are even now
      under the rule of Barbarians. But since it turned out well for us and came
      to a better issue, now that the war has come round and reached you, there
      has at last arisen in your minds a recollection of Gelon. However, though
      I have met with contempt at your hands, I will not act like you; but I am
      prepared to come to your assistance, supplying two hundred triremes and
      twenty thousand hoplites, with two thousand horsemen, two thousand bowmen,
      two thousand slingers and two thousand light-armed men to run beside the
      horsemen; and moreover I will undertake to supply corn for the whole army
      of the Hellenes, until we have finished the war. These things I engage to
      supply on this condition, namely that I shall be commander and leader of
      the Hellenes against the Barbarian; but on any other condition I will
      neither come myself nor will I send others."
    </p>
<p>
      159. Hearing this Syagros could not contain himself but spoke these words:
      "Deeply, I trow, would Agamemnon son of Pelops lament, <a href="#link7note-149" id="link7noteref-149" class="pginternal">149</a>
      if he heard that the Spartans had had the leadership taken away from them
      by Gelon and by the Syracusans. Nay, but make thou no further mention of
      this condition, namely that we should deliver the leadership to thee; but
      if thou art desirous to come to the assistance of Hellas, know that thou
      wilt be under the command of the Lacedemonians; and if thou dost indeed
      claim not to be under command, come not thou to our help at all."
    </p>
<p>
      160. To this Gelon, seeing that the speech of Syagros was adverse, set
      forth to them his last proposal thus: "Stranger from Sparta, reproaches
      sinking into the heart of a man are wont to rouse his spirit in anger
      against them; thou however, though thou hast uttered insults against me in
      thy speech, wilt not bring me to show myself unseemly in my reply. But
      whereas ye so strongly lay claim to the leadership, it were fitting that I
      should lay claim to it more than ye, seeing that I am the leader of an
      army many times as large and of ships many more. Since however this
      condition is so distasteful to you, <a href="#link7note-150" id="link7noteref-150" class="pginternal">150</a> we will recede
      somewhat from our former proposal. Suppose that ye should be leaders of
      the land-army and I of the fleet; or if it pleases you to lead the
      sea-forces, I am willing to be leader of those on land; and either ye must
      be contented with these terms or go away without the alliance which I have
      to give."
    </p>
<p>
      161. Gelon, I say, made these offers, and the envoy of the Athenians,
      answering before that of the Lacedemonians, replied to him as follows: "O
      king of the Syracusans, it was not of a leader that Hellas was in want
      when it sent us to thee, but of an army. Thou however dost not set before
      us the hope that thou wilt send an army, except thou have the leadership
      of Hellas; and thou art striving how thou mayest become commander of the
      armies of Hellas. So long then as it was thy demand to be leader of the
      whole army of the Hellenes, it was sufficient for us Athenians to keep
      silence, knowing that the Lacedemonian would be able to make defence even
      for us both; but now, since being repulsed from the demand for the whole
      thou art requesting to be commander of the naval force, we tell that thus
      it is:—not even if the Lacedemonian shall permit thee to be
      commander of it, will we permit thee; for this at least is our own, if the
      Lacedemonians do not themselves desire to have it. With these, if they
      desire to be the leaders, we do not contend; but none others beside
      ourselves shall we permit to be in command of the ships: for then to no
      purpose should we be possessors of a sea-force larger than any other which
      belongs to the Hellenes, if, being Athenians, we should yield the
      leadership to Syracusans, we who boast of a race which is the most ancient
      of all and who are of all the Hellenes the only people who have not
      changed from one land to another; to whom also belonged a man whom Homer
      the Epic poet said was the best of all who came to Ilion in drawing up an
      army and setting it in array. <a href="#link7note-151" id="link7noteref-151" class="pginternal">151</a> Thus we are not
      justly to be reproached if we say these things."
    </p>
<p>
      162. To this Gelon made answer thus: "Stranger of Athens, it would seem
      that ye have the commanders, but that ye will not have the men to be
      commanded. Since then ye will not at all give way, but desire to have the
      whole, it were well that ye should depart home as quickly as possible and
      report to the Hellenes that the spring has been taken out of their year."
      Now this is the meaning of the saying:—evidently the spring is the
      noblest part of the year; and so he meant to say that his army was the
      noblest part of the army of the Hellenes: for Hellas therefore, deprived
      of his alliance, it was, he said, as if the spring had been taken out of
      the year. <a href="#link7note-152" id="link7noteref-152" class="pginternal">152</a>
</p>
<p>
      163. The envoys of the Hellenes, having thus had conference with Gelon,
      sailed away; and Gelon upon this, fearing on the one hand about the
      Hellenes, lest they should not be able to overcome the Barbarian, and on
      the other hand considering it monstrous and not to be endured that he
      should come to Peloponnesus and be under the command of the Lacedemonians,
      seeing that he was despot of Sicily, gave up the thought of this way and
      followed another: for so soon as he was informed that the Persian had
      crossed over the Hellespont, he sent Cadmos the son of Skythes, a man of
      Cos, with three fifty-oared galleys to Delphi, bearing large sums of money
      and friendly proposals, to wait there and see how the battle would fall
      out: and if the Barbarian should be victorious, he was to give him the
      money and also to offer him earth and water from those over whom Gelon had
      rule; but if the Hellenes should be victorious, he was bidden to bring it
      back.
    </p>
<p>
      164. Now this Cadmos before these events, having received from his father
      in a prosperous state the government <a href="#link7note-153" id="link7noteref-153" class="pginternal">153</a> of the people of
      Cos, had voluntarily and with no danger threatening, but moved merely by
      uprightness of nature, placed the government in the hands of the people of
      Cos <a href="#link7note-154" id="link7noteref-154" class="pginternal">154</a>
      and had departed to Sicily, where he took from <a href="#link7note-155" id="link7noteref-155" class="pginternal">155</a> the Samians and
      newly colonised the city of Zancle, which had changed its name to Messene.
      This same Cadmos, having come thither in such manner as I have said, Gelon
      was now sending, having selected him on account of the integrity which in
      other matters he had himself found to be in him; and this man, in addition
      to the other upright acts which had been done by him, left also this to be
      remembered, which was not the least of them: for having got into his hands
      that great sum of money which Gelon entrusted to his charge, though he
      might have taken possession of it himself he did not choose to do so; but
      when the Hellenes had got the better in the sea-fight and Xerxes had
      marched away and departed, he also returned to Sicily bringing back with
      him the whole sum of money.
    </p>
<p>
      165. The story which here follows is also reported by those who dwell in
      Sicily, namely that, even though he was to be under the command of the
      Lacedemonians, Gelon would have come to the assistance of the Hellenes,
      but that Terillos, the son of Crinippos and despot of Himera, having been
      driven out of Himera by Theron the son of Ainesidemos <a href="#link7note-156" id="link7noteref-156" class="pginternal">156</a>
      the ruler of the Agrigentines, was just at this very time bringing in an
      army of Phenicians, Libyans, Iberians, Ligurians, Elisycans, Sardinians
      and Corsicans, to the number of thirty myriads, <a href="#link7note-157" id="link7noteref-157" class="pginternal">157</a> with Amilcas the son
      of Annon king of the Carthaginians as their commander, whom Terillos had
      persuaded partly by reason of his own guest-friendship, and especially by
      the zealous assistance of Anaxilaos the son of Cretines, who was despot of
      Rhegion, and who to help his father-in-law endeavoured to bring in Amilcas
      to Sicily, and had given him his sons as hostages; for Anaxilaos was
      married to the daughter of Terillos, whose name was Kydippe. Thus it was,
      they say, that Gelon was not able to come to the assistance of the
      Hellenes, and sent therefore the money to Delphi.
    </p>
<p>
      166. In addition to this they report also that, as it happened, Gelon and
      Theron were victorious over Amilcas the Carthaginian on the very same day
      when the Hellenes were victorious at Salamis over the Persian. And this
      Amilcas, who was a Carthaginian on the father's side but on the mother's
      Syracusan, and who had become king of the Carthaginians by merit, when the
      engagement took place and he was being worsted in the battle, disappeared,
      as I am informed; for neither alive nor dead did he appear again anywhere
      upon the earth, though Gelon used all diligence in the search for him.
    </p>
<p>
      167. Moreover there is also this story reported by the Carthaginians
      themselves, who therein relate that which is probable in itself, namely
      that while the Barbarians fought with the Hellenes in Sicily from the
      early morning till late in the afternoon (for to such a length the combat
      is said to have been protracted), during this time Amilcas was remaining
      in the camp and was making sacrifices to get good omens of success,
      offering whole bodies of victims upon a great pyre: and when he saw that
      there was a rout of his own army, he being then, as it chanced, in the act
      of pouring a libation over the victims, threw himself into the fire, and
      thus he was burnt up and disappeared. Amilcas then having disappeared,
      whether it was in such a manner as this, as it is reported by the
      Phenicians, or in some other way, <a href="#link7note-159" id="link7noteref-159" class="pginternal">159</a> the Carthaginians
      both offer sacrifices to him now, and also they made memorials of him then
      in all the cities of their colonies, and the greatest in Carthage itself.
    </p>
<p>
      168. So far of the affairs of Sicily: and as for the Corcyreans, they made
      answer to the envoys as follows, afterwards acting as I shall tell: for
      the same men who had gone to Sicily endeavoured also to obtain the help of
      these, saying the same things which they said to Gelon; and the Corcyreans
      at the time engaged to send a force and to help in the defence, declaring
      that they must not permit Hellas to be ruined without an effort on their
      part, for if it should suffer disaster, they would be reduced to
      subjection from the very first day; but they must give assistance so far
      as lay in their power. Thus speciously they made reply; but when the time
      came to send help, they manned sixty ships, having other intentions in
      their minds, and after making much difficulty they put out to sea and
      reached Peloponnese; and then near Pylos and Tainaron in the land of the
      Lacedemonians they kept their ships at anchor, waiting, as Gelon did, to
      see how the war would turn out: for they did not expect that the Hellenes
      would overcome, but thought that the Persian would gain the victory over
      them with ease and be ruler of all Hellas. Accordingly they were acting of
      set purpose, in order that they might be able to say to the Persian some
      such words as these: "O king, when the Hellenes endeavoured to obtain our
      help for this war, we, who have a power which is not the smallest of all,
      and could have supplied a contingent of ships in number not the smallest,
      but after the Athenians the largest, did not choose to oppose thee or to
      do anything which was not to thy mind." By speaking thus they hoped that
      they would obtain some advantage over the rest, and so it would have
      happened, as I am of opinion: while they had for the Hellenes an excuse
      ready made, that namely of which they actually made use: for when the
      Hellenes reproached them because they did not come to help, they said that
      they had manned sixty triremes, but had not been able to get past Malea
      owing to the Etesian Winds; therefore it was that they had not come to
      Salamis, nor was it by any want of courage on their part that they had
      been left of the sea-fight.
    </p>
<p>
      169. These then evaded the request of the Hellenes thus: but the Cretans,
      when those of the Hellenes who had been appointed to deal with these
      endeavoured to obtain their help, did thus, that is to say, they joined
      together and sent men to inquire of the god at Delphi whether it would be
      better for them if they gave assistance to Hellas: and the Pythian
      prophetess answered: "Ye fools, do ye think those woes too few, <a href="#link7note-160" id="link7noteref-160" class="pginternal">160</a>
      which Minos sent upon you in his wrath, <a href="#link7note-161" id="link7noteref-161" class="pginternal">161</a> because of the
      assistance that ye gave to Menelaos? seeing that, whereas they did not
      join with you in taking vengeance for his death in Camicos, ye
      nevertheless joined with them in taking vengeance for the woman who by a
      Barbarian was carried off from Sparta." When the Cretans heard this answer
      reported, they abstained from the giving of assistance.
    </p>
<p>
      170. For the story goes that Minos, having come to Sicania, which is now
      called Sicily, in search of Daidalos, died there by a violent death; and
      after a time the Cretans, urged thereto by a god, all except the men of
      Polichne and Praisos, came with a great armament to Sicania and besieged
      for seven years the city of Camicos, which in my time was occupied by the
      Agrigentines; and at last not being able either to capture it or to remain
      before it, because they were hard pressed by famine, they departed and
      went away. And when, as they sailed, they came to be off the coast of
      Iapygia, a great storm seized them and cast them away upon the coast; and
      their vessels being dashed to pieces, they, since they saw no longer any
      way of coming to Crete, founded there the city of Hyria; and there they
      stayed and were changed so that they became instead of Cretans, Messapians
      of Iapygia, and instead of islanders, dwellers on the mainland: then from
      the city of Hyria they founded those other settlements which the
      Tarentines long afterwards endeavoured to destroy and suffer great
      disaster in that enterprise, so that this in fact proved to be the
      greatest slaughter of Hellenes that is known to us, and not only of the
      Tarentines themselves but of those citizens of Rhegion who were compelled
      by Mikythos the son of Choiros to go to the assistance of the Tarentines,
      and of whom there were slain in this manner three thousand men: of the
      Tarentines themselves however, who were slain there, there was no
      numbering made. This Mikythos, who was a servant of Anaxilaos, had been
      left by him in charge of Rhegion; and he it was who after being driven out
      of Rhegion took up his abode at Tegea of the Arcadians and dedicated those
      many statues at Olympia.
    </p>
<p>
      171. This of the men of Rhegion and of the Tarentines has been an episode
      <a href="#link7note-162" id="link7noteref-162" class="pginternal">162</a>
      in my narrative: in Crete however, as the men of Praisos report, after it
      had been thus stripped of inhabitants, settlements were made by various
      nations, but especially by Hellenes; and in the next generation but one
      after the death of Minos came the Trojan war, in which the Cretans proved
      not the most contemptible of those who came to assist Menelaos. Then after
      this, when they had returned home from Troy, famine and pestilence came
      upon both the men and their cattle, until at last Crete was stripped of
      its inhabitants for the second time, and a third population of Cretans now
      occupy it together with those which were left of the former inhabitants.
      The Pythian prophetess, I say, by calling these things to their minds
      stopped them from giving assistance to the Hellenes, though they desired
      to do so.
    </p>
<p>
      172. As for the Thessalians, they at first had taken the side of the
      Persians against their will, and they gave proof that they were not
      pleased by that which the Aleuadai were designing; for so soon as they
      heard that the Persian was about to cross over into Europe, they sent
      envoys to the Isthmus: now at the Isthmus were assembled representatives
      of Hellas chosen by the cities which had the better mind about Hellas:
      having come then to these, the envoys of the Thessalians said: "Hellenes,
      ye must guard the pass by Olympos, in order that both Thessaly and the
      whole of Hellas may be sheltered from the war. We are prepared to join
      with you in guarding it, but ye must send a large force as well as we; for
      if ye shall not send, be assured that we shall make agreement with the
      Persian; since it is not right that we, standing as outposts so far in
      advance of the rest of Hellas, should perish alone in your defence: and
      not being willing <a href="#link7note-163" id="link7noteref-163" class="pginternal">163</a> to come to our help, ye cannot apply to us
      any force to compel inability; <a href="#link7note-164" id="link7noteref-164" class="pginternal">164</a> but we shall
      endeavour to devise some means of safety for ourselves."
    </p>
<p>
      173. Thus spoke the Thessalians; and the Hellenes upon this resolved to
      send to Thessaly by sea an army of men on foot to guard the pass: and when
      the army was assembled it set sail through Euripos, and having come to
      Alos in the Achaian land, it disembarked there and marched into Thessaly
      leaving the ships behind at Alos, and arrived at Tempe, the pass which
      leads from lower Macedonia into Thessaly by the river Peneios, going
      between the mountains of Olympos and Ossa. There the Hellenes encamped,
      being assembled to the number of about ten thousand hoplites, and to them
      was added the cavalry of the Thessalians; and the commander of the
      Lacedemonians was Euainetos the son of Carenos, who had been chosen from
      the polemarchs, <a href="#link7note-165" id="link7noteref-165" class="pginternal">165</a> not being of the royal house, and of the
      Athenians Themistocles the son of Neocles. They remained however but few
      days here, for envoys came from Alexander the son of Amyntas the
      Macedonian, who advised them to depart thence and not to remain in the
      pass and be trodden under foot by the invading host, signifying to them at
      the same time both the great numbers of the army and the ships which they
      had. When these gave them this counsel, they followed the advice, for they
      thought that the counsel was good, and the Macedonian was evidently
      well-disposed towards them. Also, as I think, it was fear that persuaded
      them to it, when they were informed that there was another pass besides
      this to the Thessalian land by upper Macedonia through the Perraibians and
      by the city of Gonnos, the way by which the army of Xerxes did in fact
      make its entrance. So the Hellenes went down to their ships again and made
      their way back to the Isthmus.
    </p>
<p>
      174. Such was the expedition to Thessaly, which took place when the king
      was about to cross over from Asia to Europe and was already at Abydos. So
      the Thessalians, being stripped of allies, upon this took the side of the
      Medes with a good will and no longer half-heartedly, so that in the course
      of events they proved very serviceable to the king.
    </p>
<p>
      175. When the Hellenes had returned to the Isthmus, they deliberated,
      having regard to that which had been said by Alexander, where and in what
      regions they should set the war on foot: and the opinion which prevailed
      was to guard the pass at Thermopylai; for it was seen to be narrower than
      that leading into Thessaly, and at the same time it was single, <a href="#link7note-166" id="link7noteref-166" class="pginternal">166</a>
      and nearer also to their own land; and as for the path by means of which
      were taken those of the Hellenes who were taken by the enemy at
      Thermopylai, they did not even know of its existence until they were
      informed by the people of Trachis after they had come to Thermopylai. This
      pass then they resolved to guard, and not permit the Barbarian to go by
      into Hellas; and they resolved that the fleet should sail to Artemision in
      the territory of Histiaia: for these points are near to one another, so
      that each division of their forces could have information of what was
      happening to the other. And the places are so situated as I shall
      describe.
    </p>
<p>
      176. As to Artemision first, coming out of the Thracian Sea the space is
      contracted from great width to that narrow channel which lies between the
      island of Skiathos and the mainland of Magnesia; and after the strait
      there follows at once in Euboea the sea-beach called Artemision, upon
      which there is a temple of Artemis. Then secondly the passage into Hellas
      by Trechis is, where it is narrowest, but fifty feet wide: it is not here
      however that the narrowest part of this whole region lies, but in front of
      Thermopylai and also behind it, consisting of a single wheel-track only <a href="#link7note-167" id="link7noteref-167" class="pginternal">167</a>
      both by Alpenoi, which lies behind Thermopylai and again by the river
      Phoinix near the town of Anthela there is no space but a single
      wheel-track only: and on the West of Thermopylai there is a mountain which
      is impassable and precipitous, rising up to a great height and extending
      towards the range of Oite, while on the East of the road the sea with
      swampy pools succeeds at once. In this passage there are hot springs,
      which the natives of the place call the "Pots," <a href="#link7note-168" id="link7noteref-168" class="pginternal">168</a> and an altar of
      Heracles is set up near them. Moreover a wall had once been built at this
      pass, and in old times there was a gate set in it; which wall was built by
      the Phokians, who were struck with fear because the Thessalians had come
      from the land of the Thesprotians to settle in the Aiolian land, the same
      which they now possess. Since then the Thessalians, as they supposed, were
      attempting to subdue them, the Phokians guarded themselves against this
      beforehand; and at that time they let the water of the hot springs run
      over the passage, that the place might be converted into a ravine, and
      devised every means that the Thessalians might not make invasion of their
      land. Now the ancient wall had been built long before, and the greater
      part of it was by that time in ruins from lapse of time; the Hellenes
      however resolved to set it up again, and at this spot to repel the
      Barbarian from Hellas: and very near the road there is a village called
      Alpenoi, from which the Hellenes counted on getting supplies.
    </p>
<p>
      177. These places then the Hellenes perceived to be such as their purpose
      required; for they considered everything beforehand and calculated that
      the Barbarians would not be able to take advantage either of superior
      numbers or of cavalry, and therefore they resolved here to receive the
      invader of Hellas: and when they were informed that the Persian was in
      Pieria, they broke up from the Isthmus and set forth for the campaign,
      some going to Thermopylai by land, and others making for Artemision by
      sea.
    </p>
<p>
      178. The Hellenes, I say, were coming to the rescue with speed, having
      been appointed to their several places: and meanwhile the men of Delphi
      consulted the Oracle of the god on behalf of themselves and on behalf of
      Hellas, being struck with dread; and a reply was given them that they
      should pray to the Winds, for these would be powerful helpers of Hellas in
      fight. So the Delphians, having accepted the oracle, first reported the
      answer which had been given them to those of the Hellenes who desired to
      be free; and having reported this to them at a time when they were in
      great dread of the Barbarian, they laid up for themselves an immortal
      store of gratitude: then after this the men of Delphi established an altar
      for the Winds in Thuia, where is the sacred enclosure of Thuia the
      daughter of Kephisos, after whom moreover this place has its name; and
      also they approached them with sacrifices.
    </p>
<p>
      179. The Delphians then according to the oracle even to this day make
      propitiary offerings to the Winds: and meanwhile the fleet of Xerxes
      setting forth from the city of Therma had passed over with ten of its
      ships, which were those that sailed best, straight towards Skiathos, where
      three Hellenic ships, a Troizenian, an Eginetan and an Athenian, were
      keeping watch in advance. When the crews of these caught sight of the
      ships of the Barbarians, they set off to make their escape:
    </p>
<p>
      180, and the ship of Troizen, of which Prexinos was in command, was
      pursued and captured at once by the Barbarians; who upon that took the man
      who was most distinguished by beauty among the fighting-men on board of
      her, <a href="#link7note-169" id="link7noteref-169" class="pginternal">169</a>
      and cut his throat at the prow of the ship, making a good omen for
      themselves of the first of the Hellenes whom they had captured who was
      pre-eminent for beauty. The name of this man who was sacrificed was Leon,
      and perhaps he had also his name to thank in some degree for what befell
      him.
    </p>
<p>
      181. The ship of Egina however, of which Asonides was master, even gave
      them some trouble to capture it, seeing that Pytheas the son of Ischenoös
      served as a fighting-man on board of her, who proved himself a most
      valiant man on this day; for when the ship was being taken, he held out
      fighting until he was hacked all to pieces: and as when he had fallen he
      did not die, but had still breath in him, the Persians who served as
      fighting-men on board the ships, because of his valour used all diligence
      to save his life, both applying unguents of myrrh to heal his wounds and
      also wrapping him up in bands of the finest linen; and when they came back
      to their own main body, they showed him to all the army, making a marvel
      of him and giving him good treatment; but the rest whom they had taken in
      this ship they treated as slaves.
    </p>
<p>
      182. Two of the three ships, I say, were captured thus; but the third, of
      which Phormos an Athenian was master, ran ashore in its flight at the
      mouth of the river Peneios; and the Barbarians got possession of the
      vessel but not of the crew; for so soon as the Athenians had run the ship
      ashore, they leapt out of her, and passing through Thessaly made their way
      to Athens.
    </p>
<p>
      183. Of these things the Hellenes who were stationed at Artemision were
      informed by fire-signals from Skiathos; and being informed of them and
      being struck with fear, they removed their place of anchorage from
      Atermision to Chalkis, intending to guard the Euripos, but leaving at the
      same time watchers by day <a href="#link7note-170" id="link7noteref-170" class="pginternal">170</a> on the heights of Euboea. Of the ten ships
      of the Barbarians three sailed up to the reef called Myrmex, <a href="#link7note-171" id="link7noteref-171" class="pginternal">171</a>
      which lies between Skiathos and Magnesia; and when the Barbarians had
      there erected a stone pillar, which for that purpose they brought to the
      reef, they set forth with their main body <a href="#link7note-172" id="link7noteref-172" class="pginternal">172</a> from Therma, the
      difficulties of the passage having now been cleared away, and sailed
      thither with all their ships, having let eleven days go by since the king
      set forth on his march from Therma. Now of this reef lying exactly in the
      middle of the fairway they were informed by Pammon of Skyros. Sailing then
      throughout the day the Barbarians accomplished the voyage to Sepias in
      Magnesia and to the sea-beach which is between the city of Casthanaia and
      the headland of Sepias.
    </p>
<p>
      184. So far as this place and so far as Thermopylai the army was exempt
      from calamity; and the number was then still, as I find by computation,
      this:—Of the ships which came from Asia, which were one thousand two
      hundred and seven, the original number of the crews supplied by the
      several nations I find to have been twenty-four myriads and also in
      addition to them one thousand four hundred, <a href="#link7note-173" id="link7noteref-173" class="pginternal">173</a> if one reckons at
      the rate of two hundred men to each ship: and on board of each of these
      ships there served as fighting-men, <a href="#link7note-174" id="link7noteref-174" class="pginternal">174</a> besides the
      fighting-men belonging to its own nation in each case, thirty men who were
      Persians, Medes, or Sacans; and this amounts to three myriads six thousand
      two hundred and ten <a href="#link7note-175" id="link7noteref-175" class="pginternal">175</a> in addition to the others. I will add also
      to this and to the former number the crews of the fifty-oared galleys,
      assuming that there were eighty men, more or less, <a href="#link7note-176" id="link7noteref-176" class="pginternal">176</a> in each one. Of
      these vessels there were gathered together, as was before said, three
      thousand: it would follow therefore that there were in them
      four-and-twenty myriads <a href="#link7note-177" id="link7noteref-177" class="pginternal">177</a> of men. This was the naval force which came
      from Asia, amounting in all to fifty-one myriads and also seven thousand
      six hundred and ten in addition. <a href="#link7note-178" id="link7noteref-178" class="pginternal">178</a> Then of the footmen
      there had been found to be a hundred and seventy myriads, <a href="#link7note-179" id="link7noteref-179" class="pginternal">179</a>
      and of the horsemen eight myriads: <a href="#link7note-180" id="link7noteref-180" class="pginternal">180</a> and I will add also
      to these the Arabian camel-drivers and the Libyan drivers of chariots,
      assuming them to amount to twenty thousand men. The result is then that
      the number of the ships' crews combined with that of the land-army amounts
      to two hundred and thirty-one myriads and also in addition seven thousand
      six hundred and ten. <a href="#link7note-181" id="link7noteref-181" class="pginternal">181</a> This is the statement of the Army which was
      brought up out of Asia itself, without counting the attendants which
      accompanied it or the corn-transports and the men who sailed in these.
    </p>
<p>
      185. There is still to be reckoned, in addition to all this which has been
      summed up, the force which was being led from Europe; and of this we must
      give a probable estimate. <a href="#link7note-182" id="link7noteref-182" class="pginternal">182</a> The Hellenes of Thrace and of the islands
      which lie off the coast of Thrace supplied a hundred and twenty ships;
      from which ships there results a sum of twenty-four thousand men: and as
      regards the land-force which was supplied by the Thracians, Paionians,
      Eordians, Bottiaians, the race which inhabits Chalkidike, the Brygians,
      Pierians, Macedonians, Perraibians, Enianians, <a href="#link7note-183" id="link7noteref-183" class="pginternal">183</a> Dolopians,
      Magnesians, Achaians, and all those who dwell in the coast-region of
      Thrace, of these various nations I estimate that there were thirty
      myriads. <a href="#link7note-184" id="link7noteref-184" class="pginternal">184</a> These myriads then added to those from Asia
      make a total sum of two hundred and sixty-four myriads of fighting men and
      in addition to these sixteen hundred and ten. <a href="#link7note-185" id="link7noteref-185" class="pginternal">185</a>
</p>
<p>
      186. Such being the number of this body of fighting-men, <a href="#link7note-186" id="link7noteref-186" class="pginternal">186</a>
      the attendants who went with these and the men who were in the small
      vessels <a href="#link7note-187" id="link7noteref-187" class="pginternal">187</a> which carried corn, and again in the other
      vessels which sailed with the army, these I suppose were not less in
      number but more than the fighting men. I assume them to be equal in number
      with these, and neither at all more nor less; and so, being supposed equal
      in number with the fighting body, they make up the same number of myriads
      as they. Thus five hundred and twenty-eight myriads three thousand two
      hundred and twenty <a href="#link7note-188" id="link7noteref-188" class="pginternal">188</a> was the number of men whom Xerxes son of
      Dareios led as far as Sepias and Thermopylai.
    </p>
<p>
      187. This is the number of the whole army of Xerxes; but of the women who
      made bread for it, and of the concubines and eunuchs no man can state any
      exact number, nor again of the draught-animals and other beasts of burden
      or of the Indian hounds, which accompanied it, could any one state the
      number by reason of their multitude: so that it does not occur to me to
      wonder that the streams of some rivers should have failed them, but I
      wonder rather how the provisions were sufficient to feed so many myriads;
      for I find on computation that if each man received a quart <a href="#link7note-189" id="link7noteref-189" class="pginternal">189</a>
      of wheat every day and nothing more, there would be expended every day
      eleven myriads of <i>medimnoi</i> <a href="#link7note-190" id="link7noteref-190" class="pginternal">190</a> and three hundred
      and forty <i>medimnoi</i> besides: and here I am not reckoning anything
      for the women, eunuchs, baggage-animals, or dogs. Of all these men,
      amounting to so many myriads, not one was for beauty and stature more
      worthy than Xerxes himself to possess this power.
    </p>
<p>
      188. The fleet, I say, set forth and sailed: and when it had put in to
      land in the region of Magnesia at the beach which is between the city of
      Casthanaia and the headland of Sepias, the first of the ships which came
      lay moored by the land and the others rode at anchor behind them; for, as
      the beach was not large in extent, they lay at anchor with prows
      projecting <a href="#link7note-191" id="link7noteref-191" class="pginternal">191</a> towards the sea in an order which was eight
      ships deep. For that night they lay thus; but at early dawn, after clear
      sky and windless calm, the sea began to be violently agitated and a great
      storm fell upon them with a strong East <a href="#link7note-192" id="link7noteref-192" class="pginternal">192</a> Wind, that wind
      which they who dwell about those parts call Hellespontias. Now as many of
      them as perceived that the wind was rising and who were so moored that it
      was possible for them to do so, drew up their ships on land before the
      storm came, and both they and their ships escaped; but as for those of the
      ships which it caught out at sea, some it cast away at the place called
      Ipnoi <a href="#link7note-193" id="link7noteref-193" class="pginternal">193</a> in Pelion and others on the beach, while
      some were wrecked on the headland of Sepias itself, others at the city of
      Meliboia, and others were thrown up on shore <a href="#link7note-194" id="link7noteref-194" class="pginternal">194</a> at Casthanaia: and
      the violence of the storm could not be resisted.
    </p>
<p>
      189. There is a story reported that the Athenians had called upon Boreas
      to aid them, by suggestion of an oracle, because there had come to them
      another utterance of the god bidding them call upon their brother by
      marriage to be their helper. Now according to the story of the Hellenes
      Boreas has a wife who is of Attica, Oreithuia the daughter of
      Erechththeus. By reason of this affinity, I say, the Athenians, according
      to the tale which has gone abroad, conjectured that their "brother by
      marriage" was Boreas, and when they perceived the wind rising, as they lay
      with their ships at Chalkis in Euboea, or even before that, they offered
      sacrifices and called upon Boreas and Oreithuia to assist them and to
      destroy the ships of the Barbarians, as they had done before round about
      mount Athos. Whether it was for this reason that the wind Boreas fell upon
      the Barbarians while they lay at anchor, I am not able to say; but however
      that may be, the Athenians report that Boreas had come to their help in
      former times, and that at this time he accomplished those things for them
      of which I speak; and when they had returned home they set up a temple
      dedicated to Boreas by the river Ilissos.
    </p>
<p>
      190. In this disaster the number of the ships which were lost was not less
      than four hundred, according to the report of those who state the number
      which is lowest, with men innumerable and an immense quantity of valuable
      things; insomuch that to Ameinocles the son of Cretines, a Magnesian who
      held lands about Sepias, this shipwreck proved very gainful; for he picked
      up many cups of gold which were thrown up afterwards on the shore, and
      many also of silver, and found treasure-chests <a href="#link7note-195" id="link7noteref-195" class="pginternal">195</a> which had belonged
      to the Persians, and made acquisition of other things of gold <a href="#link7note-196" id="link7noteref-196" class="pginternal">196</a>
      more than can be described. This man however, though he became very
      wealthy by the things which he found, yet in other respects was not
      fortunate; for he too suffered misfortune, being troubled by the slaying
      of a child. <a href="#link7note-197" id="link7noteref-197" class="pginternal">197</a>
</p>
<p>
      191. Of the corn-transports and other vessels which perished there was no
      numbering made; and so great was the loss that the commanders of the
      fleet, being struck with fear lest the Thessalians should attack them now
      that they had been brought into an evil plight, threw round their camp a
      lofty palisade built of the fragments of wreck. For the storm continued
      during three days; but at last the Magians, making sacrifice of victims
      and singing incantations to appease the Wind by enchantments, <a href="#link7note-198" id="link7noteref-198" class="pginternal">198</a>
      and in addition to this, offering to Thetis and the Nereïds, caused it to
      cease on the fourth day, or else for some other reason it abated of its
      own will. Now they offered sacrifice to Thetis, being informed by the
      Ionians of the story that she was carried off from the place by Peleus,
      and that the whole headland of Sepias belonged to her and to the other
      Nereïds.
    </p>
<p>
      192. The storm then had ceased on the fourth day; and meanwhile the
      day-watchers had run down from the heights of Euboea on the day after the
      first storm began, and were keeping the Hellenes informed of all that had
      happened as regards the shipwreck. They then, being informed of it, prayed
      first to Poseidon the Saviour and poured libations, and then they hastened
      to go back to Artemision, expecting that there would be but a very few
      ships of the enemy left to come against them.
    </p>
<p>
      193. They, I say, came for the second time and lay with their ships about
      Artemision: and from that time even to this they preserve the use of the
      surname "Saviour" for Poseidon. Meanwhile the Barbarians, when the wind
      had ceased and the swell of the sea had calmed down, drew their ships into
      the sea and sailed on along the shore of the mainland, and having rounded
      the extremity of Magnesia they sailed straight into the gulf which leads
      towards Pagasai. In this gulf of Magnesia there is a place where it is
      said that Heracles was left behind by Jason and his comrades, having been
      sent from the Argo to fetch water, at the time when they were sailing for
      the fleece to Aia in the land of Colchis: for from that place they
      designed, when they had taken in water, to loose <a href="#link7note-199" id="link7noteref-199" class="pginternal">199</a> their ship into the
      open sea; and from this the place has come to have the name Aphetai. Here
      then the fleet of Xerxes took up its moorings.
    </p>
<p>
      194. Now it chanced that fifteen of these ships put out to sea a good deal
      later than the rest, and they happened to catch sight of the ships of the
      Hellenes at Artemision. These ships the Barbarians supposed to be their
      own, and they sailed thither accordingly and fell among the enemy. Of
      these the commander was Sandokes the son of Thamasios, the governor of
      Kyme in Aiolia, whom before this time king Dareios had taken and crucified
      (he being one of the Royal Judges) for this reason, <a href="#link7note-19901" id="link7noteref-19901" class="pginternal">19901</a>
      namely that Sandokes had pronounced judgment unjustly for money. So then
      after he was hung up, Dareios reckoned and found that more good services
      had been done by him to the royal house than were equal to his offences;
      and having found this, and perceived that he had himself acted with more
      haste than wisdom, he let him go. Thus he escaped from king Dareios, and
      did not perish but survived; now, however, when he sailed in toward the
      Hellenes, he was destined not to escape the second time; for when the
      Hellenes saw them sailing up, perceiving the mistake which was being made
      they put out against them and captured them without difficulty.
    </p>
<p>
      195. Sailing in one of these ships Aridolis was captured, the despot of
      Alabanda in Caria, and in another the Paphian commander Penthylos son of
      Demonoös, who brought twelve ships from Paphos, but had lost eleven of
      them in the storm which had come on by Sepias, and now was captured
      sailing in towards Artemision with the one which had escaped. These men
      the Hellenes sent away in bonds to the Isthmus of the Corinthians, after
      having inquired of them that which they desired to learn of the army of
      Xerxes.
    </p>
<p>
      196. The fleet of the Barbarians then, except the fifteen ships of which I
      said that Sandokes was in command, had arrived at Aphetai; and Xerxes
      meanwhile with the land-army, having marched through Thessalia and Achaia,
      had already entered the land of the Malians two days before, <a href="#link7note-200" id="link7noteref-200" class="pginternal">200</a>
      after having held in Thessaly a contest for his own horses, making trial
      also of the Thessalian cavalry, because he was informed that it was the
      best of all among the Hellenes; and in this trial the horses of Hellas
      were far surpassed by the others. Now of the rivers in Thessalia the
      Onochonos alone failed to suffice by its stream for the drinking of the
      army; but of the rivers which flow in Achaia even that which is the
      largest of them, namely Epidanos, even this, I say, held out but barely.
    </p>
<p>
      197. When Xerxes had reached Alos of Achaia, the guides who gave him
      information of the way, wishing to inform him fully of everything,
      reported to him a legend of the place, the things, namely, which have to
      do with the temple of Zeus Laphystios; <a href="#link7note-201" id="link7noteref-201" class="pginternal">201</a> how Athamas the son
      of Aiolos contrived death for Phrixos, having taken counsel with Ino, and
      after this how by command of an oracle the Achaians propose to his
      descendants the following tasks to be performed:—whosoever is the
      eldest of this race, on him they lay an injunction that he is forbidden to
      enter the City Hall, <a href="#link7note-202" id="link7noteref-202" class="pginternal">202</a> and they themselves keep watch; now the City
      Hall is called by the Achaians the "Hall of the People"; <a href="#link7note-203" id="link7noteref-203" class="pginternal">203</a>
      and if he enter it, it may not be that he shall come forth until he is
      about to be sacrificed. They related moreover in addition to this, that
      many of these who were about to be sacrificed had before now run away and
      departed to another land, because they were afraid; and if afterwards in
      course of time they returned to their own land and were caught, they were
      placed <a href="#link7note-204" id="link7noteref-204" class="pginternal">204</a> in the City Hall: and they told how the man
      is sacrificed all thickly covered with wreaths, and with what form of
      procession he is brought forth to the sacrifice. This is done to the
      descendants of Kytissoros the son of Phrixos, because, when the Achaians
      were making of Athamas the son of Aiolos a victim to purge the sins of the
      land according to the command of an oracle, and were just about to
      sacrifice him, this Kytissoros coming from Aia of the Colchians rescued
      him; and having done so he brought the wrath of the gods upon his own
      descendants. Having heard these things, Xerxes, when he came to the sacred
      grove, both abstained from entering it himself, and gave the command to
      his whole army to so likewise; and he paid reverence both to the house and
      to the sacred enclosure of the descendants of Athamas.
    </p>
<p>
      198. These then are the things which happened in Thessalia and in Achaia;
      and from these regions he proceeded to the Malian land, going along by a
      gulf of the sea, in which there is an ebb and flow of the tide every day.
      Round about this gulf there is a level space, which in parts is broad but
      in other parts very narrow; and mountains lofty and inaccessible
      surrounding this place enclose the whole land of Malis and are called the
      rocks of Trachis. The first city upon this gulf as one goes from Achaia is
      Antikyra, by which the river Spercheios flowing from the land of the
      Enianians <a href="#link7note-205" id="link7noteref-205" class="pginternal">205</a> runs out into the sea. At a distance of
      twenty furlongs <a href="#link7note-206" id="link7noteref-206" class="pginternal">206</a> or thereabouts from this river there is
      another, of which the name is Dyras; this is said to have appeared that it
      might bring assistance to Heracles when he was burning: then again at a
      distance of twenty furlongs from this there is another river called Melas.
    </p>
<p>
      199. From this river Melas the city of Trachis is distant five furlongs;
      and here, in the parts where Trachis is situated, is even the widest
      portion of all this district, as regards the space from the mountains to
      the sea; for the plain has an extent of twenty-two thousand <i>plethra</i>.
      <a href="#link7note-207" id="link7noteref-207" class="pginternal">207</a>
      In the mountain-range which encloses the land of Trachis there is a cleft
      to the South of Trachis itself; and through this cleft the river Asopos
      flows, and runs along by the foot of the mountain.
    </p>
<p>
      200. There is also another river called Phoinix, to the South of the
      Asopos, of no great size, which flowing from these mountains runs out into
      the Asopos; and at the river Phoinix is the narrowest place, for here has
      been constructed a road with a single wheel-track only. Then from the
      river Phoinix it is a distance of fifteen furlongs to Thermopylai; and in
      the space between the river Phoinix and Thermopylai there is a village
      called Anthela, by which the river Asopos flows, and so runs out into the
      sea; and about this village there is a wide space in which is set up a
      temple dedicated to Demeter of the Amphictyons, and there are seats for
      the Amphictyonic councillors and a temple dedicated to Amphictyon himself.
    </p>
<p>
      201. King Xerxes, I say, was encamped within the region of Trachis in the
      land of the Malians, and the Hellenes within the pass. This place is
      called by the Hellenes in general Thermopylai, but by the natives of the
      place and those who dwell in the country round it is called Pylai. Both
      sides then were encamped hereabout, and the one had command of all that
      lies beyond Trachis <a href="#link7note-208" id="link7noteref-208" class="pginternal">208</a> in the direction of the North Wind, and the
      others of that which tends towards the South Wind and the mid-day on this
      side of the continent. <a href="#link7note-209" id="link7noteref-209" class="pginternal">209</a>
</p>
<p>
      202. These were the Hellenes who awaited the attack of the Persian in this
      place:—of the Spartans three hundred hoplites; of the men of Tegea
      and Mantineia a thousand, half from each place, from Orchomenos in Arcadia
      a hundred and twenty, and from the rest of Arcadia a thousand,—of
      the Arcadians so many; from Corinth four hundred, from Phlius two hundred,
      and of the men of Mykene eighty: these were they who came from the
      Peloponnese; and from the Boeotians seven hundred of the Thespians, and of
      the Thebans four hundred.
    </p>
<p>
      203. In addition to these the Locrians of Opus had been summoned to come
      in their full force, and of the Phokians a thousand: for the Hellenes had
      of themselves sent a summons to them, saying by messengers that they had
      come as forerunners of the others, that the rest of the allies were to be
      expected every day, that their sea was safely guarded, being watched by
      the Athenians and the Eginetans and by those who had been appointed to
      serve in the fleet, and that they need fear nothing: for he was not a god,
      they said, who was coming to attack Hellas, but a man; and there was no
      mortal, nor would be any, with those fortunes evil had not been mingled at
      his very birth, and the greatest evils for the greatest men; therefore he
      also who was marching against them, being mortal, would be destined to
      fail of his expectation. They accordingly, hearing this, came to the
      assistance of the others at Trachis.
    </p>
<p>
      204. Of these troops, although there were other commanders also according
      to the State to which each belonged, yet he who was most held in regard
      and who was leader of the whole army was the Lacedemonian Leonidas son of
      Anaxandrides, son of Leon, son of Eurycratides, son of Anaxander, son of
      Eurycrates, son of Polydoros, son of Alcamenes, son of Teleclos, son of
      Archelaos, son of Hegesilaos, son of Doryssos, son of Leobotes, son of
      Echestratos, son of Agis, son of Eurysthenes, son of Aristodemos, son of
      Aristomachos, son of Cleodaios, son of Hyllos, son of Heracles; who had
      obtained the kingdom of Sparta contrary to expectation.
    </p>
<p>
      205. For as he had two brothers each older than himself, namely Cleomenes
      and Dorieos, he had been far removed from the thought of becoming king.
      Since however Cleomenes had died without male child, and Dorieos was then
      no longer alive, but he also had brought his life to an end in Sicily, <a href="#link7note-210" id="link7noteref-210" class="pginternal">210</a>
      thus the kingdom came to Leonidas, both because was of elder birth than
      Cleombrotos (for Cleombrotos was the youngest of the sons of Anaxandrides)
      and also because he had in marriage the daughter of Cleomenes. He then at
      this time went to Thermopylai, having chosen the three hundred who were
      appointed by law <a href="#link7note-211" id="link7noteref-211" class="pginternal">211</a> and men who chanced to have sons; and he
      took with him besides, before he arrived, those Thebans whom I mentioned
      when I reckoned them in the number of the troops, of whom the commander
      was Leontiades the son of Eurymachos: and for this reason Leonidas was
      anxious to take up these with him of all the Hellenes, namely because
      accusations had been strongly brought against them that they were taking
      the side of the Medes; therefore he summoned them to the war, desiring to
      know whether they would send troops with them or whether they would openly
      renounce the alliance of the Hellenes; and they sent men, having other
      thoughts in their mind the while.
    </p>
<p>
      206. These with Leonidas the Spartans had sent out first, in order that
      seeing them the other allies might join in the campaign, and for fear that
      they also might take the side of the Medes, if they heard that the
      Spartans were putting off their action. Afterwards, however, when they had
      kept the festival, (for the festival of the Carneia stood in their way),
      they intended then to leave a garrison in Sparta and to come to help in
      full force with speed: and just so also the rest of the allies had thought
      of doing themselves; for it chanced that the Olympic festival fell at the
      same time as these events. Accordingly, since they did not suppose that
      the fighting in Thermopylai would so soon be decided, they sent only the
      forerunners of their force.
    </p>
<p>
      207. These, I say, had intended to do thus: and meanwhile the Hellenes at
      Thermopylai, when the Persian had come near to the pass, were in dread,
      and deliberated about making retreat from their position. To the rest of
      the Peloponnesians then it seemed best that they should go to the
      Peloponnese and hold the Isthmus in guard; but Leonidas, when the Phokians
      and Locrians were indignant at this opinion, gave his vote for remaining
      there, and for sending at the same time messengers to the several States
      bidding them to come up to help them, since they were but few to repel the
      army of the Medes.
    </p>
<p>
      208. As they were thus deliberating, Xerxes sent a scout on horseback to
      see how many they were in number and what they were doing; for he had
      heard while he was yet in Thessaly that there had been assembled in this
      place a small force, and that the leaders of it were Lacedemonians
      together with Leonidas, who was of the race of Heracles. And when the
      horseman had ridden up towards their camp, he looked upon them and had a
      view not indeed of the whole of their army, for of those which were posted
      within the wall, which they had repaired and were keeping a guard, it was
      not possible to have a view, but he observed those who were outside, whose
      station was in front of the wall; and it chanced at that time that the
      Lacedemonians were they who were posted outside. So then he saw some of
      the men practising athletic exercises and some combing their long hair:
      and as he looked upon these things he marvelled, and at the same time he
      observed their number: and when he had observed all exactly, he rode back
      unmolested, for no one attempted to pursue him and he found himself
      treated with much indifference. And when he returned he reported to Xerxes
      all that which he had seen.
    </p>
<p>
      209. Hearing this Xerxes was not able to conjecture the truth about the
      matter, namely that they were preparing themselves to die and to deal
      death to the enemy so far as they might; but it seemed to him that they
      were acting in a manner merely ridiculous; and therefore he sent for
      Demaratos the son of Ariston, who was in his camp, and when he came,
      Xerxes asked him of these things severally, desiring to discover what this
      was which the Lacedemonians were doing: and he said: "Thou didst hear from
      my mouth at a former time, when we were setting forth to go against
      Hellas, the things concerning these men; and having heard them thou madest
      me an object of laughter, because I told thee of these things which I
      perceived would come to pass; for to me it is the greatest of all ends to
      speak the truth continually before thee, O king. Hear then now also: these
      men have come to fight with us for the passage, and this is it that they
      are preparing to do; for they have a custom which is as follows;—whenever
      they are about to put their lives in peril, then they attend to the
      arrangement of their hair. Be assured however, that if thou shalt subdue
      these and the rest of them which remain behind in Sparta, there is no
      other race of men which will await thy onset, O king, or will raise hands
      against thee: for now thou art about to fight against the noblest kingdom
      and city of those which are among the Hellenes, and the best men." To
      Xerxes that which was said seemed to be utterly incredible, and he asked
      again a second time in what manner being so few they would fight with his
      host. He said; "O king, deal with me as with a liar, if thou find not that
      these things come to pass as I say."
    </p>
<p>
      210. Thus saying he did not convince Xerxes, who let four days go by,
      expecting always that they would take to flight; but on the fifth day,
      when they did not depart but remained, being obstinate, as he thought, in
      impudence and folly, he was enraged and sent against them the Medes and
      the Kissians, charging them to take the men alive and bring them into his
      presence. Then when the Medes moved forward and attacked the Hellenes,
      there fell many of them, and others kept coming up continually, and they
      were not driven back, though suffering great loss: and they made it
      evident to every man, and to the king himself not least of all, that human
      beings are many but men are few. This combat went on throughout the day:
    </p>
<p>
      211, and when the Medes were being roughly handled, then these retired
      from the battle, and the Persians, those namely whom the king called
      "Immortals," of whom Hydarnes was commander, took their place and came to
      the attack, supposing that they at least would easily overcome the enemy.
      When however these also engaged in combat with the Hellenes, they gained
      no more success than the Median troops but the same as they, seeing that
      they were fighting in a place with a narrow passage, using shorter spears
      than the Hellenes, and not being able to take advantage of their superior
      numbers. The Lacedemonians meanwhile were fighting in a memorable fashion,
      and besides other things of which they made display, being men perfectly
      skilled in fighting opposed to men who were unskilled, they would turn
      their backs to the enemy and make a pretence of taking to flight; and the
      Barbarians, seeing them thus taking a flight, would follow after them with
      shouting and clashing of arms: then the Lacedemonians, when they were
      being caught up, turned and faced the Barbarians; and thus turning round
      they would slay innumerable multitudes of the Persians; and there fell
      also at these times a few of the Spartans themselves. So, as the Persians
      were not able to obtain any success by making trial of the entrance and
      attacking it by divisions and every way, they retired back.
    </p>
<p>
      212. And during these onsets it is said that the king, looking on, three
      times leapt up from his seat, struck with fear for his army. Thus they
      contended then: and on the following day the Barbarians strove with no
      better success; for because the men opposed to them were few in number,
      they engaged in battle with the expectation that they would be found to be
      disabled and would not be capable any longer of raising their hands
      against them in fight. The Hellenes however were ordered by companies as
      well as by nations, and they fought successively each in turn, excepting
      the Phokians, for these were posted upon the mountain to guard the path.
      So the Persians, finding nothing different from that which they had seen
      on the former day, retired back from the fight.
    </p>
<p>
      213. Then when the king was in a strait as to what he should do in the
      matter before him, Epialtes the son of Eurydemos, a Malian, came to speech
      with him, supposing that he would win a very great reward from the king;
      and this man told him of the path which leads over the mountain to
      Thermopylai, and brought about the destruction of those Hellenes who
      remained in that place. Afterwards from fear of the Lacedemonians he fled
      to Thessaly, and when he had fled, a price was proclaimed for his life by
      the Deputies, <a href="#link7note-212" id="link7noteref-212" class="pginternal">212</a> when the Amphictyons met for their assembly
      at Pylai. <a href="#link7note-213" id="link7noteref-213" class="pginternal">213</a> Then some time afterwards having returned to
      Antikyra he was slain by Athenades a man of Trachis. Now this Athenades
      killed Epialtes for another cause, which I shall set forth in the
      following part of the history, <a href="#link7note-214" id="link7noteref-214" class="pginternal">214</a> but he was honoured
      for it none the less by the Lacedemonians.
    </p>
<p>
      214. Thus Epialtes after these events was slain: there is however another
      tale told, that Onetes the son of Phanagoras, a man of Carystos, and
      Corydallos of Antikyra were those who showed the Persians the way round
      the mountain; but this I can by no means accept: for first we must judge
      by this fact, namely that the Deputies of the Hellenes did not proclaim a
      price for the lives of Onetes and Corydallos, but for that of Epialtes the
      Trachinian, having surely obtained the most exact information of the
      matter; and secondly we know that Epialtes was an exile from his country
      to avoid this charge. True it is indeed that Onetes might know of this
      path, even though he were not a Malian, if he had had much intercourse
      with the country; but Epialtes it was who led them round the mountain by
      the path, and him therefore I write down as the guilty man.
    </p>
<p>
      215. Xerxes accordingly, being pleased by that which Epialtes engaged to
      accomplish, at once with great joy proceeded to send Hydarnes and the men
      of whom Hydarnes was commander; <a href="#link7note-215" id="link7noteref-215" class="pginternal">215</a> and they set forth
      from the camp about the time when the lamps are lit. This path of which we
      speak had been discovered by the Malians who dwell in that land, and
      having discovered it they led the Thessalians by it against the Phokians,
      at the time when the Phokians had fenced the pass with a wall and thus
      were sheltered from the attacks upon them: so long ago as this had the
      pass been proved by the Malians to be of no value. <a href="#link7note-216" id="link7noteref-216" class="pginternal">216</a> And this path lies
      as follows:—it begins from the river Asopos, which flows through the
      cleft, and the name of this mountain and of the path is the same, namely
      Anopaia; and this Anopaia stretches over the ridge of the mountain and
      ends by the town of Alpenos, which is the first town of the Locrians
      towards Malis, and by the stone called Black Buttocks <a href="#link7note-217" id="link7noteref-217" class="pginternal">217</a>
      and the seats of the Kercopes, where is the very narrowest part.
    </p>
<p>
      217. By this path thus situated the Persians after crossing over the
      Asopos proceeded all through the night, having on their right hand the
      mountains of the Oitaians and on the left those of the Trachinians: and
      when dawn appeared, they had reached the summit of the mountain. In this
      part of the mountain there were, as I have before shown, a thousand
      hoplites of the Phokians keeping guard, to protect their own country and
      to keep the path: for while the pass below was guarded by those whom I
      have mentioned, the path over the mountain was guarded by the Phokians,
      who had undertaken the business for Leonidas by their own offer.
    </p>
<p>
      218. While the Persians were ascending they were concealed from these,
      since all the mountain was covered with oak-trees; and the Phokians became
      aware of them after they had made the ascent as follows:—the day was
      calm, and not a little noise was made by the Persians, as was likely when
      leaves were lying spread upon the ground under their feet; upon which the
      Phokians started up and began to put on their arms, and by this time the
      Barbarians were close upon them. These, when they saw men arming
      themselves, fell into wonder, for they were expecting that no one would
      appear to oppose them, and instead of that they had met with an armed
      force. Then Hydarnes, seized with fear lest the Phokians should be
      Lacedemonians, asked Epialtes of what people the force was; and being
      accurately informed he set the Persians in order for battle. The Phokians
      however, when they were hit by the arrows of the enemy, which flew
      thickly, fled and got away at once to the topmost peak of the mountain,
      fully assured that it was against them that the enemy had designed to
      come, <a href="#link7note-218" id="link7noteref-218" class="pginternal">218</a> and here they were ready to meet death.
      These, I say, were in this mind; but the Persians meanwhile with Epialtes
      and Hydarnes made no account of the Phokians, but descended the mountain
      with all speed.

<p>
      219. To the Hellenes who were in Thermopylai first the soothsayer
      Megistias, after looking into the victims which were sacrificed, declared
      the death which was to come to them at dawn of day; and afterwards
      deserters brought the report <a href="#link7note-219" id="link7noteref-219" class="pginternal">219</a> of the Persians
      having gone round. These signified it to them while it was yet night, and
      thirdly came the day-watchers, who had run down from the heights when day
      was already dawning. Then the Hellenes deliberated, and their opinions
      were divided; for some urged that they should not desert their post, while
      others opposed this counsel. After this they departed from their assembly,
      <a href="#link7note-220" id="link7noteref-220" class="pginternal">220</a>
      and some went away and dispersed each to their several cities, while
      others of them were ready to remain there together with Leonidas.
    </p>
<p>
      220. However it is reported also that Leonidas himself sent them away,
      having a care that they might not perish, but thinking that it was not
      seemly for himself and for the Spartans who were present to leave the post
      to which they had come at first to keep guard there. I am inclined rather
      to be of this latter opinion, <a href="#link7note-221" id="link7noteref-221" class="pginternal">221</a> namely that because
      Leonidas perceived that the allies were out of heart and did not desire to
      face the danger with him to the end, he ordered them to depart, but held
      that for himself to go away was not honourable, whereas if he remained, a
      great fame of him would be left behind, and the prosperity of Sparta would
      not be blotted out: for an oracle had been given by the Pythian prophetess
      to the Spartans, when they consulted about this war at the time when it
      was being first set on foot, to the effect that either Lacedemon must be
      destroyed by the Barbarians, or their king must lose his life. This reply
      the prophetess gave them in hexameter verses, and it ran thus:
    </p>
<pre>
 "But as for you, ye men who in wide-spaced Sparta inhabit,
  Either your glorious city is sacked by the children of Perses,
  Or, if it be not so, then a king of the stock Heracleian
  Dead shall be mourned for by all in the boundaries of broad Lacedemon.
  Him <a href="#link7note-222" id="link7noteref-222" class="pginternal">222</a> nor the might of bulls nor the raging of lions shall hinder;
  For he hath might as of Zeus; and I say he shall not be restrained,
  Till one of the other of these he have utterly torn and divided." <a href="#link7note-223" id="link7noteref-223" class="pginternal">223</a>
</pre>
<p>
      I am of opinion that Leonidas considering these things and desiring to lay
      up for himself glory above all the other Spartans, <a href="#link7note-224" id="link7noteref-224" class="pginternal">224</a> dismissed the
      allies, rather than that those who departed did so in such disorderly
      fashion, because they were divided in opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      221. Of this the following has been to my mind a proof as convincing as
      any other, namely that Leonidas is known to have endeavoured to dismiss
      the soothsayer also who accompanied this army, Megistias the Acarnanian,
      who was said to be descended from Melampus, that he might not perish with
      them after he had declared from the victims that which was about to come
      to pass for them. He however when he was bidden to go would not himself
      depart, but sent away his son who was with him in the army, besides whom
      he had no other child.
    </p>
<p>
      222. The allies then who were dismissed departed and went away, obeying
      the word of Leonidas, and only the Thespians and the Thebans remained
      behind with the Lacedemonians. Of these the Thebans stayed against their
      will and not because they desired it, for Leonidas kept them, counting
      them as hostages; but the Thespians very willingly, for they said that
      they would not depart and leave Leonidas and those with him, but they
      stayed behind and died with them. The commander of these was Demophilos
      the son of Diadromes.
    </p>
<p>
      223. Xerxes meanwhile, having made libations at sunrise, stayed for some
      time, until about the hour when the market fills, and then made an advance
      upon them; for thus it had been enjoined by Epialtes, seeing that the
      descent of the mountain is shorter and the space to be passed over much
      less than the going round and the ascent. The Barbarians accordingly with
      Xerxes were advancing to the attack; and the Hellenes with Leonidas,
      feeling that they were going forth to death, now advanced out much further
      than at first into the broader part of the defile; for when the fence of
      the wall was being guarded, <a href="#link7note-225" id="link7noteref-225" class="pginternal">225</a> they on the former
      days fought retiring before the enemy into the narrow part of the pass;
      but now they engaged with them outside the narrows, and very many of the
      Barbarians fell: for behind them the leaders of the divisions with
      scourges in their hands were striking each man, ever urging them on to the
      front. Many of them then were driven into the sea and perished, and many
      more still were trodden down while yet alive by one another, and there was
      no reckoning of the number that perished: for knowing the death which was
      about to come upon them by reason of those who were going round the
      mountain, they <a href="#link7note-226" id="link7noteref-226" class="pginternal">226</a> displayed upon the Barbarians all the
      strength which they had, to its greatest extent, disregarding danger and
      acting as if possessed by a spirit of recklessness.
    </p>
<p>
      224. Now by this time the spears of the greater number of them were
      broken, so it chanced, in this combat, and they were slaying the Persians
      with their swords; and in this fighting fell Leonidas, having proved
      himself a very good man, and others also of the Spartans with him, men of
      note, of whose names I was informed as of men who had proved themselves
      worthy, and indeed I was told also the names of all the three hundred.
      Moreover of the Persians there fell here, besides many others of note,
      especially two sons of Dareios, Abrocomes and Hyperanthes, born to Dareios
      of Phratagune the daughter of Artanes: now Artanes was the brother of king
      Dareios and the son of Hystaspes, the son of Arsames; and he in giving his
      daughter in marriage to Dareios gave also with her all his substance,
      because she was his only child.
    </p>
<p>
      225. Two brothers of Xerxes, I say, fell here fighting; and meanwhile over
      the body of Leonidas there arose a great struggle between the Persians and
      the Lacedemonians, until the Hellenes by valour dragged this away from the
      enemy and turned their opponents to flight four times. This conflict
      continued until those who had gone with Epialtes came up; and when the
      Hellenes learnt that these had come, from that moment the nature of the
      combat was changed; for they retired backwards to the narrow part of the
      way, and having passed by the wall they went and placed themselves upon
      the hillock, <a href="#link7note-227" id="link7noteref-227" class="pginternal">227</a> all in a body together except only the
      Thebans: now this hillock is in the entrance, where now the stone lion is
      placed for Leonidas. On this spot while defending themselves with daggers,
      that is those who still had them left, and also with hands and with teeth,
      they were overwhelmed by the missiles of the Barbarians, some of these
      having followed directly after them and destroyed the fence of the wall,
      while others had come round and stood about them on all sides.
    </p>
<p>
      226. Such were the proofs of valour given by the Lacedemonians and
      Thespians; yet the Spartan Dienekes is said to have proved himself the
      best man of all, the same who, as they report, uttered this saying before
      they engaged battle with the Medes:—being informed by one of the men
      of Trachis that when the Barbarians discharged their arrows they obscured
      the light of the sun by the multitude of the arrows, so great was the
      number of their host, he was not dismayed by this, but making small
      account of the number of the Medes, he said that their guest from Trachis
      brought them very good news, for if the Medes obscured the light of the
      sun, the battle against them would be in the shade and not in the sun.
    </p>
<p>
      227. This and other sayings of this kind they report that Dienekes the
      Lacedemonian left as memorials of himself; and after him the bravest they
      say of the Lacedemonians were two brothers Alpheos and Maron, sons of
      Orsiphantos. Of the Thespians the man who gained most honour was named
      Dithyrambos son of Harmatides.
    </p>
<p>
      228. The men were buried were they fell; and for these, as well as for
      those who were slain before being sent away <a href="#link7note-228" id="link7noteref-228" class="pginternal">228</a> by Leonidas, there
      is an inscription which runs thus:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Here once, facing in fight three hundred myriads of foemen,
    Thousands four did contend, men of the Peloponnese."
</pre>
<p>
      This is the inscription for the whole body; and for the Spartans
      separately there is this:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Stranger, report this word, we pray, to the Spartans, that lying
    Here in this spot we remain, faithfully keeping their laws." <a href="#link7note-229" id="link7noteref-229" class="pginternal">229</a>
</pre>
<p>
      This, I say, for the Lacedemonians; and for the soothsayer as follows:
    </p>
<pre>
 "This is the tomb of Megistias renowned, whom the Median foemen,
    Where Sperchios doth flow, slew when they forded the stream;
  Soothsayer he, who then knowing clearly the fates that were coming,
    Did not endure in the fray Sparta's good leaders to leave."
</pre>
<p>
      The Amphictyons it was who honoured them with inscriptions and memorial
      pillars, excepting only in the case of the inscription to the soothsayer;
      but that of the soothsayer Megistias was inscribed by Simonides the son of
      Leoprepes on account of guest-friendship.
    </p>
<p>
      229. Two of these three hundred, it is said, namely Eurystos and
      Aristodemos, who, if they had made agreement with one another, might
      either have come safe home to Sparta together (seeing that they had been
      dismissed from the camp by Leonidas and were lying at Alpenoi with disease
      of the eyes, suffering extremely), or again, if they had not wished to
      return home, they might have been slain together with the rest,—when
      they might, I say, have done either one of these two things, would not
      agree together; but the two being divided in opinion, Eurystos, it is
      said, when he was informed that the Persians had gone round, asked for his
      arms and having put them on ordered his Helot to lead him to those who
      were fighting; and after he had led him thither, the man who had led him
      ran away and departed, but Eurystos plunged into the thick of the
      fighting, and so lost his life: but Aristodemos was left behind fainting.
      <a href="#link7note-230" id="link7noteref-230" class="pginternal">230</a>
      Now if either Aristodemos had been ill <a href="#link7note-231" id="link7noteref-231" class="pginternal">231</a> alone, and so had
      returned home to Sparta, or the men had both of them come back together, I
      do not suppose that the Spartans would have displayed any anger against
      them; but in this case, as the one of them had lost his life and the
      other, clinging to an excuse which the first also might have used, <a href="#link7note-232" id="link7noteref-232" class="pginternal">232</a>
      had not been willing to die, it necessarily happened that the Spartans had
      great indignation against Aristodemos.
    </p>
<p>
      230. Some say that Aristodemos came safe to Sparta in this manner, and on
      a pretext such as I have said; but others, that he had been sent as a
      messenger from the camp, and when he might have come up in time to find
      the battle going on, was not willing to do so, but stayed upon the road
      and so saved his life, while his fellow-messenger reached the battle and
      was slain.
    </p>
<p>
      231. When Aristodemos, I say, had returned home to Lacedemon, he had
      reproach and dishonour; <a href="#link7note-233" id="link7noteref-233" class="pginternal">233</a> and that which he suffered by way of
      dishonour was this,—no one of the Spartans would either give him
      light for a fire or speak with him, and he had reproach in that he was
      called Aristodemos the coward. <a href="#link7note-234" id="link7noteref-234" class="pginternal">234</a>
</p>
<p>
      232. He however in the battle at Plataia repaired all the guilt that was
      charged against him: but it is reported that another man also survived of
      these three hundred, whose name was Pantites, having been sent as a
      messenger to Thessaly, and this man, when he returned back to Sparta and
      found himself dishonoured, is said to have strangled himself.
    </p>
<p>
      233. The Thebans however, of whom the commander was Leontiades, being with
      the Hellenes had continued for some time to fight against the king's army,
      constrained by necessity; but when they saw that the fortunes of the
      Persians were prevailing, then and not before, while the Hellenes with
      Leonidas were making their way with speed to the hillock, they separated
      from these and holding out their hands came near to the Barbarians, saying
      at the same time that which was most true, namely that they were on the
      side of the Medes and that they had been among the first to give earth and
      water to the king; and moreover that they had come to Thermopylai
      constrained by necessity, and were blameless for the loss which had been
      inflicted upon the king: so that thus saying they preserved their lives,
      for they had also the Thessalians to bear witness to these words. However,
      they did not altogether meet with good fortune, for some had even been
      slain as they had been approaching, and when they had come and the
      Barbarians had them in their power, the greater number of them were
      branded by command of Xerxes with the royal marks, beginning with their
      leader Leontiades, the same whose son Eurymachos was afterwards slain by
      the Plataians, when he had been made commander of four hundred Thebans and
      had seized the city of the Plataians. <a href="#link7note-235" id="link7noteref-235" class="pginternal">235</a>
</p>
<p>
      234. Thus did the Hellenes at Thermopylai contend in fight; and Xerxes
      summoned Demaratos and inquired of him, having first said this:
      "Demaratos, thou art a good man; and this I conclude by the truth of thy
      words, for all that thou saidest turned out so as thou didst say. Now,
      however, tell me how many in number are the remaining Lacedemonians, and
      of them how many are like these in matters of war; or are they so even all
      of them?" He said: "O king, the number of all the Lacedemonians is great
      and their cities are many, but that which thou desirest to learn, thou
      shalt know. There is in Lacedemon the city of Sparta, having about eight
      thousand men; and these are all equal to those who fought here: the other
      Lacedemonians are not equal to these, but they are good men too." To this
      Xerxes said: "Demaratos, in what manner shall we with least labour get the
      better of these men? Come set forth to us this; for thou knowest the
      courses of their counsels, <a href="#link7note-236" id="link7noteref-236" class="pginternal">236</a> seeing that thou wert once their king."
    </p>
<p>
      235. He made answer: "O king, if thou dost in very earnest take counsel
      with me, it is right that I declare to thee the best thing. What if thou
      shouldest send three hundred ships from thy fleet to attack the Laconian
      land? Now there is lying near it an island named Kythera, about which
      Chilon, who was a very wise man among us, said that it would be a greater
      gain for the Spartans that it should be sunk under the sea than that it
      should remain above it; for he always anticipated that something would
      happen from it of such a kind as I am now setting forth to thee: not that
      he knew of thy armament beforehand, but that he feared equally every
      armament of men. Let thy forces then set forth from this island and keep
      the Lacedemonians in fear; and while they have a war of their own close at
      their doors, there will be no fear for thee from them that when the
      remainder of Hellas is being conquered by the land-army, they will come to
      the rescue there. Then after the remainder of Hellas has been reduced to
      subjection, from that moment the Lacedemonian power will be left alone and
      therefore feeble. If however thou shalt not do this, I will tell thee what
      thou must look for. There is a narrow isthmus leading to the Peloponnese,
      and in this place thou must look that other battles will be fought more
      severe than those which have taken place, seeing that all the
      Peloponnesians have sworn to a league against thee: but if thou shalt do
      the other thing of which I spoke, this isthmus and the cities within it
      will come over to thy side without a battle."
    </p>
<p>
      236. After him spoke Achaimenes, brother of Xerxes and also commander of
      the fleet, who chanced to have been present at this discourse and was
      afraid lest Xerxes should be persuaded to do this: "O king," he said, "I
      see that thou art admitting the speech of a man who envies thy good
      fortune, or is even a traitor to thy cause: for in truth the Hellenes
      delight in such a temper as this; they envy a man for his good luck, and
      they hate that which is stronger than themselves. And if, besides other
      misfortunes which we have upon us, seeing that four hundred of our ships
      <a href="#link7note-237" id="link7noteref-237" class="pginternal">237</a>
      have suffered wreck, thou shalt send away another three hundred from the
      station of the fleet to sail round Peloponnese, then thy antagonists
      become a match for thee in fight; whereas while it is all assembled
      together our fleet is hard for them to deal with, and they will not be at
      all a match for thee: and moreover the whole sea-force will support the
      land-force and be supported by it, if they proceed onwards together; but
      if thou shalt divide them, neither wilt thou be of service to them nor
      they to thee. My determination is rather to set thy affairs in good order
      <a href="#link7note-238" id="link7noteref-238" class="pginternal">238</a>
      and not to consider the affairs of the enemy, either where they will set
      on foot the war or what they will do or how many in number they are; for
      it is sufficient that they should themselves take thought for themselves,
      and we for ourselves likewise: and if the Lacedemonians come to stand
      against the Persians in fight, they will assuredly not heal the wound from
      which they are now suffering." <a href="#link7note-239" id="link7noteref-239" class="pginternal">239</a>
</p>
<p>
      237. To him Xerxes made answer as follows: "Achaimenes, I think that thou
      speakest well, and so will I do; but Demaratos speaks that which he
      believes to be best for me, though his opinion is defeated by thine: for I
      will not certainly admit that which thou saidest, namely that he is not
      well-disposed to my cause, judging both by what was said by him before
      this, and also by that which is the truth, namely that though one citizen
      envies another for his good fortune and shows enmity to him by his
      silence, <a href="#link7note-240" id="link7noteref-240" class="pginternal">240</a> nor would a citizen when a fellow-citizen
      consulted him suggest that which seemed to him the best, unless he had
      attained to a great height of virtue, and such men doubtless are few; yet
      guest-friend to guest-friend in prosperity is well-disposed as nothing
      else on earth, and if his friend should consult him, he would give him the
      best counsel. Thus then as regards the evil-speaking against Demaratos,
      that is to say about one who is my guest-friend, I bid every one abstain
      from it in the future."
    </p>
<p>
      238. Having thus said Xerxes passed in review the bodies of the dead; and
      as for Leonidas, hearing that he had been the king and commander of the
      Lacedemonians he bade them cut off his head and crucify him. And it has
      been made plain to me by many proofs besides, but by none more strongly
      than by this, that king Xerxes was enraged with Leonidas while alive more
      than with any other man on earth; for otherwise he would never have done
      this outrage to his corpse; since of all the men whom I know, the Persians
      are accustomed most to honour those who are good men in war. They then to
      whom it was appointed to do these things, proceeded to do so.
    </p>
<p>
      239. I will return now to that point of my narrative where it remained
      unfinished. <a href="#link7note-241" id="link7noteref-241" class="pginternal">241</a> The Lacedemonians had been informed before
      all others that the king was preparing an expedition against Hellas; and
      thus it happened that they sent to the Oracle at Delphi, where that reply
      was given them which I reported shortly before this. And they got this
      information in a strange manner; for Demaratos the son of Ariston after he
      had fled for refuge to the Medes was not friendly to the Lacedemonians, as
      I am of opinion and as likelihood suggests supporting my opinion; but it
      is open to any man to make conjecture whether he did this thing which
      follows in a friendly spirit or in malicious triumph over them. When
      Xerxes had resolved to make a campaign against Hellas, Demaratos, being in
      Susa and having been informed of this, had a desire to report it to the
      Lacedemonians. Now in no other way was he able to signify it, for there
      was danger that he should be discovered, but he contrived thus, that is to
      say, he took a folding tablet and scraped off the wax which was upon it,
      and then he wrote the design of the king upon the wood of the tablet, and
      having done so he melted the wax and poured it over the writing, so that
      the tablet (being carried without writing upon it) might not cause any
      trouble to be given by the keepers of the road. Then when it had arrived
      at Lacedemon, the Lacedemonians were not able to make conjecture of the
      matter; until at last, as I am informed, Gorgo, the daughter of Cleomenes
      and wife of Leonidas, suggested a plan of which she had herself thought,
      bidding them scrape the wax and they would find writing upon the wood; and
      doing as she said they found the writing and read it, and after that they
      sent notice to the other Hellenes. These things are said to have come to
      pass in this manner. <a href="#link7note-242" id="link7noteref-242" class="pginternal">242</a>

      disputed. I understand Herodotus to state that though the vessels lay of
      course in the direction of the stream from the Hellespont, that is
      presenting their prows (or sterns) to the stream, yet this did not mean
      that they pointed straight towards the Propontis and Euxine; for the
      stream after passing Sestos runs almost from North to South with even a
      slight tendency to the East (hence {eurou} a few lines further on), so
      that ships lying in the stream would point in a line cutting at right
      angles that of the longer axis (from East to West) of the Pontus and
      Propontis. This is the meaning of {epikarsios} elsewhere in Herodotus (i.
      180 and iv. 101), and it would be rash to assign to it any other meaning
      here. It is true however that the expression {pros esperes} is used
      loosely below for the side toward the Egean. For {anakokheue} a subject
      must probably be supplied from the clause {pentekonterous—sunthentes},
      "that it (i.e. the combination of ships) might support etc.," and {ton
      tonon ton oplon} may either mean as below "the stretched ropes," or "the
      tension of the ropes," which would be relieved by the support: the latter
      meaning seems to me preferable.]
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Whitelaw suggests to me that {epikarsios} ({epi kar}) may mean rather
      "head-foremost," which seems to be its meaning in Homer (Odyss. ix. 70),
      and from which might be obtained the idea of intersection, one line
      running straight up against another, which it has in other passages. In
      that case it would here mean "heading towards the Pontus."]

      the ships are described as drawn up in rows one behind the other on shore,
      and where {prokrossas} is often explained to mean {klimakedon}, i.e.
      either in steps one behind the other owing to the rise of the beach, or in
      the arrangement of the <i>quincunx</i>. Probably in this passage the idea
      is rather of the prows projecting in rows like battlements {krossai}, and
      this is the sense in which the word is used by Herodotus elsewhere (iv.
      152). The word {krossai} however is used for the successively rising
      stages of the pyramids (ii. 125), and {prokrossos} may mean simply "in a
      row," or "one behind the other," which would suit all passages in which it

<h2>
      BOOK VIII. THE EIGHTH BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED URANIA
    </h2>
<p>
      1. Those of the Hellenes who had been appointed to serve in the fleet were
      these:—the Athenians furnished a hundred and twenty-seven ships, and
      the Plataians moved by valour and zeal for the service, although they had
      had no practice in seamanship, yet joined with the Athenians in manning
      their ships. The Corinthians furnished forty ships, the Megarians twenty;
      the Chalkidians manned twenty ships with which the Athenians furnished
      them; <a href="#link8note-1" id="link8noteref-1" class="pginternal">1</a>
      the Eginetans furnished eighteen ships, the Sikyonians twelve, the
      Lacedemonians ten, the Epidaurians eight, the Eretrians seven, the
      Troizenians five, the Styrians two, the Keïans two ships <a href="#link8note-2" id="link8noteref-2" class="pginternal">2</a> and
      two fifty-oared galleys, while the Locrians of Opus came also to the
      assistance of the rest with seven fifty-oared galleys.
    </p>
<p>
      2. These were those who joined in the expedition to Artemision, and I have
      mentioned them according to the number <a href="#link8note-3" id="link8noteref-3" class="pginternal">3</a> of the ships which they
      severally supplied: so the number of the ships which were assembled at
      Artemision was (apart from the fifty-oared galleys) two hundred and
      seventy-one: and the commander who had the supreme power was furnished by
      the Spartans, namely Eurybiades son of Eurycleides, since the allies said
      that they would not follow the lead of the Athenians, but unless a
      Lacedemonian were leader they would break up the expedition which was to
      be made:
    </p>
<p>
      3, for it had come to be said at first, even before they sent to Sicily to
      obtain allies, that the fleet ought to be placed in the charge of the
      Athenians. So as the allies opposed this, the Athenians yielded, having it
      much at heart that Hellas should be saved, and perceiving that if they
      should have disagreement with one another about the leadership, Hellas
      would perish: and herein they judged rightly, for disagreement between
      those of the same race is worse than war undertaken with one consent by as
      much as war is worse than peace. Being assured then of this truth, they
      did not contend, but gave way for so long time as they were urgently in
      need of the allies; and that this was so their conduct proved; for when,
      after repelling the Persian from themselves, they were now contending for
      his land and no longer for their own, they alleged the insolence of
      Pausanias as a pretext and took away the leadership from the
      Lacedemonians. This however took place afterwards.
    </p>
<p>
      4. But at this time these Hellenes also who had come to Artemision, <a href="#link8note-4" id="link8noteref-4" class="pginternal">4</a> when
      they saw that a great number of ships had put in to Aphetai and that
      everything was filled with their armament, were struck with fear, because
      the fortunes of the Barbarians had different issue from that which they
      expected, and they deliberated about retreating from Artemision to the
      inner parts of Hellas. And the Euboeans perceiving that they were so
      deliberating, asked Eurybiades to stay there by them for a short time,
      until they should have removed out of their land their children, and their
      households; and as they did not persuade him, they went elsewhere and
      persuaded Themistocles the commander of the Athenians by a payment of
      thirty talents, the condition being that the fleet should stay and fight
      the sea-battle in front of Euboea.
    </p>
<p>
      5. Themistocles then caused the Hellenes to stay in the following manner:—to
      Eurybiades he imparted five talents of the sum with the pretence that he
      was giving it from himself; and when Eurybiades had been persuaded by him
      to change his resolution, Adeimantos son of Okytos, the Corinthian
      commander, was the only one of all the others who still made a struggle,
      saying that he would sail away from Artemision and would not stay with the
      others: to him therefore Themistocles said with an oath: "Thou at least
      shalt not leave us, for I will give thee greater gifts than the king of
      the Medes would send to thee, if thou shouldest desert thy allies." Thus
      he spoke, and at the same time he sent to the ship of Adeimantos three
      talents of silver. So these all <a href="#link8note-5" id="link8noteref-5" class="pginternal">5</a> had been persuaded by
      gifts to change their resolution, and at the same time the request of the
      Euboeans had been gratified and Themistocles himself gained money; and it
      was not known that he had the rest of the money, but those who received a
      share of this money were fully persuaded that it had come from the
      Athenian State for this purpose.
    </p>
<p>
      6. Thus they remained in Euboea and fought a sea-battle; and it came to
      pass as follows:—when the Barbarians had arrived at Aphetai about
      the beginning of the afternoon, having been informed even before they came
      that a few ships of the Hellenes were stationed about Artemision and now
      seeing them for themselves, they were eager to attack them, to see if they
      could capture them. Now they did not think it good yet to sail against
      them directly for this reason,—for fear namely that the Hellenes,
      when they saw them sailing against them, should set forth to take flight
      and darkness should come upon them in their flight; and so they were
      likely (thought the Persians) <a href="#link8note-6" id="link8noteref-6" class="pginternal">6</a> to get away; whereas it was right, according to
      their calculation, that not even the fire-bearer <a href="#link8note-7" id="link8noteref-7" class="pginternal">7</a> should escape and save his
      life.
    </p>
<p>
      7. With a view to this then they contrived as follows:—of the whole
      number of their ships they parted off two hundred and sent them round to
      sail by Caphereus and round Geriastos to the Euripos, going outside
      Skiathos so that they might not be sighted by the enemy as they sailed
      round Euboea: and their purpose was that with these coming up by that way,
      and blocking the enemies' retreat, and themselves advancing against them
      directly, they might surround them on all sides. Having formed this plan
      they proceeded to send off the ships which were appointed for this, and
      they themselves had no design of attacking the Hellenes on that day nor
      until the signal agreed upon should be displayed to them by those who were
      sailing round, to show that they had arrived. These ships, I say, they
      were sending round, and meanwhile they were numbering the rest at Aphetai.
    </p>
<p>
      8. During this time, while these were numbering their ships, it happened
      thus:—there was in that camp a man of Skione named Skyllias, as a
      diver the best of all the men of that time, who also in the shipwreck
      which took place by Pelion had saved for the Persians many of their goods
      and many of them also he had acquired for himself: this Skyllias it
      appears had had an intention even before this of deserting to the side of
      the Hellenes, but it had not been possible for him to do so then. In what
      manner after this attempt he did actually come to the Hellenes, I am not
      able to say with certainty, but I marvel if the tale is true which is
      reported; for it is said that he dived into the sea at Aphetai and did not
      come up till he reached Artemision, having traversed here somewhere about
      eighty furlongs through the sea. Now there are told about this man several
      other tales which seem likely to be false, but some also which are true:
      about this matter however let it be stated as my opinion that he came to
      Artemision in a boat. Then when he had come, he forthwith informed the
      commanders about the shipwreck, how it had come to pass, and of the ships
      which had been sent away to go round Euboea.
    </p>
<p>
      9. Hearing this the Hellenes considered the matter with one another; and
      after many things had been spoken, the prevailing opinion was that they
      should remain there that day and encamp on shore, and then, when midnight
      was past, they should set forth and go to meet those ships which were
      sailing round. After this however, as no one sailed out to attack them,
      they waited for the coming of the late hours of the afternoon and sailed
      out themselves to attack the Barbarians, desiring to make a trial both of
      their manner of fighting and of the trick of breaking their line. <a href="#link8note-8" id="link8noteref-8" class="pginternal">8</a>
</p>
<p>
      10. And seeing them sailing thus against them with few ships, not only the
      others in the army of Xerxes but also their commanders judged them to be
      moved by mere madness, and they themselves also put out their ships to
      sea, supposing that they would easily capture them: and their expectation
      was reasonable enough, since they saw that the ships of the Hellenes were
      few, while theirs were many times as numerous and sailed better. Setting
      their mind then on this, they came round and enclosed them in the middle.
      Then so many of the Ionians as were kindly disposed to the Hellenes and
      were serving in the expedition against their will, counted it a matter of
      great grief to themselves when they saw them being surrounded and felt
      assured that not one of them would return home, so feeble did they think
      the power of the Hellenes to be; while those to whom that which was
      happening was a source of pleasure, were vying with one another, each one
      endeavouring to be the first to take an Athenian ship and receive gifts
      from the king: for in their camps there was more report of the Athenians
      than of any others.
    </p>
<p>
      11. The Hellenes meanwhile, when the signal was given, first set
      themselves with prows facing the Barbarians and drew the sterns of their
      ships together in the middle; and when the signal was given a second time,
      although shut off in a small space and prow against prow, <a href="#link8note-9" id="link8noteref-9" class="pginternal">9</a> they
      set to work vigorously; and they captured thirty ships of the Barbarians
      and also Philaon the son of Chersis, the brother of Gorgos kind of the
      Salaminians, who was a man of great repute in the army. Now the first of
      the Hellenes who captured a ship of the enemy was an Athenian, Lycomedes
      the son of Aischraios, and he received the prize for valour. So these, as
      they were contending in this sea-fight with doubtful result, were parted
      from one another by the coming on of night. The Hellenes accordingly
      sailed away to Artemision and the Barbarians to Aphetai, the contest
      having been widely different from their expectation. In this sea-fight
      Antidoros of Lemnos alone of the Hellenes who were with the king deserted
      to the side of the Hellenes, and the Athenians on account of this deed
      gave him a piece of land in Salamis.
    </p>
<p>
      12. When the darkness had come on, although the season was the middle of
      summer, yet there came on very abundant rain, which lasted through the
      whole of the night, with crashing thunder <a href="#link8note-10" id="link8noteref-10" class="pginternal">10</a> from Mount Pelion; and
      the dead bodies and pieces of wreck were cast up at Aphetai and became
      entangled round the prows of the ships and struck against the blades of
      the oars: and the men of the army who were there, hearing these things
      became afraid, expecting that they would certainly perish, to such
      troubles had they come; for before they had had even breathing space after
      the shipwreck and the storm which had arisen off Mount Pelion, there had
      come upon them a hard sea-fight, and after the sea-fight a violent storm
      of rain and strong streams rushing to the sea and crashing thunder.
    </p>
<p>
      13. These then had such a night as I have said; and meanwhile those of
      them who had been appointed to sail round Euboea experienced the very same
      night, but against them it raged much more fiercely, inasmuch as it fell
      upon them while they were making their course in the open sea. And the end
      of it proved distressful <a href="#link8note-11" id="link8noteref-11" class="pginternal">11</a> to them; for when the storm and the rain
      together came upon them as they sailed, being then off the "Hollows" of
      Euboea, <a href="#link8note-12" id="link8noteref-12" class="pginternal">12</a>
      they were borne by the wind not knowing by what way they were carried, and
      were cast away upon the rocks. And all this was being brought about by God
      in order that the Persian force might be made more equal to that of the
      Hellenes and might not be by very much the larger.
    </p>
<p>
      14. These then, I say, were perishing about the Hollows of Euboea, and
      meanwhile the Barbarians at Aphetai, when day had dawned upon them, of
      which they were glad, were keeping their ships quiet, and were satisfied
      in their evil plight to remain still for the present time; but to the
      Hellenes there came as a reinforcement three-and-fifty Athenian ships. The
      coming of these gave them more courage, and at the same time they were
      encouraged also by a report that those of the Barbarians who had been
      sailing round Euboea had all been destroyed by the storm that had taken
      place. They waited then for the same time of day as before, and then they
      sailed and fell upon some Kilikian ships; and having destroyed these, they
      sailed away when the darkness came on, and returned to Artemision.
    </p>
<p>
      15. On the third day the commanders of the Barbarians, being exceedingly
      indignant that so small a number of ships should thus do them damage, and
      fearing what Xerxes might do, did not wait this time for the Hellenes to
      begin the fight, but passed the word of command and put out their ships to
      sea about the middle of the day. Now it so happened that these battles at
      sea and the battles on land at Thermopylai took place on the same days;
      and for those who fought by sea the whole aim of the fighting was
      concerned with the channel of Euripos, just as the aim of Leonidas and of
      his band was to guard the pass: the Hellenes accordingly exhorted one
      another not to let the Barbarians go by into Hellas; while these cheered
      one another on to destroy the fleet of the Hellenes and to get possession
      of the straits.
    </p>
<p>
      16. Now while the forces of Xerxes were sailing in order towards them, the
      Hellenes kept quiet at Artemision; and the Barbarians, having made a
      crescent of their ships that they might enclose them, were endeavouring to
      surround them. Then the Hellenes put out to sea and engaged with them; and
      in this battle the two sides were nearly equal to one another; for the
      fleet of Xerxes by reason of its great size and numbers suffered damage
      from itself, since the ships were thrown into confusion and ran into one
      another: nevertheless it stood out and did not give way, for they
      disdained to be turned to flight by so few ships. Many ships therefore of
      the Hellenes were destroyed and many men perished, but many more ships and
      men of the Barbarians. Thus contending they parted and went each to their
      own place.
    </p>
<p>
      17. In this sea-fight the Egyptians did best of the men who fought for
      Xerxes; and these, besides other great deeds which they displayed,
      captured five ships of the Hellenes together with their crews: while of
      the Hellenes those who did best on this day were the Athenians, and of the
      Athenians Cleinias the son of Alkibiades, who was serving with two hundred
      man and a ship of his own, furnishing the expense at his own proper cost.
    </p>
<p>
      18. Having parted, both sides gladly hastened to their moorings; and after
      they had separated and got away out of the sea-fight, although the
      Hellenes had possession of the bodies of the dead and of the wrecks of the
      ships, yet having suffered severely <a href="#link8note-13" id="link8noteref-13" class="pginternal">13</a> (and especially the
      Athenians, of whose ships half had been disabled), they were deliberating
      now about retreating to the inner parts of Hellas.
    </p>
<p>
      19. Themistocles however had conceived that if there should be detached
      from the force of the Barbarians the Ionian and Carian nations, they would
      be able to overcome the rest; and when the people of Euboea were driving
      their flocks down to that sea, <a href="#link8note-14" id="link8noteref-14" class="pginternal">14</a> he assembled the
      generals and said to them that he thought he had a device by which he
      hoped to cause the best of the king's allies to leave him. This matter he
      revealed to that extent only; and with regard to their present
      circumstances, he said that they must do as follows:—every one must
      slaughter of the flocks of the Euboeans as many as he wanted, for it was
      better that their army should have them than the enemy; moreover he
      advised that each one should command his own men to kindle a fire: and as
      for the time of their departure he would see to it in such wise that they
      should come safe to Hellas. This they were content to do, and forthwith
      when they had kindled a fire they turned their attention to the flocks.
    </p>
<p>
      20. For in fact the Euboeans, neglecting the oracle of Bakis as if it had
      no meaning at all, had neither carried away anything from their land nor
      laid in any store of provisions with a view to war coming upon them, and
      by their conduct moreover they had brought trouble upon themselves. <a href="#link8note-15" id="link8noteref-15" class="pginternal">15</a>
      For the oracle uttered by Bakis about these matters runs as follows:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Mark, when a man, a Barbarian, shall yoke the Sea with papyrus,
  Then do thou plan to remove the loud-bleating goats from Euboea."
</pre>
<p>
      In the evils which at this time were either upon them or soon to be
      expected they might feel not a little sorry that they had paid no
      attention to these lines.
    </p>
<p>
      21. While these were thus engaged, there came to them the scout from
      Trachis: for there was at Artemision a scout named Polyas, by birth of
      Antikyra, to whom it had been appointed, if the fleet should be disabled,
      <a href="#link8note-16" id="link8noteref-16" class="pginternal">16</a>
      to signify this to those at Thermopylai, and he had a vessel equipped and
      ready for this purpose; and similarly there was with Leonidas Abronichos
      son of Lysicles, an Athenian, ready to carry news to those at Artemision
      with a thirty-oared galley, if any disaster should happen to the
      land-army. This Abronichos then had arrived, and he proceeded to signify
      to them that which had come to pass about Leonidas and his army; and then
      when they were informed of it no longer put off their retreat, but set
      forth in the order in which they were severally posted, the Corinthians
      first and the Athenians last.
    </p>
<p>
      22. Themistocles however selected those ships of the Athenians which
      sailed best, and went round to the springs of drinking-water, cutting
      inscriptions on the stones there, which the Ionians read when they came to
      Artemision on the following day. These inscriptions ran thus: "Ionians, ye
      act not rightly in making expedition against the fathers of your race and
      endeavouring to enslave Hellas. Best of all were it that ye should come
      and be on our side; but if that may not be done by you, stand aside even
      now from the combat against us and ask the Carians to do the same as ye.
      If however neither of these two things is possible to be done, and ye are
      bound down by too strong compulsion to be able to make revolt, then in the
      action, when we engage battle, be purposely slack, remember that ye are
      descended from us and that our quarrel with the Barbarian took its rise at
      the first from you." Themistocles wrote thus, having, as I suppose, two
      things together in his mind, namely that either the inscriptions might
      elude the notice of the king and cause the Ionians to change and come over
      to the side on which he was, or that having been reported and denounced to
      Xerxes they might cause the Ionians to be distrusted by him, and so he
      might keep them apart from the sea-fights.
    </p>
<p>
      23. Themistocles then had set these inscriptions: and to the Barbarians
      there came immediately after these things a man of Histaia in a boat
      bringing word of the retreat of the Hellenes from Artemision. They
      however, not believing it, kept the messenger under guard and sent
      swift-sailing ships to look on before. Then these having reported the
      facts, at last as daylight was spreading over the sky, the whole armament
      sailed in a body to Artemision; and having stayed at this place till
      mid-day, after this they sailed to Histaia, and there arrived they took
      possession of the city of Histaia and overran all the villages which lie
      along the coast in the region of Ellopia, which is the land of Histaia.
    </p>
<p>
      24. While they were there, Xerxes, after he had made his dispositions with
      regard to the bodies of the dead, sent a herald to the fleet: and the
      dispositions which he made beforehand were as follows:—for all those
      of his army who were lying dead at Thermopylai, (and there were as many as
      twenty thousand in all), with the exception of about a thousand whom he
      left, he dug trenches and buried them, laying over them leaves and heaping
      earth upon them, that they might not be seen by the men of the fleet. Then
      when the herald had gone over to Histaia, he gathered an assembly of the
      whole force and spoke these words: "Allies, king Xerxes grants permission
      to any one of you who desires it, to leave his post and to come and see
      how he fights against those most senseless men who looked to overcome the
      power of the king."
    </p>
<p>
      25. When the herald had proclaimed this, then boats were of all things
      most in request, so many were they who desired to see this sight; and when
      they had passed over they went through the dead bodies and looked at them:
      and every one supposed that those who were lying there were all
      Lacedemonians or Thespians, though the Helots also were among those that
      they saw: however, they who had passed over did not fail to perceive that
      Xerxes had done that which I mentioned about the bodies of his own dead;
      for in truth it was a thing to cause laughter even: on the one side there
      were seen a thousand dead bodies lying, while the others lay all gathered
      together in the same place, four thousand <a href="#link8note-17" id="link8noteref-17" class="pginternal">17</a> of them. During this
      day then they busied themselves with looking, and on the day after this
      they sailed back to the ships at Histaia, while Xerxes and his army set
      forth upon their march.
    </p>
<p>
      26. There had come also to them a few deserters from Arcadia, men in want
      of livelihood and desiring to be employed. These the Persians brought into
      the king's presence and inquired about the Hellenes, what they were doing;
      and one man it was who asked them this for all the rest. They told them
      that the Hellenes were keeping the Olympic festival and were looking on at
      a contest of athletics and horsemanship. He then inquired again, what was
      the prize proposed to them, for the sake of which they contended; and they
      told them of the wreath of olive which is given. Then Tigranes <a href="#link8note-18" id="link8noteref-18" class="pginternal">18</a>
      the son of Artabanos uttered a thought which was most noble, though
      thereby he incurred from the king the reproach of cowardice: for hearing
      that the prize was a wreath and not money, he could not endure to keep
      silence, but in the presence of all he spoke these words: "Ah! Mardonios,
      what kind of men are these against whom thou hast brought us to fight, who
      make their contest not for money but for honour!" Thus was it spoken by
      this man.
    </p>
<p>
      27. In the meantime, so soon as the disaster at Thermopylai had come
      about, the Thessalians sent a herald forthwith to the Phokians, against
      whom they had a grudge always, but especially because of the latest
      disaster which they had suffered: for when both the Thessalians themselves
      and their allies had invaded the Phokian land not many years before this
      expedition of the king, they had been defeated by the Phokians and handled
      by them roughly. For the Phokians had been shut up in Mount Parnassos
      having with them a soothsayer, Tellias the Eleian; and this Tellias
      contrived for them a device of the following kind:—he took six
      hundred men, the best of the Phokians, and whitened them over with chalk,
      both themselves and their armour, and then he attacked the Thessalians by
      night, telling the Phokians beforehand to slay every man whom they should
      see not coloured over with white. So not only the sentinels of the
      Thessalians, who saw these first, were terrified by them, supposing it to
      be something portentous and other than it was, but also after the
      sentinels the main body of their army; so that the Phokians remained in
      possession of four thousand bodies of slain men and shields; of which last
      they dedicated half at Abai and half at Delphi; and from the tithe of
      booty got by this battle were made the large statues which are contending
      for the tripod in front of the temple <a href="#link8note-19" id="link8noteref-19" class="pginternal">19</a> at Delphi, and others
      similar to these are dedicated as an offering at Abai.
    </p>
<p>
      28. Thus had the Phokians done to the Thessalian footmen, when they were
      besieged by them; and they had done irreparable hurt to their cavalry
      also, when this had invaded their land: for in the pass which is by
      Hyampolis they had dug a great trench and laid down in it empty wine-jars;
      and then having carried earth and laid it on the top and made it like the
      rest of the ground, they waited for the Thessalians to invade their land.
      These supposing that they would make short work with the Phokians, <a href="#link8note-20" id="link8noteref-20" class="pginternal">20</a>
      riding in full course fell upon the wine-jars; and there the legs of their
      horses were utterly crippled.
    </p>
<p>
      29. Bearing then a grudge for both of these things, the Thessalians sent a
      herald and addressed them thus: "Phokians, we advise you to be more
      disposed now to change your minds and to admit that ye are not on a level
      with us: for in former times among the Hellenes, so long as it pleased us
      to be on that side, we always had the preference over you, and now we have
      such great power with the Barbarian that it rests with us to cause you to
      be deprived of your land and to be sold into slavery also. We however,
      though we have all the power in our hands, do not bear malice, but let
      there be paid to us fifty talents of silver in return for this, and we
      will engage to avert the dangers which threaten to come upon your land."
    </p>
<p>
      30. Thus the Thessalians proposed to them; for the Phokians alone of all
      the people in those parts were not taking the side of the Medes, and this
      for no other reason, as I conjecture, but only because of their enmity
      with the Thessalians; and if the Thessalians had supported the cause of
      the Hellenes, I am of opinion that the Phokians would have been on the
      side of the Medes. When the Thessalians proposed this, they said that they
      would not give the money, and that it was open to them to take the Median
      side just as much as the Thessalians, if they desired it for other
      reasons; but they would not with their own will be traitors to Hellas.
    </p>
<p>
      31. When these words were reported, then the Thessalians, moved with anger
      against the Phokians, became guides to the Barbarian to show him the way:
      and from the land of Trachis they entered Doris; for a narrow strip <a href="#link8note-21" id="link8noteref-21" class="pginternal">21</a> of
      the Dorian territory extends this way, about thirty furlongs in breadth,
      lying between Malis and Phokis, the region which was in ancient time
      called Dryopis; this land is the mother-country of the Dorians in
      Peloponnese. Now the Barbarians did not lay waste this land of Doris when
      they entered it, for the people of it were taking the side of the Medes,
      and also the Thessalians did not desire it.
    </p>
<p>
      32. When however from Doris they entered Phokis, they did not indeed
      capture the Phokians themselves; for some of them had gone up to the
      heights of Parnassos,—and that summit of Parnassos is very
      convenient to receive a large number, which lies by itself near the city
      of Neon, the name of it being Tithorea,—to this, I say, some of them
      had carried up their goods and gone up themselves; but most of them had
      conveyed their goods out to the Ozolian Locrians, to the city of Amphissa,
      which is situated above the Crissaian plain. The Barbarians however
      overran the whole land of Phokis, for so the Thessalians led their army,
      and all that they came to as they marched they burned or cut down, and
      delivered to the flames both the cities and the temples:
    </p>
<p>
      33, for they laid everything waste, proceeding this way by the river
      Kephisos, and they destroyed the city of Drymos by fire, and also the
      following, namely Charadra, Erochos, Tethronion, Amphikaia, Neon, Pedieis,
      Triteis, Elateia, Hyampolis, Parapotamioi and Abai, at which last-named
      place there was a temple of Apollo, wealthy and furnished with treasuries
      and votive offerings in abundance; and there was then, as there is even
      now, the seat of an Oracle there: this temple they plundered and burnt.
      Some also of the Phokians they pursued and captured upon the mountains,
      and some women they did to death by repeated outrage.
    </p>
<p>
      34. Passing by Parapotamioi the Barbarians came to Panopeus, and from this
      point onwards their army was separated and went different ways. The
      largest and strongest part of the army, proceeding with Xerxes himself
      against Athens, entered the land of the Boeotians, coming into the
      territory of Orchomenos. Now the general body of the Boeotians was taking
      the side of the Medes, and their cities were being kept by Macedonians
      appointed for each, who had been sent by Alexander; and they were keeping
      them this aim, namely in order to make it plain to Xerxes that the
      Boeotians were disposed to be on the side of the Medes.
    </p>
<p>
      35. These, I say, of the Barbarians took their way in this direction; but
      others of them with guides had set forth to go to the temple at Delphi,
      keeping Parnassos on their right hand: and all the parts of Phokis over
      which these marched they ravaged; for they set fire to the towns of
      Panopeus and Daulis and Aiolis. And for this reason they marched in that
      direction, parted off from the rest of the army, namely in order that they
      might plunder the temple at Delphi and deliver over the treasures there to
      king Xerxes: and Xerxes was well acquainted with all that there was in it
      of any account, better, I am told, than with the things which he had left
      in his own house at home, seeing that many constantly reported of them,
      and especially of the votive offerings of Croesus the son of Alyattes.
    </p>
<p>
      36. Meanwhile the Delphians, having been informed of this, had been
      brought to extreme fear; and being in great terror they consulted the
      Oracle about the sacred things, whether they should bury them in the earth
      or carry them forth to another land; but the god forbade them to meddle
      with these, saying that he was able by himself to take care of his own.
      Hearing this they began to take thought for themselves, and they sent
      their children and women over to Achaia on the other side of the sea,
      while most of the men themselves ascended up towards the summits of
      Parnassos and carried their property to the Corykian cave, while others
      departed for refuge to Amphissa of the Locrians. In short the Delphians
      had all left the town excepting sixty men and the prophet of the Oracle.
      <a href="#link8note-22" id="link8noteref-22" class="pginternal">22</a>
</p>
<p>
      37. When the Barbarians had come near and could see the temple, then the
      prophet, whose name was Akeratos, saw before the cell <a href="#link8note-23" id="link8noteref-23" class="pginternal">23</a>
      arms lying laid out, having been brought forth out of the sanctuary, <a href="#link8note-24" id="link8noteref-24" class="pginternal">24</a>
      which were sacred and on which it was not permitted to any man to lay
      hands. He then was going to announce the portent to those of the Delphians
      who were still there, but when the Barbarians pressing onwards came
      opposite the temple of Athene Pronaia, there happened to them in addition
      portents yet greater than that which had come to pass before: for though
      that too was a marvel, that arms of war should appear of themselves laid
      forth outside the cell, yet this, which happened straightway after that,
      is worthy of marvel even beyond all other prodigies. When the Barbarians
      in their approach were opposite the temple of Athene Pronaia, at this
      point of time from the heaven there fell thunderbolts upon them, and from
      Parnassos two crags were broken away and rushed down upon them with a
      great crashing noise falling upon many of them, while from the temple of
      Pronaia there was heard a shout, and a battle-cry was raised.
    </p>
<p>
      38. All these things having come together, there fell fear upon the
      Barbarians; and the Delphians having perceived that they were flying, came
      down after them and slew a great number of them; and those who survived
      fled straight to Boeotia. These who returned of the Barbarians reported,
      as I am informed, that in addition to this which we have said they saw
      also other miraculous things; for two men (they said) in full armour and
      of stature more than human followed them slaying and pursuing.
    </p>
<p>
      39. These two the Delphians say were the native heroes Phylacos and
      Autonoös, whose sacred enclosures are about the temple, that of Phylacos
      being close by the side of the road above the temple of Pronaia and that
      of Autonoös near Castalia under the peak called Hyampeia. Moreover the
      rocks which fell from Parnassos were still preserved even to my time,
      lying in the sacred enclosure of Athene Pronaia, into which they fell when
      they rushed through the ranks of the Barbarians. Such departure had these
      men from the temple.
    </p>
<p>
      40. Meanwhile the fleet of the Hellenes after leaving Artemision put in to
      land at Salamis at the request of the Athenians: and for this reason the
      Athenians requested them to put in to Salamis, namely in order that they
      might remove out of Attica to a place of safety their children and their
      wives, and also deliberate what they would have to do; for in their
      present case they meant to take counsel afresh, because they had been
      deceived in their expectation. For they had thought to find the
      Peloponnesians in full force waiting for the Barbarians in Boeotia; they
      found however nothing of this, but they were informed on the contrary that
      the Peloponnesians were fortifying the Isthmus with a wall, valuing above
      all things the safety of the Peloponnese and keeping this in guard; and
      that they were disposed to let all else go. Being informed of this, the
      Athenians therefore made request of them to put in to Salamis.
    </p>
<p>
      41. The others then put in their ships to land at Salamis, but the
      Athenians went over to their own land; and after their coming they made a
      proclamation that every one of the Athenians should endeavour to save his
      children and household as best he could. So the greater number sent them
      to Troizen, but others to Egina, and others to Salamis, and they were
      urgent to put these out of danger, both because they desired to obey the
      oracle and also especially for another reason, which was this:—the
      Athenians say that a great serpent lives in the temple <a href="#link8note-25" id="link8noteref-25" class="pginternal">25</a>
      and guards the Acropolis; and they not only say this, but also they set
      forth for it monthly offerings, as if it were really there; and the
      offering consists of a honey-cake. This honey-cake, which before used
      always to be consumed, was at this time left untouched. When the priestess
      had signified this, the Athenians left the city much more and with greater
      eagerness than before, seeing that the goddess also had (as they supposed)
      left the Acropolis. Then when all their belongings had been removed out of
      danger, they sailed to the encampment of the fleet.
    </p>
<p>
      42. When those who came from Artemision had put their ships in to land at
      Salamis, the remainder of the naval force of the Hellenes, being informed
      of this, came over gradually to join them <a href="#link8note-26" id="link8noteref-26" class="pginternal">26</a> from Troizen: for they
      had been ordered beforehand to assemble at Pogon, which is the harbour of
      the Troizenians. There were assembled accordingly now many more ships than
      those which were in the sea-fight at Artemision, and from more cities.
      Over the whole was set as admiral the same man as at Artemision, namely
      Eurybiades the son of Eurycleides, a Spartan but not of the royal house;
      the Athenians however supplied by far the greatest number of ships and
      those which sailed the best.
    </p>
<p>
      43. The following were those who joined the muster:—From Peloponnese
      the Lacedemonians furnishing sixteen ships, the Corinthians furnishing the
      same complement as at Artemision, the Sikyonians furnishing fifteen ships,
      the Epidaurians ten, the Troizenians five, the men of Hermion <a href="#link8note-2601" id="link8noteref-2601" class="pginternal">2601</a>
      three, these all, except the Hermionians, being of Doric and Makednian <a href="#link8note-27" id="link8noteref-27" class="pginternal">27</a>
      race and having made their last migration from Erineos and Pindos and the
      land of Dryopis; <a href="#link8note-28" id="link8noteref-28" class="pginternal">28</a> but the people of Hermion are Dryopians,
      driven out by Heracles and the Malians from the land which is now called
      Doris.
    </p>
<p>
      44. These were the Peloponnesians who joined the fleet, and those of the
      mainland outside the Peloponnese were as follows:—the Athenians,
      furnishing a number larger than all the rest, <a href="#link8note-29" id="link8noteref-29" class="pginternal">29</a> namely one hundred and
      eighty ships, and serving alone, since the Plataians did not take part
      with the Athenians in the sea-fight at Salamis, because when the Hellenes
      were departing from Artemision and come near Chalkis, the Plataians
      disembarked on the opposite shore of Boeotia and proceeded to the removal
      of their households. So being engaged in saving these, they had been left
      behind. As for the Athenians, in the time when the Pelasgians occupied
      that which is now called Hellas, they were Pelasgians, being named
      Cranaoi, and in the time of king Kecrops they came to be called
      Kecropidai; then when Erechtheus had succeeded to his power, they had
      their name changed to Athenians; and after Ion the son of Xuthos became
      commander <a href="#link8note-30" id="link8noteref-30" class="pginternal">30</a> of the Athenians, they got the name from him
      of Ionians.
    </p>
<p>
      45. The Megarians furnished the same complement as at Artermision; the
      Amprakiots came to the assistance of the rest with seven ships, and the
      Leucadians with three, these being by race Dorians from Corinth.
    </p>
<p>
      46. Of the islanders the Eginetans furnished thirty; these had also other
      ships manned, but with them they were guarding their own land, while with
      the thirty which sailed best they joined in the sea-fight at Salamis. Now
      the Eginetans are Dorians from Epidauros, and their island had formerly
      the name of Oinone. After the Eginetans came the Chalkidians with the
      twenty ships which were at Artemision, and the Eretrians with their seven:
      these are Ionians. Next the Keïans, furnishing the same as before and
      being by race Ionians from Athens. The Naxians furnished four ships, they
      having been sent out by the citizens of their State to join the Persians,
      like the other islanders; but neglecting these commands they had come to
      the Hellenes, urged thereto by Democritos, a man of repute among the
      citizens and at that time commander of a trireme. Now the Naxians are
      Ionians coming originally from Athens. The Styrians furnished the same
      ships as at Artemision, and the men of Kythnos one ship and one
      fifty-oared galley, these both being Dryopians. Also the Seriphians, the
      Siphnians and the Melians served with the rest; for they alone of the
      islanders had not given earth and water to the Barbarian.
    </p>
<p>
      47. These all who have been named dwelt inside the land of the
      Thesprotians and the river Acheron; for the Thesprotians border upon the
      land of the Amprakiots and Leucadians, and these were they who came from
      the greatest distance to serve: but of those who dwell outside these
      limits the men of Croton were the only people who came to the assistance
      of Hellas in her danger; and these sent one ship, of whom the commander
      was Phaÿlos, a man who had three times won victories at the Pythian games.
      Now the men of Croton are by descent Achaians.
    </p>
<p>
      48. All the rest who served in the fleet furnished triremes, but the
      Melians, Siphnian and Seriphians fifty-oared galleys: the Melians, who are
      by descent from Lacedemon, furnished two, the Siphnians and Seriphians,
      who are Ionians from Athens, each one. And the whole number of the ships,
      apart from the fifty-oared galleys, was three hundred and seventy-eight.
      <a href="#link8note-31" id="link8noteref-31" class="pginternal">31</a>
</p>
<p>
      49. When the commanders had assembled at Salamis from the States which
      have been mentioned, they began to deliberate, Eurybiades having proposed
      that any one who desired it should declare his opinion as to where he
      thought it most convenient to fight a sea-battle in those regions of which
      they had command; for Attica had already been let go, and he was now
      proposing the question about the other regions. And the opinions of the
      speakers for the most part agreed that they should sail to the Isthmus and
      there fight a sea-battle in defence of the Peloponnese, arguing that if
      they should be defeated in the sea-battle, supposing them to be at Salamis
      they would be blockaded in an island, where no help would come to them,
      but at the Isthmus they would be able to land where their own men were.
    </p>
<p>
      50. While the commanders from the Peloponnese argued thus, an Athenian had
      come in reporting that the Barbarians were arrived in Attica and that all
      the land was being laid waste with fire. For the army which directed its
      march through Boeotia in company with Xerxes, after it had burnt the city
      of the Thespians (the inhabitants having left it and gone to the
      Peloponnese) and that of the Plataians likewise, had now come to Athens
      and was laying waste everything in those regions. Now he had burnt
      Thespiai <a href="#link8note-3101" id="link8noteref-3101" class="pginternal">3101</a> and Plataia because he was informed by the
      Thebans that these were not taking the side of the Medes.
    </p>
<p>
      51. So in three months from the crossing of the Hellespont, whence the
      Barbarians began their march, after having stayed there one month while
      they crossed over into Europe, they had reached Attica, in the year when
      Calliades was archon of the Athenians. And they took the lower city, which
      was deserted, and then they found that there were still a few Athenians
      left in the temple, either stewards of the temple or needy persons, who
      had barred the entrance to the Acropolis with doors and with a palisade of
      timber and endeavoured to defend themselves against the attacks of the
      enemy, being men who had not gone out to Salamis partly because of their
      poverty, and also because they thought that they alone had discovered the
      meaning of the oracle which the Pythian prophetess had uttered to them,
      namely that the "bulwark of wood" should be impregnable, and supposed that
      this was in fact the safe refuge according to the oracle, and not the
      ships.
    </p>
<p>
      52. So the Persians taking their post upon the rising ground opposite the
      Acropolis, which the Athenians call the Hill of Ares, <a href="#link8note-32" id="link8noteref-32" class="pginternal">32</a>
      proceeded to besiege them in this fashion, that is they put tow round
      about their arrows and lighted it, and then shot them against the
      palisade. The Athenians who were besieged continued to defend themselves
      nevertheless, although they had come to the extremity of distress and
      their palisade had played them false; nor would they accept proposals for
      surrender, when the sons of Peisistratos brought them forward: but
      endeavouring to defend themselves they contrived several contrivances
      against the enemy, and among the rest they rolled down large stones when
      the Barbarians approached the gates; so that for a long time Xerxes was in
      a difficulty, not being able to capture them.
    </p>
<p>
      53. In time however there appeared for the Barbarians a way of approach
      after their difficulties, since by the oracle it was destined that all of
      Attica which is on the mainland should come to be under the Persians. Thus
      then it happened that on the front side <a href="#link8note-33" id="link8noteref-33" class="pginternal">33</a> of the Acropolis behind
      the gates and the way up to the entrance, in a place where no one was
      keeping guard, nor would one have supposed that any man could ascend by
      this way, here men ascended by the temple of Aglauros the daughter of
      Kecrops, although indeed the place is precipitous: and when the Athenians
      saw that they had ascended up to the Acropolis, some of them threw
      themselves down from the wall and perished, while others took refuge in
      the sanctuary <a href="#link8note-34" id="link8noteref-34" class="pginternal">34</a> of the temple. Then those of the Persians who
      had ascended went first to the gates, and after opening these they
      proceeded to kill the suppliants; and when all had been slain by them,
      they plundered the temple and set fire to the whole of the Acropolis.
    </p>
<p>
      54. Then Xerxes, having fully taken possession of Athens, sent to Susa a
      mounted messenger to report to Artabanos the good success which they had.
      And on the next day after sending the herald he called together the exiles
      of the Athenians who were accompanying him, and bade them go up to the
      Acropolis and sacrifice the victims after their own manner; whether it was
      that he had seen some vision of a dream which caused him to give this
      command, or whether perchance he had a scruple in his mind because he had
      set fire to the temple. The Athenian exiles did accordingly that which was
      commanded them:
    </p>
<p>
      55, and the reason why I made mention of this I will here declare:—there
      is in this Acropolis a temple <a href="#link8note-35" id="link8noteref-35" class="pginternal">35</a> of Erechtheus, who is
      said to have been born of the Earth, and in this there is an olive-tree
      and a sea, which (according to the story told by the Athenians) Poseidon
      and Athene, when they contended for the land, set as witnesses of
      themselves. Now it happened to this olive-tree to be set on fire with the
      rest of the temple by the Barbarians; and on the next day after the
      conflagration those of the Athenians who were commanded by the king to
      offer sacrifice, saw when they had gone up to the temple that a shoot had
      run up from the stock of the tree about a cubit in length. These then made
      report of this.
    </p>
<p>
      56. The Hellenes meanwhile at Salamis, when it was announced to them how
      it had been as regards the Acropolis of the Athenians, were disturbed so
      greatly that some of the commanders did not even wait for the question to
      be decided which had been proposed, but began to go hastily to their ships
      and to put up their sails, meaning to make off with speed; and by those of
      them who remained behind it was finally decided to fight at sea in defence
      of the Isthmus. So night came on, and they having been dismissed from the
      council were going to their ships:
    </p>
<p>
      57, and when Themistocles had come to his ship, Mnesiphilos an Athenian
      asked him what they had resolved; and being informed by him that it had
      been determined to take out the ships to the Isthmus and fight a battle by
      sea in defence of the Peloponnese, he said: "Then, if they set sail with
      the ships from Salamis, thou wilt not fight any more sea-battles at all
      for the fatherland, for they will all take their way to their several
      cities and neither Eurybiades nor any other man will be able to detain
      them or to prevent the fleet from being dispersed: and Hellas will perish
      by reason of evil counsels. But if there by any means, go thou and try to
      unsettle that which has been resolved, if perchance thou mayest persuade
      Eurybiades to change his plans, so as to stay here."
    </p>
<p>
      58. This advice very much commended itself to Themistocles; and without
      making any answer he went to the ship of Eurybiades. Having come thither
      he said that he desired to communicate to him a matter which concerned the
      common good; and Eurybiades bade him come into his ship and speak, if he
      desired to say anything. Then Themistocles sitting down beside him
      repeated to him all those things which he had heard Mnesiphilos say,
      making as if they were his own thoughts, and adding to them many others;
      until at last by urgent request he persuaded him to come out of his ship
      and gather the commanders to the council.
    </p>
<p>
      59. So when they were gathered together, before Eurybiades proposed the
      discussion of the things for which he had assembled the commanders,
      Themistocles spoke with much vehemence <a href="#link8note-36" id="link8noteref-36" class="pginternal">36</a> being very eager to
      gain his end; and as he was speaking, the Corinthian commander, Adeimantos
      the son of Okytos, said: "Themistocles, at the games those who stand forth
      for the contest before the due time are beaten with rods." He justifying
      himself said: "Yes, but those who remain behind are not crowned."
    </p>
<p>
      60. At that time he made answer mildly to the Corinthian; and to
      Eurybiades he said not now any of those things which he had said before,
      to the effect that if they should set sail from Salamis they would
      disperse in different directions; for it was not seemly for him to bring
      charges against the allies in their presence: but he held to another way
      of reasoning, saying: "Now it is in thy power to save Hellas, if thou wilt
      follow my advice, which is to stay here and here to fight a sea-battle,
      and if thou wilt not follow the advice of those among these men who bid
      thee remove the ships to the Isthmus. For hear both ways, and then set
      them in comparison. If thou engage battle at the Isthmus, thou wilt fight
      in an open sea, into which it is by no means convenient for us that we go
      to fight, seeing that we have ships which are heavier and fewer in number
      than those of the enemy. Then secondly thou wilt give up to destruction
      Salamis and Megara and Egina, even if we have success in all else; for
      with their fleet will come also the land-army, and thus thou wilt thyself
      lead them to the Peloponnese and wilt risk the safety of all Hellas. If
      however thou shalt do as I say, thou wilt find therein all the advantages
      which I shall tell thee of:—in the first place by engaging in a
      narrow place with few ships against many, if the fighting has that issue
      which it is reasonable to expect, we shall have very much the better; for
      to fight a sea-fight in a narrow space is for our advantage, but to fight
      in a wide open space is for theirs. Then again Salamis will be preserved,
      whither our children and our wives have been removed for safety; and
      moreover there is this also secured thereby, to which ye are most of all
      attached, namely that by remaining here thou wilt fight in defence of the
      Peloponnese as much as if the fight were at the Isthmus; and thou wilt not
      lead the enemy to Peloponnese, if thou art wise. Then if that which I
      expect come to pass and we gain a victory with our ships, the Barbarians
      will not come to you at the Isthmus nor will they advance further than
      Attica, but they will retire in disorder; and we shall be the gainers by
      the preservation of Megara and Egina and Salamis, at which place too an
      oracle tells us that we shall get the victory over our enemies. <a href="#link8note-37" id="link8noteref-37" class="pginternal">37</a>
      Now when men take counsel reasonably for themselves, reasonable issues are
      wont as a rule to come, but if they do not take counsel reasonably, then
      God is not wont generally to attach himself to the judgment of men."
    </p>
<p>
      61. When Themistocles thus spoke, the Corinthian Adeimantos inveighed
      against him for the second time, bidding him to be silent because he had
      no native land, and urging Eurybiades not to put to the vote the proposal
      of one who was a citizen of no city; for he said that Themistocles might
      bring opinions before the council if he could show a city belonging to
      him, but otherwise not. This objection he made against him because Athens
      had been taken and was held by the enemy. Then Themistocles said many evil
      things of him and of the Corinthians both, and declared also that he
      himself and his countrymen had in truth a city and a land larger than that
      of the Corinthians, so long as they had two hundred ships fully manned;
      for none of the Hellenes would be able to repel the Athenians if they came
      to fight against them.
    </p>
<p>
      62. Signifying this he turned then to Eurybiades and spoke yet more
      urgently: "If thou wilt remain here, and remaining here wilt show thyself
      a good man, well; but if not, thou wilt bring about the overthrow of
      Hellas, for upon the ships depends all our power in the war. Nay, but do
      as I advise. If, however, thou shalt not do so, we shall forthwith take up
      our households and voyage to Siris in Italy, which is ours already of old
      and the oracles say that it is destined to be colonised by us; and ye,
      when ye are left alone and deprived of allies such as we are, will
      remember my words."
    </p>
<p>
      63. When Themistocles thus spoke, Eurybiades was persuaded to change his
      mind; and, as I think, he changed his mind chiefly from fear lest the
      Athenians should depart and leave them, if he should take the ships to the
      Isthmus; for if the Athenians left them and departed, the rest would be no
      longer able to fight with the enemy. He chose then this counsel, to stay
      in that place and decide matters there by a sea-fight.
    </p>
<p>
      64. Thus those at Salamis, after having skirmished with one another in
      speech, were making preparations for a sea-fight there, since Eurybiades
      had so determined: and as day was coming on, at the same time when the sun
      rose there was an earthquake felt both on the land and on the sea: and
      they determined to pray to the gods and to call upon the sons of Aiacos to
      be their helpers. And as they had determined, so also they did; for when
      they had prayed to all the gods, they called Ajax and Telamon to their
      help from Salamis, where the fleet was, <a href="#link8note-38" id="link8noteref-38" class="pginternal">38</a> and sent a ship to
      Egina to bring Aiacos himself and the rest of the sons of Aiacos.
    </p>
<p>
      65. Moreover Dicaios the son of Theokydes, an Athenian, who was an exile
      and had become of great repute among the Medes at this time, declared that
      when the Attic land was being ravaged by the land-army of Xerxes, having
      been deserted by the Athenians, he happened then to be in company with
      Demaratos the Lacedemonian in the Thriasian plain; and he saw a cloud of
      dust going up from Eleusis, as if made by a company of about thirty
      thousand men, and they wondered at the cloud of dust, by what men it was
      caused. Then forthwith they heard a sound of voices, and Dicaios perceived
      that the sound was the mystic cry <i>Iacchos</i>; but Demaratos, having no
      knowledge of the sacred rites which are done at Eleusis, asked him what
      this was that uttered the sound, and he said: "Demaratos, it cannot be but
      that some great destruction is about to come to the army of the king: for
      as to this, it is very manifest, seeing that Attica is deserted, that this
      which utters the sound is of the gods, and that it is going from Eleusis
      to help the Athenians and their allies: if then it shall come down in the
      Peloponnese, there is danger for the king himself and for the army which
      is upon the mainland, but if it shall direct its course towards the ships
      which are at Salamis, the king will be in danger of losing his fleet. This
      feast the Athenians celebrate every year to the Mother and the Daughter;
      <a href="#link8note-39" id="link8noteref-39" class="pginternal">39</a>
      and he that desires it, both of them and of the other Hellenes, is
      initiated in the mysteries; and the sound of voices which thou hearest is
      the cry <i>Iacchos</i> which they utter at this feast." To this Demaratos
      said: "Keep silence and tell not this tale to any other man; for if these
      words of thine be reported to the king, thou wilt surely lose thy head,
      and neither I nor any other man upon earth will be able to save thee: but
      keep thou quiet, and about this expedition the gods will provide." He then
      thus advised, and after the cloud of dust and the sound of voices there
      came a mist which was borne aloft and carried towards Salamis to the camp
      of the Hellenes: and thus they learnt (said he) that the fleet of Xerxes
      was destined to be destroyed. Such was the report made by Dicaios the son
      of Theodykes, appealing to Demaratos and others also as witnesses.
    </p>
<p>
      66. Meanwhile those who were appointed to serve in the fleet of Xerxes,
      having gazed in Trachis upon the disaster of the Lacedemonians and having
      passed over from thence to Histiaia, after staying three days sailed
      through Euripos, and in other three days they had reached Phaleron. And,
      as I suppose, they made their attack upon Athens not fewer in number both
      by land and sea than when they had arrived at Sepias and at Thermopylai:
      for against those of them who perished by reason of the storm and those
      who were slain at Thermopylai and in the sea-fights at Artemision, I will
      set those who at that time were not yet accompanying the king, the
      Malians, Dorians, Locrians, and Boeotians (who accompanied him in a body,
      except the Thespians and Plataians), and moreover those of Carystos,
      Andros, and Tenos, with all the other islanders except the five cities of
      which I mentioned the names before; for the more the Persian advanced
      towards the centre of Hellas, the more nations accompanied him.
    </p>
<p>
      67. So then, when all these had come to Athens except the Parians (now the
      Parians had remained behind at Kythnos waiting to see how the war would
      turn out),—when all the rest, I say, had come to Phaleron, then
      Xerxes himself came down to the ships desiring to visit them and to learn
      the opinions of those who sailed in them: and when he had come and was set
      in a conspicuous place, then those who were despots of their own nations
      or commanders of divisions being sent for came before him from their
      ships, and took their seats as the king had assigned rank to each one,
      first the king of Sidon, then he of Tyre, and after them the rest: and
      when they were seated in due order, Xerxes sent Mardonios and inquired,
      making trial of each one, whether he should fight a battle by sea.
    </p>
<p>
      68. So when Mardonios went round asking them, beginning with the king of
      Sidon, the others gave their opinions all to the same effect, advising him
      to fight a battle by sea, but Artemisia spoke these words:—(a) "Tell
      the king I pray thee, Mardonios, that I, who have proved myself not to be
      the worst in the sea-fights which have been fought near Euboea, and have
      displayed deeds not inferior to those of others, speak to him thus:
      Master, it is right that I set forth the opinion which I really have, and
      say that which I happen to think best for thy cause: and this I say,—spare
      thy ships and do not make a sea-fight; for the men are as much stronger
      than thy men by sea, as men are stronger than women. And why must thou
      needs run the risk of sea-battles? Hast thou not Athens in thy possession,
      for the sake of which thou didst set forth on thy march, and also the rest
      of Hellas? and no man stands in thy way to resist, but those who did stand
      against thee came off as it was fitting that they should. (b) Now the
      manner in which I think the affairs of thy adversaries will have their
      issue, I will declare. If thou do not hasten to make a sea-fight, but keep
      thy ships here by the land, either remaining here thyself or even
      advancing on to the Peloponnese, that which thou hast come to do, O
      master, will easily be effected; for the Hellenes are not able to hold out
      against thee for any long time, but thou wilt soon disperse them and they
      will take flight to their several cities: since neither have they
      provisions with them in this island, as I am informed, nor is it probable
      that if thou shalt march thy land-army against the Peloponnese, they who
      have come from thence will remain still; for these will have no care to
      fight a battle in defence of Athens. (c) If however thou hasten to fight
      forthwith, I fear that damage done to the fleet may ruin the land-army
      also. Moreover, O king, consider also this, that the servants of good men
      are apt to grow bad, but those of bad men good; and thou, who art of all
      men the best, hast bad servants, namely those who are reckoned as allies,
      Egyptians and Cyprians and Kilikians and Pamphylians, in whom there is no
      profit."
    </p>
<p>
      69. When she thus spoke to Mardonios, those who were friendly to Artemisia
      were grieved at her words, supposing that she would suffer some evil from
      the king because she urged him not to fight at sea; while those who had
      envy and jealousy of her, because she had been honoured above all the
      allies, were rejoiced at the opposition, <a href="#link8note-40" id="link8noteref-40" class="pginternal">40</a> supposing that she
      would now be ruined. When however the opinions were reported to Xerxes, he
      was greatly pleased with the opinion of Artemisia; and whereas even before
      this he thought her excellent, he commended her now yet more. Nevertheless
      he gave orders to follow the advice of the greater number, thinking that
      when they fought by Euboea they were purposely slack, because he was not
      himself present with them, whereas now he had made himself ready to look
      on while they fought a sea-battle.
    </p>
<p>
      70. So when they passed the word to put out to sea, they brought their
      ships out to Salamis and quietly ranged themselves along the shore in
      their several positions. At that time the daylight was not sufficient for
      them to engage battle, for night had come on; but they made their
      preparations to fight on the following day. Meanwhile the Hellenes were
      possessed by fear and dismay, especially those who were from Peloponnese:
      and these were dismayed because remaining in Salamis they were to fight a
      battle on behalf of the land of the Athenians, and being defeated they
      would be cut off from escape and blockaded in an island, leaving their own
      land unguarded. And indeed the land-army of the Barbarians was marching
      forward during that very night towards the Peloponnese.
    </p>
<p>
      71. Yet every means had been taken that the Barbarians might not be able
      to enter Peloponnesus by land: for as soon as the Peloponnesians heard
      that Leonidas and his company had perished at Thermopylai, they came
      together quickly from the cities and took post at the Isthmus, and over
      them was set as commander Cleombrotos, the son of Anaxandrides and brother
      of Leonidas. These being posted at the Isthmus had destroyed the Skironian
      way, and after this (having so determined in counsel with one another)
      they began to build a wall across the Isthmus; and as they were many
      myriads <a href="#link8note-41" id="link8noteref-41" class="pginternal">41</a>
      and every man joined in the work, the work proceeded fast; for stones and
      bricks and pieces of timber and baskets full of sand were carried to it
      continually, and they who had thus come to help paused not at all in their
      work either by night or by day.
    </p>
<p>
      72. Now those of the Hellenes who came in full force to the Isthmus to
      help their country were these,—the Lacedemonians, the Arcadians of
      every division, the Eleians, Corinthians, Sikyonians, Epidaurians,
      Phliasians, Troizenians and Hermionians. These were they who came to the
      help of Hellas in her danger and who had apprehension for her, while the
      rest of the Peloponnesians showed no care: and the Olympic and Carneian
      festivals had by this time gone by.
    </p>
<p>
      73. Now Peloponnesus is inhabited by seven races; and of these, two are
      natives of the soil and are settled now in the place where they dwelt of
      old, namely the Arcadians and the Kynurians; and one race, that of the
      Achaians, though it did not remove from the Peloponnese, yet removed in
      former time from its own land and dwells now in that which was not its
      own. The remaining races, four in number, have come in from without,
      namely the Dorians, Aitolians, Dryopians and Lemnians. Of the Dorians
      there are many cities and of great renown; of the Aitolians, Elis alone;
      of the Dryopians, Hermion <a href="#link8note-42" id="link8noteref-42" class="pginternal">42</a> and Asine, which latter is opposite Cardamyle
      in the Laconian land; and of the Lemnians, all the Paroreatai. The
      Kynurians, who are natives of the soil, seem alone to be Ionians, but they
      have become Dorians completely because they are subject to the Argives and
      by lapse of time, being originally citizens of Orneai or the dwellers in
      the country round Orneai. <a href="#link8note-43" id="link8noteref-43" class="pginternal">43</a> Of these seven nations the remaining cities,
      except those which I enumerated just now, stood aside and did nothing; and
      if one may be allowed to speak freely, in thus standing aside they were in
      fact taking the side of the Medes.
    </p>
<p>
      74. Those at the Isthmus were struggling with the labour which I have
      said, since now they were running a course in which their very being was
      at stake, and they did not look to have any brilliant success with their
      ships: while those who were at Salamis, though informed of this work, were
      yet dismayed, not fearing so much for themselves as for Peloponnesus. For
      some time then they spoke of it in private, one man standing by another,
      and they marvelled at the ill-counsel of Eurybiades; but at last it broke
      out publicly. A meeting accordingly was held, and much was spoken about
      the same points as before, some saying that they ought to sail away to
      Peloponnesus and run the risk in defence of that, and not stay and fight
      for a land which had been captured by the enemy, while the Athenians,
      Eginetans and Megarians urged that they should stay there and defend
      themselves.
    </p>
<p>
      75. Then Themistocles, when his opinion was like to be defeated by the
      Peloponnesians, secretly went forth from the assembly, and having gone out
      he sent a man to the encampment of the Medes in a boat, charging him with
      that which he must say: this man's name was Sikinnos, and he was a servant
      of Themistocles and tutor to his children; and after these events
      Themistocles entered him as a Thespian citizen, when the Thespians were
      admitting new citizens, and made him a wealthy man. He at this time came
      with a boat and said to the commanders of the Barbarians these words: "The
      commander of the Athenians sent me privately without the knowledge of the
      other Hellenes (for, as it chances, he is disposed to the cause of the
      king, and desires rather that your side should gain the victory than that
      of the Hellenes), to inform you that the Hellenes are planning to take
      flight, having been struck with dismay; and now it is possible for you to
      execute a most noble work, if ye do not permit them to flee away: for they
      are not of one mind with one another and they will not stand against you
      in fight, but ye shall see them fighting a battle by sea with one another,
      those who are disposed to your side against those who are not."
    </p>
<p>
      76. He then having signified to them this, departed out of the way; and
      they, thinking that the message deserved credit, landed first a large
      number of Persians in the small island of Psyttaleia, which lies between
      Salamis and the mainland; and then, as midnight came on, they put out the
      Western wing of their fleet to sea, circling round towards Salamis, and
      also those stationed about Keos and Kynosura put out their ships to sea;
      and they occupied all the passage with their ships as far as Munychia. And
      for this reason they put out their ships, namely in order that the
      Hellenes might not even be permitted to get away, but being cut off in
      Salamis might pay the penalty for the contests at Artemision: and they
      disembarked men of the Persians on the small island called Psyttaleia for
      this reason, namely that when the fight should take place, these might
      save the men of one side and destroy those of the other, since there
      especially it was likely that the men and the wrecks of ships would be
      cast up on shore, for the island lay in the way of the sea-fight which was
      to be. These things they did in silence, that the enemy might not have
      information of them.
    </p>
<p>
      77. They then were making their preparations thus in the night without
      having taken any sleep at all: and with regard to oracles, I am not able
      to make objections against them that they are not true, for I do not
      desire to attempt to overthrow the credit of them when they speak clearly,
      looking at such matters as these which here follow:
    </p>
<pre>
 "But when with ships they shall join the sacred strand of the goddess,
  Artemis golden-sword-girded, and thee, wave-washed Kynosura,
  Urged by a maddening hope, <a href="#link8note-44" id="link8noteref-44" class="pginternal">44</a> having given rich Athens to plunder,
  Then shall Justice divine quell Riot, of Insolence first-born, <a href="#link8note-45" id="link8noteref-45" class="pginternal">45</a>
  Longing to overthrow all things <a href="#link8note-46" id="link8noteref-46" class="pginternal">46</a> and terribly panting for bloodhshed:
  Brass shall encounter with brass, and Ares the sea shall empurple,
  Tinging its waves with the blood: then a day of freedom for Hellas
  Cometh from wide-seeing Zeus <a href="#link8note-47" id="link8noteref-47" class="pginternal">47</a> and from Victory, lady and mother." <a href="#link8note-48" id="link8noteref-48" class="pginternal">48</a>
</pre>
<p>
      Looking to such things as this, and when Bakis speaks so clearly, I do not
      venture myself to make any objections about oracles, nor can I admit them
      from others.
    </p>
<p>
      78. Now between the commanders that were at Salamis there came to be great
      contention of speech and they did not yet know that the Barbarians were
      surrounding them with their ships, but they thought that they were still
      in their place as they saw them disposed in the day.
    </p>
<p>
      79. Then while the commanders were engaged in strife, there came over from
      Egina Aristeides the son of Lysimachos, an Athenian who had been
      ostracised by the people, a man whom I hold (according to that which I
      hear of his character) to have been the best and most upright of all
      Athenians. This man came into the council and called forth Themistocles,
      who was to him not a friend, but an enemy to the last degree; but because
      of the greatness of the present troubles he let those matters be forgotten
      and called him forth, desiring to communicate with him. Now he had heard
      beforehand that the Peloponnesians were pressing to take the ships away to
      the Isthmus. So when Themistocles came forth to him, Aristeides spoke
      these words: "Both at other times when occasion arises, and also
      especially at this time we ought to carry on rivalry as to which of us
      shall do more service to our country. And I tell thee now that it is
      indifferent whether the Peloponnesians say many words or few about sailing
      away from hence; for having been myself an eye-witness I tell thee that
      now not even if the Corinthians and Eurybiades himself desire to sail out,
      will they be able; for we are encompassed round by the enemy. Go thou in
      then, and signify this to them."
    </p>
<p>
      80. He made answer as follows: "Thou advisest very well, <a href="#link8note-49" id="link8noteref-49" class="pginternal">49</a>
      and also the news which thou hast brought is good, since thou art come
      having witnessed with thine own eyes that which I desired might come to
      pass: for know that this which is being done by the Medes is of my
      suggestion; because, when the Hellenes would not come to a battle of their
      own will, it was necessary to bring them over to us against their will. Do
      thou however, since thou art come bearing good news, thyself report it to
      them; for if I say these things, I shall be thought to speak that which I
      have myself invented, and I shall not persuade them, but they will think
      that the Barbarians are not doing so. Do thou thyself however come forward
      to speak, and declare to them how things are; and when thou hast declared
      this, if they are persuaded, that will be the best thing, but if this is
      not credible to them, it will be the same thing so far as concerns us, for
      they will no longer be able to take to flight, if we are encompassed on
      all sides, as thou sayest."
    </p>
<p>
      81. Aristeides accordingly came forward and told them this, saying that he
      had come from Egina and had with difficulty escaped without being
      perceived by those who were blockading them; for the whole encampment of
      the Hellenes was encompassed by the ships of Xerxes; and he counselled
      them to get ready to defend themselves. He then having thus spoken
      retired, and among them again there arose dispute, for the greater number
      of the commanders did not believe that which was reported to them:
    </p>
<p>
      82. and while these were doubting, there came a trireme manned by Tenians,
      deserting from the enemy, of which the commander was Panaitios the son of
      Sosimenes, which brought them the whole truth. For this deed the Tenians
      were inscribed at Delphi on the tripod among those who had conquered the
      Barbarians. With the ship which deserted at Salamis and the Lemnian ship
      which deserted before and came to Artemision, the naval force of the
      Hellenes was completed to the number of three hundred and eighty ships,
      for before this two ships were yet wanting to make up this number.
    </p>
<p>
      83. The Hellenes then, since they believed that which was said by the
      Tenians, were preparing for a sea-fight: and as the dawn appeared, they
      made an assembly of those who fought on board the ships <a href="#link8note-50" id="link8noteref-50" class="pginternal">50</a>
      and addressed them, Themistocles making a speech which was eloquent beyond
      the rest; and the substance of it was to set forth all that is better as
      opposed to that which is worse, of the several things which arise in the
      nature and constitution of man; and having exhorted them to choose the
      better, <a href="#link8note-51" id="link8noteref-51" class="pginternal">51</a>
      and thus having wound up his speech, he bade them embark in their ships.
      These then proceeded to embark, and there came in meanwhile the trireme
      from Egina which had gone away to bring the sons of Aiacos.
    </p>
<p>
      84. Then the Hellenes put out all their ships, and while they were putting
      out from shore, the Barbarians attacked them forthwith. Now the other
      Hellenes began backing their ships and were about to run them aground, but
      Ameinias of Pallene, an Athenian, put forth with his ship and charged one
      of the enemy; and his ship being entangled in combat and the men not being
      able to get away, the others joined in the fight to assist Ameinias. The
      Athenians say that the beginning of the battle was made thus, but the
      Eginetans say that the ship which went away to Egina to bring the sons of
      Aiacos was that which began the fight. It is also reported that an
      apparition of a woman was seen by them, and that having appeared she
      encouraged them to the fight so that the whole of the army of the Hellenes
      heard it, first having reproached them in these words: "Madmen, <a href="#link8note-52" id="link8noteref-52" class="pginternal">52</a>
      how far will ye yet back your ships?"
    </p>
<p>
      85. Opposite the Athenians had been ranged the Phenicians, for these
      occupied the wing towards Eleusis and the West, and opposite the
      Lacedemonians were the Ionians, who occupied the wing which extended to
      the East and to Piræus. Of them however a few were purposely slack in the
      fight according to the injunctions of Themistocles, <a href="#link8note-53" id="link8noteref-53" class="pginternal">53</a> but the greater number
      were not so. I might mention now the names of many captains of ships who
      destroyed ships of the Hellenes, but I will make no use of their names
      except in the case of Theomestor, the son of Androdamas and Phylacos the
      son of Histiaios, of Samos both: and for this reason I make mention of
      these and not of the rest, because Theomestor on account of this deed
      became despot of Samos, appointed by the Persians, and Phylacos was
      recorded as a benefactor of the king and received much land as a reward.
      Now the benefactors of the king are called in the Persian tongue <i>orosangai</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      86. Thus it was with these; but the greater number of their ships were
      disabled at Salamis, being destroyed some by the Athenians and others by
      the Eginetans: for since the Hellenes fought in order and ranged in their
      places, while the Barbarians were no longer ranged in order nor did
      anything with design, it was likely that there would be some such result
      as in fact followed. Yet on this day they surpassed themselves much more
      than when they fought by Euboea, every one being eager and fearing Xerxes,
      and each man thinking that the king was looking especially at him.
    </p>
<p>
      87. As regards the rest I cannot speak of them separately, or say
      precisely how the Barbarians or the Hellenes individually contended in the
      fight; but with regard to Artemisia that which happened was this, whence
      she gained yet more esteem than before from the king.—When the
      affairs of the king had come to great confusion, at this crisis a ship of
      Artemisia was being pursued by an Athenian ship; and as she was not able
      to escape, for in front of her were other ships of her own side, while her
      ship, as it chanced, was furthest advanced towards the enemy, she resolved
      what she would do, and it proved also much to her advantage to have done
      so. While she was being pursued by the Athenian ship she charged with full
      career against a ship of her own side manned by Calyndians and in which
      the king of the Calyndians Damasithymos was embarked. Now, even though it
      be true that she had had some strife with him before, while they were
      still about the Hellespont, yet I am not able to say whether she did this
      by intention, or whether the Calyndian ship happened by chance to fall in
      her way. Having charged against it however and sunk it, she enjoyed good
      fortune and got for herself good in two ways; for first the captain of the
      Athenian ship, when he saw her charge against a ship manned by Barbarians,
      turned away and went after others, supposing that the ship of Artemisia
      was either a Hellenic ship or was deserting from the Barbarians and
      fighting for the Hellenes,
    </p>
<p>
      88,—first, I say, it was her fortune to have this, namely to escape
      and not suffer destruction; and then secondly it happened that though she
      had done mischief, she yet gained great reputation by this thing with
      Xerxes. For it is said that the king looking on at the fight perceived
      that her ship had charged the other; and one of those present said:
      "Master, dost thou see Artemisia, how well she is fighting, and how she
      sank even now a ship of the enemy?" He asked whether this was in truth the
      deed of Artemisia, and they said that it was; for (they declared) they
      knew very well the sign of her ship: and that which was destroyed they
      thought surely was one of the enemy; for besides other things which
      happened fortunately for her, as I have said, there was this also, namely
      that not one of the crew of the Calyndian ship survived to become her
      accuser. And Xerxes in answer to that which was said to him is reported to
      have uttered these words: "My men have become women, and my women men."
      Thus it is said that Xerxes spoke.
    </p>
<p>
      89. And meanwhile in this struggle there was slain the commander
      Ariabignes, son of Dareios and brother of Xerxes, and there were slain too
      many others of note of the Persians and Medes and also of the allies; and
      of the Hellenes on their part a few; for since they knew how to swim,
      those whose ships were destroyed and who were not slain in hand-to-hand
      conflict swam over to Salamis; but of the Barbarians the greater number
      perished in the sea, not being able to swim. And when the first ships
      turned to flight, then it was that the largest number perished, for those
      who were stationed behind, while endeavouring to pass with their ships to
      the front in order that they also might display some deed of valour for
      the king to see, ran into the ships of their own side as they fled.
    </p>
<p>
      90. It happened also in the course of this confusion that some of the
      Phenicians, whose ships had been destroyed, came to the king and accused
      the Ionians, saying that by means of them their ships had been lost, and
      that they had been traitors to the cause. Now it so came about that not
      only the commanders of the Ionians did not lose their lives, but the
      Phenicians who accused them received a reward such as I shall tell. While
      these men were yet speaking thus, a Samothrakian ship charged against an
      Athenian ship: and as the Athenian ship was being sunk by it, an Eginetan
      ship came up against the Samothrakian vessel and ran it down. Then the
      Samothrakians, being skilful javelin-throwers, by hurling cleared off the
      fighting-men from the ship which had wrecked theirs and then embarked upon
      it and took possession of it. This event saved the Ionians from
      punishment; for when Xerxes saw that they had performed a great exploit,
      he turned to the Phenicians (for he was exceedingly vexed and disposed to
      find fault with all) and bade cut off their heads, in order that they
      might not, after having been cowards themselves, accuse others who were
      better men than they. For whensoever Xerxes (sitting just under the
      mountain opposite Salamis, which is called Aigaleos) saw any one of his
      own side display a deed of valour in the sea-fight, he inquired about him
      who had done it, and the scribes recorded the name of the ship's captain
      with that of his father and the city from whence he came. Moreover also
      Ariaramnes, a Persian who was present, shared <a href="#link8note-54" id="link8noteref-54" class="pginternal">54</a> the fate of the
      Phenicians, being their friend. They <a href="#link8note-55" id="link8noteref-55" class="pginternal">55</a> then proceeded to deal
      with the Phenicians.
    </p>
<p>
      91. In the meantime, as the Barbarians turned to flight and were sailing
      out towards Phaleron, the Eginetans waited for them in the passage and
      displayed memorable actions: for while the Athenians in the confused
      tumult were disabling both those ships which resisted and those which were
      fleeing, the Eginetans were destroying those which attempted to sail away;
      and whenever any escaped the Athenians, they went in full course and fell
      among the Eginetans.
    </p>
<p>
      92. Then there met one another the ship of Themistocles, which was
      pursuing a ship of the enemy, and that of Polycritos the son of Crios the
      Eginetan. This last had charged against a ship of Sidon, the same that had
      taken the Eginetan vessel which was keeping watch in advance at Skiathos,
      <a href="#link8note-56" id="link8noteref-56" class="pginternal">56</a>
      and in which sailed Pytheas the son of Ischenoös, whom the Persians kept
      in their ship, all cut to pieces as he was, making a marvel of his valour.
      The Sidonian ship then was captured bearing with it this man as well as
      the Persians of whom I spoke, so that Pytheas thus came safe to Egina. Now
      when Polycritos looked at the Athenian vessel he recognised when he saw it
      the sign of the admiral's ship, and shouting out he addressed Themistocles
      with mockery about the accusation brought against the Eginetans of taking
      the side of the Medes, <a href="#link8note-57" id="link8noteref-57" class="pginternal">57</a> and reproached him. This taunt Polycritos
      threw out against Themistocles after he had charged against the ship of
      Sidon. And meanwhile those Barbarians whose ships had escaped destruction
      fled and came to Phaleron to be under cover of the land-army.
    </p>
<p>
      93. In this sea-fight the Eginetans were of all the Hellenes the best
      reported of, and next to them the Athenians; and of the individual men the
      Eginetan Polycritos and the Athenians Eumenes of Anagyrus and Ameinias of
      Pallene, the man who had pursued after Artemisia. Now if he had known that
      Artemisia was sailing in this ship, he would not have ceased until either
      he had taken her or had been taken himself; for orders had been given to
      the Athenian captains, and moreover a prize was offered of ten thousand
      drachmas for the man who should take her alive; since they thought it
      intolerable that a woman should make an expedition against Athens. She
      then, as has been said before, had made her escape; and the others also,
      whose ships had escaped destruction, were at Phaleron.
    </p>
<p>
      94. As regards Adeimantos the commander of the Corinthians, the Athenians
      say that forthwith at the beginning when the ships were engaging in the
      fight, being struck with panic and terror he put up his sails and fled
      away; and the Corinthians, when they saw the admiral's ship fleeing,
      departed likewise: and after this, as the story goes, when they came in
      their flight opposite to the temple of Athene Skiras in the land of
      Salamis, there fell in with them by divine guidance a light vessel, <a href="#link8note-58" id="link8noteref-58" class="pginternal">58</a>
      which no one was ever found to have sent, and which approached the
      Corinthians at a time when they knew nothing of that which was happening
      with the fleet. And by this it is conjectured <a href="#link8note-59" id="link8noteref-59" class="pginternal">59</a> that the matter was of
      the Deity; for when they came near to the ships, the men in the light
      vessel said these words: "Adeimantos, thou hast turned thy ships away and
      hast set forth to flee, deserting the cause of the Hellenes, while they
      are in truth gaining a victory and getting the better of their foes as
      much as they desired." When they said this, since Adeimantos doubted of
      it, they spoke a second time and said that they might be taken as hostages
      and slain, if the Hellenes should prove not to be gaining the victory.
      Then he turned his ship back, he and the others with him, and they reached
      the camp when the work was finished. Such is the report spread by the
      Athenians against these: the Corinthians however do not allow this to be
      so, but hold that they were among the first in the sea-fight; and the rest
      of Hellas also bears witness on their side.
    </p>
<p>
      95. Aristeides moreover the son of Lysimachos, the Athenian, of whom I
      made mention also shortly before this as a very good man, he in this
      tumult which had arisen about Salamis did as follows:—taking with
      him a number of the hoplites of Athenian race who had been ranged along
      the shore of the land of Salamis, with them he disembarked on the island
      of Psyttaleia; and these slew all the Persians who were in this islet.
    </p>
<p>
      96. When the sea-fight had been broken off, the Hellenes towed in to
      Salamis so many of the wrecks as chanced to be still about there, and held
      themselves ready for another sea-fight, expecting that the king would yet
      make use of the ships which remained unhurt; but many of the wrecks were
      taken by the West Wind and borne to that strand in Attica which is called
      Colias; so as to fulfil <a href="#link8note-60" id="link8noteref-60" class="pginternal">60</a> not only all that other oracle which was
      spoken about this sea-fight by Bakis and Musaios, but also especially,
      with reference to the wrecks cast up here, that which had been spoken in
      an oracle many years before these events by Lysistratos, an Athenian who
      uttered oracles, and which had not been observed by any of the Hellenes:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Then shall the Colian women with firewood of oars roast barley." <a href="#link8note-61" id="link8noteref-61" class="pginternal">61</a>
</pre>
<p>
      This was destined to come to pass after the king had marched away.
    </p>
<p>
      97. When Xerxes perceived the disaster which had come upon him, he feared
      lest some one of the Ionians should suggest to the Hellenes, or they
      should themselves form the idea, to sail to the Hellespont and break up
      the bridges; and so he might be cut off in Europe and run the risk of
      perishing utterly: therefore he began to consider about taking flight. He
      desired however that his intention should not be perceived either by the
      Hellenes or by those of his own side; therefore he attempted to construct
      a mole going across to Salamis, and he bound together Phenician merchant
      vessels in order that they might serve him both for a bridge and a wall,
      and made preparations for fighting as if he were going to have another
      battle by sea. Seeing him do so, all the rest made sure that he had got
      himself ready in earnest and intended to stay and fight; but Mardonios did
      not fail to perceive the true meaning of all these things, being by
      experience very well versed in his way of thinking.
    </p>
<p>
      98. While Xerxes was doing thus, he sent a messenger to the Persians, to
      announce the calamity which had come upon them. Now there is nothing
      mortal which accomplishes a journey with more speed than these messengers,
      so skilfully has this been invented by the Persians: for they say that
      according to the number of days of which the entire journey consists, so
      many horses and men are set at intervals, each man and horse appointed for
      a day's journey. These neither snow nor rain nor heat nor darkness of
      night prevents from accomplishing each one the task proposed to him, with
      the very utmost speed. The first then rides and delivers the message with
      which he is charged to the second, and the second to the third; and after
      that it goes through them handed from one to the other, <a href="#link8note-62" id="link8noteref-62" class="pginternal">62</a> as
      in the torch-race among the Hellenes, which they perform for Hephaistos.
      This kind of running of their horses the Persians call <i>angareion</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      99. The first message then which came to Susa, announcing that Xerxes had
      Athens in his possession, so greatly rejoiced the Persians who had been
      left behind, that they strewed all the ways with myrtle boughs and offered
      incense perpetually, and themselves continued in sacrifices and feasting.
      The second message however, which came to them after this, so greatly
      disturbed them that they all tore their garments and gave themselves up to
      crying and lamentation without stint, laying the blame upon Mardonios: and
      this the Persians did not so much because they were grieved about the
      ships, as because they feared for Xerxes himself.
    </p>
<p>
      100. As regards the Persians this went on for all the time which
      intervened, until the coming of Xerxes himself caused them to cease: and
      Mardonios seeing that Xerxes was greatly troubled by reason of the
      sea-fight, and suspecting that he was meaning to take flight from Athens,
      considered with regard to himself that he would have to suffer punishment
      for having persuaded the king to make an expedition against Hellas, and
      that it was better for him to run the risk of either subduing Hellas or
      ending his own life honourably, placing his safety in suspense for a great
      end, <a href="#link8note-63" id="link8noteref-63" class="pginternal">63</a>
      though his opinion was rather that he would subdue Hellas;—he
      reckoned up these things, I say, and addressed his speech to the king as
      follows: "Master, be not thou grieved, nor feel great trouble on account
      of this thing which has come to pass; for it is not upon a contest of
      timbers that all our fortunes depend, but of men and of horses: and none
      of these who suppose now that all has been achieved by them will attempt
      to disembark from the ships and stand against thee, nor will any in this
      mainland do so; but those who did stand against us paid the penalty. If
      therefore thou thinkest this good to do, let us forthwith attempt the
      Peloponnese, or if thou thinkest good to hold back, we may do that. Do not
      despond however, for there is no way of escape for the Hellenes to avoid
      being thy slaves, after they have first given an account of that which
      they did to thee both now and at former times. Thus it were best to do;
      but if thou hast indeed resolved to retire thyself and to withdraw thy
      army, I have another counsel to offer for that case too. Do not thou, O
      king, let the Persians be an object of laughter to the Hellenes; for none
      of thy affairs have suffered by means of the Persians, nor wilt thou be
      able to mention any place where we proved ourselves cowards: but if
      Phenicians or Egyptians or Cyprians or Kilikians proved themselves
      cowards, the calamity which followed does not belong to the Persians in
      any way. Now therefore, since it is not the Persians who are guilty
      towards thee, follow my counsel. If thou hast determined not to remain
      here, retire thou to thine own abode, taking with thee the main body of
      the army, and it must then be for me to deliver over to thee Hellas
      reduced to subjection, choosing for this purpose thirty myriads <a href="#link8note-64" id="link8noteref-64" class="pginternal">64</a>
      from the army."
    </p>
<p>
      101. Hearing this Xerxes was rejoiced and delighted so far as he might be
      after his misfortunes, <a href="#link8note-65" id="link8noteref-65" class="pginternal">65</a> and to Mardonios he said that when he had
      taken counsel he would reply and say which of these two things he would
      do. So when he was taking counsel with those of the Persians who were
      called to be his advisers, <a href="#link8note-66" id="link8noteref-66" class="pginternal">66</a> it seemed good to him to send for Artemisia
      also to give him counsel, because at the former time she alone had showed
      herself to have perception of that which ought to be done. So when
      Artemisia had come, Xerxes removed from him all the rest, both the Persian
      councillors and also the spearmen of the guard and spoke to her thus:
      "Mardonios bids me stay here and make an attempt on the Peloponnese,
      saying that the Persians and the land-army are not guilty of any share in
      my calamity, and that they would gladly give me proof of this. He bids me
      therefore either do this or, if not, he desires himself to choose thirty
      myriads from the army and to deliver over to me Hellas reduced to
      subjection; and he bids me withdraw with the rest of the army to my own
      abode. Do thou therefore, as thou didst well advise about the sea-fight
      which was fought, urging that we should not bring it on, so also now
      advise me which of these things I shall do, that I may succeed in
      determining well."
    </p>
<p>
      102. He thus consulted her, and she spoke these words: "O king, it is hard
      for me to succeed in saying the best things when one asks me for counsel;
      yet it seems good to me at the present that thou shouldest retire back and
      leave Mardonios here, if he desires it and undertakes to do this, together
      with those whom he desires to have: for on the one hand if he subdue those
      whom he says that he desires to subdue, and if those matters succeed well
      which he has in mind when he thus speaks, the deed will after all be
      thine, master, seeing that thy slaves achieved it: and on the other hand
      if the opposite shall come to pass of that which Mardonios intends, it
      will be no great misfortune, seeing that thou wilt thyself remain safe,
      and also the power in those parts <a href="#link8note-67" id="link8noteref-67" class="pginternal">67</a> which concerns thy
      house: <a href="#link8note-68" id="link8noteref-68" class="pginternal">68</a>
      for if thou shalt remain safe with thy house, many contests many times
      over repeated will the Hellenes have to pass through for their own
      existence. <a href="#link8note-69" id="link8noteref-69" class="pginternal">69</a> Of Mardonios however, if he suffer any
      disaster, no account will be made; and if the Hellenes conquer they gain a
      victory which is no victory, having destroyed one who is but thy slave.
      Thou however wilt retire having done that for which thou didst make thy
      march, that is to say, having delivered Athens to the fire."
    </p>
<p>
      103. With this advice Xerxes was greatly delighted, since she succeeded in
      saying that very thing which he himself was meaning to do: for not even if
      all the men and all the women in the world had been counselling him to
      remain, would he have done so, as I think, so much had he been struck with
      terror. He commended Artemisia therefore and sent her away to conduct his
      sons to Ephesos, for there were certain bastard sons of his which
      accompanied him.
    </p>
<p>
      104. With these sons he sent Hermotimos to have charge of them, who was by
      race of Pedasa and was in the estimation of the king second to none of the
      eunuchs. [Now the Pedasians dwell above Halicarnassos, and at this Pedasa
      a thing happens as follows:—whenever to the whole number of those
      who dwell about this city some trouble is about to come within a certain
      time, then the priestess of Athene in that place gets a long beard; and
      this has happened to them twice before now.
    </p>
<p>
      105. Of these Pedasians was Hermotimos.] <a href="#link8note-70" id="link8noteref-70" class="pginternal">70</a> And this man of all
      persons whom we know up to this time obtained the greatest revenge for a
      wrong done to him. For he had been captured by enemies and was being sold,
      and Panionios a man of Chios bought him, one who had set himself to gain
      his livelihood by the most impious practices; for whenever he obtained
      boys who possessed some beauty, he would make eunuchs of them, and then
      taking them to Sardis or Ephesos sold them for large sums of money, since
      with the Barbarians eunuchs are held to be of more value for all matters
      of trust than those who are not eunuchs. Panionios then, I say, made
      eunuchs of many others, since by this he got his livelihood, and also of
      this man about whom I speak: and Hermotimos, being not in everything
      unfortunate, was sent from Sardis to the king with other gifts, and as
      time went on he came to be honoured more than all the other eunuchs in the
      sight of Xerxes.
    </p>
<p>
      106. And when the king, being at that time in Sardis, was setting the
      Persian army in motion to march against Athens, then Hermotimos, having
      gone down for some business to that part of Mysia which the Chians occupy
      and which is called Atarneus, found there Panionios: and having recognised
      him he spoke to him many friendly words, first recounting to him all the
      good things which he had by his means, and next making promises in return
      for this, and saying how many good things he would do for him, if he would
      bring his household and dwell in that land; so that Panionios gladly
      accepting his proposals brought his children and his wife. Then, when he
      had caught him together with his whole house, Hermotimos spoke as follows:
      "O thou, who of all men that ever lived up to this time didst gain thy
      substance by the most impious deeds, what evil did either I myself or any
      of my forefathers do either to thee or to any of thine, that thou didst
      make me to be that which is nought instead of a man? Didst thou suppose
      that thou wouldest escape the notice of the gods for such things as then
      thou didst devise? They however following the rule of justice delivered <a href="#link8note-71" id="link8noteref-71" class="pginternal">71</a>
      thee into my hands, since thou hadst done impious deeds; so that thou
      shalt not have reason to find fault with the penalty which shall be
      inflicted upon thee by me." When he had thus reproached him, the man's
      sons were brought into his presence and Panionios was compelled to make
      eunuchs of his own sons, who were four in number, and being compelled he
      did so; and then when he had so done, the sons were compelled to do the
      same thing to him. Thus vengeance by the hands of Hermotimos <a href="#link8note-72" id="link8noteref-72" class="pginternal">72</a>
      overtook Panionios.
    </p>
<p>
      107. When Xerxes had entrusted his sons to Artemisia to carry them back to
      Ephesos, he called Mardonios and bade him choose of the army whom he
      would, and make his deeds, if possible, correspond to his words. During
      this day then things went so far; and in the night on the command of the
      king the leaders of the fleet began to withdraw their ships from Phaleron
      to the Hellespont, as quickly as they might each one, to guard the bridges
      for the king to pass over. And when the Barbarians were near Zoster as
      they sailed, then seeing the small points of rock which stretch out to sea
      from this part of the mainland, they thought that these were ships and
      fled for a good distance. In time however, perceiving that they were not
      ships but points of rock, they assembled together again and continued on
      their voyage.
    </p>
<p>
      108. When day dawned, the Hellenes, seeing that the land-army was staying
      still in its place, supposed that the ships also were about Phaleron; and
      thinking that they would fight another sea-battle, they made preparations
      to repel them. When however they were informed that the ships had
      departed, forthwith upon this they thought it good to pursue after them.
      They pursued therefore as far as Andros, but did not get a sight of the
      fleet of Xerxes; and when they had come to Andros, they deliberated what
      they should do. Themistocles then declared as his opinion that they should
      take their course through the islands and pursue after the ships, and
      afterwards sail straight to the Hellespont to break up the bridges; but
      Eurybiades expressed the opposite opinion to this, saying that if they
      should break up the floating-bridges, they would therein do <a href="#link8note-73" id="link8noteref-73" class="pginternal">73</a>
      the greatest possible evil to Hellas: for if the Persian should be cut off
      and compelled to remain in Europe, he would endeavour not to remain still,
      since if he remained still, neither could any of his affairs go forward,
      nor would any way of returning home appear; but his army would perish of
      hunger: whereas if he made the attempt and persevered in it, all Europe
      might be brought over to him, city by city and nation by nation, the
      inhabitants being either conquered <a href="#link8note-74" id="link8noteref-74" class="pginternal">74</a> or surrendering on
      terms before they were conquered: moreover they would have for food the
      crops of the Hellenes which grew year by year. He thought however that
      conquered in the sea-fight the Persian would not stay in Europe, and
      therefore he might be allowed to flee until in his flight he came to his
      own land. Then after that they might begin the contest for the land which
      belonged to the Persian. To this opinion the commanders of the other
      Peloponnesians adhered also.
    </p>
<p>
      109. When Themistocles perceived that he would not be able to persuade
      them, or at least the greater number of them, to sail to the Hellespont,
      he changed his counsel <a href="#link8note-75" id="link8noteref-75" class="pginternal">75</a> and turning to the Athenians (for these were
      grieved most at the escape of the enemy and were anxious to sail to the
      Hellespont even by themselves alone, <a href="#link8note-76" id="link8noteref-76" class="pginternal">76</a> if the others were not
      willing) to them he spoke as follows: "I myself also have been present
      before now on many occasions, and have heard of many more, on which
      something of this kind came to pass, namely that men who were forced into
      great straits, after they had been defeated fought again and repaired
      their former disaster: and as for us, since we have won as a prize from
      fortune the existence of ourselves and of Hellas by repelling from our
      land so great a cloud of men, let us not pursue enemies who flee from us:
      for of these things not we were the doors, but the gods and heroes, who
      grudged that one man should become king of both Asia and of Europe, and he
      a man unholy and presumptuous, one who made no difference between things
      sacred and things profane, <a href="#link8note-77" id="link8noteref-77" class="pginternal">77</a> burning and casting down the images of the
      gods, and who also scourged the Sea and let down into it fetters. But as
      things are at present, it is well that we should now remain in Hellas and
      look after ourselves and our households; and let each man repair his
      house, and have a care for sowing his land, after he has completely driven
      away the Barbarian: and then at the beginning of the spring let us sail
      down towards the Hellespont and Ionia." Thus he spoke, intending to lay up
      for himself a store of gratitude with the Persian, in order that if after
      all any evil should come upon him at the hands of the Athenians, he might
      have a place of refuge: and this was in fact that which came to pass.
    </p>
<p>
      110. Themistocles then speaking thus endeavoured to deceive them, and the
      Athenians followed his advice: for he had had the reputation even in
      former times of being a man of ability <a href="#link8note-78" id="link8noteref-78" class="pginternal">78</a> and he had now proved
      himself to be in truth both able and of good judgment; therefore they were
      ready in every way to follow his advice when he spoke. So when these had
      been persuaded by him, forthwith after this Themistocles sent men with a
      vessel, whom he trusted to keep silence, to whatever test they might be
      brought, of that which he himself charged them to tell the king; and of
      them Sikinnos his servant again was one. When these came to Attica, the
      rest stayed behind in the ship, while Sikinnos went up to Xerxes and spoke
      these words: "Themistocles the son of Neocles sent me, who is commander of
      the Athenians, and of all the allies the best and ablest man, to tell thee
      that Themistocles the Athenian, desiring to be of service to thee, held
      back the Hellenes when they were desirous to pursue after thy ships and to
      destroy the bridges on the Hellespont. Now therefore thou mayest make thy
      way home quite undisturbed." They having signified this sailed away again.
    </p>
<p>
      111. The Hellenes meanwhile, having resolved not to pursue after the ships
      of the Barbarians further, nor to sail to the Hellespont to break up the
      passage, were investing Andros intending to take it: for the Andrians were
      the first of the islanders who, being asked by Themistocles for money,
      refused to give it: and when Themistocles made proposals to them and said
      that the Athenians had come having on their side two great deities,
      Persuasion and Compulsion, and therefore they must by all means give them
      money, they replied to this that not without reason, as it now appeared,
      was Athens great and prosperous, since the Athenians were well supplied
      with serviceable deities; but as for the Andrians, they were poor, <a href="#link8note-79" id="link8noteref-79" class="pginternal">79</a>
      having in this respect attained to the greatest eminence, and there were
      two unprofitable deities which never left their island but always remained
      attached to the place, Poverty, namely, and Helplessness: and the Andrians
      being possessed of these deities would not give money; for never could the
      power of the Athenians get the better of their inability. <a href="#link8note-80" id="link8noteref-80" class="pginternal">80</a>
</p>
<p>
      112. These, I say, having thus made answer and having refused to give the
      money, were being besieged: and Themistocles not ceasing in his desire for
      gain sent threatening messages to the other islands and asked them for
      money by the same envoys, employing those whom he had before sent to the
      king; <a href="#link8note-81" id="link8noteref-81" class="pginternal">81</a>
      and he said that if they did not give that which was demanded of them, he
      would bring the fleet of the Hellenes against them to besiege and take
      them. Thus saying he collected great sums of money from the Carystians and
      the Parians, who being informed how Andros was being besieged, because it
      had taken the side of the Medes, and how Themistocles was held in more
      regard than any of the other commanders, sent money for fear of this.
      Whether any others of the islanders also gave money I am not able to say,
      but I think that some others gave and not these alone. Yet to the
      Carystians at least there was no respite from the evil on this account,
      but the Parians escaped the attack, because they propitiated Themistocles
      with money. Thus Themistocles with Andros as his starting-point was
      acquiring sums of money for himself from the men of the islands without
      the knowledge of the other commanders.
    </p>
<p>
      113. Xerxes meanwhile with his army stayed for a few days after the
      sea-fight, and then they all began to march forth towards Boeotia by the
      same way by which they had come: for Mardonios thought both that it was
      well for him to escort the king on his way, and also that it was now too
      late in the year to carry on the war; it was better, he thought, to winter
      in Thessaly and then at the beginning of spring to attempt the
      Peloponnese. When he came to Thessaly, then Mardonios chose out for
      himself first all those Persians who are called "Immortals," except only
      their commander Hydarnes (for Hydarnes said that he would not be left
      behind by the king), and after them of the other Persians those who wore
      cuirasses, and the body of a thousand horse: also the Medes, Sacans,
      Bactrians and Indians, foot and horsemen both. <a href="#link8note-82" id="link8noteref-82" class="pginternal">82</a> These nations he chose
      in the mass, <a href="#link8note-83" id="link8noteref-83" class="pginternal">83</a> but from the other allies he selected by few
      at a time, choosing whose who had fine appearance of those of whom he knew
      that they had done good service. From the Persians he chose more than from
      any other single nation, and these wore collars of twisted metal and
      bracelets; and after them came the Medes, who in fact were not inferior in
      number to the Persians, but only in bodily strength. The result was that
      there were thirty myriads in all, including cavalry.
    </p>
<p>
      114. During this time, while Mardonios was selecting his army and Xerxes
      was in Thessaly, there had come an oracle from Delphi to the
      Lacedemonians, bidding them ask satisfaction from Xerxes for the murder of
      Leonidas and accept that which should be given by him. The Spartans
      therefore sent a herald as quickly as possible, who having found the whole
      army still in Thessaly came into the presence of Xerxes and spoke these
      words: "O king of the Medes, the Lacedemonians and the sons of Heracles of
      Sparta demand of thee satisfaction for murder, because thou didst kill
      their king, fighting in defence of Hellas." He laughed and then kept
      silence some time, and after that pointing to Mardonios, who happened to
      be standing by him, he said: "Then Mardonios here shall give them
      satisfaction, such as is fitting for them to have."
    </p>
<p>
      115. The herald accordingly accepted the utterance and departed; and
      Xerxes leaving Mardonios in Thessaly went on himself in haste to the
      Hellespont and arrived at the passage where the crossing was in
      five-and-thirty days, bringing back next to nothing, as one may say, <a href="#link8note-84" id="link8noteref-84" class="pginternal">84</a> of
      his army: and whithersoever they came on the march and to whatever nation,
      they seized the crops of that people and used them for provisions; and if
      they found no crops, then they took the grass which was growing up from
      the earth, and stripped off the bark from the trees and plucked down the
      leaves and devoured them, alike of the cultivated trees and of those
      growing wild; and they left nothing behind them: thus they did by reason
      of famine. Then plague too seized upon the army and dysentery, which
      destroyed them by the way, and some of them also who were sick the king
      left behind, laying charge upon the cities where at the time he chanced to
      be in his march, to take care of them and support them: of these he left
      some in Thessaly, and some at Siris in Paionia, and some in Macedonia. In
      these parts too he had left behind him the sacred chariot of Zeus, when he
      was marching against Hellas; but on his return he did not receive it back:
      for the Paionians had given it to the Thracians, and when Xerxes asked for
      it again, they said that the mares while at pasture had been carried off
      by the Thracians of the upper country, who dwelt about the source of the
      Strymon.
    </p>
<p>
      116. Here also a Thracian, the king of the Bisaltians and of the
      Crestonian land, did a deed of surpassing horror; for he had said that he
      would not himself be subject to Xerxes with his own will and had gone away
      up to Mount Rhodope, and also he had forbidden his sons to go on the march
      against Hellas. They however, either because they cared not for his
      command, or else because a desire came upon them to see the war, went on
      the march with the Persian: and when they returned all unhurt, being six
      in number, their father plucked out their eyes for this cause.
    </p>
<p>
      117. They then received this reward: and as to the Persians, when passing
      on from Thrace they came to the passage, they crossed over the Hellespont
      in haste to Abydos by means of the ships, for they did not find the
      floating-bridges still stretched across but broken up by a storm. While
      staying there for a time they had distributed to them an allowance of food
      more abundant than they had had by the way, and from satisfying their
      hunger without restraint and also from the changes of water there died
      many of those in the army who had remained safe till then. The rest
      arrived with Xerxes at Sardis.
    </p>
<p>
      118. There is also another story reported as follows, namely that when
      Xerxes on his march away from Athens came to Eïon on the Strymon, from
      that point he did not continue further to make marches by road, but
      delivered his army to Hydarnes to lead back to the Hellespont, while he
      himself embarked in a Phenician ship and set forth for Asia; and as he
      sailed he was seized by a wind from the Strymon, <a href="#link8note-85" id="link8noteref-85" class="pginternal">85</a> violent and raising
      great waves; and since he was tossed by the storm more and more, the ship
      being heavily laden (for there were upon the deck great numbers of
      Persians, those namely who went with Xerxes), the king upon that falling
      into fear shouted aloud and asked the pilot whether there were for them
      any means of safety. He said: "Master, there are none, unless some way be
      found of freeing ourselves of the excessive number of passengers." Then it
      is said that Xerxes, when he heard this, spoke thus: "Persians, now let
      each one of you show that he has care for the king; for my safety, as it
      seems, depends upon you." He, they say, thus spoke, and they made
      obeisance to him and leapt out into the sea; and so the ship being
      lightened came safe to Asia. As soon as they had landed Xerxes, they say,
      first presented the pilot with a wreath of gold, because he had saved the
      life of the king, and then cut off his head, because he had caused the
      death of many of the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      119. This other story, I say, is reported about the return of Xerxes, but
      I for my part can by no means believe it, either in other respects or as
      regards this which is said to have happened to the Persians; for if this
      which I have related had in truth been said by the pilot to Xerxes, not
      one person's opinion in ten thousand will differ from mine that the king
      would have done some such thing as this, that is to say, he would have
      caused those who were upon the deck to go down below into the hold, seeing
      that they were Persians of the highest rank among the Persians; and of the
      rowers, who were Phenicians, he would have thrown out into the sea a
      number equal to the number of those. In fact however, as I have said
      before, he made his return to Asia together with the rest of the army by
      road.
    </p>
<p>
      120. And this also which follows is a strong witness that it was so; for
      Xerxes is known to have come to Abdera on his way back, and to have made
      with them a guest-friendship and presented them with a Persian sword of
      gold and a gold-spangled tiara: and as the men of Abdera themselves say
      (though I for my part can by no means believe it), he loosed his girdle
      for the first time during his flight back from Athens, considering himself
      to be in security. Now Abdera is situated further towards the Hellespont
      than the river Strymon and Eïon, from which place the story says that he
      embarked in the ship.
    </p>
<p>
      121. The Hellenes meanwhile, when it proved that they were not able to
      conquer Andros, turned towards Carystos, and having laid waste the land of
      that people they departed and went to Salamis. First then for the gods
      they chose out first-fruits of the spoil, and among them three Persian
      triremes, one to be dedicated as an offering at the Isthmus, which
      remained there still up to my time, another at Sunion, and the third to
      Ajax in Salamis where they were. After this they divided the spoil among
      themselves and sent the first-fruits <a href="#link8note-86" id="link8noteref-86" class="pginternal">86</a> to Delphi, of which was
      made a statue holding in its hand the beak of a ship and in height
      measuring twelve cubits. This statue stood in the same place with the
      golden statue of Alexander the Macedonian.
    </p>
<p>
      122. Then when the Hellenes had sent first-fruits to Delphi, they asked
      the god on behalf of all whether the first-fruits which he had received
      were fully sufficient and acceptable to him. He said that from the
      Hellenes he had received enough, but not from the Eginetans, and from them
      he demanded the offering of their prize of valour for the sea-fight at
      Salamis. Hearing this the Eginetans dedicated golden stars, three in
      number, upon a ship's mast of bronze, which are placed in the corner <a href="#link8note-87" id="link8noteref-87" class="pginternal">87</a>
      close to the mixing-bowl of Croesus.
    </p>
<p>
      123. After the division of the spoil the Hellenes sailed to the Isthmus,
      to give the prize of valour to him who of all the Hellenes had proved
      himself the most worthy during this war: and when they had come thither
      and the commanders distributed <a href="#link8note-88" id="link8noteref-88" class="pginternal">88</a> their votes at the
      altar of Poseidon, selecting from the whole number the first and the
      second in merit, then every one of them gave in his vote for himself, each
      man thinking that he himself had been the best; but for the second place
      the greater number of votes came out in agreement, assigning that to
      Themistocles. They then were left alone in their votes, while Themistocles
      in regard to the second place surpassed the rest by far:
    </p>
<p>
      124, and although the Hellenes would not give decision of this by reason
      of envy, but sailed away each to their own city without deciding, yet
      Themistocles was loudly reported of and was esteemed throughout Hellas to
      be the man who was the ablest <a href="#link8note-89" id="link8noteref-89" class="pginternal">89</a> by far of the Hellenes:
      and since he had not received honour from those who had fought at Salamis,
      although he was the first in the voting, he went forthwith after this to
      Lacedemon, desiring to receive honour there; and the Lacedemonians
      received him well and gave him great honours. As a prize of valour they
      gave to Eurybiades a wreath of olive; and for ability and skill they gave
      to Themistocles also a wreath of olive, and presented him besides with the
      chariot which was judged to be the best in Sparta. So having much
      commended him, they escorted him on his departure with three hundred
      picked men of the Spartans, the same who are called the "horsemen," <a href="#link8note-90" id="link8noteref-90" class="pginternal">90</a> as
      far as the boundaries of Tegea: and he is the only man of all we know to
      whom the Spartans ever gave escort on his way.
    </p>
<p>
      125. When however he had come to Athens from Lacedemon, Timodemos of
      Aphidnai, one of the opponents of Themistocles, but in other respects not
      among the men of distinction, maddened by envy attacked him, bringing
      forward against him his going to Lacedemon, and saying that it was on
      account of Athens that he had those marks of honour which he had from the
      Lacedemonians, and not on his own account. Then, as Timodemos continued
      ceaselessly to repeat this, Themistocles said: "I tell thee thus it is:—if
      I had been a native of Belbina <a href="#link8note-91" id="link8noteref-91" class="pginternal">91</a> I should never have
      been thus honoured by the Spartans; but neither wouldest thou, my friend,
      for all that thou art an Athenian." So far then went these matters.
    </p>
<p>
      126. Artabazos meanwhile the son of Pharnakes, a man who was held in
      esteem among the Persians even before this and came to be so yet more
      after the events about Plataia, was escorting the king as far as the
      passage with six myriads <a href="#link8note-92" id="link8noteref-92" class="pginternal">92</a> of that army which Mardonios had selected for
      himself; and when the king was in Asia and Artabazos on his march back
      came near to Pallene, finding that Mardonios was wintering in Thessaly and
      Macedonia and was not at present urgent with him to come and join the rest
      of the army, he thought it not good to pass by without reducing the
      Potidaians to slavery, whom he had found in revolt: for the men of
      Potidaia, when the king had marched by them and when the fleet of the
      Persians had departed in flight from Salamis, had openly made revolt from
      the Barbarians; and so also had the others done who occupy Pallene.
    </p>
<p>
      127. So upon this Artabazos began to besiege Potidaia, and suspecting that
      the men of Olynthos also were intending revolt from the king, he began to
      besiege this city too, which was occupied by Bottiaians who had been
      driven away from the Thermaian gulf by the Macedonians. So when he had
      taken these men by siege, he brought them forth to a lake and slew them <a href="#link8note-93" id="link8noteref-93" class="pginternal">93</a>
      there; and the city he delivered to Critobulos of Torone to have in
      charge, and to the natives of Chalkidike; and thus it was that the
      Chalkidians got possession of Olynthos.
    </p>
<p>
      128. Having taken this city Artabazos set himself to attack Potidaia with
      vigour, and as he was setting himself earnestly to this work, Timoxeinos
      the commander of the troops from Skione concerted with him to give up the
      town by treachery. Now in what manner he did this at the first, I for my
      part am not able to say, for this is not reported; at last however it
      happened as follows. Whenever either Timoxeinos wrote a paper wishing to
      send it to Artabazos, or Artabazos wishing to send one to Timoxeinos, they
      wound it round by the finger-notches <a href="#link8note-94" id="link8noteref-94" class="pginternal">94</a> of an arrow, and then,
      putting feathers over the paper, they shot it to a place agreed upon
      between them. It came however to be found out that Timoxeinos was
      attempting by treachery to give up Potidaia; for Artabazos, shooting an
      arrow at the place agreed upon, missed this spot and struck a man of
      Potidaia in the shoulder; and when he was struck, a crowd came about him,
      as is apt to happen when there is fighting, and they forthwith took the
      arrow and having discovered the paper carried it to the commanders. Now
      there was present an allied force of the other men of Pallene also. Then
      when the commanders had read the paper and discovered who was guilty of
      the treachery, they resolved not openly to convict <a href="#link8note-95" id="link8noteref-95" class="pginternal">95</a> Timoxeinos of
      treachery, for the sake of the city of Skione, lest the men of Skione
      should be esteemed traitors for all time to come.

      129. He then in such a manner as this had been discovered; and when three
      months had gone by while Artabazos was besieging the town, there came to
      be a great ebb of the sea backwards, which lasted for a long time; and the
      Barbarians, seeing that shallow water had been produced, endeavoured to
      get by into the peninsula of Pallene, <a href="#link8note-96" id="link8noteref-96" class="pginternal">96</a> but when they had
      passed through two fifth-parts of the distance, and yet three-fifths
      remained, which they must pass through before they were within Pallene,
      then there came upon them a great flood-tide of the sea, higher than ever
      before, as the natives of the place say, though high tides come often. So
      those of them who could not swim perished, and those who could were slain
      by the men of Potidaia who put out to them in boats. The cause of the high
      tide and flood and of that which befell the Persians was this, as the
      Potidaians say, namely that these same Persians who perished by means of
      the sea had committed impiety towards the temple of Poseidon and his image
      in the suburb of their town; and in saying that this was the cause, in my
      opinion they say well. The survivors of his army Artabazos led away to
      Thessaly to join Mardonios. Thus it fared with these who escorted the king
      on his way.
    </p>
<p>
      130. The fleet of Xerxes, so much of it as remained, when it had touched
      Asia in its flight from Salamis, and had conveyed the king and his army
      over from the Chersonese to Abydos, passed the winter at Kyme: and when
      spring dawned upon it, it assembled early at Samos, where some of the
      ships had even passed the winter; and most of the Persians and Medes still
      served as fighting-men on board of them. <a href="#link8note-97" id="link8noteref-97" class="pginternal">97</a> To be commanders of
      them there came Mardontes the son of Bagaios, and Artaÿntes the son of
      Artachaies, and with them also Ithamitres was in joint command, who was
      brother's son to Artaÿntes and had been added by the choice of Artaÿntes
      himself. They then, since they had suffered a heavy blow, did not advance
      further up towards the West, nor did any one compel them to do so; but
      they remained still in Samos and kept watch over Ionia, lest it should
      revolt, having three hundred ships including those of the Ionians; and
      they did not expect that the Hellenes on their part would come to Ionia,
      but thought that it would satisfy them to guard their own land, judging
      from the fact that they had not pursued after them in their flight from
      Salamis but were well contented then to depart homewards. As regards the
      sea then their spirit was broken, but on land they thought that Mardonios
      would get much the advantage. So they being at Samos were taking counsel
      to do some damage if they could to their enemies, and at the same time
      they were listening for news how the affairs of Mardonios would fall out.
    </p>
<p>
      131. The Hellenes on their part were roused both by the coming on of
      spring and by the presence of Mardonios in Thessaly. Their land-army had
      not yet begun to assemble, when the fleet arrived at Egina, in number one
      hundred and ten ships, and the commander and admiral was Leotychides, who
      was the son of Menares, the son of Hegesilaos, the son of Hippocratides,
      the son of Leotychides, the son of Anaxilaos, the son of Archidemos, the
      son of Anaxandriddes, the son of Theopompos, the son of Nicander, the son
      of Charilaos, <a href="#link8note-98" id="link8noteref-98" class="pginternal">98</a> the son of Eunomos, the son of Polydectes, the
      son of Prytanis, the son of Euryphon, <a href="#link8note-99" id="link8noteref-99" class="pginternal">99</a> the son of Procles, the
      son of Aristodemos, the son of Aristomachos, the son of Cleodaios, the son
      of Hyllos, the son of Heracles, being of the other royal house. <a href="#link8note-100" id="link8noteref-100" class="pginternal">100</a>
      These all, except the two <a href="#link8note-101" id="link8noteref-101" class="pginternal">101</a> enumerated first after Leotychides, had been
      kings of Sparta. And of the Athenians the commander was Xanthippos the son
      of Ariphon.
    </p>
<p>
      132. When all the ships had arrived at Egina, there came Ionian envoys to
      the camp of the Hellenes, who also came a short time before this to Sparta
      and asked the Lacedemonians to set Ionia free; and of them one was
      Herodotus the son of Basileides. These had banded themselves together and
      had plotted to put to death Strattis the despot of Chios, being originally
      seven in number; but when one of those who took part with them gave
      information of it and they were discovered to be plotting against him,
      then the remaining six escaped from Chios and came both to Sparta and also
      at this time to Egina, asking the Hellenes to sail over to Ionia: but they
      with difficulty brought them forward as far as Delos; for the parts beyond
      this were all fearful to the Hellenes, since they were without experience
      of those regions and everything seemed to them to be filled with armed
      force, while their persuasion was that it was as long a voyage to Samos as
      to the Pillars of Heracles. Thus at the same time it so chanced that the
      Barbarians dared sail no further up towards the West than Samos, being
      smitten with fear, and the Hellenes no further down towards the East than
      Delos, when the Chians made request of them. So fear was guard of the
      space which lay between them.
    </p>
<p>
      133. The Hellenes, I say, sailed to Delos; and Mardonios meanwhile had
      been wintering in Thessaly. From thence he sent round a man, a native of
      Europos, whose name was Mys, to the various Oracles, charging him to go
      everywhere to consult, <a href="#link8note-102" id="link8noteref-102" class="pginternal">102</a> wherever they <a href="#link8note-103" id="link8noteref-103" class="pginternal">103</a> were permitted to
      make trial of the Oracles. What he desired to find out from the Oracles
      when he gave this charge, I am not able to say, for that is not reported;
      but I conceive for my part that he sent to consult about his present
      affairs and not about other things.
    </p>
<p>
      134. This Mys is known to have come to Lebadeia and to have persuaded by
      payment of money one of the natives of the place to go down to Trophonios,
      and also he came to the Oracle at Abai of the Phokians; and moreover when
      he came for the first time to Thebes, he not only consulted the Ismenian
      Apollo,—there one may consult just as at Olympia with victims,—but
      also by payment he persuaded a stranger who was not a Theban, and induced
      him to lie down to sleep in the temple of Amphiaraos. In this temple no
      one of the Thebans is permitted to seek divination, and that for the
      following reason:—Amphiaraos dealing by oracles bade them choose
      which they would of these two things, either to have him as a diviner or
      else as an ally in war, abstaining from the other use; and they chose that
      he should be their ally in war: for this reason it is not permitted to any
      of the Thebans to lie down to sleep in that temple.
    </p>
<p>
      135. After this a thing which to me is a very great marvel is said by the
      Thebans to have come to pass:—it seems that this man Mys of Europos,
      as he journeyed round to all the Oracles, came also to the sacred
      enclosure of the Ptoan Apollo. This temple is called "Ptoon," and belongs
      to the Thebans, and it lies above the lake Copaïs at the foot of the
      mountains, close to the town of Acraiphia. When the man called Mys came to
      this temple with three men chosen from the citizens <a href="#link8note-104" id="link8noteref-104" class="pginternal">104</a>
      in his company, who were sent by the public authority to write down that
      which the god should utter in his divination, forthwith it is said the
      prophet <a href="#link8note-105" id="link8noteref-105" class="pginternal">105</a> of the god began to give the oracle in a
      Barbarian tongue; and while those of the Thebans who accompanied him were
      full of wonder, hearing a Barbarian instead of the Hellenic tongue, and
      did not know what to make of the matter before them, it is said that the
      man of Europos, Mys, snatched from them the tablet which they bore and
      wrote upon it that which was being spoken by the prophet; and he said that
      the prophet was giving his answer in the Carian tongue: and then when he
      had written it, he went away and departed to Thessaly.
    </p>
<p>
      136. Mardonios having read that which the Oracles uttered, whatever that
      was, after this sent as an envoy to Athens Alexander the son of Amyntas,
      the Macedonian, both because the Persians were connected with him by
      marriage, (for Gygaia the sister of Alexander and daughter of Amyntas had
      been married to a Persian Bubares, <a href="#link8note-106" id="link8noteref-106" class="pginternal">106</a> and from her had
      been born to him that Amyntas who lived in Asia, having the name of his
      mother's father, to whom the king gave Alabanda, <a href="#link8note-107" id="link8noteref-107" class="pginternal">107</a> a great city of
      Phrygia, to possess), and also Mardonios was sending him because he was
      informed that Alexander was a public guest-friend and benefactor of the
      Athenians; for by this means he thought that he would be most likely to
      gain over the Athenians to his side, about whom he heard that they were a
      numerous people and brave in war, and of whom he knew moreover that these
      were they who more than any others had brought about the disasters which
      had befallen the Persians by sea. Therefore if these should be added to
      him, he thought that he should easily have command of the sea (and this in
      fact would have been the case), while on land he supposed himself to be
      already much superior in force. Thus he reckoned that his power would be
      much greater than that of the Hellenes. Perhaps also the Oracles told him
      this beforehand, counselling him to make the Athenian his ally, and so he
      was sending in obedience to their advice.
    </p>
<p>
      137. Now of this Alexander the seventh ancestor <a href="#link8note-108" id="link8noteref-108" class="pginternal">108</a> was that Perdiccas
      who first became despot of the Macedonians, and that in the manner which
      here follows:—From Argos there fled to the Illyrians three brothers
      of the descendents of Temenos, Gauanes, Aëropos, and Perdiccas; and
      passing over from the Illyrians into the upper parts of Macedonia they
      came to the city of Lebaia. There they became farm-servants for pay in the
      household of the king, one pasturing horses, the second oxen, and the
      youngest of them, namely Perdiccas, the smaller kinds of cattle; for <a href="#link8note-109" id="link8noteref-109" class="pginternal">109</a>
      in ancient times even those who were rulers over men <a href="#link8note-110" id="link8noteref-110" class="pginternal">110</a>
      were poor in money, and not the common people only; and the wife of the
      king cooked for them their food herself. And whenever she baked, the loaf
      of the boy their servant, namely Perdiccas, became double as large as by
      nature it should be. When this happened constantly in the same manner, she
      told it to her husband, and he when he heard it conceived forthwith that
      this was a portent and tended to something great. He summoned the
      farm-servants therefore, and gave notice to them to depart out of his
      land; and they said that it was right that before they went forth they
      should receive the wages which were due. Now it chanced that the sun was
      shining into the house down through the opening which received the smoke,
      and the king when he heard about the wages said, being infatuated by a
      divine power: "I pay you then this for wages, and it is such as ye
      deserve," pointing to the sunlight. So then Gauanes and Aëropos the elder
      brothers stood struck with amazement when they heard this, but the boy,
      who happened to have in his hand a knife, said these words: "We accept, O
      king, that which thou dost give;" and he traced a line with his knife
      round the sunlight on the floor of the house, and having traced the line
      round he thrice drew of the sunlight into his bosom, and after that he
      departed both himself and his fellows.
    </p>
<p>
      138. They then were going away, and to the king one of those who sat by
      him at table told what manner of thing the boy had done, and how the
      youngest of them had taken that which was given with some design: and he
      hearing this and being moved with anger, sent after them horsemen to slay
      them. Now there is a river in this land to which the descendents of these
      men from Argos sacrifice as a saviour. This river, so soon as the sons of
      Temenos had passed over it, began to flow with such great volume of water
      that the horsemen became unable to pass over. So the brothers, having come
      to another region of Macedonia, took up their dwelling near the so-called
      gardens of Midas the son of Gordias, where roses grow wild which have each
      one sixty petals and excel all others in perfume. In these gardens too
      Silenos was captured, as is reported by the Macedonians: and above the
      gardens is situated a mountain called Bermion, which is inaccessible by
      reason of the cold. Having taken possession of that region, they made this
      their starting-point, and proceeded to subdue also the rest of Macedonia.
    </p>
<p>
      139. From this Perdiccas the descent of Alexander was as follows:—Alexander
      was the son of Amyntas, Amyntas was the son of Alketes, the father of
      Alketes was Aëropos, of him Philip, of Philip Argaios, and of this last
      the father was Perdiccas, who first obtained the kingdom.
    </p>
<p>
      140. Thus then, I say, Alexander the son of Amyntas was descended; and
      when he came to Athens sent from Mardonios, he spoke as follows: (a)
      "Athenians, Mardonios speaks these words:—There has come to me a
      message from the king which speaks in this manner:—To the Athenians
      I remit all the offences which were committed against me: and now,
      Mardonios, thus do,—first give them back their own land; then let
      them choose for themselves another in addition to this, whichsoever they
      desire, remaining independent; and set up for them again all their
      temples, which I set on fire, provided that they consent to make a treaty
      with me. This message having come to me, it is necessary for me to do so,
      unless by your means I am prevented: and thus I speak to you now:—Why
      are ye so mad as to raise up war against the king? since neither will ye
      overcome him, nor are ye able to hold out against him for ever: for ye saw
      the multitude of the host of Xerxes and their deeds, and ye are informed
      also of the power which is with me at the present time; so that even if ye
      overcome and conquer us (of which ye can have no hope if ye are rightly
      minded), another power will come many times as large. Do not ye then
      desire to match yourselves with the king, and so to be both deprived of
      your land and for ever running a course for your own lives; but make peace
      with him: and ye have a most honourable occasion to make peace, since the
      king has himself set out upon this road: agree to a league with us then
      without fraud or deceit, and remain free. (b) These things Mardonios
      charged me to say to you, O Athenians; and as for me, I will say nothing
      of the goodwill towards you on my part, for ye would not learn that now
      for the first time; but I ask of you to do as Mardonios says, since I
      perceive that ye will not be able to war with Xerxes for ever,—if I
      perceived in you ability to do this, I should never have come to you
      speaking these words,—for the power of the king is above that of a
      man and his arm is very long. If therefore ye do not make an agreement
      forthwith, when they offer you great things as the terms on which they are
      willing to make a treaty, I have fear on your behalf, seeing that ye dwell
      more upon the highway than any of your allies, and are exposed ever to
      destruction alone, the land which ye possess being parted off from the
      rest and lying between the armies which are contending together. <a href="#link8note-111" id="link8noteref-111" class="pginternal">111</a>
      Nay, but be persuaded, for this is a matter of great consequence to you,
      that to you alone of the Hellenes the great king remits the offences
      committed and desires to become a friend."
    </p>
<p>
      141. Thus spoke Alexander; and the Lacedemonians having been informed that
      Alexander had come to Athens to bring the Athenians to make a treaty with
      the Barbarians, and remembering the oracles, who it was destined that they
      together with the other Dorians should be driven forth out of the
      Peloponnese by the Medes and the Athenians combined, had been very greatly
      afraid lest the Athenians should make a treaty with the Persians; and
      forthwith they had resolved to send envoys. It happened moreover that they
      were introduced at the same time with Alexander; <a href="#link8note-112" id="link8noteref-112" class="pginternal">112</a> for the Athenians
      had waited for them, protracting the time, because they were well assured
      that the Lacedemonians would hear that an envoy had come from the
      Barbarians to make a treaty, and that having heard it they would
      themselves send envoys with all speed. They acted therefore of set
      purpose, so as to let the Lacedemonians see their inclination.
    </p>
<p>
      142. So when Alexander had ceased speaking, the envoys from Sparta
      followed him forthwith and said: "As for us, the Lacedemonians sent us to
      ask of you not to make any change in that which concerns Hellas, nor to
      accept proposals from the Barbarian; since this is not just in any way nor
      honourable for any of the Hellenes to do, but least of all for you, and
      that for many reasons. Ye were they who stirred up this war, when we by no
      means willed it; and the contest came about for your dominion, but now it
      extends even to the whole of Hellas. Besides this it is by no means to be
      endured that ye Athenians, who are the authors of all this, should prove
      to be the cause of slavery to the Hellenes, seeing that ye ever from
      ancient time also have been known as the liberators of many. We feel
      sympathy however with you for your sufferings and because ye were deprived
      of your crops twice and have had your substance ruined now for a long
      time. In compensation for this the Lacedemonians and their allies make
      offer to support your wives and all those of your households who are
      unfitted for war, so long as this war shall last: but let not Alexander
      the Macedonian persuade you, making smooth the speech of Mardonios; for
      these things are fitting for him to do, since being himself a despot he is
      working in league with a despot: for you however they are not fitting to
      do, if ye chance to be rightly minded; for ye know that in Barbarians
      there is neither faith nor truth at all."
    </p>
<p>
      Thus spoke the envoys:
    </p>
<p>
      143, and to Alexander the Athenians made answer thus: "Even of ourselves
      we know so much, that the Mede has a power many times as numerous as ours;
      so that there is no need for thee to cast this up against us. Nevertheless
      because we long for liberty we shall defend ourselves as we may be able:
      and do not thou endeavour to persuade us to make a treaty with the
      Barbarian, for we on our part shall not be persuaded. And now report to
      Mardonios that the Athenians say thus:—So long as the Sun goes on
      the same course by which he goes now, we will never make an agreement with
      Xerxes; but we will go forth to defend ourselves <a href="#link8note-113" id="link8noteref-113" class="pginternal">113</a> against him,
      trusting in the gods and the heroes as allies, for whom he had no respect
      when he set fire to their houses and to their sacred images. And in the
      future do not thou appear before the Athenians with any such proposals as
      these, nor think that thou art rendering them good service in advising
      them to do that which is not lawful; for we do not desire that thou
      shouldest suffer anything unpleasant at the hands of the Athenians, who
      art their public guest and friend."
    </p>
<p>
      144. To Alexander they thus made answer, but to the envoys from Sparta as
      follows: "That the Lacedemonians should be afraid lest we should make a
      treaty with the Barbarian was natural no doubt; <a href="#link8note-114" id="link8noteref-114" class="pginternal">114</a> but it seems to be
      an unworthy fear for men who know so well the spirit of the Athenians,
      namely that there is neither so great quantity of gold anywhere upon the
      earth, nor any land so much excelling in beauty and goodness, that we
      should be willing to accept it and enslave Hellas by taking the side of
      the Medes. For many and great are the reasons which hinder us from doing
      this, even though we should desire it; first and greatest the images and
      houses of the gods set on fire or reduced to ruin, which we must
      necessarily avenge to the very utmost rather than make an agreement with
      him who did these deeds; then secondly there is the bond of Hellenic race,
      by which we are of one blood and of one speech, the common temples of the
      gods and the common sacrifices, the manners of life which are the same for
      all; to these it would not be well that the Athenians should become
      traitors. And be assured of this, if by any chance ye were not assured of
      it before, that so long as one of the Athenians remains alive, we will
      never make an agreement with Xerxes. We admire however the forethought
      which ye had with regard to us, in that ye took thought for us who have
      had our substance destroyed, and are willing to support the members of our
      households; and so far as ye are concerned, the kindness has been fully
      performed: but we shall continue to endure as we may, and not be a trouble
      in any way to you. Now therefore, with full conviction this is so, send
      out an army as speedily as ye may: for, as we conjecture, the Barbarian
      will be here invading our land at no far distant time but so soon as he
      shall be informed of the message sent, namely that we shall do none of
      those things which he desired of us. Therefore before he arrives here in
      Attica, it is fitting that ye come to our rescue quickly in Boeotia." Thus
      the Athenians made answer, and upon that the envoys went away back to
      Sparta.

<h2>
      BOOK IX. THE NINTH BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED CALLIOPE
    </h2>
<p>
      1. Mardonios, when Alexander had returned back and had signified to him
      that which was said by the Athenians, set forth from Thessaly and began to
      lead his army with all diligence towards Athens: and to whatever land he
      came, he took up with him the people of that land. The leaders of Thessaly
      meanwhile did not repent of all that which had been done already, but on
      the contrary they urged on the Persian yet much more; and Thorax of
      Larissa had joined in escorting Xerxes in his flight and at this time he
      openly offered Mardonios passage to invade Hellas..
    </p>
<p>
      2. Then when the army in its march came to Boeotia, the Thebans
      endeavoured to detain Mardonios, and counselled him saying that there was
      no region more convenient for him to have his encampment than that; and
      they urged him not to advance further, but to sit down there and endeavour
      to subdue to himself the whole of Hellas without fighting: for to overcome
      the Hellenes by open force when they were united, as at the former time
      they were of one accord together, <a href="#link9note-1" id="link9noteref-1" class="pginternal">1</a> was a difficult task even
      for the whole world combined, "but," they proceeded, "if thou wilt do that
      which we advise, with little labour thou wilt have in thy power all their
      plans of resistance. <a href="#link9note-2" id="link9noteref-2" class="pginternal">2</a> Send money to the men who have power in their
      cities, and thus sending thou wilt divide Hellas into two parties: after
      that thou wilt with ease subdue by the help of thy party those who are not
      inclined to thy side.".
    </p>
<p>
      3. Thus they advised, but he did not follow their counsel; for there had
      instilled itself into him a great desire to take Athens for the second
      time, partly from obstinacy <a href="#link9note-3" id="link9noteref-3" class="pginternal">3</a> and partly because he meant to signify to the
      king in Sardis that he was in possession of Athens by beacon-fires through
      the islands. However he did not even at this time find the Athenians there
      when he came to Attica; but he was informed that the greater number were
      either in Salamis or in the ships, and he captured the city finding it
      deserted. Now the capture of the city by the king had taken place ten
      months before the later expedition of Mardonios against it.
    </p>
<p>
      4. When Mardonios had come to Athens, he sent to Salamis Morychides a man
      of the Hellespont, bearing the same proposals as Alexander the Macedonian
      had brought over to the Athenians. These he sent for the second time,
      being aware beforehand that the dispositions of the Athenians were not
      friendly, but hoping that they would give way and leave their obstinacy,
      since the Attic land had been captured by the enemy and was in his power..
    </p>
<p>
      5. For this reason he sent Morychides to Salamis; and he came before the
      Council <a href="#link9note-4" id="link9noteref-4" class="pginternal">4</a>
      and reported the words of Mardonios. Then one of the Councillors, Lykidas,
      expressed the opinion that it was better to receive the proposal which
      Morychides brought before them and refer it to the assembly of the people.
      <a href="#link9note-5" id="link9noteref-5" class="pginternal">5</a> He,
      I say, uttered this opinion, whether because he had received money from
      Mardonios, or because this was his own inclination: however the Athenians
      forthwith, both those of the Council and those outside, when they heard of
      it, were very indignant, and they came about Lykidas and stoned him to
      death; but the Hellespontian Morychides they dismissed unhurt. Then when
      there had arisen much uproar in Salamis about Lykidas, the women of the
      Athenians heard of that which was being done, and one woman passing the
      word to another and one taking another with her, they went of their own
      accord to the house of Lykidas and stoned his wife and his children to
      death.
    </p>
<p>
      6. The Athenians had passed over to Salamis as follows:—So long as
      they were looking that an army should come from the Peloponnese to help
      them, they remained in Attica; but as those in Peloponnesus acted very
      slowly and with much delay, while the invader was said to be already in
      Boeotia, they accordingly removed everything out of danger, and themselves
      passed over to Salamis; and at the same time they sent envoys to Lacedemon
      to reproach the Lacedemonians for having permitted the Barbarian to invade
      Attica and for not having gone to Boeotia to meet him in company with
      them, and also to remind them how many things the Persian had promised to
      give the Athenians if they changed sides; bidding the envoys warn them
      that if they did not help the Athenians, the Athenians would find some
      shelter <a href="#link9note-6" id="link9noteref-6" class="pginternal">6</a>
      for themselves..
    </p>
<p>
      7. For the Lacedemonians in fact were keeping a feast during this time,
      and celebrating the Hyakinthia; and they held it of the greatest
      consequence to provide for the things which concerned the god, while at
      the same time their wall which they had been building at the Isthmus was
      just at this moment being completed with battlements. And when the envoys
      from the Athenians came to Lacedemon, bringing with them also envoys from
      Megara and Plataia, they came in before the Ephors and said as follows:
      "The Athenians sent us saying that the king of the Medes not only offers
      to give us back our land, but also desires to make us his allies on fair
      and equal terms without deceit or treachery, <a href="#link9note-7" id="link9noteref-7" class="pginternal">7</a> and is desirous moreover
      to give us another land in addition to our own, whichsoever we shall
      ourselves choose. We however, having respect for Zeus of the Hellenes and
      disdaining to be traitors to Hellas, did not agree but refused, although
      we were unjustly dealt with by the other Hellenes and left to destruction,
      and although we knew that it was more profitable to make a treaty with the
      Persian than to carry on war: nor shall we make a treaty at any future
      time, if we have our own will. Thus sincerely is our duty done towards the
      Hellenes: <a href="#link9note-8" id="link9noteref-8" class="pginternal">8</a>
      but as for you, after having come then to great dread lest we should make
      a treaty with the Persian, so soon as ye learnt certainly what our spirit
      was, namely that we should never betray Hellas, and because your wall
      across the Isthmus is all but finished, now ye make no account of the
      Athenians, but having agreed with us to come to Boeotia to oppose the
      Persian, ye have now deserted us, and ye permitted the Barbarian moreover
      to make invasion of Attica. For the present then the Athenians have anger
      against you, for ye did not do as was fitting to be done: and now they bid
      <a href="#link9note-9" id="link9noteref-9" class="pginternal">9</a> you
      with all speed send out an army together with us, in order that we may
      receive the Barbarian in the land of Attica; for since we failed of
      Boeotia, the most suitable place to fight in our land is the Thriasian
      plain.".
    </p>
<p>
      8. When the Ephors heard this they deferred their reply to the next day,
      and then on the next day to the succeeding one; and this they did even for
      ten days, deferring the matter from day to day, while during this time the
      whole body of the Peloponnesians were building the wall over the Isthmus
      with great diligence and were just about to complete it. Now I am not able
      to say why, when Alexander the Macedonian had come to Athens, they were so
      very anxious lest the Athenians should take the side of the Medes, whereas
      now they had no care about it, except indeed that their wall over the
      Isthmus had now been built, and they thought they had no need of the
      Athenians any more; whereas when Alexander came to Attica the wall had not
      yet been completed, but they were working at it in great dread of the
      Persians..
    </p>
<p>
      9. At last however the answer was given and the going forth of the
      Spartans took place in the following manner:—on the day before that
      which was appointed for the last hearing of the envoys, Chileos a man of
      Tegea, who of all strangers had most influence in Lacedemon, heard from
      the Ephors all that which the Athenians were saying; and he, it seems,
      said to them these words: "Thus the matter stands, Ephors:—if the
      Athenians are not friendly with us but are allies of the Barbarian, then
      though a strong wall may have been built across the Isthmus, yet a wide
      door has been opened for the Persian into Peloponnesus. Listen to their
      request, however, before the Athenians resolve upon something else tending
      to the fall of Hellas.".
    </p>
<p>
      10. Thus he counselled them, and they forthwith took his words to heart;
      and saying nothing to the envoys who had come from the cities, while yet
      it was night they sent out five thousand Spartans, with no less than seven
      of the Helots set to attend upon each man of them, <a href="#link9note-901" id="link9noteref-901" class="pginternal">901</a> appointing Pausanias
      the son of Cleombrotos to lead them forth. Now the leadership belonged to
      Pleistarchos the son of Leonidas; but he was yet a boy, and the other was
      his guardian and cousin: for Cleombrotos, the father of Pausanias and son
      of Anaxandrides, was no longer alive, but when he had led home from the
      Isthmus the army which had built the wall, no long time after this he
      died. Now the reason why Cleombrotos led home the army from the Isthmus
      was this:—as he was offering sacrifice for fighting against the
      Persian, the sun was darkened in the heaven. And Pausanias chose as
      commander in addition to himself Euryanax the son of Dorieos, a man of the
      same house..
    </p>
<p>
      11. So Pausanias with his army had gone forth out of Sparta; and the
      envoys, when day had come, not knowing anything of this going forth, came
      in before the Ephors meaning to depart also, each to his own State: and
      when they had come in before them they said these words: "Ye, O
      Lacedemonians, are remaining here and celebrating this Hyakinthia and
      disporting yourselves, having left your allies to destruction; and the
      Athenians being wronged by you and for want of allies will make peace with
      the Persians on such terms as they can: and having made peace, evidently
      we become allies of the king, and therefore we shall join with him in
      expeditions against any land to which the Persians may lead us; and ye
      will learn then what shall be the issue for you of this matter." When the
      envoys spoke these words, the Ephors said and confirmed it with an oath,
      that they supposed by this time the men were at Orestheion on their way
      against the strangers: for they used to call the Barbarians "strangers."
      <a href="#link9note-10" id="link9noteref-10" class="pginternal">10</a>
      So they, not knowing of the matter, asked the meaning of these words, and
      asking they learnt all the truth; so that they were struck with amazement
      and set forth as quickly as possible in pursuit; and together with them
      five thousand chosen hoplites of the Lacedemonian "dwellers in the country
      round" <a href="#link9note-11" id="link9noteref-11" class="pginternal">11</a>
      did the same thing also.
    </p>
<p>
      12. They then, I say, were hastening towards the Isthmus; and the Argives
      so soon as they heard that Pausanias with his army had gone forth from
      Sparta, sent as a herald to Attica the best whom they could find of the
      long-distance runners, <a href="#link9note-12" id="link9noteref-12" class="pginternal">12</a> because they had before of their own motion
      engaged for Mardonios that they would stop the Spartans from going forth:
      and the herald when he came to Athens spoke as follows: "Mardonios, the
      Argives sent me to tell thee that the young men have gone forth from
      Lacedemon, and that the Argives are not able to stop them from going
      forth: with regard to this therefore may it be thy fortune to take
      measures well." <a href="#link9note-13" id="link9noteref-13" class="pginternal">13</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      13. He having spoken thus departed and went back; and Mardonios was by no
      means anxious any more to remain in Attica when he heard this message.
      Before he was informed of this he had been waiting, because he desired to
      know the news from the Athenians as to what they were about to do; and he
      had not been injuring or laying waste the land of Attica, because he hoped
      always that they would make a treaty with him; but as he did not persuade
      them, being now informed of everything he began to retire out of the
      country before the force of Pausanias arrived at the Isthmus, having first
      set fire to Athens and cast down and destroyed whatever was left standing
      of the walls, houses or temples. Now he marched away for this cause,
      namely first because Attica was not a land where horsemen could act
      freely, and also because, if he should be defeated in a battle in Attica,
      there was no way of retreat except by a narrow pass, so that a few men
      could stop them. He intended therefore to retreat to Thebes, and engage
      battle near to a friendly city and to a country where horsemen could act
      freely.
    </p>
<p>
      14. Mardonios then was retiring out of the way, and when he was already
      upon a road a message came to him saying that another body of troops in
      advance of the rest <a href="#link9note-14" id="link9noteref-14" class="pginternal">14</a> had come to Megara, consisting of a thousand
      Lacedemonians. Being thus informed he took counsel with himself, desiring
      if possible first to capture these. Therefore he turned back and proceeded
      to lead his army towards Megara, and the cavalry going in advance of the
      rest overran the Megaran land: this was the furthest land in Europe
      towards the sun-setting to which this Persian army came..
    </p>
<p>
      15. After this a message came to Mardonios that the Hellenes were
      assembled at the Isthmus; therefore he marched back by Dekeleia, for the
      chiefs of Boeotia <a href="#link9note-15" id="link9noteref-15" class="pginternal">15</a> had sent for those of the Asopians who dwelt
      near the line of march, and these were his guides along the road to
      Sphendaleis and thence to Tanagra. So having encamped for the night at
      Tanagra and on the next day having directed his march to Scolos, he was
      within the land of the Thebans. Then he proceeded to cut down the trees in
      the lands of the Thebans, although they were on the side of the Medes,
      moved not at all by enmity to them, but pressed by urgent necessity both
      to make a defence for his camp, and also he was making it for a refuge, in
      case that when he engaged battle things should not turn out for him as he
      desired. Now the encampment of his army extended from Erythrai along by
      Hysiai and reached the river Asopos: he was not however making the wall to
      extend so far as this, but with each face measuring somewhere about ten
      furlongs. <a href="#link9note-16" id="link9noteref-16" class="pginternal">16</a>
</p>
<p>
      16. While the Barbarians were engaged upon this work, Attaginos the son of
      Phyrnon, a Theban, having made magnificent preparations invited to an
      entertainment Mardonios himself and fifty of the Persians who were of most
      account; and these being invited came; and the dinner was given at Thebes.
      Now this which follows I heard from Thersander, an Orchomenian and a man
      of very high repute in Orchomenos. This Thersander said that he too was
      invited by Attaginos to this dinner, and there were invited also fifty men
      of the Thebans, and their host did not place them to recline <a href="#link9note-17" id="link9noteref-17" class="pginternal">17</a>
      separately each nation by themselves, but a Persian and a Theban upon
      every couch. Then when dinner was over, as they were drinking pledges to
      one another, <a href="#link9note-18" id="link9noteref-18" class="pginternal">18</a> the Persian who shared a couch with him
      speaking in the Hellenic tongue asked him of what place he was, and he
      answered that he was of Orchomenos. The other said: "Since now thou hast
      become my table-companion and the sharer of my libation, I desire to leave
      behind with thee a memorial of my opinion, in order that thou thyself also
      mayest know beforehand and be able to take such counsels for thyself as
      may be profitable. Dost thou see these Persians who are feasting here, and
      the army which we left behind encamped upon the river? Of all these, when
      a little time has gone by, thou shalt see but very few surviving." While
      the Persian said these words he shed many tears, as Thersander reported;
      and he marvelling at his speech said to him: "Surely then it is right to
      tell Mardonios and to those of the Persians who after him are held in
      regard." He upon this said: "Friend, that which is destined to come from
      God, it is impossible for a man to avert; for no man is willing to follow
      counsel, even when one speaks that which is reasonable. And these things
      which I say many of us Persians know well; yet we go with the rest being
      bound in the bonds of necessity: and the most hateful grief of all human
      griefs is this, to have knowledge of the truth but no power over the
      event." <a href="#link9note-19" id="link9noteref-19" class="pginternal">19</a>
      These things I heard from Thersander of Orchomenos, and in addition to
      them this also, namely that he told them to various persons forthwith,
      before the battle took place at Plataia.
    </p>
<p>
      17. Mardonios then being encamped in Boeotia, the rest of the Hellenes who
      lived in these parts and took the side of the Medes were all supplying
      troops and had joined in the invasion of Attica, but the Phokians alone
      had not joined in the invasion,—the Phokians, I say, for these too
      were now actively <a href="#link9note-20" id="link9noteref-20" class="pginternal">20</a> taking the side of the Medes, not of their own
      will however, but by compulsion. Not many days however after the arrival
      of Mardonios at Thebes, there came of them a thousand hoplites, and their
      leader was Harmokydes, the man who was of most repute among their
      citizens. When these too came to Thebes, Mardonios sent horsemen and bade
      the Phokians take up their position by themselves in the plain. After they
      had so done, forthwith the whole cavalry appeared; and upon this there
      went a rumour <a href="#link9note-21" id="link9noteref-21" class="pginternal">21</a> through the army of Hellenes which was with
      the Medes that the cavalry was about to shoot them down with javelins, and
      this same report went through the Phokians themselves also. Then their
      commander Harmokydes exhorted them, speaking as follows: "Phokians, it is
      manifest that these men are meaning to deliver us to a death which we may
      plainly foresee, <a href="#link9note-22" id="link9noteref-22" class="pginternal">22</a> because we have been falsely accused by the
      Thessalians, as I conjecture: now therefore it is right that every one of
      you prove himself a good man; for it is better to bring our lives to an
      end doing deeds of valour and defending ourselves, than to be destroyed by
      a dishonourable death offering ourselves for the slaughter. Let each man
      of them learn that they are Barbarians and that we, against whom they
      contrived murder, are Hellenes.".
    </p>
<p>
      18. While he was thus exhorting them, the horsemen having encompassed them
      round were riding towards them as if to destroy them; and they were
      already aiming their missiles as if about to discharge them, nay some
      perhaps did discharge them: and meanwhile the Phokians stood facing them
      gathered together and with their ranks closed as much as possible every
      way. Then the horsemen turned and rode away back. Now I am not able to say
      for certain whether they came to destroy the Phokians at the request of
      the Thessalians, and then when they saw them turn to defence they feared
      lest they also might suffer some loss, and therefore rode away back, for
      so Mardonios had commanded them; or whether on the other hand he desired
      to make trial of them and to see if they had in them any warlike spirit.
      Then, when the horsemen had ridden away back, Mardonios sent a herald and
      spoke to them as follows: "Be of good courage, Phokians, for ye proved
      yourselves good men, and not as I was informed. Now therefore carry on
      this way with zeal, for ye will not surpass in benefits either myself or
      the king." Thus far it happened as regards the Phokians.
    </p>
<p>
      19. When the Lacedemonians came to the Isthmus they encamped upon it, and
      hearing this the rest of the Peloponnesians who favoured the better cause,
      and some also because they saw the Spartans going out, did not think it
      right to be behind the Lacedemonians in their going forth. So from the
      Isthmus, when the sacrifices had proved favourable, they marched all
      together and came to Eleusis; and having performed sacrifices there also,
      when the signs were favourable they marched onwards, and the Athenians
      together with them, who had passed over from Salamis and had joined them
      at Eleusis. And then they had come to Erythrai in Boeotia, then they
      learnt that the Barbarians were encamping on the Asopos, and having
      perceived this they ranged themselves over against them on the lower
      slopes of Kithairon..
    </p>
<p>
      20. Then Mardonios, as the Hellenes did not descend into the plain, sent
      towards them all his cavalry, of which the commander was Masistios (by the
      Hellenes called Makistios), a man of reputation among the Persians, who
      had a Nesaian horse with a bridle of gold and in other respects finely
      caparisoned. So when the horsemen had ridden up to the Hellenes they
      attacked them by squadrons, and attacking <a href="#link9note-23" id="link9noteref-23" class="pginternal">23</a> they did them much
      mischief, and moreover in contempt they called them women..
    </p>
<p>
      21. Now it happened by chance that the Megarians were posted in the place
      which was the most assailable of the whole position and to which the
      cavalry could best approach: so as the cavalry were making their attacks,
      the Megarians being hard pressed sent a herald to the commanders of the
      Hellenes, and the herald having come spoke these words: "The Megarians
      say:—we, O allies, are not able by ourselves to sustain the attacks
      of the Persian cavalry, keeping this position where we took post at the
      first; nay, even hitherto by endurance and valour alone have we held out
      against them, hard pressed as we are: and now unless ye shall send some
      others to take up our position in succession to us, know that we shall
      leave the position in which we now are." The herald brought report to them
      thus; and upon this Pausanias made trial of the Hellenes, whether any
      others would voluntarily offer to go to this place and post themselves
      there in succession to the Megarians: and when the rest were not desirous
      to go, the Athenians undertook the task, and of the Athenians those three
      hundred picked men of whom Olympidoros the son of Lampon was captain.
    </p>
<p>
      22. These they were who undertook the task and were posted at Erythrai in
      advance of the other Hellenes who ere there present, having chosen to go
      with them the bow-men also. For some time then they fought, and at last an
      end was set to the fighting in the following manner:—while the
      cavalry was attacking by squadrons, the horse of Masistios, going in
      advance of the rest, was struck in the side by an arrow, and feeling pain
      he reared upright and threw Masistios off; and when he had fallen, the
      Athenians forthwith pressed upon him; and his horse they took and himself,
      as he made resistance, they slew, though at first they could not, for his
      equipment was of this kind,—he wore a cuirass of gold scales
      underneath, and over the cuirass he had put on a crimson tunic. So as they
      struck upon the cuirass they could effect nothing, until some one,
      perceiving what the matter was, thrust into his eye. Then at length he
      fell and died; and by some means the other men of the cavalry had not
      observed this take place, for they neither saw him when he had fallen from
      his horse nor when he was being slain, and while the retreat and the turn
      <a href="#link9note-24" id="link9noteref-24" class="pginternal">24</a>
      were being made, they did not perceive that which was happening; but when
      they had stopped their horses, then at once they missed him, since there
      was no one to command them; and when they perceived what had happened,
      they passed the word to one another and all rode together, that they might
      if possible recover the body..
    </p>
<p>
      23. The Athenians upon that, seeing that the cavalry were riding to attack
      them no longer by squadrons but all together, shouted to the rest of the
      army to help them. Then while the whole number of those on foot were
      coming to their help, there arose a sharp fight for the body; and so long
      as the three hundred were alone they had much the worse and were about to
      abandon the body, but when the mass of the army came to their help, then
      the horsemen no longer sustained the fight, nor did they succeed in
      recovering the body; and besides him they lost others of their number
      also. Then they drew off about two furlongs away and deliberated what they
      should do; and it seemed good to them, as they had no commander, to ride
      back to Mardonios..
    </p>
<p>
      24. When the cavalry arrived at the camp, the whole army and also
      Mardonios made great mourning for Masistios, cutting off their own hair
      and that of their horses and baggage-animals and giving way to lamentation
      without stint; for all Boeotia was filled with the sound of it, because
      one had perished who after Mardonios was of the most account with the
      Persians and with the king..
    </p>
<p>
      25. The Barbarians then were paying honours in their own manner to
      Masistios slain: but the Hellenes, when they had sustained the attack of
      the cavalry and having sustained it had driven them back, were much more
      encouraged; and first they put the dead body in a cart and conveyed it
      along their ranks; and the body was a sight worth seeing for its size and
      beauty, wherefore also the men left their places in the ranks and went one
      after the other <a href="#link9note-25" id="link9noteref-25" class="pginternal">25</a> to gaze upon Masistios. After this they
      resolved to come down further towards Plataia; for the region of Plataia
      was seen to be much more convenient for them to encamp in than that of
      Erythrai, both for other reasons and because it is better watered. To this
      region then and to the spring Gargaphia, which is in this region, they
      resolved that they must come, and encamp in their several posts. So they
      took up their arms and went by the lower slopes of Kithairon past Hysiai
      to the Plataian land; and having there arrived they posted themselves
      according to their several nations near the spring Gargaphia and the
      sacred enclosure of Androcrates the hero, over low hills or level ground.
    </p>
<p>
      26. Then in the arranging of the several posts there arose a contention of
      much argument <a href="#link9note-2501" id="link9noteref-2501" class="pginternal">2501</a> between the Tegeans and the Athenians; for
      they each claimed to occupy the other wing of the army <a href="#link9note-26" id="link9noteref-26" class="pginternal">26</a>
      themselves, alleging deeds both new and old. The Tegeans on the one hand
      said as follows: "We have been always judged worthy of this post by the
      whole body of allies in all the common expeditions which the
      Peloponnesians have made before this, whether in old times or but lately,
      ever since that time when the sons of Heracles endeavoured after the death
      of Eurystheus to return to the Peloponnese. This honour we gained at that
      time by reason of the following event:—When with the Achaians and
      the Ionians who were then in Peloponnesus we had come out to the Isthmus
      to give assistance and were encamped opposite those who desired to return,
      then it is said that Hyllos made a speech saying that it was not right
      that the one army should risk its safety by engaging battle with the
      other, and urging that that man of the army of the Peloponnesians whom
      they should judge to be the best of them should fight in single combat
      with himself on terms concerted between them. The Peloponnesians then
      resolved that this should be done; and they made oath with one another on
      this condition,—that if Hyllos should conquer the leader of the
      Peloponnesians, then the sons of Heracles should return to their father's
      heritage; but he should be conquered, then on the other hand the sons of
      Heracles should depart and lead away their army, and not within a hundred
      years attempt to return to the Peloponnese. There was selected then of all
      the allies, he himself making a voluntary offer, Echemos the son of
      Aëropos, the son of Phegeus, <a href="#link9note-27" id="link9noteref-27" class="pginternal">27</a> who was our commander and king: and he fought
      a single combat and slew Hyllos. By reason of this deed we obtained among
      the Peloponnesians of that time, besides many other great privileges which
      we still possess, this also of always leading the other wing of the army,
      when a common expedition is made. To you, Lacedemonians, we make no
      opposition, but we give you freedom of choice, and allow you to command
      whichever wing ye desire; but of the other we say that it belongs to us to
      be the leaders as in former time: and apart from this deed which has been
      related, we are more worthy than the Athenians to have this post; for in
      many glorious contests have we contended against you, O Spartans, and in
      many also against others. Therefore it is just that we have the other wing
      rather than the Athenians; for they have not achieved deeds such as ours,
      either new or old.".
    </p>
<p>
      27. Thus they spoke, and the Athenians replied as follows: "Though we know
      that this gathering was assembled for battle with the Barbarian and not
      for speech, yet since the Tegean has proposed to us as a task to speak of
      things both old and new, the deeds of merit namely which by each of our
      two nations have been achieved in all time, it is necessary for us to
      point out to you whence it comes that to us, who have been brave men
      always, it belongs as a heritage rather than to the Arcadians to have the
      chief place. First as to the sons of Heracles, whose leader they say that
      they slew at the Isthmus, these in the former time, when they were driven
      away by all the Hellenes to whom they came flying from slavery under those
      of Mykene, we alone received; and joining with them we subdued the
      insolence of Eurystheus, having conquered in fight those who then dwelt in
      Peloponnesus. Again when the Argives who with Polyneikes marched against
      Thebes, had been slain and were lying unburied, we declare that we marched
      an army against the Cadmeians and recovered the dead bodies and gave them
      burial in our own land at Eleusis. We have moreover another glorious deed
      performed against the Amazons who invaded once the Attic land, coming from
      the river Thermodon: and in the toils of Troy we were not inferior to any.
      But it is of no profit to make mention of these things; for on the one
      hand, though we were brave men in those times, we might now have become
      worthless, and on the other hand even though we were then worthless, yet
      now we might be better. Let it suffice therefore about ancient deeds; but
      if by us no other deed has been displayed (as many there have been and
      glorious, not less than by any other people of the Hellenes), yet even by
      reason of the deed wrought at Marathon alone we are worthy to have this
      privilege and others besides this, seeing that we alone of all the
      Hellenes fought in single combat with the Persian, and having undertaken
      so great a deed we overcame and conquered six-and-forty nations. <a href="#link9note-28" id="link9noteref-28" class="pginternal">28</a>
      Are we not worthy then to have this post by reason of that deed alone?
      However, since at such a time as this it is not fitting to contend for
      post, we are ready to follow your saying, O Lacedemonians, as to where ye
      think it most convenient that we should stand and opposite to whom; for
      wheresoever we are posted, we shall endeavour to be brave men. Prescribe
      to us therefore and we shall obey." They made answer thus; and the whole
      body of the Lacedemonians shouted aloud that the Athenians were more
      worthy to occupy the wing than the Arcadians. Thus the Athenians obtained
      the wing, and overcame the Tegeans.
    </p>
<p>
      28. After this the Hellenes were ranged as follows, both those of them who
      came in continually afterwards <a href="#link9note-29" id="link9noteref-29" class="pginternal">29</a> and those who had come
      at the first. The right wing was held by ten thousand Lacedemonians; and
      of these the five thousand who were Spartans were attended by thirty-five
      thousand Helots serving as light-armed troops, seven of them appointed for
      each man. <a href="#link9note-30" id="link9noteref-30" class="pginternal">30</a> To stand next to themselves the Spartans chose
      the Tegeans, both to do them honour and also because of their valour; and
      of these there were one thousand five hundred hoplites. After these were
      stationed five thousand Corinthians, and they had obtained permission from
      Pausanias that the three hundred who were present of the men of Potidaia
      in Pallene should stand by their side. Next to these were stationed six
      hundred Arcadians of Orchomenos; and to these three thousand Sikyonians.
      Next after these were eight hundred Epidaurians: by the side of these were
      ranged a thousand Troizenians: next to the Troizenians two hundred
      Lepreates: next to these four hundred of the men of Mikene and Tiryns; and
      then a thousand Phliasians. By the side of these stood three hundred
      Hermionians; and next to the Hermionians were stationed six hundred
      Eretrians and Styrians; next to these four hundred Chalkidians; and to
      these five hundred men of Amprakia. After these stood eight hundred
      Leucadians and Anactorians; and next to them two hundred from Pale in
      Kephallenia. After these were ranged five hundred Eginetans; by their side
      three thousand Megarians; and next to these six hundred Plataians. Last,
      or if you will first, were ranged the Athenians, occupying the left wing,
      eight thousand in number, and the commander of them was Aristeides the son
      of Lysimachos..
    </p>
<p>
      29. These all, excepting those who were appointed to attend the Spartans,
      seven for each man, were hoplites, being in number altogether three
      myriads eight thousand and seven hundred. <a href="#link9note-31" id="link9noteref-31" class="pginternal">31</a> This was the whole
      number of hoplites who were assembled against the Barbarian; and the
      number of the light-armed was as follows:—of the Spartan division
      thirty-five thousand men, reckoning at the rate of seven for each man, and
      of these every one was equipped for fighting; and the light-armed troops
      of the rest of the Lacedemonians and of the other Hellenes, being about
      one for each man, amounted to thirty-four thousand five hundred..
    </p>
<p>
      30. Of the light-armed fighting men the whole number then was six myriads
      nine thousand and five hundred; <a href="#link9note-32" id="link9noteref-32" class="pginternal">32</a> and of the whole
      Hellenic force which assembled at Plataia the number (including both the
      hoplites and the light-armed fighting men) was eleven myriads <a href="#link9note-33" id="link9noteref-33" class="pginternal">33</a>
      all but one thousand eight hundred men; and with the Thespians who were
      present the number of eleven myriads was fully made up; for there were
      present also in the army those of the Thespians who survived, being in
      number about one thousand eight hundred, and these too were without heavy
      arms. <a href="#link9note-34" id="link9noteref-34" class="pginternal">34</a>
      These then having been ranged in order were encamped on the river Asopos.
    </p>
<p>
      31. Meanwhile the Barbarians with Mardonios, when they had sufficiently
      mourned for Masistios, being informed that the Hellenes were at Plataia
      came themselves also to that part of the Asopos which flows there; and
      having arrived there, they were ranged against the enemy by Mardonios
      thus:—against the Lacedemonians he stationed the Persians; and since
      the Persians were much superior in numbers, they were arrayed in deeper
      ranks than those, and notwithstanding this they extended in front of the
      Tegeans also: and he ranged them in this manner,—all the strongest
      part of that body he selected from the rest and stationed it opposite to
      the Lacedemonians, but the weaker part he ranged by their side opposite to
      the Tegeans. This he did on the information and suggestion of the Thebans.
      Then next to the Persians he ranged the Medes; and these extended in front
      of the Corinthians, Potidaians, Orchomenians and Sikyonians. Next to the
      Medes he ranged the Bactrians; and these extended in front of the
      Epidaurians, Troizenians, Lepreates, Tirynthians, Mykenians and
      Phliasians. After the Bactrians he stationed the Indians; and these
      extended in front of the Hermionians, Eretrians, Styrians and Chalkidians.
      Next to the Indians he ranged the Sacans, who extended in front of the men
      of Amprakia, the Anactorians, Leucadians, Palians and Eginetans. Next to
      the Sacans and opposite to the Athenians, Plataians and Megarians, he
      ranged the Boeotians, Locrians, Malians, Thessalians, and the thousand men
      of the Phokians: for not all the Phokians had taken the side of the Medes,
      but some of them were even supporting the cause of the Hellenes, being
      shut up in Parnassos; and setting out from thence they plundered from the
      army of Mardonios and from those of the Hellenes who were with him. He
      ranged the Macedonians also and those who dwell about the borders of
      Thessaly opposite to the Athenians..
    </p>
<p>
      32. These which have been named were the greatest of the nations who were
      arrayed in order by Mardonios, those, I mean, which were the most renowned
      and of greatest consideration: but there were in his army also men of
      several other nations mingled together, of the Phrygians, Thracians,
      Mysians, Paionians, and the rest; and among them also some Ethiopians, and
      of the Egyptians those called Hermotybians and Calasirians, <a href="#link9note-35" id="link9noteref-35" class="pginternal">35</a>
      carrying knives, <a href="#link9note-36" id="link9noteref-36" class="pginternal">36</a> who of all the Egyptians are the only
      warriors. These men, while he was yet at Phaleron, he had caused to
      disembark from the ships in which they served as fighting-men; for the
      Egyptians had not been appointed to serve in the land-army which came with
      Xerxes to Athens. Of the Barbarians then there were thirty myriads, <a href="#link9note-37" id="link9noteref-37" class="pginternal">37</a> as
      has been declared before; but of the Hellenes who were allies of Mardonios
      no man knows what the number was, for they were not numbered; but by
      conjecture I judge that these were assembled to the number of five
      myriads. These who were placed in array side by side were on foot; and the
      cavalry was ranged apart from them in a separate body.
    </p>
<p>
      33. When all had been drawn up by nations and by divisions, then on the
      next day they offered sacrifice on both sides. For the Hellenes Tisamenos
      the son of Antiochos was he who offered sacrifice, for he it was who
      accompanied this army as diviner. This man the Lacedemonians had made to
      be one of their own people, being an Eleian and of the race of the
      Iamidai: <a href="#link9note-38" id="link9noteref-38" class="pginternal">38</a> for when Tisamenos was seeking divination at
      Delphi concerning issue, the Pythian prophetess made answer to him that he
      should win five of the greatest contests. He accordingly, missing the
      meaning of the oracle, began to attend to athletic games, supposing that
      he should win contests of athletics; and he practised for the "five
      contests" <a href="#link9note-39" id="link9noteref-39" class="pginternal">39</a> and came within one fall of winning a victory
      at the Olympic games, <a href="#link9note-40" id="link9noteref-40" class="pginternal">40</a> being set to contend with Hieronymos of
      Andros. The Lacedemonians however perceived that the oracle given to
      Tisamenos had reference not to athletic but to martial contests, and they
      endeavoured to persuade Tisamenos by payment of money, and to make him a
      leader in their wars together with the kings of the race of Heracles. He
      then, seeing that the Spartans set much store on gaining him over as a
      friend, having perceived this, I say, he raised his price and signified to
      them that he would do as they desired, if they would make him a citizen of
      their State and give him full rights, but for no other payment. The
      Spartans at first when they heard this displayed indignation and
      altogether gave up their request, but at last, when great terror was
      hanging over them of this Persian armament, they gave way <a href="#link9note-41" id="link9noteref-41" class="pginternal">41</a>
      and consented. He then perceiving that they had changed their minds, said
      that he could not now be satisfied even so, nor with these terms alone;
      but it was necessary that his brother Hegias also should be made a Spartan
      citizen on the same terms as he himself became one..
    </p>
<p>
      34. By saying this he followed the example of Melampus in his request, <a href="#link9note-42" id="link9noteref-42" class="pginternal">42</a> if
      one may compare royal power with mere citizenship; for Melampus on his
      part, when the women in Argos had been seized by madness, and the Argives
      endeavoured to hire him to come from Pylos and to cause their women to
      cease from the malady, proposed as payment for himself the half of the
      royal power; and the Argives did not suffer this, but departed: and
      afterwards, when more of their women became mad, at length they accepted
      that which Melampus had proposed, and went to offer him this: but he then
      seeing that they had changed their minds, increased his demand, and said
      that he would not do that which they desired unless they gave to his
      brother Bias also the third share in the royal power. <a href="#link9note-43" id="link9noteref-43" class="pginternal">43</a>
      And the Argives, being driven into straits, consented to this also. 35.
      Just so the Spartans also, being very much in need of Tisamenos, agreed
      with him on any terms which he desired: and when the Spartans had agreed
      to this demand also, then Tisamenos the Eleian, having become a Spartan,
      had part with them in winning five of the greatest contests as their
      diviner: and these were the only men who ever were made fellow-citizens of
      the Spartans. Now the five contests were these: one and the first of them
      was this at Plataia; and after this the contest at Tegea, which took place
      with the Tegeans and the Argives; then that at Dipaieis against all the
      Arcadians except the Mantineians; after that the contest with the
      Messenians at Ithome; <a href="#link9note-44" id="link9noteref-44" class="pginternal">44</a> and last of all that which took place at
      Tanagra against the Athenians and Argives. This, I say, was accomplished
      last of the five contests.
    </p>
<p>
      36. This Tisamenos was acting now as diviner for the Hellenes in the
      Plataian land, being brought by the Spartans. Now to the Hellenes the
      sacrifices were of good omen if they defended themselves only, but not if
      they crossed the Asopos and began a battle;.
    </p>
<p>
      37, and Mardonios too, who was eager to begin a battle, found the
      sacrifices not favourable to this design, but they were of good omen to
      him also if he defended himself only; for he too used the Hellenic manner
      of sacrifice, having as diviner Hegesistratos an Eleian and the most
      famous of the Telliadai, whom before these events the Spartans had taken
      and bound, in order to put him to death, because they had suffered much
      mischief from him. He then being in this evil case, seeing that he was
      running a course for his life and was likely moreover to suffer much
      torment before his death, had done a deed such as may hardly be believed.
      Being made fast on a block bound with iron, he obtained an iron tool,
      which in some way had been brought in, and contrived forthwith a deed the
      most courageous of any that we know: for having first calculated how the
      remaining portion of his foot might be got out of the block, he cut away
      the flat of his own foot, <a href="#link9note-45" id="link9noteref-45" class="pginternal">45</a> and after that, since he was guarded still by
      warders, he broke through the wall and so ran away to Tegea, travelling
      during the nights and in the daytime entering a wood and resting there; so
      that, though the Lacedemonians searched for him in full force, he arrived
      at Tegea on the third night; and the Lacedemonians were possessed by great
      wonder both at his courage, when they saw the piece of the foot that was
      cut off lying there, and also because they were not able to find him. So
      he at that time having thus escaped them took refuge at Tegea, which then
      was not friendly with the Lacedemonians; and when he was healed and had
      procured for himself a wooden foot, he became an open enemy of the
      Lacedemonians. However in the end the enmity into which he had fallen with
      the Lacedemonians was not to his advantage; for he was caught by them
      while practising divination in Zakynthos, and was put to death.
    </p>
<p>
      38. However the death of Hegesistratos took place later than the events at
      Plataia, and he was now at the Asopos, having been hired by Mardonions for
      no mean sum, sacrificing and displaying zeal for his cause both on account
      of his enmity with the Lacedemonians and on account of the gain which he
      got: but as the sacrifices were not favourable for a battle either for the
      Persians themselves or for those Hellenes who were with them (for these
      also had a diviner for themselves, Hippomachos a Leucadian), and as the
      Hellenes had men constantly flowing in and were becoming more in number,
      Timagenides the son of Herpys, a Theban, counselled Mardonios to set a
      guard on the pass of Kithairon, saying that the Hellenes were constantly
      flowing in every day and that he would thus cut off large numbers..
    </p>
<p>
      39. Eight days had now passed while they had been sitting opposite to one
      another, when he gave this counsel to Mardonios; and Mardonios, perceiving
      that the advice was good, sent the cavalry when night came on to the pass
      of Kithairon leading towards Plataia, which the Boeotians call the "Three
      Heads" <a href="#link9note-46" id="link9noteref-46" class="pginternal">46</a>
      and the Athenians the "Oak Heads." <a href="#link9note-47" id="link9noteref-47" class="pginternal">47</a> Having been thus sent,
      the cavalry did not come without effect, for they caught five hundred
      baggage-animals coming out into the plain, which were bearing provisions
      from Peloponnesus to the army, and also the men who accompanied the carts:
      and having taken this prize the Persians proceeded to slaughter them
      without sparing either beast or man; and when they were satiated with
      killing they surrounded the rest and drove them into the camp to
      Mardonios.
    </p>
<p>
      40. After this deed they spent two days more, neither side wishing to
      begin a battle; for the Barbarians advanced as far as the Asopos to make
      trial of the Hellenes, but neither side would cross the river. However the
      cavalry of Mardonios made attacks continually and did damage to the
      Hellenes; for the Thebans, being very strong on the side of the Medes,
      carried on the war with vigour, and always directed them up to the moment
      of fighting; and after this the Persians and Medes took up the work and
      were they who displayed valour in their turn.
    </p>
<p>
      41. For ten days then nothing more was done than this; but when the
      eleventh day had come, while they still sat opposite to one another at
      Plataia, the Hellenes having by this time grown much more numerous and
      Mardonios being greatly vexed at the delay of action, then Mardonios the
      son of Gobryas and Artabazos the son of Pharnakes, who was esteemed by
      Xerxes as few of the Persians were besides, came to speech with one
      another; and as they conferred, the opinions they expressed were these,—that
      of Artabazos, that they must put the whole army in motion as soon as
      possible and go to the walls of the Thebans, whither great stores of corn
      had been brought in for them and fodder for their beasts; and that they
      should settle there quietly and get their business done as follows:—they
      had, he said, great quantities of gold, both coined and uncoined, and also
      of silver and of drinking-cups; and these he advised they should send
      about to the Hellenes without stint, more especially to those of the
      Hellenes who were leaders in their several cities; and these, he said,
      would speedily deliver up their freedom: and he advised that they should
      not run the risk of a battle. His opinion then was the same as that of the
      Thebans, <a href="#link9note-48" id="link9noteref-48" class="pginternal">48</a> for he as well as they had some true
      foresight: but the opinion of Mardonios was more vehement and more
      obstinate, and he was by no means disposed to yield; for he said that he
      thought their army far superior to that of the Hellenes, and he gave as
      his opinion that they should engage battle as quickly as possible and not
      allow them to assemble in still greater numbers than were already
      assembled; and as for the sacrifices of Hegesistratos, they should leave
      them alone and not endeavour to force a good sign, but follow the custom
      of the Persians and engage battle..
    </p>
<p>
      42. When he so expressed his judgment, none opposed him, and thus his
      opinion prevailed; for he and not Artabazos had the command of the army
      given him by the king. He summoned therefore the commanders of the
      divisions and the generals of those Hellenes who were with him, and asked
      whether they knew of any oracle regarding the Persians, which said that
      they should be destroyed in Hellas; and when those summoned to council <a href="#link9note-49" id="link9noteref-49" class="pginternal">49</a>
      were silent, some not knowing the oracles and others knowing them but not
      esteeming it safe to speak, Mardonios himself said: "Since then ye either
      know nothing or do not venture to speak, I will tell you, since I know
      very well. There is an oracle saying that the Persians are destined when
      they come to Hellas to plunder the temple at Delphi, and having plundered
      it to perish every one of them. We therefore, just because we know this,
      will not go to that temple nor will we attempt to plunder it; and for this
      cause we shall not perish. So many of you therefore as chance to wish well
      to the Persians, have joy so far as regards this matter, and be assured
      that we shall overcome the Hellenes." Having spoken to them thus, he next
      commanded to prepare everything and to set all in order, since at dawn of
      the next day a battle would be fought.
    </p>
<p>
      43. Now this oracle, which Mardonios said referred to the Persians, I know
      for my part was composed with reference with the Illyrians and the army of
      the Enchelians, and not with reference to the Persians at all. However,
      the oracle which was composed by Bakis with reference to this battle,
    </p>
<pre>
 "The gathering of Hellenes together and cry of Barbarian voices,
  Where the Thermodon flows, by the banks of grassy Asopos;
  Here very many shall fall ere destiny gave them to perish,
  Medes bow-bearing in fight, when the fatal day shall approach them,"—
</pre>
<p>
      these sayings, and others like them composed by Musaios, I know had
      reference to the Persians. Now the river Thermodon flows between Tanagra
      and Glisas.
    </p>
<p>
      44. After the inquiry about the oracles and the exhortation given by
      Mardonios night came on and the guards were set: and when night was far
      advanced, and it seemed that there was quiet everywhere in the camps, and
      that the men were in their deepest sleep, then Alexander the son of
      Amyntas, commander and king of the Macedonians, rode his horse up to the
      guard-posts of the Athenians and requested that he might have speech with
      their generals. So while the greater number of the guards stayed at their
      posts, some ran to the generals, and when they reached them they said that
      a man had come riding on a horse out of the camp of the Medes, who
      discovered nothing further, but only named the generals and said that he
      desired to have speech with them..
    </p>
<p>
      45. Having heard this, forthwith they accompanied the men to the
      guard-posts, and when they had arrived there, Alexander thus spoke to
      them: "Athenians, I lay up these words of mine as a trust to you, charging
      you to keep them secret and tell them to no one except only to Pausanias,
      lest ye bring me to ruin: for I should not utter them if I did not care
      greatly for the general safety of Hellas, seeing that I am a Hellene
      myself by original descent and I should not wish to see Hellas enslaved
      instead of free. I say then that Mardonios and his army cannot get the
      offerings to be according to their mind, <a href="#link9note-50" id="link9noteref-50" class="pginternal">50</a> for otherwise ye would
      long ago have fought. Now however he has resolved to let the offerings
      alone and to bring on a battle at dawn of day; for, as I conjecture, he
      fears lest ye should assemble in greater numbers. Therefore prepare
      yourselves; and if after all Mardonios should put off the battle and not
      bring it on, stay where ye are and hold out patiently; for they have
      provisions only for a few days remaining. And if this way shall have its
      issue according to your mind, then each one of you ought to remember me
      also concerning liberation, <a href="#link9note-51" id="link9noteref-51" class="pginternal">51</a> since I have done for the sake of the Hellenes
      so hazardous a deed by reason of my zeal for you, desiring to show you the
      design of Mardonios, in order that the Barbarians may not fall upon you
      when ye are not as yet expecting them: and I am Alexander the Macedonian."
      Thus having spoken he rode away back to the camp and to his own position.
    </p>
<p>
      46. Then the generals of the Athenians came to the right wing and told
      Pausanias that which they had heard from Alexander. Upon this saying he
      being struck with fear of the Persians spoke as follows: "Since then at
      dawn the battle comes on, it is right that ye, Athenians, should take your
      stand opposite to the Persians, and we opposite to the Boeotians and those
      Hellenes who are now posted against you; and for this reason, namely
      because ye are acquainted with the Medes and with their manner of
      fighting, having fought with them at Marathon, whereas we have had no
      experience of these men and are without knowledge of them; for not one of
      the Spartans has made trial of the Medes in fight, but of the Boeotians
      and Thessalians we have had experience. It is right therefore that ye
      should take up your arms and come to this wing of the army, and that we
      should go to the left wing." In answer to this the Athenians spoke as
      follows: "To ourselves also long ago at the very first, when we saw that
      the Persians were being ranged opposite to you, it occurred to us to say
      these very things, which ye now bring forward before we have uttered them;
      but we feared lest these words might not be pleasing to you. Since however
      ye yourselves have made mention of this, know that your words have caused
      us pleasure, and that we are ready to do this which ye say.".
    </p>
<p>
      47. Both then were content to do this, and as dawn appeared they began to
      change their positions with one another: and the Boeotians perceiving that
      which was being done reported it to Mardonios, who, when he heard it,
      forthwith himself also endeavoured to change positions, bringing the
      Persians along so as to be against the Lacedemonians: and when Pausanias
      learnt that this was being done, he perceived that he was not unobserved,
      and he led the Spartans back again to the right wing; and just so also did
      Mardonios upon his left.
    </p>
<p>
      48. When they had been thus brought to their former positions, Mardonios
      sent a herald to the Spartans and said as follows: "Lacedemonians, ye are
      said forsooth by those who are here to be very good men, and they have
      admiration for you because ye do not flee in war nor leave your post, but
      stay there and either destroy your enemies or perish yourselves. In this
      however, as it now appears, there is no truth; for before we engaged
      battle and came to hand-to-hand conflict we saw you already flee and leave
      your station, desiring to make the trial with the Athenians first, while
      ye ranged yourselves opposite to our slaves. These are not at all the
      deeds of good men in war, but we were deceived in you very greatly; for we
      expected by reason of your renown that ye would send a herald to us,
      challenging us and desiring to fight with the Persians alone; but though
      we on our part were ready to do this, we did not find that ye said
      anything of this kind, but rather that ye cowered with fear. Now therefore
      since ye were not the first to say this, we are the first. Why do we not
      forthwith fight, <a href="#link9note-52" id="link9noteref-52" class="pginternal">52</a> ye on behalf of the Hellenes, since ye have
      the reputation of being the best, and we on behalf of the Barbarians, with
      equal numbers on both sides? and if we think it good that the others
      should fight also, then let them fight afterwards; and if on the other
      hand we should not think it good, but think it sufficient that we alone
      should fight, then let us fight it out to the end, and whichsoever of us
      shall be the victors, let these be counted as victorious with their whole
      army.".
    </p>
<p>
      49. The herald having thus spoken waited for some time, and then, as no
      one made him any answer, he departed and went back; and having returned he
      signified to Mardonios that which had happened to him. Mardonios then
      being greatly rejoiced and elated by his empty <a href="#link9note-53" id="link9noteref-53" class="pginternal">53</a> victory, sent the
      cavalry to attack the Hellenes: and when the horsemen had ridden to attack
      them, they did damage to the whole army of the Hellenes by hurling
      javelins against them and shooting with bows, being mounted archers and
      hard therefore to fight against: and they disturbed and choked up the
      spring Gargaphia, from which the whole army of the Hellenes was drawing
      its water. Now the Lacedemonians alone were posted near this spring, and
      it was at some distance from the rest of the Hellenes, according as they
      chanced to be posted, while the Asopos was near at hand; but when they
      were kept away from the Asopos, then they used to go backwards and
      forwards to this spring; for they were not permitted by the horsemen and
      archers to fetch water from the river..
    </p>
<p>
      50. Such then being the condition of things, the generals of the Hellenes,
      since the army had been cut off from its water and was being harassed by
      the cavalry, assembled to consult about these and other things, coming to
      Pausanias upon the right wing: for other things too troubled them yet more
      than these of which we have spoken, since they no longer had provisions,
      and their attendants who had been sent to Peloponnese for the purpose of
      getting them had been cut off by the cavalry and were not able to reach
      the camp..
    </p>
<p>
      51. It was resolved then by the generals in council with one another, that
      if the Persians put off the battle for that day, they would go to the
      Island. This is distant ten furlongs <a href="#link9note-54" id="link9noteref-54" class="pginternal">54</a> from the Asopos and the
      spring Gargaphia, where they were then encamped, and is in front of the
      city of the Plataians: and if it be asked how there can be an island on
      the mainland, thus it is <a href="#link9note-55" id="link9noteref-55" class="pginternal">55</a>:—the river parts in two above, as it
      flows from Kithairon down to the plain, keeping a distance of about three
      furlongs between its streams, and after that it joins again in one stream;
      and the name of it is Oëroe, said by the natives of the country to be the
      daughter of Asopos. To this place of which I speak they determined to
      remove, in order that they might be able to get an abundant supply of
      water and that the cavalry might not do them damage, as now when they were
      right opposite. And they proposed to remove when the second watch of the
      night should have come, so that the Persians might not see them set forth
      and harass them with the cavalry pursuing. They proposed also, after they
      had arrived at this place, round which, as I say, Oëroe the daughter of
      Asopos flows, parting into two streams <a href="#link9note-56" id="link9noteref-56" class="pginternal">56</a> as she runs from
      Kithairon, to send half the army to Kithairon during this same night, in
      order to take up their attendants who had gone to get the supplies of
      provisions; for these were cut off from them in Kithairon.
    </p>
<p>
      52. Having thus resolved, during the whole of that day they had trouble
      unceasingly, while the cavalry pressed upon them; but when the day drew to
      a close and the attacks of the cavalry had ceased, then as it was becoming
      night and the time had arrived at which it had been agreed that they
      should retire from their place, the greater number of them set forth and
      began to retire, not however keeping it in mind to go to the place which
      had been agreed upon; but on the contrary, when they had begun to move,
      they readily took occasion to flee <a href="#link9note-57" id="link9noteref-57" class="pginternal">57</a> from the cavalry
      towards the city of the Plataians, and in their flight they came as far as
      the temple of Hera, which temple is in front of the city of the Plataians
      at a distance of twenty furlongs from the spring Gargaphia; and when they
      had there arrived they halted in front of the temple.
    </p>
<p>
      53. These then were encamping about the temple of Hera; and Pausanias,
      seeing that they were retiring from the camp, gave the word to the
      Lacedemonians also to take up their arms and go after the others who were
      preceding them, supposing that these were going to the place to which they
      had agreed to go. Then, when all the other commanders were ready to obey
      Pausanias, Amompharetos the son of Poliades, the commander of the Pitanate
      division, <a href="#link9note-58" id="link9noteref-58" class="pginternal">58</a> said that he would not flee from the
      strangers, nor with his own will would he disgrace Sparta; and he
      expressed wonder at seeing that which was being done, not having been
      present at the former discussion. And Pausanias and Euryanax were greatly
      disturbed that he did not obey them and still more that they should be
      compelled to leave the Pitanate division behind, since he thus refused; <a href="#link9note-59" id="link9noteref-59" class="pginternal">59</a>
      for they feared that if they should leave it in order to do that which
      they had agreed with the other Hellenes, both Amompharetos himself would
      perish being left behind and also the men with him. With this thought they
      kept the Lacedemonian force from moving, and meanwhile they endeavoured to
      persuade him that it was not right for him to do so..
    </p>
<p>
      54. They then were exhorting Amompharetos, who had been left behind alone
      of the Lacedemonians and Tegeans; and meanwhile the Athenians were keeping
      themselves quiet in the place where they had been posted, knowing the
      spirit of the Lacedemonians, that they were apt to say otherwise than they
      really meant; <a href="#link9note-60" id="link9noteref-60" class="pginternal">60</a> and when the army began to move, they sent a
      horseman from their own body to see whether the Spartans were attempting
      to set forth, or whether they had in truth no design at all to retire; and
      they bade him ask Pausanias what they ought to do. 55. So when the herald
      came to the Lacedemonians, he saw that they were still in their place and
      that the chiefs of them had come to strife with one another: for when
      Euryanax and Pausanias both exhorted Amompharetos not to run the risk of
      remaining behind with his men, alone of all the Lacedemonians, they did
      not at all persuade him, and at last they had come to downright strife;
      and meanwhile the herald of the Athenians had arrived and was standing by
      them. And Amompharetos in his contention took a piece of rock in both his
      hands and placed it at the feet of Pausanias, saying that with this pebble
      he gave his vote not to fly from the strangers, meaning the Barbarians. <a href="#link9note-61" id="link9noteref-61" class="pginternal">61</a>
      Pausanias then, calling him a madman and one who was not in his right
      senses, bade tell the state of their affairs to the Athenian herald, <a href="#link9note-62" id="link9noteref-62" class="pginternal">62</a>
      who was asking that which he had been charged to ask; and at the same time
      he requested the Athenians to come towards the Lacedemonians and to do in
      regard to the retreat the same as they did..
    </p>
<p>
      56. He then went away back to the Athenians; and as the dawn of day found
      them yet disputing with one another, Pausanias, who had remained still
      throughout all this time, gave the signal, and led away all the rest over
      the low hills, supposing that Amonpharetos would not stay behind when the
      other Lacedemonians departed (in which he was in fact right); and with
      them also went the Tegeans. Meanwhile the Athenians, following the
      commands which were given them, were going in the direction opposite to
      that of the Lacedemonians; for these were clinging to the hills and the
      lower slope of Kithairon from fear of the cavalry, while the Athenians
      were marching below in the direction of the plain..
    </p>
<p>
      57. As for Amonpharetos, he did not at first believe that Pausanias would
      ever venture to leave him and his men behind, and he stuck to it that they
      should stay there and not leave their post; but when Pausanias and his
      troops were well in front, then he perceived that they had actually left
      him behind, and he made his division take up their arms and led them
      slowly towards the main body. This, when it had got away about ten
      furlongs, stayed for the division of Amompharetos, halting at the river
      Moloeis and the place called Argiopion, where also there stands a temple
      of the Eleusinian Demeter: and it stayed there for this reason, namely in
      order that of Amonpharetos and his division should not leave the place
      where they had been posted, but should remain there, it might be able to
      come back to their assistance. So Amompharetos and his men were coming up
      to join them, and the cavalry also of the Barbarians was at the same time
      beginning to attack them in full force: for the horsemen did on this day
      as they had been wont to do every day; and seeing the place vacant in
      which the Hellenes had been posted on the former days, they rode their
      horses on continually further, and as soon as they came up with them they
      began to attack them.
    </p>
<p>
      58. Then Mardonios, when he was informed that the Hellenes had departed
      during the night, and when he saw their place deserted, called Thorax of
      Larissa and his brothers Eurypylos and Thrasydeios, and said: "Sons of
      Aleuas, will ye yet say anything, <a href="#link9note-63" id="link9noteref-63" class="pginternal">63</a> now that ye see these
      places deserted? For ye who dwell near them were wont to say that the
      Lacedemonians did not fly from a battle, but were men unsurpassed in war;
      and these men ye not only saw before this changing from their post, but
      now we all of us see that they have run away during the past night; and by
      this they showed clearly, when the time came for them to contend in battle
      with those who were in truth the best of all men, that after all they were
      men of no worth, who had been making a display of valour among Hellenes, a
      worthless race. As for you, since ye had had no experience of the
      Persians, I for my part was very ready to excuse you when ye praised
      these, of whom after all ye knew something good; but much more I marvelled
      at Artabazos that <i>he</i> should have been afraid of the Lacedemonians,
      and that having been afraid he should have uttered that most cowardly
      opinion, namely that we ought to move our army away and go to the city of
      the Thebans to be besieged there,—an opinion about which the king
      shall yet be informed by me. Of these things we will speak in another
      place; now however we must not allow them to act thus, but we must pursue
      them until they are caught and pay the penalty to us for all that they did
      to the Persians in time past.".
    </p>
<p>
      59. Thus having spoken he led on the Persians at a run, after they had
      crossed the Asopos, on the track of the Hellenes, supposing that these
      were running away from him; and he directed his attack upon the
      Lacedemonians and Tegeans only, for the Athenians, whose march was towards
      the plain, he did not see by reason of the hills. Then the rest of the
      commanders of the Barbarian divisions, seeing that the Persians had
      started to pursue the Hellenes, forthwith all raised the signals for
      battle and began to pursue, each as fast as they could, not arranged in
      any order or succession of post..
    </p>
<p>
      60. These then were coming on with shouting and confused numbers, thinking
      to make short work of <a href="#link9note-64" id="link9noteref-64" class="pginternal">64</a> the Hellenes; and Pausanias, when the cavalry
      began to attack, sent to the Athenians a horseman and said thus:
      "Athenians, now that the greatest contest is set before us, namely that
      which has for its issue the freedom or the slavery of Hellas, we have been
      deserted by our allies, we Lacedemonians and ye Athenians, seeing that
      they have run away during the night that is past. Now therefore it is
      determined what we must do upon this, namely that we must defend ourselves
      and protect one another as best we may. If then the cavalry had set forth
      to attack you at the first, we and the Tegeans, who with us refuse to
      betray the cause of Hellas, should have been bound to go to your help; but
      as it is, since the whole body has come against us, it is right that ye
      should come to that portion of the army which is hardest pressed, to give
      aid. If however anything has happened to you which makes it impossible for
      you to come to our help, then do us a kindness by sending to us the
      archers; and we know that ye have been in the course of this present war
      by far the most zealous of all, so that ye will listen to our request in
      this matter also.".
    </p>
<p>
      61. When the Athenians heard this they were desirous to come to their help
      and to assist them as much as possible; and as they were already going,
      they were attacked by those of the Hellenes on the side of the king who
      had been ranged opposite to them, so that they were no longer able to come
      to the help of the Lacedemonians, for the force that was attacking them
      gave them much trouble. Thus the Lacedemonians and Tegeans were left
      alone, being in number, together with light-armed men, the former fifty
      thousand and the Tegeans three thousand; for these were not parted at all
      from the Lacedemonians: and they began to offer sacrifice, meaning to
      engage battle with Mardonios and the force which had come against them.
      Then since their offerings did not prove favourable, and many of them were
      being slain during this time and many more wounded,—for the Persians
      had made a palisade of their wicker-work shields <a href="#link9note-65" id="link9noteref-65" class="pginternal">65</a> and were discharging
      their arrows in great multitude and without sparing,—Pausanias,
      seeing that the Spartans were hard pressed and that the offerings did not
      prove favourable, fixed his gaze upon the temple of Hera of the Plataians
      and called upon the goddess to help, praying that they might by no means
      be cheated of their hope:.
    </p>
<p>
      62, and while he was yet calling upon her thus, the Tegeans started
      forward before them and advanced against the Barbarians, and forthwith
      after the prayer of Pausanias the offerings proved favourable for the
      Lacedemonians as they sacrificed. So when this at length came to pass,
      then they also advanced against the Persians; and the Persians put away
      their bows and came against them. Then first there was fighting about the
      wicker-work shields, and when these had been overturned, after that the
      fighting was fierce by the side of the temple of Demeter, and so continued
      for a long time, until at last they came to justling; for the Barbarians
      would take hold of the spears and break them off. Now in courage and in
      strength the Persians were not inferior to the others, but they were
      without defensive armour, <a href="#link9note-66" id="link9noteref-66" class="pginternal">66</a> and moreover they were unversed in war and
      unequal to their opponents in skill; and they would dart out one at a time
      or in groups of about ten together, some more and some less, and fall upon
      the Spartans and perish..
    </p>
<p>
      63. In the place where Mardonios himself was, riding on a white horse and
      having about him the thousand best men of the Persians chosen out from the
      rest, here, I say, they pressed upon their opponents most of all: and so
      long as Mardonios survived, they held out against them, and defending
      themselves they cast down many of the Lacedemonians; but when Mardonios
      was slain and the men who were ranged about his person, which was the
      strongest portion of the whole army, had fallen, then the others too
      turned and gave way before the Lacedemonians; for their manner of dress,
      without defensive armour, was a very great cause of destruction to them,
      since in truth they were contending light-armed against hoplites..
    </p>
<p>
      64. Then the satisfaction for the murder of Leonidas was paid by Mardonios
      according to the oracle given to the Spartans, <a href="#link9note-67" id="link9noteref-67" class="pginternal">67</a> and the most famous
      victory of all those about which we have knowledge was gained by Pausanias
      the son of Cleombrotos, the son of Anaxandrides; of his ancestors above
      this the names have been given for Leonidas, <a href="#link9note-68" id="link9noteref-68" class="pginternal">68</a> since, as it happens,
      they are the same for both. Now Mardonios was slain by Arimnestos, <a href="#link9note-69" id="link9noteref-69" class="pginternal">69</a> a
      man of consideration in Sparta, who afterwards, when the Median wars were
      over, with three hundred men fought a battle against the whole army of the
      Messenians, then at war with the Lacedemonians, at Stenycleros, and both
      he was slain and also the three hundred..
    </p>
<p>
      65. When the Persians were turned to flight at Plataia by the
      Lacedemonians, they fled in disorder to their own camp and to the palisade
      which they had made in the Theban territory: <a href="#link9note-70" id="link9noteref-70" class="pginternal">70</a> and it is a marvel to
      me that, whereas they fought by the side of the sacred grove of Demeter,
      not one of the Persians was found to have entered the enclosure or to have
      been slain within it, but round about the temple in the unconsecrated
      ground fell the greater number of the slain. I suppose (if one ought to
      suppose anything about divine things) that the goddess herself refused to
      receive them, because they had set fire to the temple, that is to say the
      "palace" <a href="#link9note-71" id="link9noteref-71" class="pginternal">71</a> at Eleusis.
    </p>
<p>
      66. Thus far then had this battle proceeded: but Artabazos the son of
      Pharnakes had been displeased at the very first because Mardonios remained
      behind after the king was gone; and afterwards he had been bringing
      forward objections continually and doing nothing, but had urged them
      always not to fight a battle: and for himself he acted as follows, not
      being pleased with the things which were being done by Mardonios.—The
      men of whom Artabazos was commander (and he had with him no small force
      but one which was in number as much as four myriads <a href="#link9note-72" id="link9noteref-72" class="pginternal">72</a> of men), these, when
      the fighting began, being well aware what the issue of the battle would
      be, he led carefully, <a href="#link9note-73" id="link9noteref-73" class="pginternal">73</a> having first given orders that all should go
      by the way which he should lead them and at the same pace at which they
      should see him go. Having given these orders he led his troops on pretence
      of taking them into battle; and when he was well on his way, he saw the
      Persians already taking flight. Then he no longer led his men in the same
      order as before, but set off at a run, taking flight by the quickest way
      not to the palisade nor yet to the wall of the Thebans, but towards
      Phokis, desiring as quickly as possible to reach the Hellespont..
    </p>
<p>
      67. These, I say, were thus directing their march: and in the meantime,
      while the other Hellenes who were on the side of the king were purposely
      slack in the fight, <a href="#link9note-74" id="link9noteref-74" class="pginternal">74</a> the Boeotians fought with the Athenians for a
      long space; for those of the Thebans who took the side of the Medes had no
      small zeal for the cause, and they fought and were not slack, so that
      three hundred of them, the first and best of all, fell there by the hands
      of the Athenians: and when these also turned to flight, they fled to
      Thebes, not to the same place as the Persians: and the main body of the
      other allies fled without having fought constantly with any one or
      displayed any deeds of valour..
    </p>
<p>
      68. And this is an additional proof to me that all the fortunes of the
      Barbarians depended upon the Persians, namely that at that time these men
      fled before they had even engaged with the enemy, because they saw the
      Persians doing so. Thus all were in flight except only the cavalry,
      including also that of the Boeotians; and this rendered service to the
      fugitives by constantly keeping close to the enemy and separating the
      fugitives of their own side from the Hellenes..
    </p>
<p>
      69. The victors then were coming after the troops of Xerxes, both pursuing
      them and slaughtering them; and during the time when this panic arose, the
      report was brought to the other Hellenes who had posted themselves about
      the temple of Hera and had been absent from the battle, that a battle had
      taken place and that the troops of Pausanias were gaining the victory.
      When they heard this, then without ranging themselves in any order the
      Corinthians and those near them turned to go by the skirts of the mountain
      and by the low hills along the way which led straight up to the temple of
      Demeter, while the Megarians and Phliasians and those near them went by
      the plain along the smoothest way. When however the Megarians and
      Phliasians came near to the enemy, the cavalry of the Thebans caught sight
      of them from a distance hurrying along without any order, and rode up to
      attack them, the commander of the cavalry being Asopodoros the son of
      Timander; and having fallen upon them they slew six hundred of them, and
      the rest they pursued and drove to Kithairon.
    </p>
<p>
      70. These then perished thus ingloriously; <a href="#link9note-75" id="link9noteref-75" class="pginternal">75</a> and meanwhile the
      Persians and the rest of the throng, having fled for refuge to the
      palisade, succeeded in getting up to the towers before the Lacedemonians
      came; and having got up they strengthened the wall of defence as best they
      could. Then when the Lacedemonians <a href="#link9note-76" id="link9noteref-76" class="pginternal">76</a> came up to attack it,
      there began between them a vigorous <a href="#link9note-77" id="link9noteref-77" class="pginternal">77</a> fight for the wall: for
      so long as the Athenians were away, they defended themselves and had much
      the advantage over the Lacedemonians, since these did not understand the
      art of fighting against walls; but when the Athenians came up to help
      them, then there was a fierce fight for the wall, lasting for a long time,
      and at length by valour and endurance the Athenians mounted up on the wall
      and made a breach in it, through which the Hellenes poured in. Now the
      Tegeans were the first who entered the wall, and these were they who
      plundered the tent of Mardonios, taking, besides the other things which
      were in it, also the manger of his horse, which was all of bronze and a
      sight worth seeing. This manger of Mardonios was dedicated by the Tegeans
      as an offering in the temple of Athene Alea, <a href="#link9note-78" id="link9noteref-78" class="pginternal">78</a> but all the other
      things which they took, they brought to the common stock of the Hellenes.
      The Barbarians however, after the wall had been captured, no longer formed
      themselves into any close body, nor did any of them think of making
      resistance, but they were utterly at a loss, <a href="#link9note-79" id="link9noteref-79" class="pginternal">79</a> as you might expect
      from men who were in a panic with many myriads of them shut up together in
      a small space: and the Hellenes were able to slaughter them so that out of
      an army of thirty myriads, <a href="#link9note-80" id="link9noteref-80" class="pginternal">80</a> if those four be subtracted which Artabazos
      took with him in his flight, of the remainder not three thousand men
      survived. Of the Lacedemonians from Sparta there were slain in the battle
      ninety-one in all, of the Tegeans sixteen, and of the Athenians
      two-and-fifty.
    </p>
<p>
      71. Among the Barbarians those who proved themselves the best men were, of
      those on foot the Persians, and of the cavalry the Sacans, and for a
      single man Mardonios it is said was the best. Of the Hellenes, though both
      the Tegeans and the Athenians proved themselves good men, yet the
      Lacedemonians surpassed them in valour. Of this I have no other proof (for
      all these were victorious over their opposites), but only this, that they
      fought against the strongest part of the enemy's force and overcame it.
      And the man who proved himself in my opinion by much the best was that
      Aristodemos who, having come back safe from Thermopylai alone of the three
      hundred, had reproach and dishonour attached to him. After him the best
      were Poseidonios and Philokyon and Amompharetos the Spartan. <a href="#link9note-81" id="link9noteref-81" class="pginternal">81</a>
      However, when there came to be conversation as to which of them had proved
      himself the best, the Spartans who were present gave it as their opinion
      that Aristodemos had evidently wished to be slain in consequence of the
      charge which lay against him, and so, being as it were in a frenzy and
      leaving his place in the ranks, he had displayed great deeds, whereas
      Poseidonios had proved himself a good man although he did not desire to be
      slain; and so far he was the better man of the two. This however they
      perhaps said from ill-will; and all these whose names I mentioned among
      the men who were killed in this battle, were specially honoured, except
      Aristodemos; but Aristodemos, since he desired to be slain on account of
      the before-mentioned charge, was not honoured.
    </p>
<p>
      72. These obtained the most renown of those who fought at Plataia, for as
      for Callicrates, the most beautiful who came to the camp, not of the
      Lacedemonians alone, but also of all the Hellenes of his time, he was not
      killed in the battle itself; but when Pausanias was offering sacrifice, he
      was wounded by an arrow in the side, as he was sitting down in his place
      in the ranks; and while the others were fighting, he having been carried
      out of the ranks was dying a lingering death: and he said to Arimnestos <a href="#link9note-82" id="link9noteref-82" class="pginternal">82</a> a
      Plataian that it did not grieve him to die for Hellas, but it grieved him
      only that he had not proved his strength of hand, and that no deed of
      valour had been displayed by him worthy of the spirit which he had in him
      to perform great deeds. <a href="#link9note-83" id="link9noteref-83" class="pginternal">83</a>
</p>
<p>
      73. Of the Athenians the man who gained most glory is said to have been
      Sophanes the son of Eutychides of the deme of Dekeleia,—a deme of
      which the inhabitants formerly did a deed that was of service to them for
      all time, as the Athenians themselves report. For when of old the sons of
      Tyndareus invaded the Attic land with a great host, in order to bring home
      Helen, and were laying waste the demes, not knowing to what place of
      hiding Helen had been removed, then they say that the men of Dekeleia, or
      as some say Dekelos himself, being aggrieved by the insolence of Theseus
      and fearing for all the land of the Athenians, told them the whole matter
      and led them to Aphidnai, which Titakos who was sprung from the soil
      delivered up by treachery to the sons of Tyndareus. In consequence of this
      deed the Dekeleians have had continually freedom from dues in Sparta and
      front seats at the games, <a href="#link9note-84" id="link9noteref-84" class="pginternal">84</a> privileges which exist still to this day;
      insomuch that even in the war which many years after these events arose
      between the Athenians and the Peloponnesians, when the Lacedemonians laid
      waste all the rest of Attica, they abstained from injury to Dekeleia..
    </p>
<p>
      74. To this deme belonged Sophanes, who showed himself the best of all the
      Athenians in this battle; and of him there are two different stories told:
      one that he carried an anchor of iron bound by chains of bronze to the
      belt of his corslet; and this he threw whensoever he came up with the
      enemy, in order, they say, that the enemy when they came forth out of
      their ranks might not be able to move him from his place; and when a
      flight of his opponents took place, his plan was to take up the anchor
      first and then pursue after them. This story is reported thus; but the
      other of the stories, disputing the truth of that which has been told
      above, is reported as follows, namely that upon his shield, which was ever
      moving about and never remaining still, he bore an anchor as a device, and
      not one of iron bound to his corslet.
    </p>
<p>
      75. There was another illustrious deed done too by Sophanes; for when the
      Athenians besieged Egina he challenged to a fight and slew Eurybates the
      Argive, <a href="#link9note-85" id="link9noteref-85" class="pginternal">85</a>
      one who had been victor in the five contests <a href="#link9note-86" id="link9noteref-86" class="pginternal">86</a> at the games. To
      Sophanes himself it happened after these events that when he was general
      of the Athenians together with Leagros the son of Glaucon, he was slain
      after proving himself a good man by the Edonians at Daton, fighting for
      the gold mines.
    </p>
<p>
      76. When the Barbarians had been laid low by the Hellenes at Plataia,
      there approached to these a woman, the concubine of Pharandates the son of
      Teaspis a Persian, coming over of her own free will from the enemy, who
      when she perceived that the Persians had been destroyed and that the
      Hellenes were the victors, descended from her carriage and came up to the
      Lacedemonians while they were yet engaged in the slaughter. This woman had
      adorned herself with many ornaments of gold, and her attendants likewise,
      and she had put on the fairest robe of those which she had; and when she
      saw that Pausanias was directing everything there, being well acquainted
      before with his name and with his lineage, because she had heard it often,
      she recognised Pausanias and taking hold of his knees she said these
      words: "O king of Sparta, deliver me thy suppliant from the slavery of the
      captive: for thou hast also done me service hitherto in destroying these,
      who have regard neither for demigods nor yet for gods. <a href="#link9note-87" id="link9noteref-87" class="pginternal">87</a> I
      am by race of Cos, the daughter of Hegetorides the son of Antagoras; and
      the Persian took me by force in Cos and kept me a prisoner." He made
      answer in these words: "Woman, be of good courage, both because thou art a
      suppliant, and also if in addition to this it chances that thou art
      speaking the truth and art the daughter of Hegetorides the Coan, who is
      bound to me as a guest-friend more than any other of the men who dwell in
      those parts." Having thus spoken, for that time her gave her in charge to
      those Ephors who were present, and afterwards he sent her away to Egina,
      whither she herself desired to go.
    </p>
<p>
      77. After the arrival of the woman, forthwith upon this arrived the
      Mantineians, when all was over; and having learnt that they had come too
      late for the battle, they were greatly grieved, and said that they
      deserved to be punished: and being informed that the Medes with Artabazos
      were in flight, they pursued after them as far as Thessaly, though the
      Lacedemonians endeavoured to prevent them from pursuing after fugitives.
      <a href="#link9note-88" id="link9noteref-88" class="pginternal">88</a>
      Then returning back to their own country they sent the leaders of their
      army into exile from the land. After the Mantineians came the Eleians; and
      they, like the Mantineians, were greatly grieved by it and so departed
      home; and these also when they had returned sent their leaders into exile.
      So much of the Mantineians and Eleians.
    </p>
<p>
      78. At Plataia among the troops of the Eginetans was Lampon the son of
      Pytheas, one of the leading men of the Eginetans, who was moved to go to
      Pausanias with a most impious proposal, and when he had come with haste,
      he said as follows: "Son of Cleombrotos, a deed has been done by thee
      which is of marvellous greatness and glory, and to thee God has permitted
      by rescuing Hellas to lay up for thyself the greatest renown of all the
      Hellenes about whom we have any knowledge. Do thou then perform also that
      which remains to do after these things, in order that yet greater
      reputation may attach to thee, and also that in future every one of the
      Barbarians may beware of being the beginner of presumptuous deeds towards
      the Hellenes. For when Leonidas was slain at Thermopylai, Mardonios and
      Xerxes cut off his head and crucified him: to him therefore do thou repay
      like with like, and thou shalt have praise first from all the Spartans and
      then secondly from the other Hellenes also; for if thou impale the body of
      Mardonios, thou wilt then have taken vengeance for Leonidas thy father's
      brother.".
    </p>
<p>
      79. He said this thinking to give pleasure; but the other made him answer
      in these words: "Stranger of Egina, I admire thy friendly spirit and thy
      forethought for me, but thou hast failed of a good opinion nevertheless:
      for having exalted me on high and my family and my deed, thou didst then
      cast me down to nought by advising me to do outrage to a dead body, and by
      saying that if I do this I shall be better reported of. These things it is
      more fitting for Barbarians to do than for Hellenes; and even with them we
      find fault for doing so. However that may be, I do not desire in any such
      manner as this to please either Eginetans or others who like such things;
      but it is enough for me that I should keep from unholy deeds, yea and from
      unholy speech also, and so please the Spartans. As for Leonidas, whom thou
      biddest me avenge, I declare that he has been greatly avenged already, and
      by the unnumbered lives which have been taken of these men he has been
      honoured, and not he only but also the rest who brought their lives to an
      end at Thermopylai. As for thee however, come not again to me with such a
      proposal, nor give me such advice; and be thankful moreover that thou hast
      no punishment for it now."
    </p>
<p>
      80. He having heard this went his way; and Pausanias made a proclamation
      that none should lay hands upon the spoil, and he ordered the Helots to
      collect the things together. They accordingly dispersed themselves about
      the camp and found tents furnished with gold and silver, and beds overlaid
      with gold and overlaid with silver, and mixing-bowls of gold, and cups and
      other drinking vessels. They found also sacks laid upon waggons, in which
      there proved to be caldrons both of gold and of silver; and from the dead
      bodies which lay there they stripped bracelets and collars, and also their
      swords <a href="#link9note-89" id="link9noteref-89" class="pginternal">89</a>
      if they were of gold, for as to embroidered raiment, there was no account
      made of it. Then the Helots stole many of the things and sold them to the
      Eginetans, but many things also they delivered up, as many of them as they
      could not conceal; so that the great wealth of the Eginetans first came
      from this, that they bought the gold from the Helots making pretence that
      it was brass..
    </p>
<p>
      81. Then having brought the things together, and having set apart a tithe
      for the god of Delphi, with which the offering was dedicated of the golden
      tripod which rests upon the three-headed serpent of bronze and stands
      close by the altar, and also <a href="#link9note-90" id="link9noteref-90" class="pginternal">90</a> for the god at Olympia, with which they
      dedicated the offering of a bronze statue of Zeus ten cubits high, and
      finally for the god at the Isthmus, with which was made a bronze statue of
      Poseidon seven cubits high,—having set apart these things, they
      divided the rest, and each took that which they ought to have, including
      the concubines of the Persians and the gold and the silver and the other
      things, and also the beasts of burden. How much was set apart and given to
      those of them who had proved themselves the best men at Plataia is not
      reported by any, though for my part I suppose that gifts were made to
      these also; Pausanias however had ten of each thing set apart and given to
      him, that is women, horses, talents, camels, and so also of the other
      things.
    </p>
<p>
      82. It is said moreover that this was done which here follows, namely that
      Xerxes in his flight from Hellas had left to Mardonios the furniture of
      his own tent, and Pausanias accordingly seeing the furniture of Mardonios
      furnished <a href="#link9note-91" id="link9noteref-91" class="pginternal">91</a> with gold and silver and hangings of different
      colours ordered the bakers and the cooks to prepare a meal as they were
      used to do for Mardonios. Then when they did this as they had been
      commanded, it is said that Pausanias seeing the couches of gold and of
      silver with luxurious coverings, and the tables of gold and silver, and
      the magnificent apparatus of the feast, was astonished at the good things
      set before him, and for sport he ordered his own servants to prepare a
      Laconian meal; and as, when the banquet was served, the difference between
      the two was great, Pausanias laughed and sent for the commanders of the
      Hellenes; and when these had come together, Pausanias said, pointing to
      the preparation of the two meals severally: "Hellenes, for this reason I
      assembled you together, because I desired to show you the senselessness of
      this leader of the Medes, who having such fare as this, came to us who
      have such sorry fare as ye see here, in order to take it away from us."
      Thus it is said that Pausanias spoke to the commanders of the Hellenes.
    </p>
<p>
      83. However, <a href="#link9note-92" id="link9noteref-92" class="pginternal">92</a> in later time after these events many of the
      Plataians also found chests of gold and of silver and of other treasures;
      and moreover afterwards this which follows was seen in the case of the
      dead bodies here, after the flesh had been stripped off from the bones;
      for the Plataians brought together the bones all to one place:—there
      was found, I say, a skull with no suture but all of one bone, and there
      was seen also a jaw-bone, that is to say the upper part of the jaw, which
      had teeth joined together and all of one bone, both the teeth that bite
      and those that grind; and the bones were seen also of a man five cubits
      high..
    </p>
<p>
      84. The body of Mardonios however had disappeared <a href="#link9note-93" id="link9noteref-93" class="pginternal">93</a> on the day after the
      battle, taken by whom I am not able with certainty to say, but I have
      heard the names of many men of various cities who are said to have buried
      Mardonios, and I know that many received gifts from Artontes the son of
      Mardonios for having done this: who he was however who took up and buried
      the body of Mardonios I am not able for certain to discover, but
      Dionysophanes an Ephesian is reported with some show of reason to have
      been he who buried Mardonios..
    </p>
<p>
      85. He then was buried in some such manner as this: and the Hellenes when
      they had divided the spoil at Plataia proceeded to bury their dead, each
      nation apart by themselves. The Spartans made for themselves three several
      burial-places, one in which they buried the younger Spartans, <a href="#link9note-94" id="link9noteref-94" class="pginternal">94</a> of
      whom also were Poseidonios, Amompharetos, Philokyon and Callicrates,—in
      one of the graves, I say, were laid the younger men, in the second the
      rest of the Spartans, and in the third the Helots. These then thus buried
      their dead; but the Tegeans buried theirs all together in a place apart
      from these, and the Athenians theirs together; and the Megarians and
      Phliasians those who had been slain by the cavalry. Of all these the
      burial-places had bodies laid in them, but as to the burial-places of
      other States which are to be seen at Plataia, these, as I am informed, are
      all mere mounds of earth without any bodies in them, raised by the several
      peoples on account of posterity, because they were ashamed of their
      absence from the fight; for among others there is one there called the
      burial-place of the Eginetans, which I hear was raised at the request of
      the Eginetans by Cleades the son of Autodicos, a man of Plataia who was
      their public guest-friend, <a href="#link9note-95" id="link9noteref-95" class="pginternal">95</a> no less than ten years after these events.
    </p>
<p>
      86. When the Hellenes had buried their dead at Plataia, forthwith they
      determined in common council to march upon Thebes and to ask the Thebans
      to surrender those who had taken the side of the Medes, and among the
      first of them Timagenides and Attaginos, who were leaders equal to the
      first; and if the Thebans did not give them up, they determined not to
      retire from the city until they had taken it. Having thus resolved, they
      came accordingly on the eleventh day after the battle and began to besiege
      the Thebans, bidding them give the men up: and as the Thebans refused to
      give them up, they began to lay waste their land and also to attack their
      wall..
    </p>
<p>
      87. So then, as they did not cease their ravages, on the twentieth day
      Timagenides spoke as follows to the Thebans: "Thebans, since it has been
      resolved by the Hellenes not to retire from the siege until either they
      have taken Thebes or ye have delivered us up to them, now therefore let
      not the land of Boeotia suffer <a href="#link9note-96" id="link9noteref-96" class="pginternal">96</a> any more for our sakes,
      but if they desire to have money and are demanding our surrender as a
      colour for this, let us give them money taken out of the treasury of the
      State; for we took the side of the Medes together with the State and not
      by ourselves alone: but if they are making the siege truly in order to get
      us into their hands, then we will give ourselves up for trial." <a href="#link9note-97" id="link9noteref-97" class="pginternal">97</a> In
      this it was thought that he spoke very well and seasonably, and the
      Thebans forthwith sent a herald to Pausanias offering to deliver up the
      men..
    </p>
<p>
      88. After they had made an agreement on these terms, Attaginos escaped out
      of the city; and when his sons were delivered up to Pausanias, he released
      them from the charge, saying that the sons had no share in the guilt of
      taking the side of the Medes. As to the other men whom the Thebans
      delivered up, they supposed that they would get a trial, <a href="#link9note-98" id="link9noteref-98" class="pginternal">98</a>
      and they trusted moreover to be able to repel the danger by payment of
      money; but Pausanias, when he had received them, suspecting this very
      thing, first dismissed the whole army of allies, and then took the men to
      Corinth and put them to death there. These were the things which happened
      at Plataia and at Thebes.
    </p>
<p>
      89. Artabazos meanwhile, the son of Pharnakes, in his flight from Plataia
      was by this time getting forward on his way: and the Thessalians, when he
      came to them, offered him hospitality and inquired concerning the rest of
      the army, not knowing anything of that which had happened at Plataia; and
      Artabazos knowing that if he should tell them the whole truth about the
      fighting, he would run the risk of being destroyed, both himself and the
      whole army which was with him, (for he thought that they would all set
      upon him if they were informed of that which had happened),—reflecting,
      I say, upon this he had told nothing of it to the Phokians, and now to the
      Thessalians he spoke as follows: "I, as you see, Thessalians, am earnest
      to march by the shortest way to Thracia; and I am in great haste, having
      been sent with these men for a certain business from the army; moreover
      Mardonios himself and his army are shortly to be looked for here, marching
      close after me. To him give entertainment and show yourselves serviceable,
      for ye will not in the end repent of so doing." Having thus said he
      continued to march his army with haste through Thessaly and Macedonia
      straight for Thracia, being in truth earnest to proceed and going through
      the land by the shortest possible way: <a href="#link9note-99" id="link9noteref-99" class="pginternal">99</a> and so he came to
      Byzantion, having left behind him great numbers of his army, who had
      either been cut down by the Thracians on the way or had been overcome by
      hunger and fatigue; <a href="#link9note-100" id="link9noteref-100" class="pginternal">100</a> and from Byzantion he passed over in ships.
      He himself <a href="#link9note-101" id="link9noteref-101" class="pginternal">101</a> then thus made his return back to Asia.
    </p>
<p>
      90. Now on the same day on which the defeat took place at Plataia, another
      took place also, as fortune would have it, at Mycale in Ionia. For when
      the Hellenes who had come in the ships with Leotychides the Lacedemonian,
      were lying at Delos, there came to them as envoys from Samos Lampon the
      son of Thrasycles and Athenagoras the son of Archestratides and
      Hegesistratos the son of Aristagoras, who had been sent by the people of
      Samos without the knowledge either of the Persians or of the despot
      Theomestor the son of Androdamas, whom the Persians had set up to be
      despot of Samos. When these had been introduced before the commanders,
      Hegesistratos spoke at great length using arguments of all kinds, and
      saying that so soon as the Ionians should see them they would at once
      revolt from the Persians, and that the Barbarians would not wait for their
      attack; and if after all they did so, then the Hellenes would take a prize
      such as they would never take again hereafter; and appealing to the gods
      worshipped in common he endeavoured to persuade them to rescue from
      slavery men who were Hellenes and to drive away the Barbarian: and this he
      said was easy for them to do, for the ships of the enemy sailed badly and
      were no match for them in fight. Moreover if the Hellenes suspected that
      they were endeavouring to bring them on by fraud, they were ready to be
      taken as hostages in their ships..
    </p>
<p>
      91. Then as the stranger of Samos was urgent in his prayer, Leotychides
      inquired thus, either desiring to hear for the sake of the omen or perhaps
      by a chance which Providence brought about: "Stranger of Samos, what is
      thy name?" He said "Hegesistratos." <a href="#link9note-102" id="link9noteref-102" class="pginternal">102</a> The other cut short
      the rest of the speech, stopping all that Hegesistratos had intended to
      say further, and said: "I accept the augury given in Hegesistratos,
      stranger of Samos. Do thou on thy part see that thou give us assurance,
      thou and the men who are with thee, that the Samians will without fail be
      our zealous allies, and after that sail away home.".
    </p>
<p>
      92. Thus he spoke and to the words he added the deed; for forthwith the
      Samians gave assurance and made oaths of alliance with the Hellenes, and
      having so done the others sailed away home, but Hegesistratos he bade sail
      with the Hellenes, considering the name to be an augury of good success.
      Then the Hellenes after staying still that day made sacrifices for success
      on the next day, their diviner being Deïphonos the son of Euenios an
      Apolloniate, of that Apollonia which lies in the Ionian gulf. <a href="#link9note-10201" id="link9noteref-10201" class="pginternal">10201</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      93. To this man's father Euenios it happened as follows:—There are
      at this place Apollonia sheep sacred to the Sun, which during the day feed
      by a river <a href="#link9note-103" id="link9noteref-103" class="pginternal">103</a> running from Mount Lacmon through the land
      of Apollonia to the sea by the haven of Oricos; and by night they are
      watched by men chosen for this purpose, who are the most highly considered
      of the citizens for wealth and noble birth, each man having charge of them
      for a year; for the people of Apollonia set great store on these sheep by
      reason of an oracle: and they are folded in a cave at some distance from
      the city. Here at the time of which I speak this man Euenios was keeping
      watch over them, having been chosen for that purpose; and it happened one
      night that he fell asleep during his watch, and wolves came by into the
      cave and killed about sixty of the sheep. When he perceived this, he kept
      it secret and told no one, meaning to buy others and substitute them in
      the place of those that were killed. It was discovered however by the
      people of Apollonia that this had happened; and when they were informed of
      it, they brought him up before a court and condemned him to be deprived of
      his eyesight for having fallen asleep during his watch. But when they had
      blinded Euenios, forthwith after this their flocks ceased to bring forth
      young and their land to bear crops as before. Then prophesyings were
      uttered to them both at Dodona and also at Delphi, when they asked the
      prophets the cause of the evil which they were suffering, and they told
      them <a href="#link9note-104" id="link9noteref-104" class="pginternal">104</a>
      that they had done unjustly in depriving of his sight Euenios the watcher
      of the sacred sheep; for the gods of whom they inquired had themselves
      sent the wolves to attack the sheep; and they would not cease to take
      vengeance for him till the men of Apollonia should have paid to Euenios
      such satisfaction as he himself should choose and deem sufficient; and
      this being fulfilled, the gods would give to Euenios a gift of such a kind
      that many men would think him happy in that he possessed it..
    </p>
<p>
      94. These oracles then were uttered to them, and the people of Apollonia,
      making a secret of it, proposed to certain men of the citizens to manage
      the affair; and they managed it for them thus:—when Euenios was
      sitting on a seat in public, they came and sat by him, and conversed about
      other matters, and at last they came to sympathising with him in his
      misfortune; and thus leading him on they asked what satisfaction he should
      choose, if the people of Apollonia should undertake to give him
      satisfaction for that which they had done. He then, not having heard the
      oracle, made choice and said that if there should be given him the lands
      belonging to certain citizens, naming those whom he knew to possess the
      two best lots of land in Apollonia, and a dwelling-house also with these,
      which he knew to be the best house in the city,—if he became the
      possessor of these, he said, he would have no anger against them for the
      future, and this satisfaction would be sufficient for him if it should be
      given. Then as he was thus speaking, the men who sat by him said
      interrupting him: "Euenios, this satisfaction the Apolloniates pay to thee
      for thy blinding in accordance with the oracles which have been given to
      them." Upon this he was angry, being thus informed of the whole matter and
      considering that he had been deceived; and they bought the property from
      those who possessed it and gave him that which he had chosen. And
      forthwith after this he had a natural gift of divination, <a href="#link9note-105" id="link9noteref-105" class="pginternal">105</a>
      so that he became very famous..
    </p>
<p>
      95. Of this Euenios, I say, Deïphonos was the son, and he was acting as
      diviner for the army, being brought by the Corinthians. I have heard
      however also that Deïphonos wrongly made use of the name of Euenios, and
      undertook work of this kind about Hellas, not being really the son of
      Euenios.
    </p>
<p>
      96. Now when the sacrifices were favourable to the Hellenes, they put
      their ships to sea from Delos to go to Samos; and having arrived off
      Calamisa <a href="#link9note-106" id="link9noteref-106" class="pginternal">106</a> in Samos, they moored their ships there
      opposite the temple of Hera which is at this place, and made preparations
      for a sea-fight; but the Persians, being informed that they were sailing
      thither, put out to sea also and went over to the mainland with their
      remaining ships, (those of the Phenicians having been already sent away to
      sail home): for deliberating of the matter they thought it good not to
      fight a battle by sea, since they did not think that they were a match for
      the enemy. And they sailed away to the mainland in order that they might
      be under the protection of their land-army which was in Mycale, a body
      which had stayed behind the rest of the army by command of Xerxes and was
      keeping watch over Ionia: of this the number was six myriads <a href="#link9note-107" id="link9noteref-107" class="pginternal">107</a>
      and the commander of it was Tigranes, who in beauty and stature excelled
      the other Persians. The commanders of the fleet then had determined to
      take refuge under the protection of this army, and to draw up their ships
      on shore and put an enclosure round as a protection for the ships and a
      refuge for themselves..
    </p>
<p>
      97. Having thus determined they began to put out to sea; and they came
      along by the temple of the "Revered goddesses" <a href="#link9note-10701" id="link9noteref-10701" class="pginternal">10701</a> to the Gaison
      and to Scolopoeis in Mycale, where there is a temple of the Eleusinian
      Demeter, which Philistos the son of Pasicles erected when he had
      accompanied Neileus the son of Codros for the founding of Miletos; and
      there they drew up their ships on shore and put an enclosure round them of
      stones and timber, cutting down fruit-trees for this purpose, and they
      fixed stakes round the enclosure and made their preparations either for
      being besieged or for gaining a victory, for in making their preparations
      they reckoned for both chances.
    </p>
<p>
      98. The Hellenes however, when they were informed that the Barbarians had
      gone away to the mainland, were vexed because they thought that they had
      escaped; and they were in a difficulty what they should do, whether they
      should go back home, or sail down towards the Hellespont. At last they
      resolved to do neither of these two things, but to sail on to the
      mainland. Therefore when they had prepared as for a sea-fight both
      boarding-bridges and all other things that were required, they sailed
      towards Mycale; and when they came near to the camp and no one was seen to
      put out against them, but they perceived ships drawn up within the wall
      and a large land-army ranged along the shore, then first Leotychides,
      sailing along in his ship and coming as near to the shore as he could,
      made proclamation by a herald to the Ionians, saying: "Ionians, those of
      you who chance to be within hearing of me, attend to this which I say: for
      the Persians will not understand anything at all of that which I enjoin to
      you. When we join battle, each one of you must remember first the freedom
      of all, and then the watchword 'Hebe'; and this let him also who has not
      heard know from him who has heard." The design in this act was the same as
      that of Themistocles at Artemision; for it was meant that either the words
      uttered should escape the knowledge of the Barbarians and persuade the
      Ionians, or that they should be reported to the Barbarians and make them
      distrustful of the Hellenes. <a href="#link9note-108" id="link9noteref-108" class="pginternal">108</a>
</p>
<p>
      99. After Leotychides had thus suggested, then next the Hellenes proceeded
      to bring their ships up to land, and they disembarked upon the shore.
      These then were ranging themselves for fight; and the Persians, when they
      saw the Hellenes preparing for battle and also that they had given
      exhortation to the Ionians, in the first place deprived the Samians of
      their arms, suspecting that they were inclined to the side of the
      Hellenes; for when the Athenian prisoners, the men whom the army of Xerxes
      had found left behind in Attica, had come in the ships of the Barbarians,
      the Samians had ransomed these and sent them back to Athens, supplying
      them with means for their journey; and for this reason especially they
      were suspected, since they had ransomed five hundred persons of the
      enemies of Xerxes. Then secondly the Persians appointed the Milesians to
      guard the passes which lead to the summits of Mycale, on the pretext that
      they knew the country best, but their true reason for doing this was that
      they might be out of the camp. Against these of the Ionians, who, as they
      suspected, would make some hostile move <a href="#link9note-109" id="link9noteref-109" class="pginternal">109</a> if they found the
      occasion, the Persians sought to secure themselves in the manner
      mentioned; and they themselves then brought together their wicker-work
      shields to serve them as a fence.
    </p>
<p>
      100. Then when the Hellenes had made all their preparations, they
      proceeded to the attack of the Barbarians; and as they went, a rumour came
      suddenly <a href="#link9note-110" id="link9noteref-110" class="pginternal">110</a> to their whole army, and at the same time a
      herald's staff was found lying upon the beach; and the rumour went through
      their army to this effect, namely that the Hellenes were fighting in
      Boeotia and conquering the army of Mardonios. Now by many signs is the
      divine power seen in earthly things, and by this among others, namely that
      now, when the day of the defeat at Plataia and of that which was about to
      take place at Mycale happened to be the same, a rumour came to the
      Hellenes here, so that the army was encouraged much more and was more
      eagerly desirous to face the danger..
    </p>
<p>
      101. Moreover this other thing by coincidence happened besides, namely
      that there was a sacred enclosure of the Eleusinian Demeter close by the
      side of both the battle-fields; for not only in the Plataian land did the
      fight take place close by the side of the temple of Demeter, as I have
      before said, but also in Mycale it was to be so likewise. And whereas the
      rumour which came to them said that a victory had been already gained by
      the Hellenes with Pausanias, this proved to be a true report; for that
      which was done at Plataia came about while it was yet early morning, but
      the fighting at Mycale took place in the afternoon; and that it happened
      on the same day of the same month as the other became evident to them not
      long afterwards, when they inquired into the matter. Now they had been
      afraid before the rumour arrived, not for themselves so much as for the
      Hellenes generally, lest Hellas should stumble and fall over Mardonios;
      but when this report had come suddenly to them, they advanced on the enemy
      much more vigorously and swiftly than before. The Hellenes then and the
      Barbarians were going with eagerness into the battle, since both the
      islands and the Hellespont were placed before them as prizes of the
      contest.
    </p>
<p>
      102. Now for the Athenians and those who were ranged next to them, to the
      number perhaps of half the whole army, the road lay along the sea-beach
      and over level ground, while the Lacedemonians and those ranged in order
      by these were compelled to go by a ravine and along the mountain side: so
      while the Lacedemonians were yet going round, those upon the other wing
      were already beginning the fight; and as long as the wicker-work shields
      of the Persians still remained upright, they continued to defend
      themselves and had rather the advantage in the fight; but when the troops
      of the Athenians and of those ranged next to them, desiring that the
      achievement should belong to them and not to the Lacedemonians, with
      exhortations to one another set themselves more vigorously to the work,
      then from that time forth the fortune of the fight was changed; for these
      pushed aside the wicker-work shields and fell upon the Persians with a
      rush all in one body, and the Persians sustained their first attack and
      continued to defend themselves for a long time, but at last they fled to
      the wall; and the Athenians, Corinthians, Sikyonians and Troizenians, for
      that was the order in which they were ranged, followed close after them
      and rushed in together with them to the space within the wall: and when
      the wall too had been captured, then the Barbarians no longer betook
      themselves to resistance, but began at once to take flight, excepting only
      the Persians, who formed into small groups and continued to fight with the
      Hellenes as they rushed in within the wall. Of the commanders of the
      Persians two made their escape and two were slain; Artaÿntes and
      Ithamitres commanders of the fleet escaped, while Mardontes and the
      commander of the land-army, Tigranes, were slain..
    </p>
<p>
      103. Now while the Persians were still fighting, the Lacedemonians and
      those with them arrived, and joined in carrying through the rest of the
      work; and of the Hellenes themselves many fell there and especially many
      of the Sikyonians, together with their commander Perilaos. And those of
      the Samians who were serving in the army, being in the camp of the Medes
      and having been deprived of their arms, when they saw that from the very
      first the battle began to be doubtful, <a href="#link9note-111" id="link9noteref-111" class="pginternal">111</a> did as much as they
      could, endeavouring to give assistance to the Hellenes; and the other
      Ionians seeing that the Samians had set the example, themselves also upon
      that made revolt from the Persians and attacked the Barbarians..
    </p>
<p>
      104. The Milesians too had been appointed to watch the passes of the
      Persians <a href="#link9note-112" id="link9noteref-112" class="pginternal">112</a> in order to secure their safety, so that if
      that should after all come upon them which actually came, they might have
      guides and so get safe away to the summits of Mycale,—the Milesians,
      I say, had been appointed to do this, not only for that end but also for
      fear that, if they were present in the camp, they might make some hostile
      move: <a href="#link9note-113" id="link9noteref-113" class="pginternal">113</a> but they did in fact the opposite of that
      which they were appointed to do; for they not only directed them in the
      flight by other than the right paths, by paths indeed which led towards
      the enemy, but also at last they themselves became their worst foes and
      began to slay them. Thus then for the second time Ionia revolted from the
      Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      105. In this battle, of the Hellenes the Athenians were the best men, and
      of the Athenians Hermolycos the son of Euthoinos, a man who had trained
      for the <i>pancration</i>. This Hermolycos after these events, when there
      was war between the Athenians and the Carystians, was killed in battle at
      Kyrnos in the Carystian land near Geraistos, and there was buried. After
      the Athenians the Corinthians, Troizenians and Sikyonians were the best.
    </p>
<p>
      106. When the Hellenes had slain the greater number of the Barbarians,
      some in the battle and others in their flight, they set fire to the ships
      and to the whole of the wall, having first brought out the spoil to the
      sea-shore; and among the rest they found some stores of money. So having
      set fire to the wall and to the ships they sailed away; and when they came
      to Samos, the Hellenes deliberated about removing the inhabitants of
      Ionia, and considered where they ought to settle them in those parts of
      Hellas of which they had command, leaving Ionia to the Barbarians: for it
      was evident to them that it was impossible on the one hand for them to be
      always stationed as guards to protect the Ionians, and on the other hand,
      if they were not stationed to protect them, they had no hope that the
      Ionians would escape with impunity from the Persians. Therefore it seemed
      good to those of the Peloponnesians that were in authority that they
      should remove the inhabitants of the trading ports which belonged to those
      peoples of Hellas who had taken the side of the Medes, and give that land
      to the Ionians to dwell in; but the Athenians did not think it good that
      the inhabitants of Ionia should be removed at all, nor that the
      Peloponnesians should consult about Athenian colonies; and as these
      vehemently resisted the proposal, the Peloponnesians gave way. So the end
      was that they joined as allies to their league the Samians, Chians,
      Lesbians, and the other islanders who chanced to be serving with the
      Hellenes, binding them by assurance and by oaths to remain faithful and
      not withdraw from the league: and having bound these by oaths they sailed
      to break up the bridges, for they supposed they would find them still
      stretched over the straits.
    </p>
<p>
      These then were sailing towards the Hellespont;.
    </p>
<p>
      107, and meanwhile those Barbarians who had escaped and had been driven to
      the heights of Mycale, being not many in number, were making their way to
      Sardis: and as they went by the way, Masistes the son of Dareios, who had
      been present at the disaster which had befallen them, was saying many evil
      things of the commander Artaÿntes, and among other things he said that in
      respect of the generalship which he had shown he was worse than a woman,
      and that he deserved every kind of evil for having brought evil on the
      house of the king. Now with the Persians to be called worse than a woman
      is the greatest possible reproach. So he, after he had been much reviled,
      at length became angry and drew his sword upon Masistes, meaning to kill
      him; and as he was running upon him, Xeinagoras the son of Prexilaos, a
      man of Halicarnassos, perceived it, who was standing just behind
      Artaÿntes; and this man seized him by the middle and lifting him up dashed
      him upon the ground; and meanwhile the spearmen of Masistes came in front
      to protect him. Thus did Xeinagoras, and thus he laid up thanks for
      himself both with Masistes and also with Xerxes for saving the life of his
      brother; and for this deed Xeinagoras became ruler of all Kilikia by the
      gift of the king. Nothing further happened than this as they went on their
      way, but they arrived at Sardis.
    </p>
<p>
      Now at Sardis, as it chanced, king Xerxes had been staying ever since that
      time when he came thither in flight from Athens, after suffering defeat in
      the sea-fight..
    </p>
<p>
      108. At that time, while he was in Sardis, he had a passionate desire, as
      it seems, for the wife of Masistes, who was also there: and as she could
      not be bent to his will by his messages to her, and he did not wish to
      employ force because he had regard for his brother Masistes and the same
      consideration withheld the woman also, for she well knew that force would
      not be used towards her, then Xerxes abstained from all else, and
      endeavoured to bring about the marriage of his own son Dareios with the
      daughter of this woman and of Masistes, supposing that if he should do so
      he would obtain her more easily. Then having made the betrothal and done
      all the customary rites, he went away to Susa; and when he had arrived
      there and had brought the woman into his own house for Dareios, then he
      ceased from attempting the wife of Masistes and changing his inclination
      he conceived a desire for the wife of Dareios, who was daughter of
      Masistes, and obtained her: now the name of this woman was Artaÿnte..

<p>
      109. However as time went on, this became known in the following manner:—Amestris
      the wife of Xerxes had woven a mantle, large and of various work and a
      sight worthy to be seen, and this she gave to Xerxes. He then being
      greatly pleased put it on and went to Artaÿnte; and being greatly pleased
      with her too, he bade her ask what she would to be given to her in return
      for the favours which she had granted to him, for she should obtain, he
      said, whatsoever she asked: and she, since it was destined that she should
      perish miserably with her whole house, said to Xerxes upon this: "Wilt
      thou give me whatsoever I ask thee for?" and he, supposing that she would
      ask anything rather than that which she did, promised this and swore to
      it. Then when he had sworn, she boldly asked for the mantle; and Xerxes
      tried every means of persuasion, not being willing to give it to her, and
      that for no other reason but only because he feared Amestris, lest by her,
      who even before this had some inkling of the truth, he should thus be
      discovered in the act; and he offered her cities and gold in any quantity,
      and an army which no one else should command except herself. Now this of
      an army is a thoroughly Persian gift. Since however he did not persuade
      her, he gave her the mantle; and she being overjoyed by the gift wore it
      and prided herself upon it..
    </p>
<p>
      110. And Amestris was informed that she had it; and having learnt that
      which was being done, she was not angry with the woman, but supposing that
      her mother was the cause and that she was bringing this about, she planned
      destruction for the wife of Masistes. She waited then until her husband
      Xerxes had a royal feast set before him:—this feast is served up
      once in the year on the day on which the king was born, and the name of
      this feast is in Persian <i>tycta</i>, which in the tongue of the Hellenes
      means "complete"; also on this occasion alone the king washes his head, <a href="#link9note-114" id="link9noteref-114" class="pginternal">114</a>
      and he makes gifts then to the Persians:—Amestris, I say, waited for
      this day and then asked of Xerxes that the wife of Masistes might be given
      to her. And he considered it a strange and untoward thing to deliver over
      to her his brother's wife, especially since she was innocent of this
      matter; for he understood why she was making the request..
    </p>
<p>
      111. At last however as she continued to entreat urgently and he was
      compelled by the rule, namely that it is impossible among them that he who
      makes request when a royal feast is laid before the king should fail to
      obtain it, at last very much against his will consented; and in delivering
      her up he bade Amestris do as she desired, and meanwhile he sent for his
      brother and said these words: "Masistes, thou art the son of Dareios and
      my brother, and moreover in addition to this thou art a man of worth. I
      say to thee, live no longer with this wife with whom thou now livest, but
      I give thee instead of her my daughter; with her live as thy wife, but the
      wife whom thou now hast, do not keep; for it does not seem good to me that
      thou shouldest keep her." Masistes then, marvelling at that which was
      spoken, said these words: "Master, how unprofitable a speech is this which
      thou utterest to me, in that thou biddest me send away a wife by whom I
      have sons who are grown up to be young men, and daughters one of whom even
      thou thyself didst take as a wife for thy son, and who is herself, as it
      chances, very much to my mind,—that thou biddest me, I say, send
      away her and take to wife thy daughter! I, O king, think it a very great
      matter that I am judged worthy of thy daughter, but nevertheless I will do
      neither of these things: and do not thou urge me by force to do such a
      thing as this: but for thy daughter another husband will be found not in
      any wise inferior to me, and let me, I pray thee, live still with my own
      wife." He returned answer in some such words as these; and Xerxes being
      stirred with anger said as follows: "This then, Masistes, is thy case,—I
      will not give thee my daughter for thy wife, nor yet shalt thou live any
      longer with that one, in order that thou mayest learn to accept that which
      is offered thee." He then when he heard this went out, having first said
      these words: "Master, thou hast not surely brought ruin upon me?" <a href="#link9note-115" id="link9noteref-115" class="pginternal">115</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      112. During this interval of time, while Xerxes was conversing with his
      brother, Amestris had sent the spearmen of Xerxes to bring the wife of
      Masistes, and she was doing to her shameful outrage; for she cut away her
      breasts and threw them to dogs, and she cut off her nose and ears and lips
      and tongue, and sent her back home thus outraged.
    </p>
<p>
      113. Then Masistes, not yet having heard any of these things, but
      supposing that some evil had fallen upon him, came running to his house;
      and seeing his wife thus mutilated, forthwith upon this he took counsel
      with his sons and set forth to go to Bactria together with his sons and
      doubtless some others also, meaning to make the province of Bactria revolt
      and to do the greatest possible injury to the king: and this in fact would
      have come to pass, as I imagine, if he had got up to the land of the
      Bactrians and Sacans before he was overtaken, for they were much attached
      to him, and also he was the governor of the Bactrians: but Xerxes being
      informed that he was doing this, sent after him an army as he was on his
      way, and slew both him and his sons and his army. So far of that which
      happened about the passion of Xerxes and the death of Masistes.
    </p>
<p>
      114. Now the Hellenes who had set forth from Mycale to the Hellespont
      first moored their ships about Lecton, being stopped from their voyage by
      winds; and thence they came to Abydos and found that the bridges had been
      broken up, which they thought to find still stretched across, and on
      account of which especially they had come to the Hellespont. So the
      Peloponnesians which Leotychides resolved to sail back to Hellas, while
      the Athenians and Xanthippos their commander determined to stay behind
      there and to make an attempt upon the Chersonese. Those then sailed away,
      and the Athenians passed over from Abydos to the Chersonese and began to
      besiege Sestos..
    </p>
<p>
      115. To this town of Sestos, since it was the greatest stronghold of those
      in that region, men had come together from the cities which lay round it,
      when they heard that the Hellenes had arrived at the Hellespont, and
      especially there had come from the city of Cardia Oiobazos a Persian, who
      had brought to Sestos the ropes of the bridges. The inhabitants of the
      city were Aiolians, natives of the country, but there were living with
      them a great number of Persians and also of their allies..
    </p>
<p>
      116. And of the province Artaÿctes was despot, as governor under Xerxes, a
      Persian, but a man of desperate and reckless character, who also had
      practised deception upon the king on his march against Athens, in taking
      away from Elaius the things belonging to Protesilaos the son of Iphiclos.
      For at Elaius in the Chersonese there is the tomb of Protesilaos with a
      sacred enclosure about it, where there were many treasures, with gold and
      silver cups and bronze and raiment and other offerings, which things
      Artaÿctes carried off as plunder, the king having granted them to him. And
      he deceived Xerxes by saying to him some such words as these: "Master,
      there is here the house of a man, a Hellene, who made an expedition
      against thy land and met with his deserts and was slain: this man's house
      I ask thee to give to me, that every one may learn not to make expeditions
      against thy land." By saying this it was likely that he would easily
      enough persuade Xerxes to give him a man's house, not suspecting what was
      in his mind: and when he said that Protesilaos had made expedition against
      the land of the king, it must be understood that the Persians consider all
      Asia to be theirs and to belong to their reigning king. So when the things
      had been given him, he brought them from Elaius to Sestos, and he sowed
      the sacred enclosure for crops and occupied it as his own; and he himself,
      whenever he came to Elaius, had commerce with women in the inner cell of
      the temple. <a href="#link9note-116" id="link9noteref-116" class="pginternal">116</a> And now he was being besieged by the
      Athenians, when he had not made any preparation for a siege nor had been
      expecting that the Hellenes would come; for they fell upon him, as one may
      say, inevitably. <a href="#link9note-117" id="link9noteref-117" class="pginternal">117</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      117. When however autumn came and the siege still went on, the Athenians
      began to be vexed at being absent from their own land and at the same time
      not able to conquer the fortress, and they requested their commanders to
      lead them away home; but these said that they would not do so, until
      either they had taken the town or the public authority of the Athenians
      sent for them home: and so they endured their present state. <a href="#link9note-118" id="link9noteref-118" class="pginternal">118</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      118. Those however who were within the walls had now come to the greatest
      misery, so that they boiled down the girths of their beds and used them
      for food; and when they no longer had even these, then the Persians and
      with them Artaÿctes and Oiobazos ran away and departed in the night,
      climbing down by the back part of the wall, where the place was left most
      unguarded by the enemy; and when day came, the men of the Chersonese
      signified to the Athenians from the towers concerning that which had
      happened, and opened the gates to them. So the greater number of them went
      in pursuit, and the rest occupied the city..
    </p>
<p>
      119. Now Oiobazos, as he was escaping <a href="#link9note-119" id="link9noteref-119" class="pginternal">119</a> into Thrace, was
      caught by the Apsinthian Thracians and sacrificed to their native god
      Pleistoros with their rites, and the rest who were with him they
      slaughtered in another manner: but Artaÿctes with his companions, who
      started on their flight later and were overtaken at a little distance
      above Aigospotamoi, defended themselves for a considerable time and were
      some of them killed and others taken alive: and the Hellenes had bound
      these and were bringing them to Sestos, and among them Artaÿctes also in
      bonds together with his son..
    </p>
<p>
      120. Then, it is said by the men of the Chersonese, as one of those who
      guarded them was frying dried fish, a portent occurred as follows,—the
      dried fish when laid upon the fire began to leap and struggle just as if
      they were fish newly caught: and the others gathered round and were
      marvelling at the portent, but Artaÿctes seeing it called to the man who
      was frying the fish and said: "Stranger of Athens, be not at all afraid of
      this portent, seeing that it has not appeared for thee but for me.
      Protesilaos who dwells at Elaius signifies thereby that though he is dead
      and his body is dried like those fish, <a href="#link9note-120" id="link9noteref-120" class="pginternal">120</a> yet he has power
      given him by the gods to exact vengeance from the man who does him wrong.
      Now therefore I desire to impose this penalty for him, <a href="#link9note-121" id="link9noteref-121" class="pginternal">121</a>—that
      in place of the things which I took from the temple I should pay down a
      hundred talents to the god, and moreover as ransom for myself and my son I
      will pay two hundred talents to the Athenians, if my life be spared." Thus
      he engaged to do, but he did not prevail upon the commander Xanthippos;
      for the people of Elaius desiring to take vengeance for Protesilaos asked
      that he might be put to death, and the inclination of the commander
      himself tended to the same conclusion. They brought him therefore to that
      headland to which Xerxes made the passage across, or as some say to the
      hill which is over the town of Madytos, and there they nailed him to
      boards <a href="#link9note-122" id="link9noteref-122" class="pginternal">122</a> and hung him up; and they stoned his son to
      death before the eyes of Artaÿctes himself..
    </p>
<p>
      121. Having so done, they sailed away to Hellas, taking with them, besides
      other things, the ropes also of the bridges, in order to dedicate them as
      offerings in the temples: and for that year nothing happened further than
      this.
    </p>
<p>
      122. Now a forefather of this Artaÿctes who was hung up, was that
      Artembares who set forth to the Persians a proposal which they took up and
      brought before Cyrus, being to this effect: "Seeing that Zeus grants to
      the Persians leadership, and of all men to thee, O Cyrus, by destroying
      Astyages, come, since the land we possess is small and also rugged, let us
      change from it and inhabit another which is better: and there are many
      near at hand, and many also at a greater distance, of which if we take
      one, we shall have greater reverence and from more men. It is reasonable
      too that men who are rulers should do such things; for when will there
      ever be a fairer occasion than now, when we are rulers of many nations and
      of the whole of Asia?" Cyrus, hearing this and not being surprised at the
      proposal, <a href="#link9note-123" id="link9noteref-123" class="pginternal">123</a> bade them do so if they would; but he
      exhorted them and bade them prepare in that case to be no longer rulers
      but subjects; "For," said he, "from lands which are not rugged men who are
      not rugged are apt to come forth, since it does not belong to the same
      land to bring forth fruits of the earth which are admirable and also men
      who are good in war." So the Persians acknowledged that he was right and
      departed from his presence, having their opinion defeated by that of
      Cyrus; and they chose rather to dwell on poor land and be rulers, than to
      sow crops in a level plain and be slaves to others.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2 id="pg-footer-heading">THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</h2>

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

<h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
<p>
      If a new translation of Herodotus does not justify itself, it will hardly
      be justified in a preface; therefore the question whether it was needed
      may be left here without discussion. The aim of the translator has been
      above all things faithfulness—faithfulness to the manner of
      expression and to the structure of sentences, as well as to the meaning of
      the Author. At the same time it is conceived that the freedom and variety
      of Herodotus is not always best reproduced by such severe consistency of
      rendering as is perhaps desirable in the case of the Epic writers before
      and the philosophical writers after his time: nor again must his
      simplicity of thought and occasional quaintness be reproduced in the form
      of archaisms of language; and that not only because the affectation of an
      archaic style would necessarily be offensive to the reader, but also
      because in language Herodotus is not archaic. His style is the "best canon
      of the Ionic speech," marked, however, not so much by primitive purity as
      by eclectic variety. At the same time it is characterised largely by the
      poetic diction of the Epic and Tragic writers; and while the translator is
      free to employ all the resources of modern English, so far as he has them
      at his command, he must carefully retain this poetical colouring and by
      all means avoid the courtier phrase by which the style of Herodotus has
      too often been made "more noble." <a href="#linknote-331" id="linknoteref-331" class="pginternal">331</a>
</p>
<p>
      As regards the text from which this translation has been made, it is based
      upon that of Stein's critical edition (Berlin, 1869-1871), that is to say
      the estimate there made of the comparative value of the authorities has
      been on the whole accepted as a just one, rather than that which
      depreciates the value of the Medicean MS. and of the class to which it
      belongs. On the other hand the conjectural emendations proposed by Stein
      have very seldom been adopted, and his text has been departed from in a
      large number of other instances also, which will for the most part be
      found recorded in the notes.
    </p>
<p>
      As it seemed that even after Stein's re-collation of the Medicean MS.
      there were doubts felt by some scholars <a href="#linknote-332" id="linknoteref-332" class="pginternal">332</a> as to the true reading
      in some places of this MS., which is very generally acknowledged to be the
      most important, I thought it right to examine it myself in all those
      passages where questions about text arise which concern a translator, that
      is in nearly five hundred places altogether; and the results, when they
      are worth observing, are recorded in the notes. At the same time, by the
      suggestion of Dr. Stein, I re-collated a large part of the third book in
      the MS. which is commonly referred to as F (i.e. Florentinus), called by
      Stein C, and I examined this MS. also in a certain number of other places.
      It should be understood that wherever in the notes I mention the reading
      of any particular MS. by name, I do so on my own authority.
    </p>
<p>
      The notes have been confined to a tolerably small compass. Their purpose
      is, first, in cases where the text is doubtful, to indicate the reading
      adopted by the translator and any other which may seem to have reasonable
      probability, but without discussion of the authorities; secondly, where
      the rendering is not quite literal (and in other cases where it seemed
      desirable), to quote the words of the original or to give a more literal
      version; thirdly, to add an alternative version in cases where there seems
      to be a doubt as to the true meaning; and lastly, to give occasionally a
      short explanation, or a reference from one passage of the author to
      another.
    </p>
<p>
      For the orthography of proper names reference may be made to the note
      prefixed to the index. No consistent system has been adopted, and the
      result will therefore be open to criticism in many details; but the aim
      has been to avoid on the one hand the pedantry of seriously altering the
      form of those names which are fairly established in the English language
      of literature, as distinguished from that of scholarship, and on the other
      hand the absurdity of looking to Latin rather than to Greek for the
      orthography of the names which are not so established. There is no
      intention to put forward any theory about pronunciation.
    </p>
<p>
      The index of proper names will, it is hoped, be found more complete and
      accurate than those hitherto published. The best with which I was
      acquainted I found to have so many errors and omissions <a href="#linknote-333" id="linknoteref-333" class="pginternal">333</a>
      that I was compelled to do the work again from the beginning. In a
      collection of more than ten thousand references there must in all
      probability be mistakes, but I trust they will be found to be few.
    </p>
<p>
      My acknowledgments of obligation are due first to Dr. Stein, both for his
      critical work and also for his most excellent commentary, which I have had
      always by me. After this I have made most use of the editions of Krüger,
      Bähr, Abicht, and (in the first two books) Mr. Woods. As to translations,
      I have had Rawlinson's before me while revising my own work, and I have
      referred also occasionally to the translations of Littlebury (perhaps the
      best English version as regards style, but full of gross errors), Taylor,
      and Larcher. In the second book I have also used the version of B. R.
      reprinted by Mr. Lang: of the first book of this translation I have access
      only to a fragment written out some years ago, when the British Museum was
      within my reach. Other particular obligations are acknowledged in the
      notes.

<h2>
      BOOK I. THE FIRST BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED CLIO
    </h2>
<p>
      This is the Showing forth of the Inquiry of Herodotus of Halicarnassos, to
      the end that <a href="#linknote-1" id="linknoteref-1" class="pginternal">1</a>
      neither the deeds of men may be forgotten by lapse of time, nor the works
      <a href="#linknote-2" id="linknoteref-2" class="pginternal">2</a> great
      and marvellous, which have been produced some by Hellenes and some by
      Barbarians, may lose their renown; and especially that the causes may be
      remembered for which these waged war with one another.
    </p>
<p>
      1. Those of the Persians who have knowledge of history declare that the
      Phenicians first began the quarrel. These, they say, came from that which
      is called the Erythraian Sea to this of ours; and having settled in the
      land where they continue even now to dwell, set themselves forthwith to
      make long voyages by sea. And conveying merchandise of Egypt and of
      Assyria they arrived at other places and also at Argos; now Argos was at
      that time in all points the first of the States within that land which is
      now called Hellas;—the Phenicians arrived then at this land of
      Argos, and began to dispose of their ship's cargo: and on the fifth or
      sixth day after they had arrived, when their goods had been almost all
      sold, there came down to the sea a great company of women, and among them
      the daughter of the king; and her name, as the Hellenes also agree, was Io
      the daughter of Inachos. These standing near to the stern of the ship were
      buying of the wares such as pleased them most, when of a sudden the
      Phenicians, passing the word from one to another, made a rush upon them;
      and the greater part of the women escaped by flight, but Io and certain
      others were carried off. So they put them on board their ship, and
      forthwith departed, sailing away to Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      2. In this manner the Persians report that Io came to Egypt, not agreeing
      therein with the Hellenes, <a href="#linknote-3" id="linknoteref-3" class="pginternal">3</a> and this they say was the first beginning of
      wrongs. Then after this, they say, certain Hellenes (but the name of the
      people they are not able to report) put in to the city of Tyre in Phenicia
      and carried off the king's daughter Europa;—these would doubtless be
      Cretans;—and so they were quits for the former injury. After this
      however the Hellenes, they say, were the authors of the second wrong; for
      they sailed in to Aia of Colchis and to the river Phasis with a ship of
      war, and from thence, after they had done the other business for which
      they came, they carried off the king's daughter Medea: and the king of
      Colchis sent a herald to the land of Hellas and demanded satisfaction for
      the rape and to have his daughter back; but they answered that, as the
      Barbarians had given them no satisfaction for the rape of Io the Argive,
      so neither would they give satisfaction to the Barbarians for this.
    </p>
<p>
      3. In the next generation after this, they say, Alexander the son of
      Priam, having heard of these things, desired to get a wife for himself by
      violence <a href="#linknote-4" id="linknoteref-4" class="pginternal">4</a>
      from Hellas, being fully assured that he would not be compelled to give
      any satisfaction for this wrong, inasmuch as the Hellenes gave none for
      theirs. So he carried off Helen, and the Hellenes resolved to send
      messengers first and to demand her back with satisfaction for the rape;
      and when they put forth this demand, the others alleged to them the rape
      of Medea, saying that the Hellenes were now desiring satisfaction to be
      given to them by others, though they had given none themselves nor had
      surrendered the person when demand was made.
    </p>
<p>
      4. Up to this point, they say, nothing more happened than the carrying
      away of women on both sides; but after this the Hellenes were very greatly
      to blame; for they set the first example of war, making an expedition into
      Asia before the Barbarians made any into Europe. Now they say that in
      their judgment, though it is an act of wrong to carry away women by force,
      it is a folly to set one's heart on taking vengeance for their rape, and
      the wise course is to pay no regard when they have been carried away; for
      it is evident that they would never be carried away if they were not
      themselves willing to go. And the Persians say that they, namely the
      people of Asia, when their women were carried away by force, had made it a
      matter of no account, but the Hellenes on account of a woman of Lacedemon
      gathered together a great armament, and then came to Asia and destroyed
      the dominion of Priam; and that from this time forward they had always
      considered the Hellenic race to be their enemy: for Asia and the Barbarian
      races which dwell there the Persians claim as belonging to them; but
      Europe and the Hellenic race they consider to be parted off from them.
    </p>
<p>
      5. The Persians for their part say that things happened thus; and they
      conclude that the beginning of their quarrel with the Hellenes was on
      account of the taking of Ilion: but as regards Io the Phenicians do not
      agree with the Persians in telling the tale thus; for they deny that they
      carried her off to Egypt by violent means, and they say on the other hand
      that when they were in Argos she was intimate with the master of their
      ship, and perceiving that she was with child, she was ashamed to confess
      it to her parents, and therefore sailed away with the Phenicians of her
      own will, for fear of being found out. These are the tales told by the
      Persians and the Phenicians severally: and concerning these things I am
      not going to say that they happened thus or thus, <a href="#linknote-401" id="linknoteref-401" class="pginternal">401</a> but when I have
      pointed to the man who first within my own knowledge began to commit wrong
      against the Hellenes, I shall go forward further with the story, giving an
      account of the cities of men, small as well as great: for those which in
      old times were great have for the most part become small, while those that
      were in my own time great used in former times to be small: so then, since
      I know that human prosperity never continues steadfast, I shall make
      mention of both indifferently.
    </p>

<p>
      6. Croesus was Lydian by race, the son of Alyattes and ruler of the
      nations which dwell on this side of the river Halys; which river, flowing
      from the South between the Syrians <a href="#linknote-5" id="linknoteref-5" class="pginternal">5</a> and the Paphlagonians, runs
      out towards the North Wind into that Sea which is called the Euxine. This
      Croesus, first of all the Barbarians of whom we have knowledge, subdued
      certain of the Hellenes and forced them to pay tribute, while others he
      gained over and made them his friends. Those whom he subdued were the
      Ionians, the Aiolians, and the Dorians who dwell in Asia; and those whom
      he made his friends were the Lacedemonians. But before the reign of
      Croesus all the Hellenes were free; for the expedition of the Kimmerians,
      which came upon Ionia before the time of Croesus, was not a conquest of
      the cities but a plundering incursion only. <a href="#linknote-6" id="linknoteref-6" class="pginternal">6</a>
</p>
<p>
      7. Now the supremacy which had belonged to the Heracleidai came to the
      family of Croesus, called Mermnadai, in the following manner:—Candaules,
      whom the Hellenes call Myrsilos, was ruler of Sardis and a descendant of
      Alcaios, son of Heracles: for Agron, the son of Ninos, the son of Belos,
      the son of Alcaios, was the first of the Heracleidai who became king of
      Sardis, and Candaules the son of Myrsos was the last; but those who were
      kings over this land before Agrond, were descendants of Lydos the son of
      Atys, whence this whole nation was called Lydian, having been before
      called Meonian. From these the Heracleidai, descended from Heracles and
      the slave-girl of Iardanos, obtained the government, being charged with it
      by reason of an oracle; and they reigned for two-and-twenty generations of
      men, five hundred and five years, handing on the power from father to son,
      till the time of Clandaules the son of Myrsos.
    </p>
<p>
      8. This Candaules then of whom I speak had become passionately in love
      with his own wife; and having become so, he deemed that his wife was
      fairer by far than all other women; and thus deeming, to Gyges the son of
      Daskylos (for he of all his spearmen was the most pleasing to him), to
      this Gyges, I say, he used to impart as well the more weighty of his
      affairs as also the beauty of his wife, praising it above measure: and
      after no long time, since it was destined that evil should happen to
      Candaules, he said to Gyges as follows: "Gyges, I think that thou dost not
      believe me when I tell thee of the beauty of my wife, for it happens that
      men's ears are less apt of belief than their eyes: contrive therefore
      means by which thou mayest look upon her naked." But he cried aloud and
      said: "Master, what word of unwisdom is this which thou dost utter,
      bidding me look upon my mistress naked? When a woman puts off her tunic
      she puts off her modesty also. Moreover of old time those fair sayings
      have been found out by men, from which we ought to learn wisdom; and of
      these one is this,—that each man should look on his own: but I
      believe indeed that she is of all women the fairest and I entreat thee not
      to ask of me that which it is not lawful for me to do."
    </p>
<p>
      9. With such words as these he resisted, fearing lest some evil might come
      to him from this; but the king answered him thus: "Be of good courage,
      Gyges, and have no fear, either of me, that I am saying these words to try
      thee, or of my wife, lest any harm may happen to thee from her. For I will
      contrive it so from the first that she shall not even perceive that she
      has been seen by thee. I will place thee in the room where we sleep,
      behind the open door; <a href="#linknote-7" id="linknoteref-7" class="pginternal">7</a> and after I have gone in, my wife also will come
      to lie down. Now there is a seat near the entrance of the room, and upon
      this she will lay her garments as she takes them off one by one; and so
      thou wilt be able to gaze upon her at full leisure. And when she goes from
      the chair to the bed and thou shalt be behind her back, then let it be thy
      part to take care that she sees thee not as thou goest through the door."
    </p>
<p>
      10. He then, since he might not avoid it, gave consent: and Candaules,
      when he considered that it was time to rest, led Gyges to the chamber; and
      straightway after this the woman also appeared: and Gyges looked upon her
      after she came in and as she laid down her garments; and when she had her
      back turned towards him, as she went to the bed, then he slipped away from
      his hiding-place and was going forth. And as he went out, the woman caught
      sight of him, and perceiving that which had been done by her husband she
      did not cry out, though struck with shame, <a href="#linknote-8" id="linknoteref-8" class="pginternal">8</a> but she made as though she
      had not perceived the matter, meaning to avenge herself upon Candaules:
      for among the Lydians as also among most other Barbarians it is a shame
      even for a man to be seen naked.
    </p>
<p>
      11. At the time then she kept silence, as I say, and made no outward sign;
      but as soon as day had dawned, and she made ready those of the servants
      whom she perceived to be the most attached to herself, and after that she
      sent to summon Gyges. He then, not supposing that anything of that which
      had been done was known to her, came upon her summons; for he had been
      accustomed before to go <a href="#linknote-9" id="linknoteref-9" class="pginternal">9</a> whenever the queen summoned him. And when Gyges
      was come, the woman said to him these words: "There are now two ways open
      to thee, Gyges, and I give thee the choice which of the two thou wilt
      prefer to take. Either thou must slay Candaules and possess both me and
      the kingdom of Lydia, or thou must thyself here on the spot be slain, so
      that thou mayest not in future, by obeying Candaules in all things, see
      that which thou shouldest not. Either he must die who formed this design,
      or thou who hast looked upon me naked and done that which is not accounted
      lawful." For a time then Gyges was amazed at these words, and afterwards
      he began to entreat her that she would not bind him by necessity to make
      such a choice: then however, as he could not prevail with her, but saw
      that necessity was in truth set before him either to slay his master or to
      be himself slain by others, he made the choice to live himself; and he
      inquired further as follows: "Since thou dost compel me to take my
      master's life against my own will, let me hear from thee also what is the
      manner in which we shall lay hands upon him." And she answering said:
      "From that same place shall the attempt be, where he displayed me naked;
      and we will lay hands upon him as he sleeps."
    </p>
<p>
      12. So after they had prepared the plot, when night came on, (for Gyges
      was not let go nor was there any way of escape for him, but he must either
      be slain himself or slay Candaules), he followed the woman to the
      bedchamber; and she gave him a dagger and concealed him behind that very
      same door. Then afterwards, while Candaules was sleeping, Gyges came
      privily up to him <a href="#linknote-10" id="linknoteref-10" class="pginternal">10</a> and slew him, and he obtained both his wife and
      his kingdom: of him moreover Archilochos the Parian, who lived about that
      time, made mention in a trimeter iambic verse. <a href="#linknote-11" id="linknoteref-11" class="pginternal">11</a>
</p>
<p>
      13. He obtained the kingdom however and was strengthened in it by means of
      the Oracle at Delphi; for when the Lydians were angry because of the fate
      of Candaules, and had risen in arms, a treaty was made between the
      followers of Gyges and the other Lydians to this effect, that if the
      Oracle should give answer that he was to be king of the Lydians, he should
      be king, and if not, he should give back the power to the sons of
      Heracles. So the Oracle gave answer, and Gyges accordingly became king:
      yet the Pythian prophetess said this also, that vengeance for the
      Heracleidai should come upon the descendants of Gyges in the fifth
      generation. Of this oracle the Lydians and their kings made no account
      until it was in fact fulfilled.
    </p>
<p>
      14. Thus the Mermnadai obtained the government having driven out from it
      the Heracleidai: and Gyges when he became ruler sent votive offerings to
      Delphi not a few, for of all the silver offerings at Delphi his are more
      in number than those of any other man; and besides the silver he offered a
      vast quantity of gold, and especially one offering which is more worthy of
      mention than the rest, namely six golden mixing-bowls, which are dedicated
      there as his gift: of these the weight is thirty talents, and they stand
      in the treasury of the Corinthians, (though in truth this treasury does
      not belong to the State of the Corinthians, but is that of Kypselos the
      son of Aëtion). <a href="#linknote-12" id="linknoteref-12" class="pginternal">12</a> This Gyges was the first of the Barbarians
      within our knowledge who dedicated votive offerings at Delphi, except only
      Midas the son of Gordias king of Phrygia, who dedicated for an offering
      the royal throne on which he sat before all to decide causes; and this
      throne, a sight worth seeing, stands in the same place with the bowls of
      Gyges. This gold and silver which Gyges dedicated is called Gygian by the
      people of Delphi, after the name of him who offered it.
    </p>
<p>
      Now Gyges also, <a href="#linknote-13" id="linknoteref-13" class="pginternal">13</a> as soon as he became king, led an army against
      Miletos and Smyrna, and he took the lower town of Colophon: <a href="#linknote-14" id="linknoteref-14" class="pginternal">14</a> but
      no other great deed did he do in his reign, which lasted eight-and-thirty
      years, therefore we will pass him by with no more mention than has already
      been made,
    </p>
<p>
      15, and I will speak now of Ardys the son of Gyges, who became king after
      Gyges. He took Priene and made an invasion against Miletos; and while he
      was ruling over Sardis, the Kimmerians driven from their abodes by the
      nomad Scythians came to Asia and took Sardis except the citadel.
    </p>
<p>
      16. Now when Ardys had been king for nine-and-forty years, Sadyattes his
      son succeeded to his kingdom, and reigned twelve years; and after him
      Alyattes. This last made war against Kyaxares the descendant of Deïokes
      and against the Medes, <a href="#linknote-15" id="linknoteref-15" class="pginternal">15</a> and he drove the Kimmerians forth out of Asia,
      and he took Smyrna which had been founded from Colophon, and made an
      invasion against Clazomenai. From this he returned not as he desired, but
      with great loss: during his reign however he performed other deeds very
      worthy of mention as follows:—
    </p>
<p>
      17. He made war with those of Miletos, having received this war as an
      inheritance from his father: for he used to invade their land and besiege
      Miletos in the following manner:—whenever there were ripe crops upon
      the land, then he led an army into their confines, making his march to the
      sound of pipes and harps and flutes both of male and female tone: and when
      he came to the Milesian land, he neither pulled down the houses that were
      in the fields, nor set fire to them nor tore off their doors, but let them
      stand as they were; the trees however and the crops that were upon the
      land he destroyed, and then departed by the way he came: for the men of
      Miletos had command of the sea, so that it was of no use for his army to
      blockade them: and he abstained from pulling down the houses to the end
      that the Milesians might have places to dwell in while they sowed and
      tilled the land, and by the means of their labour he might have somewhat
      to destroy when he made his invasion.
    </p>
<p>
      18. Thus he continued to war with them for eleven years; and in the course
      of these years the Milesians suffered two great defeats, once when they
      fought a battle in the district of Limenion in their own land, and again
      in the plain of Maiander. Now for six of the eleven years Sadyattes the
      son of Ardys was still ruler of the Lydians, the same who was wont to
      invade the land of Miletos at the times mentioned; <a href="#linknote-16" id="linknoteref-16" class="pginternal">16</a> for this Sadyattes was he
      who first began the war: but for the five years which followed these first
      six the war was carried on by Alyattes the son of Sadyattes, who received
      it as an inheritance from his father (as I have already said) and applied
      himself to it earnestly. And none of the Ionians helped those of Miletos
      bear the burden of this war except only the men of Chios. These came to
      their aid to pay back like with like, for the Milesians had formerly
      assisted the Chians throughout their war with the people of Erythrai.
    </p>
<p>
      19. Then in the twelfth year of the war, when standing corn was being
      burnt by the army of the Lydians, it happened as follows:—as soon as
      the corn was kindled, it was driven by a violent wind and set fire to the
      temple of Athene surnamed of Assessos; and the temple being set on fire
      was burnt down to the ground. Of this no account was made then; but
      afterwards when the army had returned to Sardis, Alyattes fell sick, and
      as his sickness lasted long, he sent messengers to inquire of the Oracle
      at Delphi, either being advised to do so by some one, or because he
      himself thought it best to send and inquire of the god concerning his
      sickness. But when these arrived at Delphi, the Pythian prophetess said
      that she would give them no answer, until they should have built up again
      the temple of Athene which they had burnt at Assessos in the land of
      Miletos.
    </p>
<p>
      20. Thus much I know by the report of the people of Delphi; but the
      Milesians add to this that Periander the son of Kypselos, being a special
      guest-friend of Thrasybulos the then despot of Miletos, heard of the
      oracle which had been given to Alyattes, and sending a messenger told
      Thrasybulos, in order that he might have knowledge of it beforehand and
      take such counsel as the case required. This is the story told by the
      Milesians.
    </p>
<p>
      21. And Alyattes, when this answer was reported to him, sent a herald
      forthwith to Miletos, desiring to make a truce with Thrasybulos and the
      Milesians for so long a time as he should be building the temple. He then
      was being sent as envoy to Miletos; and Thrasybulos in the meantime being
      informed beforehand of the whole matter and knowing what Alyattes was
      meaning to do, contrived this device:—he gathered together in the
      market-place all the store of provisions which was found in the city, both
      his own and that which belonged to private persons; and he proclaimed to
      the Milesians that on a signal given by him they should all begin to drink
      and make merry with one another.
    </p>
<p>
      22. This Thrasybulos did and thus proclaimed to the end that the herald
      from Sardis, seeing a vast quantity of provisions carelessly piled up, and
      the people feasting, might report this to Alyattes: and so on fact it
      happened; for when the herald returned to Sardis after seeing this and
      delivering to Thrasybulos the charge which was given to him by the king of
      Lydia, the peace which was made, came about, as I am informed, merely
      because of this. For Alyattes, who thought that there was a great famine
      in Miletos and that the people had been worn down to the extreme of
      misery, heard from the herald, when he returned from Miletos, the opposite
      to that which he himself supposed. And after this the peace was made
      between them on condition of being guest-friends and allies to one
      another, and Alyattes built two temples to Athene at Assessos in place of
      one, and himself recovered from his sickness. With regard then to the war
      waged by Alyattes with the Milesians and Thrasybulos things went thus.
    </p>
<p>
      23. As for Periander, the man who gave information about the oracle to
      Thrasybulos, he was the son of Kypselos, and despot of Corinth. In his
      life, say the Corinthians, (and with them agree the Lesbians), there
      happened to him a very great marvel, namely that Arion of Methymna was
      carried ashore at Tainaron upon a dolphin's back. This man was a harper
      second to none of those who then lived, and the first, so far as we know,
      who composed a dithyramb, naming it so and teaching it to a chorus <a href="#linknote-17" id="linknoteref-17" class="pginternal">17</a> at
      Corinth.
    </p>
<p>
      24. This Arion, they say, who for the most part of his time stayed with
      Periander, conceived a desire to sail to Italy <a href="#linknote-18" id="linknoteref-18" class="pginternal">18</a> and Sicily; and after he
      had there acquired large sums of money, he wished to return again to
      Corinth. He set forth therefore from Taras, <a href="#linknote-19" id="linknoteref-19" class="pginternal">19</a> and as he had faith in
      Corinthians more than in other men, he hired a ship with a crew of
      Corinthians. These, the story says, when out in open sea, formed a plot to
      cast Arion overboard and so possess his wealth; and he having obtained
      knowledge of this made entreaties to them, offering them his wealth and
      asking them to grant him his life. With this however he did not prevail
      upon them, but the men who were conveying him bade him either slay himself
      there, that he might receive burial on the land, or leap straightway into
      the sea. So Arion being driven to a strait entreated them that, since they
      were so minded, they would allow him to take his stand in full minstrel's
      garb upon the deck <a href="#linknote-20" id="linknoteref-20" class="pginternal">20</a> of the ship and sing; and he promised to put
      himself to death after he had sung. They then, well pleased to think that
      they should hear the best of all minstrels upon earth, drew back from the
      stern towards the middle of the ship; and he put on the full minstrel's
      garb and took his lyre, and standing on the deck performed the Orthian
      measure. Then as the measure ended, he threw himself into the sea just as
      he was, in his full minstrel's garb; and they went on sailing away to
      Corinth, but him, they say, a dolphin supported on its back and brought
      him to shore at Tainaron: and when he had come to land he proceeded to
      Corinth with his minstrel's garb. Thither having arrived he related all
      that had been done; and Periander doubting of his story kept Arion in
      guard and would let him go nowhere, while he kept careful watch for those
      who had conveyed him. When these came, he called them and inquired of them
      if they had any report to make of Arion; and when they said that he was
      safe in Italy and that they had left him at Taras faring well, Arion
      suddenly appeared before them in the same guise as when he made his leap
      from the ship; and they being struck with amazement were no longer able to
      deny when they were questioned. This is the tale told by the Corinthians
      and Lesbians alike, and there is at Tainaron a votive offering of Arion of
      no great size, <a href="#linknote-21" id="linknoteref-21" class="pginternal">21</a> namely a bronze figure of a man upon a
      dolphin's back.
    </p>
<p>
      25. Alyattes the Lydian, when he had thus waged war against the Milesians,
      afterwards died, having reigned seven-and-fifty years. This king, when he
      recovered from his sickness, dedicated a votive offering at Delphi (being
      the second of his house who had so done), namely a great mixing-bowl of
      silver with a stand for it of iron welded together, which last is a sight
      worth seeing above all the offerings at Delphi and the work of Glaucos the
      Chian, who of all men first found out the art of welding iron.
    </p>
<p>
      26. After Alyattes was dead Croesus the son of Alyattes received the
      kingdom in succession, being five-and-thirty years of age. He (as I said)
      fought against the Hellenes and of them he attacked the Ephesians first.
      The Ephesians then, being besieged by him, dedicated their city to Artemis
      and tied a rope from the temple to the wall of the city: now the distance
      between the ancient city, which was then being besieged, and the temple is
      seven furlongs. <a href="#linknote-22" id="linknoteref-22" class="pginternal">22</a> These, I say, where the first upon whom Croesus
      laid hands, but afterwards he did the same to the other Ionian and Aiolian
      cities one by one, alleging against them various causes of complaint, and
      making serious charges against those in whose cases he could find serious
      grounds, while against others of them he charged merely trifling offences.
    </p>
<p>
      27. Then when the Hellenes in Asia had been conquered and forced to pay
      tribute, he designed next to build for himself ships and to lay hands upon
      those who dwelt in the islands; and when all was prepared for his building
      of ships, they say that Bias of Priene (or, according to another account,
      Pittacos of Mytilene) came to Sardis, and being asked by Croesus whether
      there was any new thing doing in Hellas, brought to an end his building of
      ships by this saying: "O king," said he, "the men of the islands are
      hiring a troop of ten thousand horse, and with this they mean to march to
      Sardis and fight against thee." And Croesus, supposing that what he
      reported was true, said: "May the gods put it into the minds of the
      dwellers of the islands to come with horses against the sons of the
      Lydians!" And he answered and said: "O king, I perceive that thou dost
      earnestly desire to catch the men of the islands on the mainland riding
      upon horses; and it is not unreasonable that thou shouldest wish for this:
      what else however thinkest thou the men of the islands desire and have
      been praying for ever since the time they heard that thou wert about to
      build ships against them, than that they might catch the Lydians upon the
      sea, so as to take vengeance upon thee for the Hellenes who dwell upon the
      mainland, whom thou dost hold enslaved?" Croesus, they say, was greatly
      pleased with this conclusion, <a href="#linknote-23" id="linknoteref-23" class="pginternal">23</a> and obeying his suggestion, for he judged him
      to speak suitably, he stopped his building of ships; and upon that he
      formed a friendship with the Ionians dwelling in the islands.
    </p>
<p>
      28. As time went on, when nearly all those dwelling on this side the river
      Halys had been subdued, (for except the Kilikians and Lykians Croesus
      subdued and kept under his rule all the nations, that is to say Lydians,
      Phrygians, Mysians, Mariandynoi, Chalybians, Paphlagonians, Thracians both
      Thynian and Bithynian, Carians, Ionians, Dorians, Aiolians, and
      Pamphylians), <a href="#linknote-24" id="linknoteref-24" class="pginternal">24</a>
</p>
<p>
      29, when these, I say, had been subdued, and while he was still adding to
      his Lydian dominions, there came to Sardis, then at the height of its
      wealth, all the wise men <a href="#linknote-25" id="linknoteref-25" class="pginternal">25</a> of the Hellas who chanced to be alive at that
      time, brought thither severally by various occasions; and of them one was
      Solon the Athenian, who after he had made laws for the Athenians at their
      bidding, left his native country for ten years and sailed away saying that
      he desired to visit various lands, in order that he might not be compelled
      to repeal any of the laws which he had proposed. <a href="#linknote-26" id="linknoteref-26" class="pginternal">26</a> For of themselves the
      Athenians were not competent to do this, having bound themselves by solemn
      oaths to submit for ten years to the laws which Solon should propose for
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      30. So Solon, having left his native country for this reason and for the
      sake of seeing various lands, came to Amasis in Egypt, and also to Croesus
      at Sardis. Having there arrived he was entertained as a guest by Croesus
      in the king's palace; and afterwards, on the third or fourth day, at the
      bidding of Croesus his servants led Solon round to see his treasuries; and
      they showed him all things, how great and magnificent they were: and after
      he had looked upon them all and examined them as he had occasion, Croesus
      asked him as follows: "Athenian guest, much report of thee has come to us,
      both in regard to thy wisdom and thy wanderings, how that in thy search
      for wisdom thou hast traversed many lands to see them; now therefore a
      desire has come upon me to ask thee whether thou hast seen any whom thou
      deemest to be of all men the most happy." <a href="#linknote-27" id="linknoteref-27" class="pginternal">27</a> This he asked supposing
      that he himself was the happiest of men; but Solon, using no flattery but
      the truth only, said: "Yes, O king, Tellos the Athenian." And Croesus,
      marvelling at that which he said, asked him earnestly: "In what respect
      dost thou judge Tellos to be the most happy?" And he said: "Tellos, in the
      first place, living while his native State was prosperous, had sons fair
      and good and saw from all of them children begotten and living to grow up;
      and secondly he had what with us is accounted wealth, and after his life a
      most glorious end: for when a battle was fought by the Athenians at
      Eleusis against the neighbouring people, he brought up supports and routed
      the foe and there died by a most fair death; and the Athenians buried him
      publicly where he fell, and honoured him greatly."
    </p>
<p>
      31. So when Solon had moved Croesus to inquire further by the story of
      Tellos, recounting how many points of happiness he had, the king asked
      again whom he had seen proper to be placed next after this man, supposing
      that he himself would certainly obtain at least the second place; but he
      replied: "Cleobis and Biton: for these, who were of Argos by race,
      possessed a sufficiency of wealth and, in addition to this, strength of
      body such as I shall tell. Both equally had won prizes in the games, and
      moreover the following tale is told of them:—There was a feast of
      Hera among the Argives and it was by all means necessary that their mother
      should be borne in a car to the temple. But since their oxen were not
      brought up in time from the field, the young men, barred from all else by
      lack of time, submitted themselves to the yoke and drew the wain, their
      mother being borne by them upon it; and so they brought it on for
      five-and-forty furlongs, <a href="#linknote-28" id="linknoteref-28" class="pginternal">28</a> and came to the temple. Then after they had
      done this and had been seen by the assembled crowd, there came to their
      life a most excellent ending; and in this the deity declared that it was
      better for man to die than to continue to live. For the Argive men were
      standing round and extolling the strength <a href="#linknote-29" id="linknoteref-29" class="pginternal">29</a> of the young men, while
      the Argive women were extolling the mother to whose lot it had fallen to
      have such sons; and the mother being exceedingly rejoiced both by the deed
      itself and by the report made of it, took her stand in front of the image
      of the goddess and prayed that she would give to Cleobis and Biton her
      sons, who had honoured her <a href="#linknote-30" id="linknoteref-30" class="pginternal">30</a> greatly, that gift which is best for man to
      receive: and after this prayer, when they had sacrificed and feasted, the
      young men lay down to sleep within the temple itself, and never rose
      again, but were held bound in this last end. <a href="#linknote-31" id="linknoteref-31" class="pginternal">31</a> And the Argives made
      statues in the likeness of them and dedicated them as offerings at Delphi,
      thinking that they had proved themselves most excellent."
    </p>
<p>
      32. Thus Solon assigned the second place in respect of happiness to these:
      and Croesus was moved to anger and said: "Athenian guest, hast thou then
      so cast aside our prosperous state as worth nothing, that thou dost prefer
      to us even men of private station?" And he said: "Croesus, thou art
      inquiring about human fortunes of one who well knows that the Deity is
      altogether envious and apt to disturb our lot. For in the course of long
      time a man may see many things which he would not desire to see, and
      suffer also many things which he would not desire to suffer. The limit of
      life for a man I lay down at seventy years: and these seventy years give
      twenty-five thousand and two hundred days, not reckoning for any
      intercalated month. Then if every other one of these years shall be made
      longer by one month, that the seasons may be caused to come round at the
      due time of the year, the intercalated months will be in number
      five-and-thirty besides the seventy years; and of these months the days
      will be one thousand and fifty. Of all these days, being in number
      twenty-six thousand two hundred and fifty, which go to the seventy years,
      one day produces nothing at all which resembles what another brings with
      it. Thus then, O Croesus, man is altogether a creature of accident. As for
      thee, I perceive that thou art both great in wealth and king of many men,
      but that of which thou didst ask me I cannot call thee yet, until I learn
      that thou hast brought thy life to a fair ending: for the very rich man is
      not at all to be accounted more happy than he who has but his subsistence
      from day to day, unless also the fortune go with him of ending his life
      well in possession of all things fair. For many very wealthy men are not
      happy, <a href="#linknote-32" id="linknoteref-32" class="pginternal">32</a>
      while many who have but a moderate living are fortunate; <a href="#linknote-33" id="linknoteref-33" class="pginternal">33</a> and
      in truth the very rich man who is not happy has two advantages only as
      compared with the poor man who is fortunate, whereas this latter has many
      as compared with the rich man who is not happy. The rich man is able
      better to fulfil his desire, and also to endure a great calamity if it
      fall upon him; whereas the other has advantage over him in these things
      which follow:—he is not indeed able equally with the rich man to
      endure a calamity or to fulfil his desire, but these his good fortune
      keeps away from him, while he is sound of limb, <a href="#linknote-34" id="linknoteref-34" class="pginternal">34</a> free from disease,
      untouched by suffering, the father of fair children and himself of comely
      form; and if in addition to this he shall end his life well, he is worthy
      to be called that which thou seekest, namely a happy man; but before he
      comes to his end it is well to hold back and not to call him yet happy but
      only fortunate. Now to possess all these things together is impossible for
      one who is mere man, just as no single land suffices to supply all things
      for itself, but one thing it has and another it lacks, and the land that
      has the greatest number of things is the best: so also in the case of a
      man, no single person is complete in himself, for one thing he has and
      another he lacks; but whosoever of men continues to the end in possession
      of the greatest number of these things and then has a gracious ending of
      his life, he is by me accounted worthy, O king, to receive this name. But
      we must of every thing examine the end and how it will turn out at the
      last, for to many God shows but a glimpse of happiness and then plucks
      them up by the roots and overturns them."
    </p>
<p>
      33. Thus saying he refused to gratify Croesus, who sent him away from his
      presence holding him in no esteem, and thinking him utterly senseless in
      that he passed over present good things and bade men look to the end of
      every matter.
    </p>
<p>
      34. After Solon had departed, a great retribution from God came upon
      Croesus, probably because he judged himself to be the happiest of all men.
      First there came and stood by him a dream, which showed to him the truth
      of the evils that were about to come to pass in respect of his son. Now
      Croesus had two sons, of whom one was deficient, seeing that he was deaf
      and dumb, while the other far surpassed his companions of the same age in
      all things: and the name of this last was Atys. As regards this Atys then,
      the dream signified to Croesus that he should lose him by the blow of an
      iron spear-point: <a href="#linknote-35" id="linknoteref-35" class="pginternal">35</a> and when he rose up from sleep and considered
      the matter with himself, he was struck with fear on account of the dream;
      and first he took for his son a wife; and whereas his son had been wont to
      lead the armies of the Lydians, he now no longer sent him forth anywhere
      on any such business; and the javelins and lances and all such things
      which men use for fighting he conveyed out of the men's apartments and
      piled them up in the inner bed-chambers, for fear lest something hanging
      up might fall down upon his son.
    </p>
<p>
      35. Then while he was engaged about the marriage of his son, there came to
      Sardis a man under a misfortune and with hands not clean, a Phrygian by
      birth and of the royal house. This man came to the house of Croesus, and
      according to the customs which prevail in that land made request that he
      might have cleansing; and Croesus gave him cleansing: now the manner of
      cleansing among the Lydians is the same almost as that which the Hellenes
      use. So when Croesus had done that which was customary, he asked of him
      whence he came and who he was, saying as follows: "Man, who art thou, and
      from what region of Phrygia didst thou come to sit upon my hearth? And
      whom of men or women didst thou slay?" And he replied: "O king, I am the
      son of Gordias, the son of Midas, and I am called Adrastos; and I slew my
      own brother against my will, and therefore am I here, having been driven
      forth by my father and deprived of all that I had." And Croesus answered
      thus: "Thou art, as it chances, the offshoot of men who are our friends
      and thou hast come to friends, among whom thou shalt want of nothing so
      long as thou shalt remain in our land: and thou wilt find it most for thy
      profit to bear this misfortune as lightly as may be." So he had his abode
      with Croesus. <a href="#linknote-36" id="linknoteref-36" class="pginternal">36</a>
</p>
<p>
      36. During this time there was produced in the Mysian Olympos a boar of
      monstrous size. This, coming down from the mountain aforesaid, ravaged the
      fields of the Mysians, and although the Mysians went out against it often,
      yet they could do it no hurt, but rather received hurt themselves from it;
      so at length messengers came from the Mysians to Croesus and said: "O
      king, there has appeared in our land a boar of monstrous size, which lays
      waste our fields; and we, desiring eagerly to take it, are not able: now
      therefore we ask of thee to send with us thy son and also a chosen band of
      young men with dogs, that we may destroy it out of our land." Thus they
      made request, and Croesus calling to mind the words of the dream spoke to
      them as follows: "As touching my son, make no further mention of him in
      this matter; for I will not send him with you, seeing that he is newly
      married and is concerned now with the affairs of his marriage: but I will
      send with you chosen men of the Lydians and the whole number of my hunting
      dogs, and I will give command to those who go, to be as zealous as may be
      in helping you to destroy the wild beast out of your land."
    </p>
<p>
      37. Thus he made reply, and while the Mysians were being contented with
      this answer, there came in also the son of Croesus, having heard of the
      request made by the Mysians: and when Croesus said that he would not send
      his son with them, the young man spoke as follows: "My father, in times
      past the fairest and most noble part was allotted to us, to go out
      continually to wars and to the chase and so have good repute; but now thou
      hast debarred me from both of these, although thou hast not observed in me
      any cowardly or faint-hearted spirit. And now with what face must I appear
      when I go to and from the market-place of the city? What kind of a man
      shall I be esteemed by the citizens, and what kind of a man shall I be
      esteemed by my newly-married wife? With what kind of a husband will she
      think that she is mated? Therefore either let me go to the hunt, or
      persuade me by reason that these things are better for me done as now they
      are."
    </p>
<p>
      38. And Croesus made answer thus: "My son, not because I have observed in
      thee any spirit of cowardice or any other ungracious thing, do I act thus;
      but a vision of a dream came and stood by me in my sleep and told me that
      thou shouldest be short-lived, and that thou shouldest perish by a
      spear-point of iron. With thought of this vision therefore I both urged on
      this marriage for thee, and I refuse now to send thee upon the matter
      which is being taken in hand, having a care of thee that I may steal thee
      from thy fate at least for the period of my own life, if by any means
      possible for me to do so. For thou art, as it chances, my only son: the
      other I do not reckon as one, seeing that he is deficient in hearing."
    </p>
<p>
      39. The young man made answer thus: "It may well be forgiven in thee, O my
      father, that thou shouldest have a care of me after having seen such a
      vision; but that which thou dost not understand, and in which the meaning
      of the dream has escaped thee, it is right that I should expound to thee.
      Thou sayest the dream declared that I should end my life by means of a
      spear-point of iron: but what hands has a boar, or what spear-point of
      iron, of which thou art afraid? If the dream had told thee that I should
      end my life by a tusk, or any other thing which resembles that, it would
      be right for thee doubtless to do as thou art doing; but it said 'by a
      spear-point.' Since therefore our fight will not be with men, let me now
      go."
    </p>
<p>
      40. Croesus made answer: "My son, thou dost partly prevail with me by
      declaring thy judgment about the dream; therefore, having been prevailed
      upon by thee, I change my resolution and allow thee to go to the chase."
    </p>
<p>
      41. Having thus said Croesus went to summon Adrastos the Phrygian; and
      when he came, he addressed him thus: "Adrastos, when thou wast struck with
      a grievous misfortune (with which I reproach thee not), I cleansed thee,
      and I have received thee into my house supplying all thy costs. Now
      therefore, since having first received kindness from me thou art bound to
      requite me with kindness, I ask of thee to be the protector of my son who
      goes forth to the chase, lest any evil robbers come upon you by the way to
      do you harm; and besides this thou too oughtest to go where thou mayest
      become famous by thy deeds, for it belongs to thee as an inheritance from
      thy fathers so to do, and moreover thou hast strength for it."
    </p>
<p>
      42. Adrastos made answer: "O king, but for this I should not have been
      going to any such contest of valour; for first it is not fitting that one
      who is suffering such a great misfortune as mine should seek the company
      of his fellows who are in prosperity, and secondly I have no desire for
      it; and for many reasons I should have kept myself away. But now, since
      thou art urgent with me, and I ought to gratify thee (for I am bound to
      requite thee with kindness), I am ready to do this: expect therefore that
      thy son, whom thou commandest me to protect, will return home to thee
      unhurt, so far as his protector may avail to keep him safe."
    </p>
<p>
      43. When he had made answer to Croesus in words like these, they
      afterwards set forth provided with chosen young men and with dogs. And
      when they were come to Mount Olympos, they tracked the animal; and having
      found it and taken their stand round in a circle, they were hurling
      against it their spears. Then the guest, he who had been cleansed of
      manslaughter, whose name was Adrastos, hurling a spear at it missed the
      boar and struck the son of Croesus. So he being struck by the spear-point
      fulfilled the saying of the dream. And one ran to report to Croesus that
      which had come to pass, and having come to Sardis he signified to him of
      the combat and of the fate of his son. And Croesus was very greatly
      disturbed by the death of his son, and was much the more moved to
      complaining by this, namely that his son was slain by the man whom he had
      himself cleansed of manslaughter. And being grievously troubled by the
      misfortune he called upon Zeus the Cleanser, protesting to him that which
      he had suffered from his guest, and he called moreover upon the Protector
      of Suppliants <a href="#linknote-37" id="linknoteref-37" class="pginternal">37</a> and the Guardian of Friendship, <a href="#linknote-38" id="linknoteref-38" class="pginternal">38</a>
      naming still the same god, and calling upon him as the Protector of
      Suppliants because when he received the guest into his house he had been
      fostering ignorantly the slayer of his son, and as the Guardian of
      Friendship because having sent him as a protector he had found him the
      worst of foes.
    </p>
<p>
      45. After this the Lydians came bearing the corpse, and behind it followed
      the slayer: and he taking his stand before the corpse delivered himself up
      to Croesus, holding forth his hands and bidding the king slay him over the
      corpse, speaking of his former misfortune and saying that in addition to
      this he had now been the destroyer of the man who had cleansed him of it;
      and that life for him was no more worth living. But Croesus hearing this
      pitied Adrastos, although he was himself suffering so great an evil of his
      own, and said to him: "Guest, I have already received from thee all the
      satisfaction that is due, seeing that thou dost condemn thyself to suffer
      death; and not thou alone art the cause of this evil, except in so far as
      thou wert the instrument of it against thine own will, but some one, as I
      suppose, of the gods, who also long ago signified to me that which was
      about to be." So Croesus buried his son as was fitting: but Adrastos the
      son of Gordias, the son of Midas, he who had been the slayer of his own
      brother and the slayer also of the man who had cleansed him, when silence
      came of all men round about the tomb, recognising that he was more
      grievously burdened by misfortune than all men of whom he knew, slew
      himself upon the grave.
    </p>
<p>
      46. For two years then Croesus remained quiet in his mourning, because he
      was deprived of his son: but after this period of time the overthrowing of
      the rule of Astyages the son of Kyaxares by Cyrus the son of Cambyses, and
      the growing greatness of the Persians caused Croesus to cease from his
      mourning, and led him to a care of cutting short the power of the
      Persians, if by any means he might, while yet it was in growth and before
      they should have become great.
    </p>
<p>
      So having formed this design he began forthwith to make trial of the
      Oracles, both those of the Hellenes and that in Libya, sending messengers
      some to one place and some to another, some to go to Delphi, others to
      Abai of the Phokians, and others to Dodona; and some were sent to the
      shrine of Amphiaraos and to that of Trophonios, others to Branchidai in
      the land of Miletos: these are the Oracles of the Hellenes to which
      Croesus sent messengers to seek divination; and others he sent to the
      shrine of Ammon in Libya to inquire there. Now he was sending the
      messengers abroad to the end that he might try the Oracles and find out
      what knowledge they had, so that if they should be found to have knowledge
      of the truth, he might send and ask them secondly whether he should
      attempt to march against the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      47. And to the Lydians whom he sent to make trial of the Oracles he gave
      charge as follows,—that from the day on which they set out from
      Sardis they should reckon up the number of the days following and on the
      hundredth day they should consult the Oracles, asking what Croesus the son
      of Alyattes king of the Lydians chanced then to be doing: and whatever the
      Oracles severally should prophesy, this they should cause to be written
      down <a href="#linknote-39" id="linknoteref-39" class="pginternal">39</a>
      and bear it back to him. Now what the other Oracles prophesied is not by
      any reported, but at Delphi, so soon as the Lydians entered the sanctuary
      of the temple <a href="#linknote-40" id="linknoteref-40" class="pginternal">40</a> to consult the god and asked that which they
      were commanded to ask, the Pythian prophetess spoke thus in hexameter
      measure:
    </p>
<pre>
 "But the number of sand I know, <a href="#linknote-41" id="linknoteref-41" class="pginternal">41</a> and the measure of drops in the ocean;
  The dumb man I understand, and I hear the speech of the speechless:
  And there hath come to my soul the smell of a strong-shelled tortoise
  Boiling in caldron of bronze, and the flesh of a lamb mingled with it;
  Under it bronze is laid, it hath bronze as a clothing upon it."
</pre>
<p>
      48. When the Pythian prophetess had uttered this oracle, the Lydians
      caused the prophecy to be written down, and went away at once to Sardis.
      And when the rest also who had been sent round were there arrived with the
      answers of the Oracles, then Croesus unfolded the writings one by one and
      looked upon them: and at first none of them pleased him, but when he heard
      that from Delphi, forthwith he did worship to the god and accepted the
      answer, <a href="#linknote-42" id="linknoteref-42" class="pginternal">42</a>
      judging that the Oracle at Delphi was the only true one, because it had
      found out what he himself had done. For when he had sent to the several
      Oracles his messengers to consult the gods, keeping well in mind the
      appointed day he contrived the following device,—he thought of
      something which it would be impossible to discover or to conceive of, and
      cutting up a tortoise and a lamb he boiled them together himself in a
      caldron of bronze, laying a cover of bronze over them.
    </p>
<p>
      49. This then was the answer given to Croesus from Delphi; and as regards
      the answer of Amphiaraos, I cannot tell what he replied to the Lydians
      after they had done the things customary in his temple, <a href="#linknote-43" id="linknoteref-43" class="pginternal">43</a> for
      there is no record of this any more than of the others, except only that
      Croesus thought that he also <a href="#linknote-44" id="linknoteref-44" class="pginternal">44</a> possessed a true Oracle.
    </p>
<p>
      50. After this with great sacrifices he endeavoured to win the favour of
      the god at Delphi: for of all the animals that are fit for sacrifice he
      offered three thousand of each kind, and he heaped up couches overlaid
      with gold and overlaid with silver, and cups of gold, and robes of purple,
      and tunics, making of them a great pyre, and this he burnt up, hoping by
      these means the more to win over the god to the side of the Lydians: and
      he proclaimed to all the Lydians that every one of them should make
      sacrifice with that which each man had. And when he had finished the
      sacrifice, he melted down a vast quantity of gold, and of it he wrought
      half-plinths <a href="#linknote-45" id="linknoteref-45" class="pginternal">45</a> making them six palms <a href="#linknote-46" id="linknoteref-46" class="pginternal">46</a> in length and three in
      breadth, and in height one palm; and their number was one hundred and
      seventeen. Of these four were of pure gold <a href="#linknote-47" id="linknoteref-47" class="pginternal">47</a> weighing two talents and
      a half <a href="#linknote-48" id="linknoteref-48" class="pginternal">48</a>
      each, and others of gold alloyed with silver <a href="#linknote-49" id="linknoteref-49" class="pginternal">49</a> weighing two talents. And
      he caused to be made also an image of a lion of pure gold weighing ten
      talents; which lion, when the temple of Delphi was being burnt down, fell
      from off the half-plinths, for upon these it was set, <a href="#linknote-50" id="linknoteref-50" class="pginternal">50</a> and
      is placed now in the treasury of the Corinthians, weighing six talents and
      a half, for three talents and a half were melted away from it.
    </p>
<p>
      51. So Croesus having finished all these things sent them to Delphi, and
      with them these besides:—two mixing bowls of great size, one of gold
      and the other of silver, of which the golden bowl was placed on the right
      hand as one enters the temple, and the silver on the left, but the places
      of these also were changed after the temple was burnt down, and the golden
      bowl is now placed in the treasury of the people of Clazomenai, weighing
      eight and a half talents and twelve pounds over, <a href="#linknote-51" id="linknoteref-51" class="pginternal">51</a> while the silver one is
      placed in the corner of the vestibule <a href="#linknote-52" id="linknoteref-52" class="pginternal">52</a> and holds six hundred
      amphors <a href="#linknote-53" id="linknoteref-53" class="pginternal">53</a>
      (being filled with wine by the Delphians on the feast of the Theophania):
      this the people of Delphi say is the work of Theodoros the Samian, <a href="#linknote-54" id="linknoteref-54" class="pginternal">54</a> and,
      as I think, rightly, for it is evident to me that the workmanship is of no
      common kind: moreover Croesus sent four silver wine-jars, which stand in
      the treasury of the Corinthians, and two vessels for lustral water, <a href="#linknote-55" id="linknoteref-55" class="pginternal">55</a> one
      of gold and the other of silver, of which the gold one is inscribed "from
      the Lacedemonians," who say that it is their offering: therein however
      they do not speak rightly; for this also is from Croesus, but one of the
      Delphians wrote the inscription upon it, desiring to gratify the
      Lacedemonians; and his name I know but will not make mention of it. The
      boy through whose hand the water flows is from the Lacedemonians, but
      neither of the vessels for lustral water. And many other votive offerings
      Croesus sent with these, not specially distinguished, among which are
      certain castings <a href="#linknote-56" id="linknoteref-56" class="pginternal">56</a> of silver of a round shape, and also a golden
      figure of a woman three cubits high, which the Delphians say is a statue
      of the baker of Croesus. Moreover Croesus dedicated the ornaments from his
      wife's neck and her girdles.
    </p>
<p>
      52. These are the things which he sent to Delphi; and to Amphiaraos,
      having heard of his valour and of his evil fate, he dedicated a shield
      made altogether of gold throughout, and a spear all of solid gold, the
      shaft being of gold also as well as the two points, which offerings were
      both remaining even to my time at Thebes in the temple of Ismenian Apollo.
    </p>
<p>
      53. To the Lydians who were to carry these gifts to the temples Croesus
      gave charge that they should ask the Oracles this question also,—whether
      Croesus should march against the Persians, and if so, whether he should
      join with himself any army of men as his friends. And when the Lydians had
      arrived at the places to which they had been sent and had dedicated the
      votive offerings, they inquired of the Oracles and said: "Croesus, king of
      the Lydians and of other nations, considering that these are the only true
      Oracles among men, presents to you <a href="#linknote-57" id="linknoteref-57" class="pginternal">57</a> gifts such as your
      revelations deserve, and asks you again now whether he shall march against
      the Persians, and if so, whether he shall join with himself any army of
      men as allies." They inquired thus, and the answers of both the Oracles
      agreed in one, declaring to Croesus that if he should march against the
      Persians he should destroy a great empire: and they counselled him to find
      out the most powerful of the Hellenes and join these with himself as
      friends.
    </p>
<p>
      54. So when the answers were brought back and Croesus heard them, he was
      delighted with the oracles, and expecting that he would certainly destroy
      the kingdom of Cyrus, he sent again to Pytho, <a href="#linknote-58" id="linknoteref-58" class="pginternal">58</a> and presented to the men
      of Delphi, having ascertained the number of them, two staters of gold for
      each man: and in return for this the Delphians gave to Croesus and to the
      Lydians precedence in consulting the Oracle and freedom from all payments,
      and the right to front seats at the games, with this privilege also for
      all time, that any one of them who wished should be allowed to become a
      citizen of Delphi.
    </p>
<p>
      55. And having made presents to the men of Delphi, Croesus consulted the
      Oracle the third time; for from the time when he learnt the truth of the
      Oracle, he made abundant use of it. <a href="#linknote-59" id="linknoteref-59" class="pginternal">59</a> And consulting the Oracle
      he inquired whether his monarchy would endure for a long time. And the
      Pythian prophetess answered him thus:
    </p>
<pre>
 "But when it cometh to pass that a mule of the Medes shall be monarch
  Then by the pebbly Hermos, O Lydian delicate-footed,
  Flee and stay not, and be not ashamed to be callèd a coward."
</pre>
<p>
      56. By these lines when they came to him Croesus was pleased more than by
      all the rest, for he supposed that a mule would never be ruler of the
      Medes instead of a man, and accordingly that he himself and his heirs
      would never cease from their rule. Then after this he gave thought to
      inquire which people of the Hellenes he should esteem the most powerful
      and gain over to himself as friends. And inquiring he found that the
      Lacedemonians and the Athenians had the pre-eminence, the first of the
      Dorian and the others of the Ionian race. For these were the most eminent
      races in ancient time, the second being a Pelasgian and the first a
      Hellenic race: and the one never migrated from its place in any direction,
      while the other was very exceedingly given to wanderings; for in the reign
      of Deucalion this race dwelt in Pthiotis, and in the time of Doros the son
      of Hellen in the land lying below Ossa and Olympos, which is called
      Histiaiotis; and when it was driven from Histiaiotis by the sons of
      Cadmos, it dwelt in Pindos and was called Makednian; and thence it moved
      afterwards to Dryopis, and from Dryopis it came finally to Peloponnesus,
      and began to be called Dorian.
    </p>
<p>
      57. What language however the Pelasgians used to speak I am not able with
      certainty to say. But if one must pronounce judging by those that still
      remain of the Pelasgians who dwelt in the city of Creston <a href="#linknote-60" id="linknoteref-60" class="pginternal">60</a> above
      the Tyrsenians, and who were once neighbours of the race now called
      Dorian, dwelling then in the land which is now called Thessaliotis, and
      also by those that remain of the Pelasgians who settled at Plakia and
      Skylake in the region of the Hellespont, who before that had been settlers
      with the Athenians, <a href="#linknote-61" id="linknoteref-61" class="pginternal">61</a> and of the natives of the various other towns
      which are really Pelasgian, though they have lost the name,—if one
      must pronounce judging by these, the Pelasgians used to speak a Barbarian
      language. If therefore all the Pelasgian race was such as these, then the
      Attic race, being Pelasgian, at the same time when it changed and became
      Hellenic, unlearnt also its language. For the people of Creston do not
      speak the same language with any of those who dwell about them, nor yet do
      the people of Phakia, but they speak the same language one as the other:
      and by this it is proved that they still keep unchanged the form of
      language which they brought with them when they migrated to these places.
    </p>
<p>
      58. As for the Hellenic race, it has used ever the same language, as I
      clearly perceive, since it first took its rise; but since the time when it
      parted off feeble at first from the Pelasgian race, setting forth from a
      small beginning it has increased to that great number of races which we
      see, <a href="#linknote-62" id="linknoteref-62" class="pginternal">62</a>
      and chiefly because many Barbarian races have been added to it besides.
      Moreover it is true, as I think, <a href="#linknote-6201" id="linknoteref-6201" class="pginternal">6201</a> of the Pelasgian
      race also, <a href="#linknote-63" id="linknoteref-63" class="pginternal">63</a>
      that so far as it remained Barbarian it never made any great increase.
    </p>
<p>
      59. Of these races then Croesus was informed that the Athenian was held
      subject and torn with faction by Peisistratos <a href="#linknote-64" id="linknoteref-64" class="pginternal">64</a> the son of Hippocrates,
      who then was despot of the Athenians. For to Hippocrates, when as a
      private citizen he went to view the Olympic games, a great marvel had
      occurred. After he had offered the sacrifice, the caldrons which were
      standing upon the hearth, full of pieces of flesh and of water, boiled
      without fire under them and ran over. And Chilon the Lacedemonian, who
      chanced to have been present and to have seen the marvel, advised
      Hippocrates first not to bring into his house a wife to bear him children,
      and secondly, if he happened to have one already, to dismiss her, and if
      he chanced to have a son, to disown him. When Chilon had thus recommended,
      Hippocrates, they say, was not willing to be persuaded, and so there was
      born to him afterwards this Peisistratos; who, when the Athenians of the
      shore <a href="#linknote-65" id="linknoteref-65" class="pginternal">65</a>
      were at feud with those of the plain, Megacles the son of Alcmaion being
      leader of the first faction, and Lycurgos the son of Aristolaïdes of that
      of the plain, aimed at the despotism for himself and gathered a third
      party. So then, after having collected supporters and called himself
      leader of the men of the mountain-lands, <a href="#linknote-66" id="linknoteref-66" class="pginternal">66</a> he contrived a device as
      follows:—he inflicted wounds upon himself and upon his mules, and
      then drove his car into the market-place, as if he had just escaped from
      his opponents, who, as he alleged, had desired to kill him when he was
      driving into the country: and he asked the commons that he might obtain
      some protection from them, for before this he had gained reputation in his
      command against the Megarians, during which he took Nisaia and performed
      other signal service. And the commons of the Athenians being deceived gave
      him those <a href="#linknote-67" id="linknoteref-67" class="pginternal">67</a>
      men chosen from the dwellers in the city who became not indeed the
      spear-men <a href="#linknote-68" id="linknoteref-68" class="pginternal">68</a>
      of Peisistratos but his club-men; for they followed behind him bearing
      wooden clubs. And these made insurrection with Peisistratos and obtained
      possession of the Acropolis. Then Peisistratos was ruler of the Athenians,
      not having disturbed the existing magistrates nor changed the ancient
      laws; but he administered the State under that constitution of things
      which was already established, ordering it fairly and well.
    </p>
<p>
      60. However, no long time after this the followers of Megacles and those
      of Lycurgos joined together and drove him forth. Thus Peisistratos had
      obtained possession of Athens for the first time, and thus he lost the
      power before he had it firmly rooted. But those who had driven out
      Peisistratos became afterwards at feud with one another again. And
      Megacles, harassed by the party strife, <a href="#linknote-69" id="linknoteref-69" class="pginternal">69</a> sent a message to
      Peisistratos asking whether he was willing to have his daughter to wife on
      condition of becoming despot. And Peisistratos having accepted the
      proposal and made an agreement on these terms, they contrived with a view
      to his return a device the most simple by far, as I think, that ever was
      practised, considering at least that it was devised at a time when the
      Hellenic race had been long marked off from the Barbarian as more skilful
      and further removed from foolish simplicity, and among the Athenians who
      are accounted the first of the Hellenes in ability. <a href="#linknote-70" id="linknoteref-70" class="pginternal">70</a> In the deme of Paiania
      there was a woman whose name was Phya, in height four cubits all but three
      fingers, <a href="#linknote-71" id="linknoteref-71" class="pginternal">71</a>
      and also fair of form. This woman they dressed in full armour and caused
      her to ascend a chariot and showed her the bearing in which she might best
      beseem her part, <a href="#linknote-72" id="linknoteref-72" class="pginternal">72</a> and so they drove to the city, having sent on
      heralds to run before them, who, when they arrived at the city, spoke that
      which had been commanded them, saying as follows: "O Athenians, receive
      with favour Peisistratos, whom Athene herself, honouring him most of all
      men, brings back to her Acropolis." So the heralds went about hither and
      thither saying this, and straightway there came to the demes in the
      country round a report that Athene was bringing Peisistratos back, while
      at the same time the men of the city, persuaded that the woman was the
      very goddess herself, were paying worship to the human creature and
      receiving Peisistratos.
    </p>
<p>
      61. So having received back the despotism in the manner which has been
      said, Peisistratos according to the agreement made with Megacles married
      the daughter of Megacles; but as he had already sons who were young men,
      and as the descendants of Alcmaion were said to be under a curse, <a href="#linknote-73" id="linknoteref-73" class="pginternal">73</a>
      therefore not desiring that children should be born to him from his
      newly-married wife, he had commerce with her not in the accustomed manner.
      And at first the woman kept this secret, but afterwards she told her
      mother, whether in answer to her inquiry or not I cannot tell; and the
      mother told her husband Megacles. He then was very indignant that he
      should be dishonoured by Peisistratos; and in his anger straightway he
      proceeded to compose his quarrel with the men of his faction. And when
      Peisistratos heard of that which was being done against himself, he
      departed wholly from the land and came to Eretria, where he took counsel
      together with his sons: and the advice of Hippias having prevailed, that
      they should endeavour to win back the despotism, they began to gather
      gifts of money from those States which owed them obligations for favours
      received: and many contributed great sums, but the Thebans surpassed the
      rest in the giving of money. Then, not to make the story long, time
      elapsed and at last everything was prepared for their return. For certain
      Argives came as mercenaries from the Peloponnesus, and a man of Naxos had
      come to them of his own motion, whose name was Lygdamis, and showed very
      great zeal in providing both money and men.
    </p>
<p>
      62. So starting from Eretria after the lapse of ten years <a href="#linknote-74" id="linknoteref-74" class="pginternal">74</a> they
      returned back; and in Attica the first place of which they took possession
      was Marathon. While they were encamping here, their partisans from the
      city came to them, and also others flowed in from the various demes, to
      whom despotic rule was more welcome than freedom. So these were gathering
      themselves together; but the Athenians in the city, so long as
      Peisistratos was collecting the money, and afterwards when he took
      possession of Marathon, made no account of it; but when they heard that he
      was marching from Marathon towards the city, then they went to the rescue
      against him. These then were going in full force to fight against the
      returning exiles, and the forces of Peisistratos, as they went towards the
      city starting from Marathon, met them just when they came to the temple of
      Athene Pallenis, and there encamped opposite to them. Then moved by divine
      guidance <a href="#linknote-75" id="linknoteref-75" class="pginternal">75</a>
      there came into the presence of Peisistratos Amphilytos the Arcarnanian,
      <a href="#linknote-76" id="linknoteref-76" class="pginternal">76</a> a
      soothsayer, who approaching him uttered an oracle in hexameter verse,
      saying thus:
    </p>
<pre>
 "But now the cast hath been made and the net hath been widely extended,
  And in the night the tunnies will dart through the moon-lighted waters."
</pre>
<p>
      63. This oracle he uttered to him being divinely inspired, and
      Peisistratos, having understood the oracle and having said that he
      accepted the prophecy which was uttered, led his army against the enemy.
      Now the Athenians from the city were just at that time occupied with the
      morning meal, and some of them after their meal with games of dice or with
      sleep; and the forces of Peisistratos fell upon the Athenians and put them
      to flight. Then as they fled, Peisistratos devised a very skilful counsel,
      to the end that the Athenians might not gather again into one body but
      might remain scattered abroad. He mounted his sons on horseback and sent
      them before him; and overtaking the fugitives they said that which was
      commanded them by Peisistratos, bidding them be of good cheer and that
      each man should depart to his own home.
    </p>
<p>
      64. Thus then the Athenians did, and so Peisistratos for the third time
      obtained possession of Athens, and he firmly rooted his despotism by many
      foreign mercenaries and by much revenue of money, coming partly from the
      land itself and partly from about the river Strymon, and also by taking as
      hostages the sons of those Athenians who had remained in the land and had
      not at once fled, and placing them in the hands of Naxos; for this also
      Peisistratos conquered by war and delivered into the charge of Lygdamis.
      Moreover besides this he cleansed the island of Delos in obedience to the
      oracles; and his cleansing was of the following kind:—so far as the
      view from the temple extended <a href="#linknote-77" id="linknoteref-77" class="pginternal">77</a> he dug up all the dead bodies which were buried
      in this part and removed them to another part of Delos. So Peisistratos
      was despot of the Athenians; but of the Athenians some had fallen in the
      battle, and others of them with the sons of Alcmaion were exiles from
      their native land.
    </p>
<p>
      65. Such was the condition of things which Croesus heard was prevailing
      among the Athenians during this time; but as to the Lacedemonians he heard
      that they had escaped from great evils and had now got the better of the
      Tegeans in the war. For when Leon and Hegesicles were kings of Sparta, the
      Lacedemonians, who had good success in all their other wars, suffered
      disaster in that alone which they waged against the men of Tegea. Moreover
      in the times before this they had the worst laws of almost all the
      Hellenes, both in matters which concerned themselves alone and also in
      that they had no dealings with strangers. And they made their change to a
      good constitution of laws thus:—Lycurgos, a man of the Spartans who
      was held in high repute, came to the Oracle at Delphi, and as he entered
      the sanctuary of the temple, straightway the Pythian prophetess said as
      follows:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Lo, thou art come, O Lycurgos, to this rich shrine of my temple,
  Loved thou by Zeus and by all who possess the abodes of Olympos.
  Whether to call thee a god, I doubt, in my voices prophetic,
  God or a man, but rather a god I think, O Lycurgos."

<p>
      66. Some say in addition to this that the Pythian prophetess also set
      forth to him the order of things which is now established for the
      Spartans; but the Lacedemonians themselves say that Lycurgos having become
      guardian of Leobotes his brother's son, who was king of the Spartans,
      brought in these things from Crete. For as soon as he became guardian, he
      changed all the prevailing laws, and took measures that they should not
      transgress his institutions: and after this Lycurgos established that
      which appertained to war, namely <i>Enomoties</i> and <i>Triecads</i> and
      Common Meals, <a href="#linknote-7701" id="linknoteref-7701" class="pginternal">7701</a> and in addition to this the Ephors and the
      Senate. Having changed thus, the Spartans had good laws; and to Lycurgos
      after he was dead they erected a temple, and they pay him great worship.
      So then, as might be supposed, with a fertile land and with no small
      number of men dwelling in it, they straightway shot up and became
      prosperous: and it was no longer sufficient for them to keep still; but
      presuming that they were superior in strength to the Arcadians, they
      consulted the Oracle at Delphi respecting conquest of the whole of
      Arcadia; and the Pythian prophetess gave answer thus:
    </p>
<pre>
 "The land of Arcadia thou askest; thou askest me much; I refuse it;
  Many there are in Arcadian land, stout men, eating acorns;
  These will prevent thee from this: but I am not grudging towards thee;
  Tegea beaten with sounding feet I will give thee to dance in,
  And a fair plain I will give thee to measure with line and divide it."
</pre>
<p>
      When the Lacedemonians heard report of this, they held off from the other
      Arcadians, and marched against the Tegeans with fetters in their hands,
      trusting to a deceitful <a href="#linknote-78" id="linknoteref-78" class="pginternal">78</a> oracle and expecting that they would make
      slaves of the men of Tegea. But having been worsted in the encounter,
      those of them who were taken alive worked wearing the fetters which they
      themselves brought with them and having "measured with line and divided"
      <a href="#linknote-79" id="linknoteref-79" class="pginternal">79</a>
      the plain of the Tegeans. And these fetters with which they had been bound
      were preserved even to my own time at Tegea, hanging about the temple of
      Athene Alea. <a href="#linknote-80" id="linknoteref-80" class="pginternal">80</a>
</p>
<p>
      67. In the former war then I say they struggled against the Tegeans
      continually with ill success; but in the time of Croesus and in the reign
      of Anaxandrides and Ariston at Lacedemon the Spartans had at length become
      victors in the war; and they became so in the following manner:—As
      they continued to be always worsted in the war by the men of Tegea, they
      sent messengers to consult the Oracle at Delphi and inquired what god they
      should propitiate in order to get the better of the men of Tegea in the
      war: and the Pythian prophetess made answer to them that they should bring
      into their land the bones of Orestes the son of Agamemnon. Then as they
      were not able to find the grave of Orestes, they sent men again to go to
      the god and to inquire about the spot where Orestes was laid: and when the
      messengers who were sent asked this, the prophetess said as follows:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Tegea there is, in Arcadian land, in a smooth place founded;
  Where there do blow two blasts by strong compulsion together;
  Stroke too there is and stroke in return, and trouble on trouble.
  There Agamemnon's son in the life-giving earth is reposing;
  Him if thou bring with thee home, of Tegea thou shalt be master." <a href="#linknote-81" id="linknoteref-81" class="pginternal">81</a>
</pre>
<p>
      When the Lacedemonians had heard this they were none the less far from
      finding it out, though they searched all places; until the time that
      Lichas, one of those Spartans who are called "Well-doers," <a href="#linknote-82" id="linknoteref-82" class="pginternal">82</a>
      discovered it. Now the "Well-doers" are of the citizens the eldest who are
      passing from the ranks of the "Horsemen," in each year five; and these are
      bound during that year in which they pass out from the "Horsemen," to
      allow themselves to be sent without ceasing to various places by the
      Spartan State.
    </p>
<p>
      68. Lichas then, being one of these, discovered it in Tegea by means both
      of fortune and ability. For as there were at that time dealings under
      truce with the men of Tegea, he had come to a forge there and was looking
      at iron being wrought; and he was in wonder as he saw that which was being
      done. The smith therefore, perceiving that he marvelled at it, ceased from
      his work and said: "Surely, thou stranger of Lacedemon, if thou hadst seen
      that which I once saw, thou wouldst have marvelled much, since now it
      falls out that thou dost marvel so greatly at the working of this iron;
      for I, desiring in this enclosure to make a well, lighted in my digging
      upon a coffin of seven cubits in length; and not believing that ever there
      had been men larger than those of the present day, I opened it, and I saw
      that the dead body was equal in length to the coffin: then after I had
      measured it, I filled in the earth over it again." He then thus told him
      of that which he had seen; and the other, having thought upon that which
      was told, conjectured that this was Orestes according to the saying of the
      Oracle, forming his conjecture in the following manner:—whereas he
      saw that the smith had two pairs of bellows, he concluded that these were
      the winds spoken of, and that the anvil and the hammer were the stroke and
      the stroke in return, and that the iron which was being wrought was the
      trouble laid upon trouble, making comparison by the thought that iron has
      been discovered for the evil of mankind. Having thus conjectured he came
      back to Sparta and declared the whole matter to the Lacedemonians; and
      they brought a charge against him on a fictitious pretext and drove him
      out into exile. <a href="#linknote-83" id="linknoteref-83" class="pginternal">83</a> So having come to Tegea, he told the smith of
      his evil fortune and endeavoured to hire from him the enclosure, but at
      first he would not allow him to have it: at length however Lichas
      persuaded him and he took up his abode there; and he dug up the grave and
      gathered together the bones and went with them away to Sparta. From that
      time, whenever they made trial of one another, the Lacedemonians had much
      the advantage in the war; and by now they had subdued to themselves the
      greater part of Peloponnesus besides.
    </p>
<p>
      69. Croesus accordingly being informed of all these things was sending
      messengers to Sparta with gifts in their hands to ask for an alliance,
      having commanded them what they ought to say: and they when they came
      said: "Croesus king of the Lydians and also of other nations sent us
      hither and saith as follows: O Lacedemonians, whereas the god by an oracle
      bade me join with myself the Hellene as a friend, therefore, since I am
      informed that ye are the chiefs of Hellas, I invite you according to the
      oracle, desiring to be your friend and your ally apart from all guile and
      deceit." Thus did Croesus announce to the Lacedemonians through his
      messengers; and the Lacedemonians, who themselves also had heard of the
      oracle given to Croesus, were pleased at the coming of the Lydians and
      exchanged oaths of friendship and alliance: for they were bound to Croesus
      also by some services rendered to them even before this time; since the
      Lacedemonians had sent to Sardis and were buying gold there with purpose
      of using it for the image of Apollo which is now set up on Mount Thornax
      in the Lacedemonian land; and Croesus, when they desired to buy it, gave
      it them as a gift.
    </p>
<p>
      70. For this reason therefore the Lacedemonians accepted the alliance, and
      also because he chose them as his friends, preferring them to all the
      other Hellenes. And not only were they ready themselves when he made his
      offer, but they caused a mixing-bowl to be made of bronze, covered outside
      with figures round the rim and of such a size as to hold three hundred
      amphors, <a href="#linknote-84" id="linknoteref-84" class="pginternal">84</a>
      and this they conveyed, desiring to give it as a gift in return to
      Croesus. This bowl never came to Sardis for reasons of which two accounts
      are given as follows:—The Lacedemonians say that when the bowl was
      on its way to Sardis and came opposite the land of Samos, the men of Samos
      having heard of it sailed out with ships of war and took it away; but the
      Samians themselves say that the Lacedemonians who were conveying the bowl,
      finding that they were too late and hearing that Sardis had been taken and
      Croesus was a prisoner, sold the bowl in Samos, and certain private
      persons bought it and dedicated it as a votive offering in the temple of
      Hera; and probably those who had sold it would say when they returned to
      Sparta that it had been taken from them by the Samians.
    </p>
<p>
      71. Thus then it happened about the mixing-bowl: but meanwhile Croesus,
      mistaking the meaning of the oracle, was making a march into Cappadokia,
      expecting to overthrow Cyrus and the power of the Persians: and while
      Croesus was preparing to march against the Persians, one of the Lydians,
      who even before this time was thought to be a wise man but in consequence
      of this opinion got a very great name for wisdom among the Lydians, had
      advised Croesus as follows (the name of the man was Sandanis):—"O
      king, thou art preparing to march against men who wear breeches of
      leather, and the rest of their clothing is of leather also; and they eat
      food not such as they desire but such as they can obtain, dwelling in a
      land which is rugged; and moreover they make no use of wine but drink
      water; and no figs have they for dessert, nor any other good thing. On the
      one hand, if thou shalt overcome them, what wilt thou take away from them,
      seeing they have nothing? and on the other hand, if thou shalt be
      overcome, consider how many good things thou wilt lose; for once having
      tasted our good things, they will cling to them fast and it will not be
      possible to drive them away. I for my own part feel gratitude to the gods
      that they do not put it into the minds of the Persians to march against
      the Lydians." Thus he spoke not persuading Croesus: for it is true indeed
      that the Persians before they subdued the Lydians had no luxury nor any
      good thing.
    </p>
<p>
      72. Now the Cappadokians are called by the Hellenes Syrians; <a href="#linknote-85" id="linknoteref-85" class="pginternal">85</a> and
      these Syrians, before the Persians had rule, were subjects of the Medes,
      but at this time they were subjects of Cyrus. For the boundary between the
      Median empire and the Lydian was the river Halys; and this flows from the
      mountain-land of Armenia through the Kilikians, and afterwards, as it
      flows, it has the Matienians on the right hand and the Phrygians on the
      other side; then passing by these and flowing up towards the North Wind,
      it bounds on the one side the Cappadokian Syrians and on the left hand the
      Paphlagonians. Thus the river Halys cuts off from the rest almost all the
      lower parts of Asia by a line extending from the sea that is opposite
      Cyprus to the Euxine. And this tract is the neck of the whole peninsula,
      the distance of the journey being such that five days are spent on the way
      by a man without encumbrance. <a href="#linknote-86" id="linknoteref-86" class="pginternal">86</a>
</p>
<p>
      73. Now for the following reasons Croesus was marching into Cappadokia:—first
      because he desired to acquire the land in addition to his own possessions,
      and then especially because he had confidence in the oracle and wished to
      take vengeance on Cyrus for Astyages. For Cyrus the son of Cambyses had
      conquered Astyages and was keeping him in captivity, who was brother by
      marriage to Croesus and king of the Medes: and he had become the brother
      by marriage of Croesus in this manner:—A horde of the nomad
      Scythians at feud with the rest withdrew and sought refuge in the land of
      the Medes: and at this time the ruler of the Medes was Kyaxares the son of
      Phraortes, the son of Deïokes, who at first dealt well with these
      Scythians, being suppliants for his protection; and esteeming them very
      highly he delivered boys to them to learn their speech and the art of
      shooting with the bow. Then time went by, and the Scythians used to go out
      continually to the chase and always brought back something; till once it
      happened that they took nothing, and when they returned with empty hands
      Kyaxares (being, as he showed on this occasion, not of an eminently good
      disposition <a href="#linknote-87" id="linknoteref-87" class="pginternal">87</a>) dealt with them very harshly and used insult
      towards them. And they, when they had received this treatment from
      Kyaxares, considering that they had suffered indignity, planned to kill
      and to cut up one of the boys who were being instructed among them, and
      having dressed his flesh as they had been wont to dress the wild animals,
      to bear it to Kyaxares and give it to him, pretending that it was game
      taken in hunting; and when they had given it, their design was to make
      their way as quickly as possible to Alyattes the son of Sadyattes at
      Sardis. This then was done; and Kyaxares with the guests who ate at his
      table tasted of that meat, and the Scythians having so done became
      suppliants for the protection of Alyattes.
    </p>
<p>
      74. After this, seeing that Alyattes would not give up the Scythians when
      Kyaxares demanded them, there had arisen war between the Lydians and the
      Medes lasting five years; in which years the Medes often discomfited the
      Lydians and the Lydians often discomfited the Medes (and among others they
      fought also a battle by night): <a href="#linknote-88" id="linknoteref-88" class="pginternal">88</a> and as they still carried
      on the war with equally balanced fortune, in the sixth year a battle took
      place in which it happened, when the fight had begun, that suddenly the
      day became night. And this change of the day Thales the Milesian had
      foretold to the Ionians laying down as a limit this very year in which the
      change took place. The Lydians however and the Medes, when they saw that
      it had become night instead of day, ceased from their fighting and were
      much more eager both of them that peace should be made between them. And
      they who brought about the peace between them were Syennesis the Kilikian
      and Labynetos the Babylonian: <a href="#linknote-89" id="linknoteref-89" class="pginternal">89</a> these were they who urged also the taking of
      the oath by them, and they brought about an interchange of marriages; for
      they decided that Alyattes should give his daughter Aryenis to Astyages
      the son of Kyaxares, seeing that without the compulsion of a strong tie
      agreements are apt not to hold strongly together. Now these nations
      observe the same ceremonies in taking oaths as the Hellenes, and in
      addition to them they make incision into the skin of their arms, and then
      lick up the blood each of the other.
    </p>
<p>
      75. This Astyages then, being his mother's father, Cyrus had conquered and
      made prisoner for a reason which I shall declare in the history which
      comes after. <a href="#linknote-90" id="linknoteref-90" class="pginternal">90</a> This then was the complaint which Croesus had
      against Cyrus when he sent to the Oracles to ask if he should march
      against the Persians; and when a deceitful answer had come back to him, he
      marched into the dominion of the Persians, supposing that the answer was
      favourable to himself. And when Croesus came to the river Halys, then,
      according to my account, he passed his army across by the bridges which
      there were; but, according to the account which prevails among the
      Hellenes, Thales the Milesian enabled him to pass his army across. For,
      say they, when Croesus was at a loss how his army should pass over the
      river (since, they add, there were not yet at that time the bridges which
      now there are), Thales being present in the army caused the river, which
      flowed then on the left hand of the army, to flow partly also on the
      right; and he did it thus:—beginning above the camp he proceeded to
      dig a deep channel, directing it in the form of a crescent moon, so that
      the river might take the camp there pitched in the rear, being turned
      aside from its ancient course by this way along the channel, and
      afterwards passing by the camp might fall again into its ancient course;
      so that as soon as the river was thus parted in two it became fordable by
      both branches: and some say even that the ancient course of the river was
      altogether dried up. But this tale I do not admit as true, for how then
      did they pass over the river as they went back?
    </p>
<p>
      76. And Croesus, when he had passed over with his army, came to that place
      in Cappadokia which is called Pteria (now Pteria is the strongest place in
      this country, and is situated somewhere about in a line with the city of
      Sinope <a href="#linknote-91" id="linknoteref-91" class="pginternal">91</a>
      on the Euxine). Here he encamped and ravaged the fields of the Syrians.
      Moreover he took the city of the Pterians, and sold the people into
      slavery, and he took also all the towns that lay about it; and the
      Syrians, who were not guilty of any wrong, he forced to remove from their
      homes. <a href="#linknote-92" id="linknoteref-92" class="pginternal">92</a>
      Meanwhile Cyrus, having gathered his own forces and having taken up in
      addition to them all who dwelt in the region between, was coming to meet
      Croesus. Before he began however to lead forth his army, he had sent
      heralds to the Ionians and tried to induce them to revolt from Croesus;
      but the Ionians would not do as he said. Then when Cyrus was come and had
      encamped over against Croesus, they made trial of one another by force of
      arms in the land of Pteria: and after hard fighting, when many had fallen
      on both sides, at length, night having come on, they parted from one the
      other with no victory on either side.
    </p>
<p>
      77. Thus the two armies contended with one another: and Croesus being ill
      satisfied with his own army in respect of number (for the army which he
      had when he fought was far smaller than that of Cyrus), being dissatisfied
      with it I say on this account, as Cyrus did not attempt to advance against
      him on the following day, marched back to Sardis, having it in his mind to
      call the Egyptians to his help according to the oath which they had taken
      (for he had made an alliance with Amasis king of Egypt before he made the
      alliance with the Lacedemonians), and to summon the Babylonians as well
      (for with these also an alliance had been concluded by him, Labynetos <a href="#linknote-93" id="linknoteref-93" class="pginternal">93</a> being
      at that time ruler of the Babylonians), and moreover to send a message to
      the Lacedemonians bidding them appear at a fixed time: and then after he
      had got all these together and had gathered his own army, his design was
      to let the winter go by and at the coming of spring to march against the
      Persians. So with these thoughts in his mind, as soon as he came to Sardis
      he proceeded to send heralds to his several allies to give them notice
      that by the fifth month from that time they should assemble at Sardis: but
      the army which he had with him and which had fought with the Persians, an
      army which consisted of mercenary troops, <a href="#linknote-94" id="linknoteref-94" class="pginternal">94</a> he let go and disbanded
      altogether, never expecting that Cyrus, after having contended against him
      with such even fortune, would after all march upon Sardis.
    </p>
<p>
      78. When Croesus had these plans in his mind, the suburb of the city
      became of a sudden all full of serpents; and when these had appeared, the
      horses leaving off to feed in their pastures came constantly thither and
      devoured them. When Croesus saw this he deemed it to be a portent, as
      indeed it was: and forthwith he despatched messengers to the dwelling of
      the Telmessians, who interpret omens: and the messengers who were sent to
      consult arrived there and learnt from the Telmessians what the portent
      meant to signify, but they did not succeed in reporting the answer to
      Croesus, for before they sailed back to Sardis Croesus had been taken
      prisoner. The Telmessians however gave decision thus: that an army
      speaking a foreign tongue was to be looked for by Croesus to invade his
      land, and that this when it came would subdue the native inhabitants; for
      they said that the serpent was born of the soil, while the horse was an
      enemy and a stranger. The men of Telmessos thus made answer to Croesus
      after he was already taken prisoner, not knowing as yet anything of the
      things which had happened to Sardis and to Croesus himself.
    </p>
<p>
      79. Cyrus, however, so soon as Croesus marched away after the battle which
      had been fought in Pteria, having learnt that Croesus meant after he had
      marched away to disband his army, took counsel with himself and concluded
      that it was good for him to march as quickly as possible to Sardis, before
      the power of the Lydians should be again gathered together. So when he had
      resolved upon this, he did it without delay: for he marched his army into
      Lydia with such speed that he was himself the first to announce his coming
      to Croesus. Then Croesus, although he had come to a great strait, since
      his affairs had fallen out altogether contrary to his own expectation, yet
      proceeded to lead forth the Lydians into battle. Now there was at this
      time no nation in Asia more courageous or more stout in battle than the
      Lydian; and they fought on horseback carrying long spears, the men being
      excellent in horsemanship.
    </p>
<p>
      80. So when the armies had met in that plain which is in front of the city
      of Sardis,—a plain wide and open, through which flow rivers (and
      especially the river Hyllos) all rushing down to join the largest called
      Hermos, which flows from the mountain sacred to the Mother surnamed "of
      Dindymos" <a href="#linknote-95" id="linknoteref-95" class="pginternal">95</a>
      and runs out into the sea by the city of Phocaia,—then Cyrus, when
      he saw the Lydians being arrayed for battle, fearing their horsemen, did
      on the suggestion of Harpagos a Mede as follows:—all the camels
      which were in the train of his army carrying provisions and baggage he
      gathered together, and he took off their burdens and set men upon them
      provided with the equipment of cavalry: and having thus furnished them
      forth he appointed them to go in front of the rest of the army towards the
      horsemen of Croesus; and after the camel-troop he ordered the infantry to
      follow; and behind the infantry he placed his whole force of cavalry. Then
      when all his men had been placed in their several positions, he charged
      them to spare none of the other Lydians, slaying all who might come in
      their way, but Croesus himself they were not to slay, not even if he
      should make resistance when he was captured. Such was his charge: and he
      set the camels opposite the horsemen for this reason,—because the
      horse has a fear of the camel and cannot endure either to see his form or
      to scent his smell: for this reason then the trick had been devised, in
      order that the cavalry of Croesus might be useless, that very force
      wherewith the Lydian king was expecting most to shine. And as they were
      coming together to the battle, so soon as the horses scented the camels
      and saw them they turned away back, and the hopes of Croesus were at once
      brought to nought. The Lydians however for their part did not upon that
      act as cowards, but when they perceived what was coming to pass they leapt
      from their horses and fought with the Persians on foot. At length,
      however, when many had fallen on either side, the Lydians turned to
      flight; and having been driven within the wall of their fortress they were
      besieged by the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      81. By these then a siege had been established: but Croesus, supposing
      that the siege would last a long time, proceeded to send from the fortress
      other messengers to his allies. For the former messengers were sent round
      to give notice that they should assemble at Sardis by the fifth month, but
      these he was sending out to ask them to come to his assistance as quickly
      as possible, because Croesus was being besieged.
    </p>
<p>
      82. So then in sending to his other allies he sent also to Lacedemon. But
      these too, the Spartans I mean, had themselves at this very time (for so
      it had fallen out) a quarrel in hand with the Argives about the district
      called Thyrea. For this Thyrea, being part of the Argive possessions, the
      Lacedemonians had cut off and taken for themselves. Now the whole region
      towards the west extending as far down as Malea <a href="#linknote-96" id="linknoteref-96" class="pginternal">96</a> was then possessed by the
      Argives, both the parts situated on the mainland and also the island of
      Kythera with the other islands. And when the Argives had come to the
      rescue to save their territory from being cut off from them, then the two
      sides came to a parley together and agreed that three hundred should fight
      of each side, and whichever side had the better in the fight that nation
      should possess the disputed land: they agreed moreover that the main body
      of each army should withdraw to their own country, and not stand by while
      the contest was fought, for fear lest, if the armies were present, one
      side seeing their countrymen suffering defeat should come up to their
      support. Having made this agreement they withdrew; and chosen men of both
      sides were left behind and engaged in fight with one another. So they
      fought and proved themselves to be equally matched; and there were left at
      last of six hundred men three, on the side of the Argives Alkenor and
      Chromios, and on the side of the Lacedemonians Othryades: these were left
      alive when night came on. So then the two men of the Argives, supposing
      that they were the victors, set off to run to Argos, but the Lacedemonian
      Othryades, after having stripped the corpses of the Argives and carried
      their arms to his own camp, remained in his place. On the next day both
      the two sides came thither to inquire about the result; and for some time
      both claimed the victory for themselves, the one side saying that of them
      more had remained alive, and the others declaring that these had fled
      away, whereas their own man had stood his ground and had stripped the
      corpses of the other party: and at length by reason of this dispute they
      fell upon one another and began to fight; and after many had fallen on
      both sides, the Lacedemonians were the victors. The Argives then cut their
      hair short, whereas formerly they were compelled by law to wear it long,
      and they made a law with a curse attached to it, that from that time forth
      no man of the Argives should grow the hair long nor their women wear
      ornaments of gold, until they should have won back Thyrea. The
      Lacedemonians however laid down for themselves the opposite law to this,
      namely that they should wear long hair from that time forward, whereas
      before that time they had not their hair long. And they say that the one
      man who was left alive of the three hundred, namely Othryades, being
      ashamed to return to Sparta when all his comrades had been slain, slew
      himself there in Thyrea.
    </p>
<p>
      83. Such was the condition of things at Sparta when the herald from Sardis
      arrived asking them to come to the assistance of Croesus, who was being
      besieged. And they notwithstanding their own difficulties, as soon as they
      heard the news from the herald, were eager to go to his assistance; but
      when they had completed their preparations and their ships were ready,
      there came another message reporting that the fortress of the Lydians had
      been taken and that Croesus had been made prisoner. Then (and not before)
      they ceased from their efforts, being grieved at the event as at a great
      calamity.
    </p>
<p>
      84. Now the taking of Sardis came about as follows:—When the
      fourteenth day came after Croesus began to be besieged, Cyrus made
      proclamation to his army, sending horsemen round to the several parts of
      it, that he would give gifts to the man who should first scale the wall.
      After this the army made an attempt; and when it failed, then after all
      the rest had ceased from the attack, a certain Mardian whose name was
      Hyroiades made an attempt to approach on that side of the citadel where no
      guard had been set; for they had no fear that it would ever be taken from
      that side, seeing that here the citadel is precipitous and unassailable.
      To this part of the wall alone Meles also, who formerly was king of
      Sardis, did not carry round the lion which his concubine bore to him, the
      Telmessians having given decision that if the lion should be carried round
      the wall, Sardis should be safe from capture: and Meles having carried it
      round the rest of the wall, that is to say those parts of the citadel
      where the fortress was open to attack, passed over this part as being
      unassailable and precipitous: now this is a part of the city which is
      turned towards Tmolos. So then this <a href="#linknote-97" id="linknoteref-97" class="pginternal">97</a> Mardian Hyroiades, having
      seen on the day before how one of the Lydians had descended on that side
      of the citadel to recover his helmet which had rolled down from above, and
      had picked it up, took thought and cast the matter about in his own mind.
      Then he himself <a href="#linknote-98" id="linknoteref-98" class="pginternal">98</a> ascended first, and after him came up others of
      the Persians, and many having thus made approach, Sardis was finally taken
      and the whole city was given up to plunder.
    </p>
<p>
      85. Meanwhile to Croesus himself it happened thus:—He had a son, of
      whom I made mention before, who was of good disposition enough but
      deprived of speech. Now in his former time of prosperity Croesus had done
      everything that was possible for him, and besides other things which he
      devised he had also sent messengers to Delphi to inquire concerning him.
      And the Pythian prophetess spoke to him thus:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Lydian, master of many, much blind to destiny, Croesus,
  Do not desire to hear in thy halls that voice which is prayed for,
  Voice of thy son; much better if this from thee were removèd,
  Since he shall first utter speech in an evil day of misfortune."
</pre>
<p>
      Now when the fortress was being taken, one of the Persians was about to
      slay Croesus taking him for another; and Croesus for his part, seeing him
      coming on, cared nothing for it because of the misfortune which was upon
      him, and to him it was indifferent that he should be slain by the stroke;
      but this voiceless son, when he saw the Persian coming on, by reason of
      terror and affliction burst the bonds of his utterance and said: "Man,
      slay not Croesus." This son, I say, uttered voice then first of all, but
      after this he continued to use speech for the whole time of his life.
    </p>
<p>
      86. The Persians then had obtained possession of Sardis and had taken
      Croesus himself prisoner, after he had reigned fourteen years and had been
      besieged fourteen days, having fulfilled the oracle in that he had brought
      to an end his own great empire. So the Persians having taken him brought
      him into the presence of Cyrus: and he piled up a great pyre and caused
      Croesus to go up upon it bound in fetters, and along with him twice seven
      sons of Lydians, whether it was that he meant to dedicate this offering as
      first-fruits of his victory to some god, or whether he desired to fulfil a
      vow, or else had heard that Croesus was a god-fearing man and so caused
      him to go up on the pyre because he wished to know if any one of the
      divine powers would save him, so that he should not be burnt alive. He,
      they say, did this; but to Croesus as he stood upon the pyre there came,
      although he was in such evil case, a memory of the saying of Solon, how he
      had said with divine inspiration that no one of the living might be called
      happy. And when this thought came into his mind, they say that he sighed
      deeply <a href="#linknote-99" id="linknoteref-99" class="pginternal">99</a>
      and groaned aloud, having been for long silent, and three times he uttered
      the name of Solon. Hearing this, Cyrus bade the interpreters ask Croesus
      who was this person on whom he called; and they came near and asked. And
      Croesus for a time, it is said, kept silence when he was asked this, but
      afterwards being pressed he said: "One whom more than much wealth I should
      have desired to have speech with all monarchs." Then, since his words were
      of doubtful import, they asked again of that which he said; and as they
      were urgent with him and gave him no peace, he told how once Solon an
      Athenian had come, and having inspected all his wealth had made light of
      it, with such and such words; and how all had turned out for him according
      as Solon had said, not speaking at all especially with a view to Croesus
      himself, but with a view to the whole human race and especially those who
      seem to themselves to be happy men. And while Croesus related these
      things, already the pyre was lighted and the edges of it round about were
      burning. Then they say that Cyrus, hearing from the interpreters what
      Croesus had said, changed his purpose and considered that he himself also
      was but a man, and that he was delivering another man, who had been not
      inferior to himself in felicity, alive to the fire; and moreover he feared
      the requital, and reflected that there was nothing of that which men
      possessed which was secure; therefore, they say, he ordered them to
      extinguish as quickly as possible the fire that was burning, and to bring
      down Croesus and those who were with him from the pyre; and they using
      endeavours were not able now to get the mastery of the flames.
    </p>
<p>
      87. Then it is related by the Lydians that Croesus, having learned how
      Cyrus had changed his mind, and seeing that every one was trying to put
      out the fire but that they were no longer able to check it, cried aloud
      entreating Apollo that if any gift had ever been given by him which had
      been acceptable to the god, he would come to his aid and rescue him from
      the evil which was now upon him. So he with tears entreated the god, and
      suddenly, they say, after clear sky and calm weather clouds gathered and a
      storm burst, and it rained with a very violent shower, and the pyre was
      extinguished. Then Cyrus, having perceived that Croesus was a lover of the
      gods and a good man, caused him to be brought down from the pyre and asked
      him as follows: "Croesus, tell me who of all men was it who persuaded thee
      to march upon my land and so to become an enemy to me instead of a
      friend?" and he said: "O king, I did this to thy felicity and to my own
      misfortune, and the causer of this was the god of the Hellenes, who
      incited me to march with my army. For no one is so senseless as to choose
      of his own will war rather peace, since in peace the sons bury their
      fathers, but in war the fathers bury their sons. But it was pleasing, I
      suppose, to the divine powers that these things should come to pass thus."
    </p>
<p>
      88. So he spoke, and Cyrus loosed his bonds and caused him to sit near
      himself and paid to him much regard, and he marvelled both himself and all
      who were about him at the sight of Croesus. And Croesus wrapt in thought
      was silent; but after a time, turning round and seeing the Persians
      plundering the city of the Lydians, he said: "O king, must I say to thee
      that which I chance to have in my thought, or must I keep silent in this
      my present fortune?" Then Cyrus bade him say boldly whatsoever he desired;
      and he asked him saying: "What is the business that this great multitude
      of men is doing with so much eagerness?" and he said: "They are plundering
      thy city and carrying away thy wealth." And Croesus answered: "Neither is
      it my city that they are plundering nor my wealth which they are carrying
      away; for I have no longer any property in these things: but it is thy
      wealth that they are carrying and driving away."
    </p>
<p>
      89. And Cyrus was concerned by that which Croesus had said, and he caused
      all the rest to withdraw and asked Croesus what he discerned for his
      advantage as regards that which was being done; and he said: "Since the
      gods gave me to thee as a slave, I think it right if I discern anything
      more than others to signify it to thee. The Persians, who are by nature
      unruly, <a href="#linknote-100" id="linknoteref-100" class="pginternal">100</a>
      are without wealth: if therefore thou shalt suffer them to carry off in
      plunder great wealth and to take possession of it, then it is to be looked
      for that thou wilt experience this result, thou must expect namely that
      whosoever gets possession of the largest share will make insurrection
      against thee. Now therefore, if that which I say is pleasing to thee, do
      this:—set spearmen of thy guard to watch at all the gates, and let
      these take away the things, and say to the men who were bearing them out
      of the city that they must first be tithed for Zeus: and thus thou on the
      one hand wilt not be hated by them for taking away the things by force,
      and they on the other will willingly let the things go, <a href="#linknote-101" id="linknoteref-101" class="pginternal">101</a>
      acknowledging within themselves that thou art doing that which is just."
    </p>
<p>
      90. Hearing this, Cyrus was above measure pleased, because he thought that
      Croesus advised well; and he commended him much and enjoined the spearmen
      of his guard to perform that which Croesus had advised: and after that he
      spoke to Croesus thus: "Croesus, since thou art prepared, like a king as
      thou art, to do good deeds and speak good words, therefore ask me for a
      gift, whatsoever thou desirest to be given thee forthwith." And he said:
      "Master, thou wilt most do me a pleasure if thou wilt permit me to send to
      the god of the Hellenes, whom I honoured most of all gods, these fetters,
      and to ask him whether it is accounted by him right to deceive those who
      do well to him." Then Cyrus asked him what accusation he made against the
      god, that he thus requested; and Croesus repeated to him all that had been
      in his mind, and the answers of the Oracles, and especially the votive
      offerings, and how he had been incited by the prophecy to march upon the
      Persians: and thus speaking he came back again to the request that it
      might be permitted to him to make this reproach <a href="#linknote-102" id="linknoteref-102" class="pginternal">102</a> against the god. And
      Cyrus laughed and said: "Not this only shalt thou obtain from me, Croesus,
      but also whatsoever thou mayst desire of me at any time." Hearing this
      Croesus sent certain of the Lydians to Delphi, enjoining them to lay the
      fetters upon the threshold of the temple and to ask the god whether he
      felt no shame that he had incited Croesus by his prophecies to march upon
      the Persians, persuading him that he should bring to an end the empire of
      Cyrus, seeing that these were the first-fruits of spoil which he had won
      from it,—at the same time displaying the fetters. This they were to
      ask, and moreover also whether it was thought right by the gods of the
      Hellenes to practice ingratitude.
    </p>
<p>
      91. When the Lydians came and repeated that which they were enjoined to
      say, it is related that the Pythian prophetess spoke as follows: "The
      fated destiny it is impossible even for a god to escape. And Croesus paid
      the debt due for the sin of his fifth ancestor, who being one of the
      spearmen of the Heracleidai followed the treacherous device of a woman,
      and having slain his master took possession of his royal dignity, which
      belonged not to him of right. And although Loxias eagerly desired that the
      calamity of Sardis might come upon the sons of Croesus and not upon
      Croesus himself, it was not possible for him to draw the Destinies aside
      from their course; but so much as these granted he brought to pass, and
      gave it as a gift to Croesus: for he put off the taking of Sardis by three
      years; and let Croesus be assured that he was taken prisoner later by
      these years than the fated time: moreover secondly, he assisted him when
      he was about to be burnt. And as to the oracle which was given, Croesus
      finds fault with good ground: for Loxias told him beforehand that if he
      should march upon the Persians he should destroy a great empire: and he
      upon hearing this, if he wished to take counsel well, ought to have sent
      and asked further whether the god meant his own empire or that of Cyrus:
      but as he did not comprehend that which was uttered and did not ask again,
      let him pronounce himself to be the cause of that which followed. To him
      also <a href="#linknote-103" id="linknoteref-103" class="pginternal">103</a>
      when he consulted the Oracle for the last time Loxias said that which he
      said concerning a mule; but this also he failed to comprehend: for Cyrus
      was in fact this mule, seeing that he was born of parents who were of two
      different races, his mother being of nobler descent and his father of less
      noble: for she was a Median woman, daughter of Astyages and king of the
      Medes, but he was a Persian, one of a race subject to the Medes, and being
      inferior in all respects he was the husband of one who was his royal
      mistress." Thus the Pythian prophetess replied to the Lydians, and they
      brought the answer back to Sardis and repeated it to Croesus; and he, when
      he heard it, acknowledged that the fault was his own and not that of the
      god. With regard then to the empire of Croesus and the first conquest of
      Ionia, it happened thus.
    </p>
<p>
      92. Now there are in Hellas many other votive offerings made by Croesus
      and not only those which have been mentioned: for first at Thebes of the
      Boeotians there is a tripod of gold, which he dedicated to the Ismenian
      Apollo; then at Ephesos there are the golden cows and the greater number
      of the pillars of the temple; and in the temple of Athene Pronaia at
      Delphi a large golden shield. These were still remaining down to my own
      time, but others of his votive offerings have perished: and the votive
      offerings of Croesus at Branchidai of the Milesians were, as I am told,
      equal in weight and similar to those at Delphi. Now those which he sent to
      Delphi and to the temple of Amphiaraos he dedicated of his own goods and
      as first-fruits of the wealth inherited from his father; but the other
      offerings were made of the substance of a man who was his foe, who before
      Croesus became king had been factious against him and had joined in
      endeavouring to make Pantaleon ruler of the Lydians. Now Pantaleon was a
      son of Alyattes and a brother of Croesus, but not by the same mother, for
      Croesus was born to Alyattes of a Carian woman, but Pantaleon of an
      Ionian. And when Croesus had gained possession of the kingdom by the gift
      of his father, he put to death the man who opposed him, drawing him upon
      the carding-comb; and his property, which even before that time he had
      vowed to dedicate, he then offered in the manner mentioned to those
      shrines which have been named. About his votive offerings let it suffice
      to have said so much.
    </p>
<p>
      93. Of marvels to be recorded the land of Lydia has no great store as
      compared with other lands, <a href="#linknote-104" id="linknoteref-104" class="pginternal">104</a> excepting the gold-dust which is carried down
      from Tmolos; but one work it has to show which is larger far than any
      other except only those in Egypt and Babylon: for there is there the
      sepulchral monument of Alyattes the father of Croesus, of which the base
      is made of larger stones and the rest of the monument is of earth piled
      up. And this was built by contributions of those who practised trade and
      of the artisans and the girls who plied their traffic there; and still
      there existed to my own time boundary-stones five in number erected upon
      the monument above, on which were carved inscriptions telling how much of
      the work was done by each class; and upon measurement it was found that
      the work of the girls was the greatest in amount. For the daughters of the
      common people in Lydia practice prostitution one and all, to gather for
      themselves dowries, continuing this until the time when they marry; and
      the girls give themselves away in marriage. Now the circuit of the
      monument is six furlongs and two hundred feet, <a href="#linknote-105" id="linknoteref-105" class="pginternal">105</a> and the breadth is
      thirteen hundred feet. <a href="#linknote-106" id="linknoteref-106" class="pginternal">106</a> And adjoining the monument is a great lake,
      which the Lydians say has a never-failing supply of water, and it is
      called the lake of Gyges. <a href="#linknote-107" id="linknoteref-107" class="pginternal">107</a> Such is the nature of this monument.
    </p>
<p>
      94. Now the Lydians have very nearly the same customs as the Hellenes,
      with the exception that they prostitute their female children; and they
      were the first of men, so far as we know, who struck and used coin of gold
      or silver; and also they were the first retail-traders. And the Lydians
      themselves say that the games which are now in use among them and among
      the Hellenes were also their invention. These they say were invented among
      them at the same time as they colonised Tyrsenia, <a href="#linknote-108" id="linknoteref-108" class="pginternal">108</a> and this is the
      account they give of them:—In the reign of Atys the son of Manes
      their king there came to be a grievous dearth over the whole of Lydia; and
      the Lydians for a time continued to endure it, but afterwards, as it did
      not cease, they sought for remedies; and one devised one thing and another
      of them devised another thing. And then were discovered, they say, the
      ways of playing with the dice and the knucklebones and the ball, and all
      the other games excepting draughts (for the discovery of this last is not
      claimed by the Lydians). These games they invented as a resource against
      the famine, and thus they used to do:—on one of the days they would
      play games all the time in order that they might not feel the want of
      food, and on the next they ceased from their games and had food: and thus
      they went on for eighteen years. As however the evil did not slacken but
      pressed upon them ever more and more, therefore their king divided the
      whole Lydian people into two parts, and he appointed by lot one part to
      remain and the other to go forth from the land; and the king appointed
      himself to be over that one of the parts which had the lot to stay in the
      land, and his son to be over that which was departing; and the name of his
      son was Tyrsenos. So the one party of them, having obtained the lot to go
      forth from the land, went down to the sea at Smyrna and built ships for
      themselves, wherein they placed all the movable goods which they had and
      sailed away to seek for means of living and a land to dwell in; until
      after passing by many nations they came at last to the land of the
      Ombricans, <a href="#linknote-109" id="linknoteref-109" class="pginternal">109</a> and there they founded cities and dwell up to
      the present time: and changing their name they were called after the
      king's son who led them out from home, not Lydians but Tyrsenians, taking
      the name from him.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      The Lydians then had been made subject to the Persians as I say:
    </p>
<p>
      95, and after this our history proceeds to inquire about Cyrus, who he was
      that destroyed the empire of Croesus, and about the Persians, in what
      manner they obtained the lead of Asia. Following then the report of some
      of the Persians,—those I mean who do not desire to glorify the
      history of Cyrus but to speak that which is in fact true,—according
      to their report, I say, I shall write; but I could set forth also the
      other forms of the story in three several ways.
    </p>
<p>
      The Assyrians ruled Upper Asia <a href="#linknote-110" id="linknoteref-110" class="pginternal">110</a> for five hundred and
      twenty years, and from them the Medes were the first who made revolt.
      These having fought for their freedom with the Assyrians proved themselves
      good men, and thus they pushed off the yoke of slavery from themselves and
      were set free; and after them the other nations also did the same as the
      Medes: and when all on the continent were thus independent, they returned
      again to despotic rule as follows:—
    </p>
<p>
      96. There appeared among the Medes a man of great ability whose name was
      Deïokes, and this man was the son of Phraortes. This Deïokes, having
      formed a desire for despotic power, did thus:—whereas the Medes
      dwelt in separate villages, he, being even before that time of great
      repute in his own village, set himself to practise just dealing much more
      and with greater zeal than before; and this he did although there was much
      lawlessness throughout the whole of Media, and although he knew that
      injustice is ever at feud with justice. And the Medes of the same village,
      seeing his manners, chose him for their judge. So he, since he was aiming
      at power, was upright and just, and doing thus he had no little praise
      from his fellow-citizens, insomuch that those of the other villages
      learning that Deïokes was a man who more than all others gave decision
      rightly, whereas before this they had been wont to suffer from unjust
      judgments, themselves also when they heard it came gladly to Deïokes to
      have their causes determined, and at last they trusted the business to no
      one else.
    </p>
<p>
      97. Then, as more and more continually kept coming to him, because men
      learnt that his decisions proved to be according to the truth, Deïokes
      perceiving that everything was referred to himself would no longer sit in
      the place where he used formerly to sit in public to determine causes, and
      said that he would determine causes no more, for it was not profitable for
      him to neglect his own affairs and to determine causes for his neighbours
      all through the day. So then, since robbery and lawlessness prevailed even
      much more in the villages than they did before, the Medes having assembled
      together in one place considered with one another and spoke about the
      state in which they were: and I suppose the friends of Deïokes spoke much
      to this effect: "Seeing that we are not able to dwell in the land under
      the present order of things, let us set up a king from among ourselves,
      and thus the land will be well governed and we ourselves shall turn to
      labour, and shall not be ruined by lawlessness." By some such words as
      these they persuaded themselves to have a king.
    </p>
<p>
      98. And when they straightway proposed the question whom they should set
      up to be king, Deïokes was much put forward and commended by every one,
      until at last they agreed that he should be their king. And he bade them
      build for him a palace worthy of the royal dignity and strengthen him with
      a guard of spearmen. And the Medes did so: for they built him a large and
      strong palace in that part of the land which he told them, and they
      allowed him to select spearmen from all the Medes. And when he had
      obtained the rule over them, he compelled the Medes to make one fortified
      city and pay chief attention to this, having less regard to the other
      cities. And as the Medes obeyed him in this also, he built large and
      strong walls, those which are now called Agbatana, standing in circles one
      within the other. And this wall is so contrived that one circle is higher
      than the next by the height of the battlements alone. And to some extent,
      I suppose, the nature of the ground, seeing that it is on a hill, assists
      towards this end; but much more was it produced by art, since the circles
      are in all seven in number. <a href="#linknote-111" id="linknoteref-111" class="pginternal">111</a> And within the last circle are the royal
      palace and the treasure-houses. The largest of these walls is in size
      about equal to the circuit of the wall round Athens; and of the first
      circle the battlements are white, of the second black, of the third
      crimson, of the fourth blue, of the fifth red: thus are the battlements of
      all the circles coloured with various tints, and the two last have their
      battlements one of them overlaid with silver and the other with gold.
    </p>
<p>
      99. These walls then Deïokes built for himself and round his own palace,
      and the people he commanded to dwell round about the wall. And after all
      was built, Deïokes established the rule, which he was the first to
      establish, ordaining that none should enter into the presence of the king,
      but that they deal with him always through messengers; and that the king
      should be seen by no one; and moreover that to laugh or to spit in
      presence is unseemly, and this last for every one without exception. <a href="#linknote-112" id="linknoteref-112" class="pginternal">112</a>
      Now he surrounded himself with this state <a href="#linknote-113" id="linknoteref-113" class="pginternal">113</a> to the end that his
      fellows, who had been brought up with him and were of no meaner family nor
      behind him in manly virtue, might not be grieved by seeing him and make
      plots against him, but that being unseen by them he might be thought to be
      of different mould.
    </p>
<p>
      100. Having set these things in order and strengthened himself in his
      despotism, he was severe in preserving justice; and the people used to
      write down their causes and send them in to his presence, and he
      determined the questions which were brought in to him and sent them out
      again. Thus he used to do about the judgment of causes; and he also took
      order for this, that is to say, if he heard that any one was behaving in
      an unruly manner, he sent for him and punished him according as each act
      of wrong deserved, and he had watchers and listeners about all the land
      over which he ruled.
    </p>
<p>
      101. Deïokes then united the Median race alone, and was ruler of this: and
      of the Medes there are the tribes which here follow, namely, Busai,
      Paretakenians, Struchates, Arizantians, Budians, Magians: the tribes of
      the Medes are so many in number.
    </p>
<p>
      102. Now the son of Deïokes was Phraortes, who when Deïokes was dead,
      having been king for three-and-fifty years, received the power in
      succession; and having received it he was not satisfied to be ruler of the
      Medes alone, but marched upon the Persians; and attacking them first
      before others, he made these first subject to the Medes. After this, being
      ruler of these two nations and both of them strong, he proceeded to subdue
      Asia going from one nation to another, until at last he marched against
      the Assyrians, those Assyrians I mean who dwelt at Nineveh, and who
      formerly had been rulers of the whole, but at that time they were left
      without support their allies having revolted from them, though at home
      they were prosperous enough. <a href="#linknote-114" id="linknoteref-114" class="pginternal">114</a> Phraortes marched, I say, against these, and
      was both himself slain, after he had reigned two-and-twenty years, and the
      greater part of his army was destroyed.
    </p>
<p>
      103. When Phraortes had brought his life to an end, Kyaxares the son of
      Phraortes, the son of Deïokes, received the power. This king is said to
      have been yet much more warlike than his forefathers; and he first banded
      the men of Asia into separate divisions, that is to say, he first arrayed
      apart from one another the spearmen and the archers and the horsemen, for
      before that time they were all mingled together without distinction. This
      was he who fought with the Lydians when the day became night as they
      fought, and who also united under his rule the whole of Asia above the
      river Halys. <a href="#linknote-115" id="linknoteref-115" class="pginternal">115</a> And having gathered together all his subjects
      he marched upon Nineveh to avenge his father, and also because he desired
      to conquer that city. And when he had fought a battle with the Assyrians
      and had defeated them, while he was sitting down before Nineveh there came
      upon him a great army of Scythians, <a href="#linknote-116" id="linknoteref-116" class="pginternal">116</a> and the leader of them
      was Madyas the son of Protohyas, king of the Scythians. These had invaded
      Asia after driving the Kimmerians out of Europe, and in pursuit of them as
      they fled they had come to the land of Media.
    </p>
<p>
      104. Now from the Maiotian lake to the river Phasis and to the land of the
      Colchians is a journey of thirty days for one without encumbrance; <a href="#linknote-117" id="linknoteref-117" class="pginternal">117</a>
      and from Colchis it is not far to pass over to Media, for there is only
      one nation between them, the Saspeirians, and passing by this nation you
      are in Media. However the Scythians did not make their invasion by this
      way, but turned aside from it to go by the upper road <a href="#linknote-118" id="linknoteref-118" class="pginternal">118</a>
      which is much longer, keeping Mount Caucasus on their right hand. Then the
      Medes fought with the Scythians, and having been worsted in the battle
      they lost their power, and the Scythians obtained rule over all Asia.
    </p>
<p>
      105. Thence they went on to invade Egypt; and when they were in Syria
      which is called Palestine, Psammetichos king of Egypt met them; and by
      gifts and entreaties he turned them from their purpose, so that they
      should not advance any further: and as they retreated, when they came to
      the city of Ascalon in Syria, most of the Scythians passed through without
      doing any damage, but a few of them who had stayed behind plundered the
      temple of Aphrodite Urania. Now this temple, as I find by inquiry, is the
      most ancient of all the temples which belong to this goddess; for the
      temple in Cyprus was founded from this, as the people of Cyprus themselves
      report, and it was the Phenicians who founded the temple in Kythera,
      coming from this land of Syria. So these Scythians who had plundered the
      temple at Ascalon, and their descendants for ever, were smitten by the
      divinity <a href="#linknote-119" id="linknoteref-119" class="pginternal">119</a> with a disease which made them women instead
      of men: and the Scythians say that it was for this reason that they were
      diseased, and that for this reason travellers who visit Scythia now, see
      among them the affection of those who by the Scythians are called <i>Enareës</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      106. For eight-and-twenty years then the Scythians were rulers of Asia,
      and by their unruliness and reckless behaviour everything was ruined; for
      on the one hand they exacted that in tribute from each people which they
      laid upon them, <a href="#linknote-120" id="linknoteref-120" class="pginternal">120</a> and apart from the tribute they rode about
      and carried off by force the possessions of each tribe. Then Kyaxares with
      the Medes, having invited the greater number of them to a banquet, made
      them drunk and slew them; and thus the Medes recovered their power, and
      had rule over the same nations as before; and they also took Nineveh,—the
      manner how it was taken I shall set forth in another history, <a href="#linknote-121" id="linknoteref-121" class="pginternal">121</a>—and
      made the Assyrians subject to them excepting only the land of Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      107. After this Kyaxares died, having reigned forty years including those
      years during which the Scythians had rule, and Astyages son of Kyaxares
      received from him the kingdom. To him was born a daughter whom he named
      Mandane; and in his sleep it seemed to him that there passed from her so
      much water as to fill his city and also to flood the whole of Asia. This
      dream he delivered over <a href="#linknote-122" id="linknoteref-122" class="pginternal">122</a> to the Magian interpreters of dreams, and
      when he heard from them the truth at each point he became afraid. And
      afterwards when this Mandane was of an age to have a husband, he did not
      give her in marriage to any one of the Medes who were his peers, because
      he feared the vision; but he gave her to a Persian named Cambyses, whom he
      found to be of a good descent and of a quiet disposition, counting him to
      be in station much below a Mede of middle rank.
    </p>
<p>
      108. And when Mandane was married to Cambyses, in the first year Astyages
      saw another vision. It seemed to him that from the womb of this daughter a
      vine grew, and this vine overspread the whole of Asia. Having seen this
      vision and delivered it to the interpreters of dreams, he sent for his
      daughter, being then with child, to come from the land of the Persians.
      And when she had come he kept watch over her, desiring to destroy that
      which should be born of her; for the Magian interpreters of dreams
      signified to him that the offspring of his daughter should be king in his
      room. Astyages then desiring to guard against this, when Cyrus was born,
      called Harpagos, a man who was of kin near him and whom he trusted above
      all the other Medes, and had made him manager of all his affairs; and to
      him he said as follows: "Neglect not by any means, Harpagos, the matter
      which I shall lay upon thee to do, and beware lest thou set me aside, <a href="#linknote-123" id="linknoteref-123" class="pginternal">123</a>
      and choosing the advantage of others instead, bring thyself afterwards to
      destruction. Take the child which Mandane bore, and carry it to thy house
      and slay it; and afterwards bury it in whatsoever manner thou thyself
      desirest." To this he made answer: "O king, never yet in any past time
      didst thou discern in me an offence against thee, and I keep watch over
      myself also with a view to the time that comes after, that I may not
      commit any error towards thee. If it is indeed thy pleasure that this
      should so be done, my service at least must be fitly rendered."
    </p>
<p>
      109. Thus he made answer, and when the child had been delivered to him
      adorned as for death, Harpagos went weeping to his wife all the words
      which had been spoken by Astyages. And she said to him: "Now, therefore,
      what is it in thy mind to do?" and he made answer: "Not according as
      Astyages enjoined: for not even if he shall come to be yet more out of his
      senses and more mad than he now is, will I agree to his will or serve him
      in such a murder as this. And for many reasons I will not slay the child;
      first because he is a kin to me, and then because Astyages is old and
      without male issue, and if after he is dead the power shall come through
      me, does not the greatest of dangers then await me? To secure me, this
      child must die; but one of the servants of Astyages must be the slayer of
      it, and not one of mine."
    </p>
<p>
      110. Thus he spoke, and straightway sent a messenger to that one of the
      herdsmen of Astyages who he knew fed his herds on the pastures which were
      most suitable for his purpose, and on the mountains most haunted by wild
      beasts. The name of this man was Mitradates, and he was married to one who
      was his fellow-slave; and the name of the woman to whom he was married was
      Kyno in the tongue of the Hellenes and in the Median tongue Spaco, for
      what the Hellenes call <i>kyna</i> (bitch) the Medes call <i>spaca</i>.
      Now, it was on the skirts of the mountains that this herdsman had his
      cattle-pastures, from Agbatana towards the North Wind and towards the
      Euxine Sea. For here in the direction of the Saspeirians the Median land
      is very mountainous and lofty and thickly covered with forests; but the
      rest of the land of Media is all level plain. So when this herdsman came,
      being summoned with much urgency, Harpagos said these words: "Astyages
      bids thee take this child and place it on the most desolate part of the
      mountains, so that it may perish as quickly as possible. And he bade me to
      say that if thou do not kill it, but in any way shalt preserve it from
      death, he will slay thee by the most evil kind of destruction: <a href="#linknote-124" id="linknoteref-124" class="pginternal">124</a>
      and I have been appointed to see that the child is laid forth."
    </p>
<p>
      111. Having heard this and having taken up the child, the herdsman went
      back by the way he came, and arrived at his dwelling. And his wife also,
      as it seems, having been every day on the point of bearing a child, by a
      providential chance brought her child to birth just at that time, when the
      herdsman was gone to the city. And both were in anxiety, each for the
      other, the man having fear about the child-bearing of his wife, and the
      woman about the cause why Harpagos had sent to summon her husband, not
      having been wont to do so aforetime. So as soon as he returned and stood
      before her, the woman seeing him again beyond her hopes was the first to
      speak, and asked him for what purpose Harpagos had sent for him so
      urgently. And he said: "Wife, when I came to the city I saw and heard that
      which I would I had not seen, and which I should wish had never chanced to
      those whom we serve. For the house of Harpagos was all full of mourning,
      and I being astonished thereat went within: and as soon as I entered I saw
      laid out to view an infant child gasping for breath and screaming, which
      was adorned with gold ornaments and embroidered clothing: and when
      Harpagos saw me he bade me forthwith to take up the child and carry it
      away and lay it on that part of the mountains which is most haunted by
      wild beasts, saying that it was Astyages who laid this task upon me, and
      using to me many threats, if I should fail to do this. And I took it up
      and bore it away, supposing that it was the child of some one of the
      servants of the house, for never could I have supposed whence it really
      was; but I marvelled to see it adorned with gold and raiment, and I
      marvelled also because mourning was made for it openly in the house of
      Harpagos. And straightway as we went by the road, I learnt the whole of
      the matter from the servant who went with me out of the city and placed in
      my hands the babe, namely that it was in truth the son of Mandane the
      daughter of Astyages, and of Cambyses the son of Cyrus, and that Astyages
      bade slay it. And now here it is."
    </p>
<p>
      112. And as he said this the herdsman uncovered it and showed it to her.
      And she, seeing that the child was large and of fair form, wept and clung
      to the knees of her husband, beseeching him by no means to lay it forth.
      But he said that he could not do otherwise than so, for watchers would
      come backwards and forwards sent by Harpagos to see that this was done,
      and he would perish by a miserable death if he should fail to do this. And
      as she could not after all persuade her husband, the wife next said as
      follows: "Since then I am unable to persuade thee not to lay it forth, do
      thou this which I shall tell thee, if indeed it needs must be seen laid
      forth. I also have borne a child, but I have borne it dead. Take this and
      expose it, and let us rear the child of the daughter of Astyages as if it
      were our own. Thus thou wilt not be found out doing a wrong to those whom
      we serve, nor shall we have taken ill counsel for ourselves; for the dead
      child will obtain a royal burial and the surviving one will not lose his
      life."
    </p>
<p>
      113. To the herdsman it seemed that, the case standing thus, his wife
      spoke well, and forthwith he did so. The child which he was bearing to put
      to death, this he delivered to his wife, and his own, which was dead, he
      took and placed in the chest in which he had been bearing the other; and
      having adorned it with all the adornment of the other child, he bore it to
      the most desolate part of the mountains and placed it there. And when the
      third day came after the child had been laid forth, the herdsman went to
      the city, leaving one of his under-herdsmen to watch there, and when he
      came to the house of Harpagos he said that he was ready to display the
      dead body of the child; and Harpagos sent the most trusted of his
      spearmen, and through them he saw and buried the herdsman's child. This
      then had had burial, but him who was afterwards called Cyrus the wife of
      the herdsman had received, and was bringing him up, giving him no doubt
      some other name, not Cyrus.
    </p>
<p>
      114. And when the boy was ten years old, it happened with regard to him as
      follows, and this made him known. He was playing in the village in which
      were stalls for oxen, he was playing there, I say, with other boys of his
      age in the road. And the boys in their play chose as their king this one
      who was called the son of the herdsman: and he set some of them to build
      palaces and others to be spearmen of his guard, and one of them no doubt
      he appointed to be the eye of the king, and to one he gave the office of
      bearing the messages, <a href="#linknote-12401" id="linknoteref-12401" class="pginternal">12401</a> appointing a work for each one severally.
      Now one of these boys who was playing with the rest, the son of Artembares
      a man of repute among the Medes, did not do that which Cyrus appointed him
      to do; therefore Cyrus bade the other boys seize him hand and foot, <a href="#linknote-125" id="linknoteref-125" class="pginternal">125</a>
      and when they obeyed his command he dealt with the boy very roughly,
      scourging him. But he, so soon as he was let go, being made much more
      angry because he considered that he had been treated with indignity, went
      down to the city and complained to his father of the treatment which he
      had met with from Cyrus, calling him not Cyrus, for this was not yet his
      name, but the son of the herdsman of Astyages. And Artembares in the anger
      of the moment went at once to Astyages, taking the boy with him, and he
      declared that he had suffered things that were unfitting and said: "O
      king, by thy slave, the son of a herdsman, we have been thus outraged,"
      showing him the shoulders of his son.
    </p>
<p>
      115. And Astyages having heard and seen this, wishing to punish the boy to
      avenge the honour of Artembares, sent for both the herdsman and his son.
      And when both were present, Astyages looked at Cyrus and said: "Didst thou
      dare, being the son of so mean a father as this, to treat with such
      unseemly insult the son of this man who is first in my favour?" And he
      replied thus: "Master, I did so to him with right. For the boys of the
      village, of whom he also was one, in their play set me up as king over
      them, for I appeared to them most fitted for this place. Now the other
      boys did what I commanded them, but this one disobeyed and paid no regard,
      until at last he received the punishment due. If therefore for this I am
      worthy to suffer any evil, here I stand before thee."
    </p>
<p>
      116. While the boy thus spoke, there came upon Astyages a sense of
      recognition of him and the lineaments of his face seemed to him to
      resemble his own, and his answer appeared to be somewhat over free for his
      station, while the time of the laying forth seemed to agree with the age
      of the boy. Being struck with amazement by these things, for a time he was
      speechless; and having at length with difficulty recovered himself, he
      said, desiring to dismiss Artembares, in order that he might get the
      herdsman by himself alone and examine him: "Artembares, I will so order
      these things that thou and thy son shall have no cause to find fault"; and
      so he dismissed Artembares, and the servants upon the command of Astyages
      led Cyrus within. And when the herdsman was left alone with the king,
      Astyages being alone with him asked whence he had received the boy, and
      who it was who had delivered the boy to him. And the herdsman said that he
      was his own son, and that the mother was living with him still as his
      wife. But Astyages said that he was not well advised in desiring to be
      brought to extreme necessity, and as he said this he made a sign to the
      spearmen of his guard to seize him. So he, as he was being led away to the
      torture, <a href="#linknote-126" id="linknoteref-126" class="pginternal">126</a> then declared the story as it really was; and
      beginning from the beginning he went through the whole, telling the truth
      about it, and finally ended with entreaties, asking that he would grant
      him pardon.
    </p>
<p>
      117. So when the herdsman had made known the truth, Astyages now cared
      less about him, but with Harpagos he was very greatly displeased and bade
      his spearmen summon him. And when Harpagos came, Astyages asked him thus:
      "By what death, Harpagos, didst thou destroy the child whom I delivered to
      thee, born of my daughter?" and Harpagos, seeing that the herdsman was in
      the king's palace, turned not to any false way of speech, lest he should
      be convicted and found out, but said as follows: "O king, so soon as I
      received the child, I took counsel and considered how I should do
      according to thy mind, and how without offence to thy command I might not
      be guilty of murder against thy daughter and against thyself. I did
      therefore thus:—I called this herdsman and delivered the child to
      him, saying first that thou wert he who bade him slay it—and in this
      at least I did not lie, for thou didst so command. I delivered it, I say,
      to this man commanding him to place it upon a desolate mountain, and to
      stay by it and watch it until it should die, threatening him with all
      kinds of punishment if he should fail to accomplish this. And when he had
      done that which was ordered and the child was dead, I sent the most
      trusted of my eunuchs and through them I saw and buried the child. Thus, O
      king, it happened about this matter, and the child had this death which I
      say."
    </p>
<p>
      118. So Harpagos declared the truth, and Astyages concealed the anger
      which he kept against him for that which had come to pass, and first he
      related the matter over again to Harpagos according as he had been told it
      by the herdsman, and afterwards, when it had been thus repeated by him, he
      ended by saying that the child was alive and that that which had come to
      pass was well, "for," continued he, "I was greatly troubled by that which
      had been done to this child, and I thought it no light thing that I had
      been made at variance with my daughter. Therefore consider that this is a
      happy change of fortune, and first send thy son to be with the boy who is
      newly come, and then, seeing that I intend to make a sacrifice of
      thanksgiving for the preservation of the boy to those gods to whom that
      honour belongs, be here thyself to dine with me."
    </p>
<p>
      119. When Harpagos heard this, he did reverence and thought it a great
      matter that his offence had turned out for his profit and moreover that he
      had been invited to dinner with happy augury; <a href="#linknote-127" id="linknoteref-127" class="pginternal">127</a> and so he went to his
      house. And having entered it straightway, he sent forth his son, for he
      had one only son of about thirteen years old, bidding him go to the palace
      of Astyages and do whatsoever the king should command; and he himself
      being overjoyed told his wife that which had befallen him. But Astyages,
      when the son of Harpagos arrived, cut his throat and divided him limb from
      limb, and having roasted some pieces of the flesh and boiled others he
      caused them to be dressed for eating and kept them ready. And when the
      time arrived for dinner and the other guests were present and also
      Harpagos, then before the other guests and before Astyages himself were
      placed tables covered with flesh of sheep; but before Harpagos was placed
      the flesh of his own son, all but the head and the hands and the feet, <a href="#linknote-128" id="linknoteref-128" class="pginternal">128</a>
      and these were laid aside covered up in a basket. Then when it seemed that
      Harpagos was satisfied with food, Astyages asked him whether he had been
      pleased with the banquet; and when Harpagos said that he had been very
      greatly pleased, they who had been commanded to do this brought to him the
      head of his son covered up, together with the hands and the feet; and
      standing near they bade Harpagos uncover and take of them that which he
      desired. So when Harpagos obeyed and uncovered, he saw the remains of his
      son; and seeing them he was not overcome with amazement but contained
      himself: and Astyages asked him whether he perceived of what animal he had
      been eating the flesh: and he said that he perceived, and that whatsoever
      the king might do was well pleasing to him. Thus having made answer and
      taking up the parts of the flesh which still remained he went to his
      house; and after that, I suppose, he would gather all the parts together
      and bury them.
    </p>
<p>
      120. On Harpagos Astyages laid this penalty; and about Cyrus he took
      thought, and summoned the same men of the Magians who had given judgment
      about his dream in the manner which has been said: and when they came,
      Astyages asked how they had given judgment about his vision; and they
      spoke according to the same manner, saying that the child must have become
      king if he had lived on and had not died before. He made answer to them
      thus: "The child is alive and not dead: <a href="#linknote-129" id="linknoteref-129" class="pginternal">129</a> and while he was
      dwelling in the country, the boys of the village appointed him king; and
      he performed completely all those things which they do who are really
      kings; for he exercised rule, <a href="#linknote-130" id="linknoteref-130" class="pginternal">130</a> appointed to their
      places spearmen of the guard and doorkeepers and bearers of messages and
      all else. Now therefore, to what does it seem to you that these things
      tend?" The Magians said: "If the child is still alive and became king
      without any arrangement, be thou confident concerning him and have good
      courage, for he shall not be ruler again the second time; since some even
      of our oracles have had but small results, <a href="#linknote-131" id="linknoteref-131" class="pginternal">131</a> and that at least
      which has to do with dreams comes often in the end to a feeble
      accomplishment." Astyages made answer in these words: "I myself also, O
      Magians, am most disposed to believe that this is so, namely that since
      the boy was named king the dream has had its fulfilment and that this boy
      is no longer a source of danger to me. Nevertheless give counsel to me,
      having well considered what is likely to be most safe both for my house
      and for you." Replying to this the Magians said: "To us also, O king, it
      is of great consequence that thy rule should stand firm; for in the other
      case it is transferred to strangers, coming round to this boy who is a
      Persian, and we being Medes are made slaves and become of no account in
      the eyes of the Persians, seeing that we are of different race; but while
      thou art established as our king, who art one of our own nation, we both
      have our share of rule and receive great honours from thee. Thus then we
      must by all means have a care of thee and of thy rule. And now, if we saw
      in this anything to cause fear, we would declare all to thee beforehand:
      but as the dream has had its issue in a trifling manner, both we ourselves
      are of good cheer and we exhort thee to be so likewise: and as for this
      boy, send him away from before thine eyes to the Persians and to his
      parents."
    </p>
<p>
      121. When he heard this Astyages rejoiced, and calling Cyrus spoke to him
      thus: "My son, I did thee wrong by reason of a vision of a dream which has
      not come to pass, but thou art yet alive by thine own destiny; now
      therefore go in peace to the land of the Persians, and I will send with
      thee men to conduct thee: and when thou art come thither, thou shalt find
      a father and a mother not after the fashion of Mitradates the herdsman and
      his wife."
    </p>
<p>
      122. Thus having spoken Astyages sent Cyrus away; and when he had returned
      and come to the house of Cambyses, his parents received him; and after
      that, when they learnt who he was, they welcomed him not a little, for
      they had supposed without doubt that their son had perished straightway
      after his birth; and they inquired in what manner he had survived. And he
      told them, saying that before this he had not known but had been utterly
      in error; on the way, however, he had learnt all his own fortunes: for he
      had supposed without doubt that he was the son of the herdsman of
      Astyages, but since his journey from the city began he had learnt the
      whole story from those who conducted him. And he said that he had been
      brought up by the wife of the herdsman, and continued to praise her
      throughout, so that Kyno was the chief person in his tale. And his parents
      took up this name from him, and in order that their son might be thought
      by the Persians to have been preserved in a more supernatural manner, they
      set on foot a report that Cyrus when he was exposed had been reared by a
      bitch: <a href="#linknote-132" id="linknoteref-132" class="pginternal">132</a>
      and from that source has come this report.
    </p>
<p>
      123. Then as Cyrus grew to be a man, being of all those of his age the
      most courageous and the best beloved, Harpagos sought to become his friend
      and sent him gifts, because he desired to take vengeance on Astyages. For
      he saw not how from himself, who was in a private station, punishment
      should come upon Astyages; but when he saw Cyrus growing up, he
      endeavoured to make him an ally, finding a likeness between the fortunes
      of Cyrus and his own. And even before that time he had effected something:
      for Astyages being harsh towards the Medes, Harpagos communicated
      severally with the chief men of the Medes, and persuaded them that they
      must make Cyrus their leader and cause Astyages to cease from being king.
      When he had effected this and when all was ready, then Harpagos wishing to
      make known his design to Cyrus, who lived among the Persians, could do it
      no other way, seeing that the roads were watched, but devised a scheme as
      follows:—he made ready a hare, and having cut open its belly but
      without pulling off any of the fur, he put into it, just as it was, a
      piece of paper, having written upon it that which he thought good; and
      then he sewed up again the belly of the hare, and giving nets as if he
      were a hunter to that one of his servants whom he trusted most, he sent
      him away to the land of the Persians, enjoining him by word of mouth to
      give the hare to Cyrus, and to tell him at the same time to open it with
      his own hands and let no one else be present when he did so.
    </p>
<p>
      124. This then was accomplished, and Cyrus having received from him the
      hare, cut it open; and having found within it the paper he took and read
      it over. And the writing said this: "Son of Cambyses, over thee the gods
      keep guard, for otherwise thou wouldst never have come to so much good
      fortune. Do thou therefore <a href="#linknote-133" id="linknoteref-133" class="pginternal">133</a> take vengeance on Astyages who is thy
      murderer, for so far as his will is concerned thou art dead, but by the
      care of the gods and of me thou art still alive; and this I think thou
      hast long ago learnt from first to last, both how it happened about
      thyself, and also what things I have suffered from Astyages, because I did
      not slay thee but gave thee to the herdsman. If therefore thou wilt be
      guided by me, thou shalt be ruler of all that land over which now Astyages
      is ruler. Persuade the Persians to revolt, and march any army against the
      Medes: and whether I shall be appointed leader of the army against thee,
      or any other of the Medes who are in repute, thou hast what thou desirest;
      for these will be the first to attempt to destroy Astyages, revolting from
      him and coming over to thy party. Consider then that here at least all is
      ready, and therefore do this and do it with speed."
    </p>
<p>
      125. Cyrus having heard this began to consider in what manner he might
      most skilfully persuade the Persians to revolt, and on consideration he
      found that this was the most convenient way, and so in fact he did:—He
      wrote first on a paper that which he desired to write, and he made an
      assembly of the Persians. Then he unfolded the paper and reading from it
      said that Astyages appointed him commander of the Persians; "and now, O
      Persians," he continued, "I give you command to come to me each one with a
      reaping-hook." Cyrus then proclaimed this command. (Now there are of the
      Persians many tribes, and some of them Cyrus gathered together and
      persuaded to revolt from the Medes, namely those, upon which all the other
      Persians depend, the Pasargadai, the Maraphians and the Maspians, and of
      these the Pasargadai are the most noble, of whom also the Achaimenidai are
      a clan, whence are sprung the Perseïd <a href="#linknote-134" id="linknoteref-134" class="pginternal">134</a> kings. But other
      Persian tribes there are, as follows:—the Panthaliaians, the
      Derusiaians and the Germanians, these are all tillers of the soil; and the
      rest are nomad tribes, namely the Daoi, Mardians, Dropicans and
      Sagartians.)
    </p>
<p>
      126. Now there was a certain region of the Persian land which was
      overgrown with thorns, extending some eighteen or twenty furlongs in each
      direction; and when all had come with that which they had been before
      commanded to bring, Cyrus bade them clear this region for cultivation
      within one day: and when the Persians had achieved the task proposed, then
      he bade them come to him on the next day bathed and clean. Meanwhile
      Cyrus, having gathered together in one place all the flocks of goats and
      sheep and the herds of cattle belonging to his father, slaughtered them
      and prepared with them to entertain the host of the Persians, and moreover
      with wine and other provisions of the most agreeable kind. So when the
      Persians came on the next day, he made them recline in a meadow and
      feasted them. And when they had finished dinner, Cyrus asked them whether
      that which they had on the former day or that which they had now seemed to
      them preferable. They said that the difference between them was great, for
      the former day had for them nothing but evil, and the present day nothing
      but good. Taking up this saying Cyrus proceeded to lay bare his whole
      design, saying: "Men of the Persians, thus it is with you. If ye will do
      as I say, ye have these and ten thousand other good things, with no
      servile labour; but if ye will not do as I say, ye have labours like that
      of yesterday innumerable. Now therefore do as I say and make yourselves
      free: for I seem to myself to have been born by providential fortune to
      take these matters in hand; and I think that ye are not worse men than the
      Medes, either in other matters or in those which have to do with war.
      Consider then that this is so, and make revolt from Astyages forthwith."
    </p>
<p>
      127. So the Persians having obtained a leader willingly attempted to set
      themselves free, since they had already for a long time been indignant to
      be ruled by the Medes: but when Astyages heard that Cyrus was acting thus,
      he sent a messenger and summoned him; and Cyrus bade the messenger report
      to Astyages that he would be with him sooner than he would himself desire.
      So Astyages hearing this armed all the Medes, and blinded by divine
      providence he appointed Harpagos to be the leader of the army, forgetting
      what he had done to him. Then when the Medes had marched out and began to
      fight with the Persians, some of them continued the battle, namely those
      who had not been made partakers in the design, while others went over to
      the Persians; but the greater number were wilfully slack and fled.
    </p>
<p>
      128. So when the Median army had been shamefully dispersed, so soon as
      Astyages heard of it he said, threatening Cyrus: "But not even so shall
      Cyrus at least escape punishment." Thus having spoken he first impaled the
      Magian interpreters of dreams who had persuaded him to let Cyrus go, and
      then he armed those of the Medes, youths and old men, who had been left
      behind in the city. These he led out and having engaged battle with the
      Persians he was worsted, and Astyages himself was taken alive, and he lost
      also those of the Medes whom he had led forth.
    </p>
<p>
      129. Then when Astyages was a prisoner, Harpagos came and stood near him
      and rejoiced over him and insulted him; and besides other things which he
      said to grieve him, he asked him especially how it pleased him to be a
      slave instead of a king, making reference to that dinner at which Astyages
      had feasted him with the flesh of his own son. <a href="#linknote-135" id="linknoteref-135" class="pginternal">135</a> He looking at him
      asked him in return whether he claimed the work of Cyrus as his own deed:
      and Harpagos said that since he had written the letter, the deed was
      justly his. Then Astyages declared him to be at the same time the most
      unskilful and the most unjust of men; the most unskilful because, when it
      was in his power to become king (as it was, if that which had now been
      done was really brought about by him), he had conferred the chief power on
      another, and the most unjust, because on account of that dinner he had
      reduced the Medes to slavery. For if he must needs confer the kingdom on
      some other and not keep it himself, it was more just to give this good
      thing to one of the Medes rather than to one of the Persians; whereas now
      the Medes, who were guiltless of this, had become slaves instead of
      masters, and the Persians who formerly were slaves of the Medes had now
      become their masters.
    </p>
<p>
      130. Astyages then, having been king for five-and-thirty years, was thus
      caused to cease from being king; and the Medes stooped under the yoke of
      the Persians because of his cruelty, after they had ruled Asia above the
      river Halys for one hundred and twenty-eight years, except during that
      period for which the Scythians had rule. <a href="#linknote-136" id="linknoteref-136" class="pginternal">136</a> Afterwards however it
      repented them that they had done this, and they revolved from Dareios, and
      having revolted they were subdued again, being conquered in a battle. At
      this time then, I say, in the reign of Astyages, the Persians with Cyrus
      rose up against the Medes and from that time forth were rulers of Asia:
      but as for Astyages, Cyrus did no harm to him besides, but kept him with
      himself until he died. Thus born and bred Cyrus became king; and after
      this he subdued Croesus, who was the first to begin the quarrel, as I have
      before said; and having subdued him he then became ruler of all Asia.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      131. These are the customs, so far as I know, which the Persians practise:—Images
      and temples and altars they do not account it lawful to erect, nay they
      even charge with folly those who do these things; and this, as it seems to
      me, because they do not account the gods to be in the likeness of men, as
      do the Hellenes. But it is their wont to perform sacrifices to Zeus going
      up to the most lofty of the mountains, and the whole circle of the heavens
      they call Zeus: and they sacrifice to the Sun and the Moon and the Earth,
      to Fire and to Water and to the Winds: these are the only gods to whom
      they have sacrificed ever from the first; but they have learnt also to
      sacrifice to Aphrodite Urania, having learnt it both from the Assyrians
      and the Arabians; and the Assyrians call Aphrodite Mylitta, the Arabians
      Alitta, <a href="#linknote-13601" id="linknoteref-13601" class="pginternal">13601</a> and the Persians Mitra.
    </p>
<p>
      132. Now this is the manner of sacrifice for the gods aforesaid which is
      established among the Persians:—they make no altars neither do they
      kindle fire; and when they mean to sacrifice they use no libation nor
      music of the pipe nor chaplets <a href="#linknote-137" id="linknoteref-137" class="pginternal">137</a> nor meal for
      sprinkling; <a href="#linknote-138" id="linknoteref-138" class="pginternal">138</a> but when a man wishes to sacrifice to any one
      of the gods, he leads the animal for sacrifice to an unpolluted place and
      calls upon the god, having his <i>tiara</i> <a href="#linknote-13801" id="linknoteref-13801" class="pginternal">13801</a> wreathed round
      generally with a branch of myrtle. For himself alone separately the man
      who sacrifices may not request good things in his prayer, but he prays
      that it may be well with all the Persians and with the king; for he
      himself also is included of course in the whole body of Persians. And when
      he has cut up the victim into pieces and boiled the flesh, he spreads a
      layer of the freshest grass and especially clover, upon which he places
      forthwith all the pieces of flesh; and when he has placed them in order, a
      Magian man stands by them and chants over them a theogony (for of this
      nature they say that their incantation is), seeing that without a Magian
      it is not lawful for them to make sacrifices. Then after waiting a short
      time the sacrificer carries away the flesh and uses it for whatever
      purpose he pleases.
    </p>
<p>
      133. And of all days their wont is to honour most that on which they were
      born, each one: on this they think it right to set out a feast more
      liberal than on other days; and in this feast the wealthier of them set
      upon the table an ox or a horse or a camel or an ass, roasted whole in an
      oven, and the poor among them set out small animals in the same way. They
      have few solid dishes, <a href="#linknote-139" id="linknoteref-139" class="pginternal">139</a> but many served up after as dessert, and
      these not in a single course; and for this reason the Persians say that
      the Hellenes leave off dinner hungry, because after dinner they have
      nothing worth mentioning served up as dessert, whereas if any good dessert
      were served up they would not stop eating so soon. To wine-drinking they
      are very much given, and it is not permitted for a man to vomit or to make
      water in presence of another. Thus do they provide against these things;
      and they are wont to deliberate when drinking hard about the most
      important of their affairs, and whatsoever conclusion has pleased them in
      their deliberation, this on the next day, when they are sober, the master
      of the house in which they happen to be when they deliberate lays before
      them for discussion: and if it pleases them when they are sober also, they
      adopt it, but if it does not please them, they let it go: and that on
      which they have had the first deliberation when they are sober, they
      consider again when they are drinking.
    </p>
<p>
      134. When they meet one another in the roads, by this you may discern
      whether those who meet are of equal rank,—for instead of greeting by
      words they kiss one another on the mouth; but if one of them is a little
      inferior to the other, they kiss one another on the cheeks, and if one is
      of much less noble rank than the other, he falls down before him and does
      worship to him. <a href="#linknote-140" id="linknoteref-140" class="pginternal">140</a> And they honour of all most after themselves
      those nations which dwell nearest to them, and next those which dwell next
      nearest, and so they go on giving honour in proportion to distance; and
      they hold least in honour those who dwell furthest off from themselves,
      esteeming themselves to be by far the best of all the human race on every
      point, and thinking that others possess merit according to the proportion
      which is here stated, <a href="#linknote-141" id="linknoteref-141" class="pginternal">141</a> and that those who dwell furthest from
      themselves are the worst. And under the supremacy of the Medes the various
      nations used also to govern one another according to the same rule as the
      Persians observe in giving honour, <a href="#linknote-142" id="linknoteref-142" class="pginternal">142</a> the Medes governing
      the whole and in particular those who dwelt nearest to themselves, and
      these having rule over those who bordered upon them, and those again over
      the nations that were next to them: for the race went forward thus ever
      from government by themselves to government through others.
    </p>
<p>
      135. The Persians more than any other men admit foreign usages; for they
      both wear the Median dress judging it to be more comely than their own,
      and also for fighting the Egyptian corslet: moreover they adopt all kinds
      of luxuries when they hear of them, and in particular they have learnt
      from the Hellenes to have commerce with boys. They marry each one several
      lawful wives, and they get also a much larger number of concubines.
    </p>
<p>
      136. It is established as a sign of manly excellence next after excellence
      in fight, to be able to show many sons; and to those who have most the
      king sends gifts every year: for they consider number to be a source of
      strength. And they educate their children, beginning at five years old and
      going on till twenty, in three things only, in riding, in shooting, and in
      speaking the truth: but before the boy is five years old he does not come
      into the presence of his father, but lives with the women; and it is so
      done for this reason, that if the child should die while he is being bred
      up, he may not be the cause of any grief to his father.
    </p>
<p>
      137. I commend this custom of theirs, and also the one which is next to be
      mentioned, namely that neither the king himself shall put any to death for
      one cause alone, nor any of the other Persians for one cause alone shall
      do hurt that is irremediable to any of his own servants; but if after
      reckoning he finds that the wrongs done are more in number and greater
      than the services rendered, <a href="#linknote-143" id="linknoteref-143" class="pginternal">143</a> then only he gives vent to his anger.
      Moreover they say that no one ever killed his own father or mother, but
      whatever deeds have been done which seemed to be of this nature, if
      examined must necessarily, they say, be found to be due either to
      changelings or to children of adulterous birth; for, say they, it is not
      reasonable to suppose that the true parent would be killed by his own son.
    </p>
<p>
      138. Whatever things it is not lawful for them to do, these it is not
      lawful for them even to speak of: and the most disgraceful thing in their
      estimation is to tell an lie, and next to this to owe money, this last for
      many other reasons, but especially because it is necessary, they say, for
      him who owes money, also sometimes to tell lies: and whosoever of the men
      of the city has leprosy or whiteness of skin, he does not come into a city
      nor mingle with the other Persians; and they say that he has these
      diseases because he has offended in some way against the Sun: but a
      stranger who is taken by these diseases, in many regions <a href="#linknote-144" id="linknoteref-144" class="pginternal">144</a>
      they drive out of the country altogether, and also white doves, alleging
      against them the same cause. And into a river they neither make water nor
      spit, neither do they wash their hands in it, nor allow any other to do
      these things, but they reverence rivers very greatly.
    </p>
<p>
      139. This moreover also has chanced to them, which the Persians have
      themselves failed to notice but I have not failed to do so:—their
      names, which are formed to correspond with their bodily shapes or their
      magnificence of station, end all with the same letter, that letter which
      the Dorians call <i>san</i> and the Ionians <i>sigma</i>; with this you
      will find, if you examine the matter, that all the Persian names end, not
      some with this and others with other letters, but all alike.
    </p>
<p>
      140. So much I am able to say for certain from my own knowledge about
      them: but what follows is reported about their dead as a secret mystery
      and not with clearness, namely that the body of a Persian man is not
      buried until it has been torn by a bird or a dog. (The Magians I know for
      a certainty have this practice, for they do it openly.) However that may
      be, the Persians cover the body with wax and then bury it in the earth.
      Now the Magians are distinguished in many ways from other men, as also
      from the priests in Egypt: for these last esteem it a matter of purity to
      kill no living creature except the animals which they sacrifice; but the
      Magians kill with their own hands all creatures except dogs and men, and
      they even make this a great end to aim at, killing both ants and serpents
      and all other creeping and flying things. About this custom then be it as
      it was from the first established; and I return now to the former
      narrative. <a href="#linknote-145" id="linknoteref-145" class="pginternal">145</a>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
      141. The Ionians and Aiolians, as soon as the Lydians had been subdued by
      the Persians, sent messengers to Cyrus at Sardis, desiring to be his
      subjects on the same terms as they had been subjects of Croesus. And when
      he heard that which they proposed to him, he spoke to them a fable, saying
      that a certain player on the pipe saw fishes in the sea and played on his
      pipe, supposing that they would come out to land; but being deceived in
      his expectation, he took a casting-net and enclosed a great multitude of
      the fishes and drew them forth from the water: and when he saw them
      leaping about, he said to the fishes: "Stop dancing I pray you now, seeing
      that ye would not come out and dance before when I piped." Cyrus spoke
      this fable to the Ionians and Aiolians for this reason, because the
      Ionians had refused to comply before, when Cyrus himself by a messenger
      requested them to revolt from Croesus, while now when the conquest had
      been made they were ready to submit to Cyrus. Thus he said to them in
      anger, and the Ionians, when they heard this answer brought back to their
      cities, put walls round about them severally, and gathered together to the
      Panionion, all except the men of Miletos, for with these alone Cyrus had
      sworn an agreement on the same terms as the Lydians had granted. The rest
      of the Ionians resolved by common consent to send messengers to Sparta, to
      ask the Spartans to help the Ionians.
    </p>
<p>
      142. These Ionians to whom belongs the Panionion had the fortune to build
      their cities in the most favourable position for climate and seasons of
      any men whom we know: for neither the regions above Ionia nor those below,
      neither those towards the East nor those towards the West, <a href="#linknote-146" id="linknoteref-146" class="pginternal">146</a>
      produce the same results as Ionia itself, the regions in the one direction
      being oppressed by cold and moisture, and those in the other by heat and
      drought. And these do not use all the same speech, but have four different
      variations of language. <a href="#linknote-147" id="linknoteref-147" class="pginternal">147</a> First of their cities on the side of the
      South lies Miletos, and next to it Myus and Priene. These are settlements
      made in Caria, and speak the same language with one another; and the
      following are in Lydia,—Ephesos, Colophon, Lebedos, Teos,
      Clazomenai, Phocaia: these cities resemble not at all those mentioned
      before in the speech which they use, but they agree one with another.
      There remain besides three Ionian cities, of which two are established in
      the islands of Samos and Chios, and one is built upon the mainland, namely
      Erythrai: now the men of Chios and of Erythrai use the same form of
      language, but the Samians have one for themselves alone. Thus there result
      four separate forms of language.
    </p>
<p>
      143. Of these Ionians then those of Miletos were sheltered from danger,
      since they had sworn an agreement; and those of them who lived in islands
      had no cause for fear, for the Phenicians were not yet subjects of the
      Persians and the Persians themselves were not sea-men. Now these <a href="#linknote-148" id="linknoteref-148" class="pginternal">148</a>
      were parted off from the other Ionians for no other reason than this:—The
      whole Hellenic nation was at that time weak, but of all its races the
      Ionian was much the weakest and of least account: except Athens, indeed,
      it had no considerable city. Now the other Ionians, and among them the
      Athenians, avoided the name, not wishing to be called Ionians, nay even
      now I perceive that the greater number of them are ashamed of the name:
      but these twelve cities not only prided themselves on the name but
      established a temple of their own, to which they gave the name of
      Panionion, and they made resolution not to grant a share in it to any
      other Ionians (nor indeed did any ask to share it except those of Smyrna);
    </p>
<p>
      144, just as the Dorians of that district which is now called the Five
      Cities <a href="#linknote-149" id="linknoteref-149" class="pginternal">149</a>
      but was formerly called the Six Cities, <a href="#linknote-150" id="linknoteref-150" class="pginternal">150</a> take care not to admit
      any of the neighbouring Dorians to the temple of Triopion, and even
      exclude from sharing in it those of their own body who commit any offence
      as regards the temple. For example, in the games of the Triopian Apollo
      they used formerly to set bronze tripods as prizes for the victors, and
      the rule was that those who received them should not carry them out of the
      temple but dedicate them then and there to the god. There was a man then
      of Halicarnassos, whose name was Agasicles, who being a victor paid no
      regard to this rule, but carried away the tripod to his own house and hung
      it up there upon a nail. On this ground the other five cities, Lindos,
      Ialysos and Cameiros, Cos and Cnidos, excluded the sixth city
      Halicarnassos from sharing in the temple.
    </p>
<p>
      145. Upon these they laid this penalty: but as for the Ionians, I think
      that the reason why they made of themselves twelve cities and would not
      receive any more into their body, was because when they dwelt in
      Peloponnesus there were of them twelve divisions, just as now there are
      twelve divisions of the Achaians who drove the Ionians out: for first,
      (beginning from the side of Sikyon) comes Pellene, then Aigeira and Aigai,
      in which last is the river Crathis with a perpetual flow (whence the river
      of the same name in Italy received its name), and Bura and Helike, to
      which the Ionians fled for refuge when they were worsted by the Achaians
      in fight, and Aigion and Rhypes and Patreis and Phareis and Olenos, where
      is the great river Peiros, and Dyme and Tritaieis, of which the last alone
      has an inland position. <a href="#linknote-151" id="linknoteref-151" class="pginternal">151</a> These form now twelve divisions of the
      Achaians, and in former times they were divisions of the Ionians.
    </p>
<p>
      146. For this reason then the Ionians also made for themselves twelve
      cities; for at any rate to say that these are any more Ionians than the
      other Ionians, or have at all a nobler descent, is mere folly, considering
      that a large part of them are Abantians from Euboea, who have no share
      even in the name of Ionia, and Minyai of Orchomenos have been mingled with
      them, and Cadmeians and Dryopians and Phokians who seceded from their
      native State and Molossians and Pelasgians of Arcadia and Dorians of
      Epidauros and many other races have been mingled with them; and those of
      them who set forth to their settlements from the City Hall of Athens and
      who esteem themselves the most noble by descent of the Ionians, these, I
      say, brought no women with them to their settlement, but took Carian
      women, whose parents they slew: and on account of this slaughter these
      women laid down for themselves a rule, imposing oaths on one another, and
      handed it on to their daughters, that they should never eat with their
      husbands, nor should a wife call her own husband by name, for this reason,
      because the Ionians had slain their fathers and husbands and children and
      then having done this had them to wife. This happened at Miletos.
    </p>
<p>
      147. Moreover some of them set Lykian kings over them, descendants of
      Glaucos and Hippolochos, while others were ruled by Cauconians of Pylos,
      descendants of Codros the son of Melanthos, and others again by princes of
      the two races combined. Since however these hold on to the name more than
      the other Ionians, let them be called, if they will, the Ionians of truly
      pure descent; but in fact all are Ionians who have their descent from
      Athens and who keep the feast of Apaturia; and this all keep except the
      men of Ephesos and Colophon: for these alone of all the Ionians do not
      keep the Apaturia, and that on the ground of some murder committed.
    </p>
<p>
      148. Now the Panionion is a sacred place on the north side of Mycale, set
      apart by common agreement of the Ionians for Poseidon of Helike <a href="#linknote-152" id="linknoteref-152" class="pginternal">152</a>;
      and this Mycale is a promontory of the mainland running out Westwards
      towards Samos, where the Ionians gathering together from their cities used
      to hold a festival which they called the Panionia. (And not only the
      feasts of the Ionians but also those of all the Hellenes equally are
      subject to this rule, that their names all end in the same letter, just
      like the names of the Persians.) <a href="#linknote-153" id="linknoteref-153" class="pginternal">153</a>
</p>
<p>
      These then are the Ionian cities:
    </p>
<p>
      149, and those of Aiolia are as follows:—Kyme, which is called
      Phriconis, Larisai, Neon-teichos, Temnos, Killa, Notion, Aigiroëssa,
      Pitane, Aigaiai, Myrina, Gryneia; these are the ancient cities of the
      Aiolians, eleven in number, since one, Smyrna, was severed from them by
      the Ionians; for these cities, that is those on the mainland, used also
      formerly to be twelve in number. And these Aiolians had the fortune to
      settle in a land which is more fertile than that of the Ionians but in
      respect of climate less favoured. <a href="#linknote-154" id="linknoteref-154" class="pginternal">154</a>
</p>
<p>
      150. Now the Aiolians lost Smyrna in the following manner:—certain
      men of Colophon, who had been worsted in party strife and had been driven
      from their native city, were received there for refuge: and after this the
      Colophonian exiles watched for a time when the men of Smyrna were
      celebrating a festival to Dionysos outside the walls, and then they closed
      the gates against them and got possession of the city. After this, when
      the whole body of Aiolians came to the rescue, they made an agreement that
      the Ionians should give up the movable goods, and that on this condition
      the Aiolians should abandon Smyrna. When the men of Smyrna had done this,
      the remaining eleven cities divided them amongst themselves and made them
      their own citizens.
    </p>
<p>
      151. These then are the Aiolian cities upon the mainland, with the
      exception of those situated on Mount Ida, for these are separate from the
      rest. And of those which are in the islands, there are five in Lesbos, for
      the sixth which was situated in Lesbos, namely Arisba, was enslaved by the
      men of Methymna, though its citizens were of the same race as they; and in
      Tenedos there is one city, and another in what are called the "Hundred
      Isles." Now the Lesbians and the men of Tenedos, like those Ionians who
      dwelt in the islands, had no cause for fear; but the remaining cities came
      to a common agreement to follow the Ionians whithersoever they should
      lead.
    </p>
<p>
      152. Now when the messengers from the Ionians and Aiolians came to Sparta
      (for this business was carried out with speed), they chose before all
      others to speak for them the Phocaian, whose name was Pythermos. He then
      put upon him a purple cloak, in order that as many as possible of the
      Spartans might hear of it and come together, and having been introduced
      before the assembly <a href="#linknote-155" id="linknoteref-155" class="pginternal">155</a> he spoke at length, asking the Spartans to
      help them. The Lacedemonians however would not listen to him, but resolved
      on the contrary not to help the Ionians. So they departed, and the
      Lacedemonians, having dismissed the messengers of the Ionians, sent men
      notwithstanding in a ship of fifty oars, to find out, as I imagine, about
      the affairs of Cyrus and about Ionia. These when they came to Phocaia sent
      to Sardis the man of most repute among them, whose name was Lacrines, to
      report to Cyrus the saying of the Lacedemonians, bidding him do hurt to no
      city of the Hellas, since they would not permit it.
    </p>
<p>
      153. When the herald had spoken thus, Cyrus is said to have asked those of
      the Hellenes whom he had with him, what men the Lacedemonians were and how
      many in number, that they made this proclamation to him; and hearing their
      answer he said to the Spartan herald: "Never yet did I fear men such as
      these, who have a place appointed in the midst of their city where they
      gather together and deceive one another by false oaths: and if I continue
      in good health, not the misfortunes of the Ionians will be for them a
      subject of talk, but rather their own." These words Cyrus threw out
      scornfully with reference to the Hellenes in general, because they have
      got for themselves <a href="#linknote-156" id="linknoteref-156" class="pginternal">156</a> markets and practise buying and selling
      there; for the Persians themselves are not wont to use markets nor have
      they any market-place at all. After this he entrusted Sardis to Tabalos a
      Persian, and the gold both of Croesus and of the other Lydians he gave to
      Pactyas a Lydian to take charge of, and himself marched away to Agbatana,
      taking with him Croesus and making for the present no account of the
      Ionians. For Babylon stood in his way still, as also the Bactrian nation
      and the Sacans and the Egyptians; and against these he meant to make
      expeditions himself, while sending some other commander about the Ionians.
    </p>
<p>
      154. But when Cyrus had marched away from Sardis, Pactyas caused the
      Lydians to revolt from Tabalos and from Cyrus. This man went down to the
      sea, and having in his possession all the gold that there had been in
      Sardis, he hired for himself mercenaries and persuaded the men of the
      sea-coast to join his expedition. So he marched on Sardis and besieged
      Tabalos, having shut himself up in the citadel.
    </p>
<p>
      155. Hearing this on his way, Cyrus said to Croesus as follows: "Croesus,
      what end shall I find of these things which are coming to pass? The
      Lydians will not cease as it seems, from giving trouble to me and from
      having it themselves. I doubt me if it were not best <a href="#linknote-157" id="linknoteref-157" class="pginternal">157</a>
      to sell them all as slaves; for as it is, I see that I have done in like
      manner as if one should slay the father and then spare his sons: just so I
      took prisoner and am carrying away thee, who wert much more than the
      father of the Lydians, while to the Lydians themselves I delivered up
      their city; and can I feel surprise after this that they have revolted
      from me?" Thus he said what was in his mind, but Croesus answered him as
      follows, fearing lest he should destroy Sardis: "O king, that which thou
      hast said is not without reason; but do not thou altogether give vent to
      thy wrath, nor destroy an ancient city which is guiltless both of the
      former things and also of those which have come to pass now: for as to the
      former things it was I who did them and I bear the consequences heaped
      upon my head; <a href="#linknote-158" id="linknoteref-158" class="pginternal">158</a> and as for what is now being done, since the
      wrongdoer is Pactyas to whom thou didst entrust the charge of Sardis, let
      him pay the penalty. But the Lydians I pray thee pardon, and lay upon them
      commands as follows, in order that they may not revolt nor be a cause of
      danger to thee:—send to them and forbid them to possess weapons of
      war, but bid them on the other hand put on tunics under their outer
      garments and be shod with buskins, and proclaim to them that they train
      their sons to play the lyre and the harp and to be retail-dealers; and
      soon thou shalt see, O king, that they have become women instead of men,
      so that there will be no fear that they will revolt from thee."
    </p>
<p>
      156. Croesus, I say, suggested to him this, perceiving that this was
      better for the Lydians than to be reduced to slavery and sold; for he knew
      that if he did not offer a sufficient reason, he would not persuade Cyrus
      to change his mind, and he feared lest at some future time, if they should
      escape the present danger, the Lydians might revolt from the Persians and
      be destroyed. And Cyrus was greatly pleased with the suggestion made and
      slackened from his wrath, saying that he agreed with his advice. Then he
      called Mazares a Mede, and laid charge upon him to proclaim to the Lydians
      that which Croesus suggested, and moreover to sell into slavery all the
      rest who had joined with the Lydians in the expedition to Sardis, and
      finally by all means to bring Pactyas himself alive to Cyrus.
    </p>
<p>
      157. Having given this charge upon the road, he continued his march to the
      native land of the Persians; but Pactyas hearing that an army was
      approaching to fight against him was struck with fear and fled away
      forthwith to Kyme. Then Mazares the Mede marched upon Sardis with a
      certain portion of the army of Cyrus, and as he did not find Pactyas or
      his followers any longer at Sardis, he first compelled the Lydians to
      perform the commands of Cyrus, and by his commands the Lydians changed the
      whole manner of their life. After this Mazares proceeded to send
      messengers to Kyme bidding them give up Pactyas: and the men of Kyme
      resolved to refer to the god at Branchidai the question what counsel they
      should follow. For there was there an Oracle established of old time,
      which all the Ionians and Aiolians were wont to consult; and this place is
      in the territory of Miletos above the port of Panormos.
    </p>
<p>
      158. So the men of Kyme sent messengers to the Branchidai <a href="#linknote-159" id="linknoteref-159" class="pginternal">159</a>
      to inquire of the god, and they asked what course they should take about
      Pactyas so as to do that which was pleasing to the gods. When they thus
      inquired, the answer was given them that they should deliver up Pactyas to
      the Persians: and the men of Kyme, having heard this answer reported, were
      disposed to give him up. Then when the mass of the people were thus
      disposed, Aristodicos the son of Heracleides, a man of repute among the
      citizens, stopped the men of Kyme from doing so, having distrust of the
      answer and thinking that those sent to inquire were not speaking the
      truth; until at last other messengers were sent to the Oracle to ask a
      second time about Pactyas, and of them Aristodicos was one.
    </p>
<p>
      159. When these came to Branchidai, Aristodicos stood forth from the rest
      and consulted the Oracle, asking as follows: Lord, <a href="#linknote-160" id="linknoteref-160" class="pginternal">160</a> there came to us a
      suppliant for protection Pactyas the Lydian, flying from a violent death
      at the hands of the Persians, and they demand him from us, bidding the men
      of Kyme give him up. But we, though we fear the power of the Persians, yet
      have not ventured up to this time to deliver to them the suppliant, until
      thy counsel shall be clearly manifested to us, saying which of the two
      things we ought to do." He thus inquired, but the god again declared to
      them the same answer, bidding them deliver up Pactyas to the Persians.
      Upon this Aristodicos with deliberate purpose did as follows:—he
      went all round the temple destroying the nests of the sparrows <a href="#linknote-161" id="linknoteref-161" class="pginternal">161</a>
      and of all the other kinds of birds which had been hatched on the temple:
      and while he was doing this, it is said that a voice came from the inner
      shrine directed to Aristodicos and speaking thus: "Thou most impious of
      men, why dost thou dare to do this? Dost thou carry away by force from my
      temple the suppliants for my protection?" And Aristodicos, it is said, not
      being at all at a loss replied to this: "Lord, dost thou thus come to the
      assistance of thy suppliants, and yet biddest the men of Kyme deliver up
      theirs?" and the god answered him again thus: "Yea, I bid you do so, that
      ye may perish the more quickly for your impiety; so that ye may not at any
      future time come to the Oracle to ask about delivering up of suppliants."
    </p>
<p>
      160. When the men of Kyme heard this saying reported, not wishing either
      to be destroyed by giving him up or to be besieged by keeping him with
      them, they sent him away to Mytilene. Those of Mytilene however, when
      Mazares sent messages to them, were preparing to deliver up Pactyas for a
      price, but what the price was I cannot say for certain, since the bargain
      was never completed; for the men of Kyme, when they learnt that this was
      being done by the Mytilenians, sent a vessel to Lesbos and conveyed away
      Pactyas to Chios. After this he was dragged forcibly from the temple of
      Athene Poliuchos by the Chians and delivered up: and the Chians delivered
      him up receiving Atarneus in return, (now this Atarneus is a region of
      Mysia <a href="#linknote-162" id="linknoteref-162" class="pginternal">162</a>
      opposition Lesbos). So the Persians having received Pactyas kept him under
      guard, meaning to produce him before Cyrus. And a long time elapsed during
      which none of the Chians either used barley-meal grown in this region of
      Atarneus, for pouring out in sacrifice to any god, or baked cakes for
      offering of the corn which grew there, but all the produce of this land
      was excluded from every kind of sacred service.
    </p>
<p>
      161. The men of Chios had then delivered up Pactyas; and after this
      Mazares made expedition against those who had joined in besieging Tabalos:
      and first he reduced to slavery those of Priene, then he overran the whole
      plain of the Maiander making spoil of it for his army, and Magnesia in the
      same manner: and straightway after this he fell sick and died.
    </p>
<p>
      162. After he was dead, Harpagos came down to take his place in command,
      being also a Mede by race (this was the man whom the king of the Medes
      Astyages feasted with the unlawful banquet, and who helped to give the
      kingdom to Cyrus). This man, being appointed commander then by Cyrus, came
      to Ionia and proceeded to take the cities by throwing up mounds against
      them: for when he had enclosed any people within their walls, then he
      threw up mounds against the walls and took their city by storm; and the
      first city of Ionia upon which he made an attempt was Phocaia.
    </p>
<p>
      163. Now these Phocaians were the first of the Hellenes who made long
      voyages, and these are they who discovered the Adriatic and Tyrsenia and
      Iberia and Tartessos: and they made voyages not in round ships, but in
      vessels of fifty oars. These came to Tartessos and became friends with the
      king of the Tartessians whose name was Arganthonios: he was ruler of the
      Tartessians for eighty years and lived in all one hundred and twenty. With
      this man, I say, the Phocaians became so exceedingly friendly, that first
      he bade them leave Ionia and dwell wherever they desired in his own land;
      and as he did not prevail upon the Phocaians to do this, afterwards,
      hearing from them of the Mede how his power was increasing, he gave them
      money to build a wall about their city: and he did this without sparing,
      for the circuit of the wall is many furlongs <a href="#linknote-163" id="linknoteref-163" class="pginternal">163</a> in extent, and it is
      built all of large stones closely fitted together.
    </p>
<p>
      164. The wall of the Phocaians was made in this manner: and Harpagos
      having marched his army against them began to besiege them, at the same
      time holding forth to them proposals and saying that it was enough to
      satisfy him if the Phocaians were willing to throw down one battlement of
      their wall and dedicate one single house. <a href="#linknote-164" id="linknoteref-164" class="pginternal">164</a> But the Phocaians,
      being very greatly grieved at the thought of subjection, said that they
      wished to deliberate about the matter for one day and after that they
      would give their answer; and they asked him to withdraw his army from the
      wall while they were deliberating. Harpagos said that he knew very well
      what they were meaning to do, nevertheless he was willing to allow them to
      deliberate. So in the time that followed, when Harpagos had withdrawn his
      army from the wall, the Phocaians drew down their fifty-oared galleys to
      the sea, put into them their children and women and all their movable
      goods, and besides them the images out of the temples and the other votive
      offerings except such as were made of bronze or stone or consisted of
      paintings, all the rest, I say, they put into the ships, and having
      embarked themselves they sailed towards Chios; and the Persians obtained
      possession of Phocaia, the city being deserted of the inhabitants.
    </p>
<p>
      165. But as for the Phocaians, since the men of Chios would not sell them
      at their request the islands called Oinussai, from the fear lest these
      islands might be made a seat of trade and their island might be shut out,
      therefore they set out for Kyrnos: <a href="#linknote-165" id="linknoteref-165" class="pginternal">165</a> for in Kyrnos twenty
      years before this they had established a city named Alalia, in accordance
      with an oracle, (now Arganthonios by that time was dead). And when they
      were setting out for Kyrnos they first sailed to Phocaia and slaughtered
      the Persian garrison, to whose charge Harpagos had delivered the city;
      then after they had achieved this they made solemn imprecations on any one
      of them who should be left behind from their voyage, and moreover they
      sank a mass of iron in the sea and swore that not until that mass should
      appear again on the surface <a href="#linknote-166" id="linknoteref-166" class="pginternal">166</a> would they return to Phocaia. However as they
      were setting forth to Kyrnos, more than half of the citizens were seized
      with yearning and regret for their city and for their native land, and
      they proved false to their oath and sailed back to Phocaia. But those of
      them who kept the oath still, weighed anchor from the islands of Oinussai
      and sailed.
    </p>
<p>
      166. When these came to Kyrnos, for five years they dwelt together with
      those who had come thither before, and they founded temples there. Then,
      since they plundered the property of all their neighbours, the Tyrsenians
      and Carthaginians <a href="#linknote-167" id="linknoteref-167" class="pginternal">167</a> made expedition against them by agreement
      with one another, each with sixty ships. And the Phocaians also manned
      their vessels, sixty in number, and came to meet the enemy in that which
      is called the Sardinian sea: and when they encountered one another in the
      sea-fight the Phocaians won a kind of Cadmean victory, for forty of their
      ships were destroyed and the remaining twenty were disabled, having had
      their prows bent aside. So they sailed in to Alalia and took up their
      children and their women and their other possessions as much as their
      ships proved capable of carrying, and then they left Kyrnos behind them
      and sailed to Rhegion.
    </p>
<p>
      167. But as for the crews of the ships that were destroyed, the
      Carthaginians and Tyrsenians obtained much the greater number of them, <a href="#linknote-168" id="linknoteref-168" class="pginternal">168</a>
      and these they brought to land and killed by stoning. After this the men
      of Agylla found that everything which passed by the spot where the
      Phocaians were laid after being stoned, became either distorted, or
      crippled, or paralysed, both small cattle and beasts of burden and human
      creatures: so the men of Agylla sent to Delphi desiring to purge
      themselves of the offence; and the Pythian prophetess bade them do that
      which the men of Agylla still continue to perform, that is to say, they
      make great sacrifices in honour of the dead, and hold at the place a
      contest of athletics and horse-racing. These then of the Phocaians had the
      fate which I have said; but those of them who took refuge at Rhegion
      started from thence and took possession of that city in the land of
      Oinotria which now is called Hyele. This they founded having learnt from a
      man of Poseidonia that the Pythian prophetess by her answer meant them to
      found a temple to Kyrnos, who was a hero, and not to found a settlement in
      the island of Kyrnos. <a href="#linknote-169" id="linknoteref-169" class="pginternal">169</a>
</p>
<p>
      168. About Phocaia in Ionia it happened thus, and nearly the same thing
      also was done by the men of Teos: for as soon as Harpagos took their wall
      with a mound, they embarked in their ships and sailed straightway for
      Thrace; and there they founded the city of Abdera, which before them
      Timesios of Clazomenai founded and had no profit therefrom, but was driven
      out by the Thracians; and now he is honoured as a hero by the Teïans in
      Abdera.
    </p>
<p>
      169. These alone of all the Ionians left their native cities because they
      would not endure subjection: but the other Ionians except the Milesians
      did indeed contend in arms with Harpagos like those who left their homes,
      and proved themselves brave men, fighting each for his own native city;
      but when they were defeated and captured they remained all in their own
      place and performed that which was laid upon them: but the Milesians, as I
      have also said before, had made a sworn agreement with Cyrus himself and
      kept still. Thus for the second time Ionia had been reduced to subjection.
      And when Harpagos had conquered the Ionians on the mainland, then the
      Ionians who dwelt in the islands, being struck with fear by these things,
      gave themselves over to Cyrus.
    </p>
<p>
      170. When the Ionians had been thus evilly entreated but were continuing
      still to hold their gatherings as before at the Panionion, Bias a man of
      Priene set forth to the Ionians, as I am informed, a most profitable
      counsel, by following which they might have been the most prosperous of
      all the Hellenes. He urged that the Ionians should set forth in one common
      expedition and sail to Sardinia, and after that found a single city for
      all the Ionians: and thus they would escape subjection and would be
      prosperous, inhabiting the largest of all islands and being rulers over
      others; whereas, if they remained in Ionia, he did not perceive, he said,
      that freedom would any longer exist for them. This was the counsel given
      by Bias of Priene after the Ionians had been ruined; but a good counsel
      too was given before the ruin of Ionia by Thales a man of Miletos, who was
      by descent of Phenician race. He advised the Ionians to have one single
      seat of government, <a href="#linknote-170" id="linknoteref-170" class="pginternal">170</a> and that this should be at Teos (for Teos, he
      said, was in the centre of Ionia), and that the other cities should be
      inhabited as before, but accounted just as if they were demes.
    </p>
<p>
      These men <a href="#linknote-171" id="linknoteref-171" class="pginternal">171</a> set forth to them counsels of the kind which
      I have said:
    </p>
<p>
      171. but Harpagos, after subduing Ionia, proceeded to march against the
      Carians and Caunians and Lykians, taking also Ionians and Aiolians to help
      him. Of these the Carians came to the mainland from the islands; for being
      of old time subjects of Minos and being called Leleges, they used to dwell
      in the islands, paying no tribute, so far back as I am able to arrive by
      hearsay, but whenever Minos required it, they used to supply his ships
      with seamen: and as Minos subdued much land and was fortunate in his
      fighting, the Carian nation was of all nations by much the most famous at
      that time together with him. And they produced three inventions of which
      the Hellenes adopted the use; that is to say, the Carians were those who
      first set the fashion of fastening crests on helmets, and of making the
      devices which are put onto shields, and these also were the first who made
      handles for their shields, whereas up to that time all who were wont to
      use shields carried them without handles and with leathern straps to guide
      them, having them hung about their necks and their left shoulders. Then
      after the lapse of a long time the Dorians and Ionians drove the Carians
      out of the islands, and so they came to the mainland. With respect to the
      Carians the Cretans relate that it happened thus; the Carians themselves
      however do not agree with this account, but suppose that they are dwellers
      on the mainland from the beginning, <a href="#linknote-172" id="linknoteref-172" class="pginternal">172</a> and that they went
      always by the same name which they have now: and they point as evidence of
      this to an ancient temple of Carian Zeus at Mylasa, in which the Mysians
      and Lydians share as being brother races of the Carians, for they say that
      Lydos and Mysos were brothers of Car; these share in it, but those who
      being of another race have come to speak the same language as the Carians,
      these have no share in it.
    </p>
<p>
      172. It seems to me however that the Caunians are dwellers there from the
      beginning, though they say themselves that they came from Crete: but they
      have been assimilated to the Carian race in language, or else the Carians
      to the Caunian race, I cannot with certainty determine which. They have
      customs however in which they differ very much from all other men as well
      as from the Carians; for example the fairest thing in their estimation is
      to meet together in numbers for drinking, according to equality of age or
      friendship, both men, women, and children; and again when they had founded
      temples for foreign deities, afterwards they changed their purpose and
      resolved to worship only their own native gods, and the whole body of
      Caunian young men put on their armour and made pursuit as far as the
      borders of the Calyndians, beating the air with their spears; and they
      said that they were casting the foreign gods out of the land. Such are the
      customs which these have.
    </p>
<p>
      173. The Lykians however have sprung originally from Crete (for in old
      time the whole of Crete was possessed by Barbarians): and when the sons of
      Europa, Sarpedon and Minos, came to be at variance in Crete about the
      kingdom, Minos having got the better in the strife of parties drove out
      both Sarpedon himself and those of his party: and they having been
      expelled came to the land of Milyas in Asia, for the land which now the
      Lykians inhabit was anciently called Milyas, and the Milyans were then
      called Solymoi. Now while Sarpedon reigned over them, they were called by
      the name which they had when they came thither, and by which the Lykians
      are even now called by the neighbouring tribes, namely Termilai; but when
      from Athens Lycos the son of Pandion came to the land of the Termilai and
      to Sarpedon, he too having been driven out by his brother namely Aigeus,
      then by the name taken from Lycos they were called after a time Lykians.
      The customs which these have are partly Cretan and partly Carian; but one
      custom they have which is peculiar to them, and in which they agree with
      no other people, that is they call themselves by their mothers and not by
      their fathers; and if one asks his neighbour who he is, he will state his
      parentage on the mother's side and enumerate his mother's female
      ascendants: and if a woman who is a citizen marry a slave, the children
      are accounted to be of gentle birth; but if a man who is a citizen, though
      he were the first man among them, have a slave for wife or concubine, the
      children are without civil rights.
    </p>
<p>
      174. Now the Carians were reduced to subjection by Harpagos without any
      brilliant deed displayed either by the Carians themselves or by those of
      the Hellenes who dwell in this land. Of these last there are besides
      others the men of Cnidos, settlers from Lacedemon, whose land runs out
      into the sea, <a href="#linknote-173" id="linknoteref-173" class="pginternal">173</a> being in fact the region which is called
      Triopion, beginning from the peninsula of Bybassos: and since all the land
      of Cnidos except a small part is washed by the sea (for the part of it
      which looks towards the North is bounded by the Gulf of Keramos, and that
      which looks to the South by the sea off Syme and Rhodes), therefore the
      men of Cnidos began to dig through this small part, which is about five
      furlongs across, while Harpagos was subduing Ionia, desiring to make their
      land an island: and within the isthmus all was theirs, <a href="#linknote-174" id="linknoteref-174" class="pginternal">174</a>
      for where the territory of Cnidos ends in the direction of the mainland,
      here is the isthmus which they were digging across. And while the Cnidians
      were working at it with a great number of men, it was perceived that the
      men who worked suffered injury much more than might have been expected and
      in a more supernatural manner, both in other parts of their bodies and
      especially in their eyes, when the rock was being broken up; so they sent
      men to ask the Oracle at Delphi what the cause of the difficulty was. And
      the Pythian prophetess, as the men of Cnidos themselves report, gave them
      this reply in trimeter verse:—
    </p>
<pre>
 "Fence not the place with towers, nor dig the isthmus through;
  Zeus would have made your land an island, had he willed."
</pre>
<p>
      When the Pythian prophetess had given this oracle, the men of Cnidos not
      only ceased from their digging but delivered themselves to Harpagos
      without resistance, when he came against them with his army.
    </p>
<p>
      175. There were also the Pedasians, who dwelt in the inland country above
      Halicarnassos; and among these, whenever anything hurtful is about to
      happen either to themselves or to their neighbours, the priestess of
      Athene has a great beard: this befell them three times. These of all about
      Caria were the only men who held out for any time against Harpagos, and
      they gave him trouble more than any other people, having fortified a
      mountain called Lide.
    </p>
<p>
      176. After a time the Pedasians were conquered; and the Lykians, when
      Harpagos marched his army into the plain of Xanthos, came out against him
      <a href="#linknote-175" id="linknoteref-175" class="pginternal">175</a>
      and fought, few against many, and displayed proofs of valour; but being
      defeated and confined within their city, they gathered together into the
      citadel their wives and their children, their property and their servants,
      and after that they set fire to this citadel, so that it was all in
      flames, and having done so and sworn terrible oaths with one another, they
      went forth against the enemy <a href="#linknote-176" id="linknoteref-176" class="pginternal">176</a> and were slain in fight, that is to say all
      the men of Xanthos: and of the Xanthians who now claim to be Lykians the
      greater number have come in from abroad, except only eighty households;
      but these eighty households happened at that time to be away from their
      native place, and so they escaped destruction. Thus Harpagos obtained
      possession of Caunos, for the men of Caunos imitated in most respects the
      behaviour of the Lykians.
    </p>
<p>
      177. So Harpagos was conquering the coast regions of Asia; and Cyrus
      himself meanwhile was doing the same in the upper parts of it, subduing
      every nation and passing over none. Now most of these actions I shall pass
      over in silence, but the undertakings which gave him trouble more than the
      rest and which are the most worthy of note, of these I shall make mention.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      178. Cyrus, so soon as he had made subject to himself all other parts of
      the mainland, proceeded to attack the Assyrians. Now Assyria has doubtless
      many other great cities, but the most famous and the strongest, and the
      place where the seat of their monarchy had been established after Nineveh
      was destroyed, was Babylon; which was a city such as I shall say.—It
      lies in a great plain, and in size it is such that each face measures one
      hundred and twenty furlongs, <a href="#linknote-177" id="linknoteref-177" class="pginternal">177</a> the shape of the whole being square; thus the
      furlongs of the circuit of the city amount in all to four hundred and
      eighty. Such is the size of the city of Babylon, and it had a magnificence
      greater than all other cities of which we have knowledge. First there runs
      round it a trench deep and broad and full of water; then a wall fifty
      royal cubits in thickness and two hundred cubits in height: now the royal
      cubit is larger by three fingers than the common cubit. <a href="#linknote-178" id="linknoteref-178" class="pginternal">178</a>
</p>
<p>
      179. I must also tell in addition to this for what purpose the earth was
      used, which was taken out of the trench, and in what manner the wall was
      made. As they dug the trench they made the earth which was carried out of
      the excavation into bricks, and having moulded enough bricks they baked
      them in kilns; and then afterwards, using hot asphalt for mortar and
      inserting reed mats at every thirty courses of brickwork, they built up
      first the edges of the trench and then the wall itself in the same manner:
      and at the top of the wall along the edges they built chambers of one
      story facing one another; and between the rows of chambers they left space
      to drive a four-horse chariot. In the circuit of the wall there are set a
      hundred gates made of bronze throughout, and the gate-posts and lintels
      likewise. Now there is another city distant from Babylon a space of eight
      days' journey, of which the name is Is; and there is a river there of no
      great size, and the name of the river is also Is, and it sends its stream
      into the river Euphrates. This river Is throws up together with its water
      lumps of asphalt in great abundance, and thence was brought the asphalt
      for the wall of Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      180. Babylon then was walled in this manner; and there are two divisions
      of the city; for a river whose name is Euphrates parts it in the middle.
      This flows from the land of the Armenians and is large and deep and swift,
      and it flows out into the Erythraian sea. The wall then on each side has
      its bends <a href="#linknote-179" id="linknoteref-179" class="pginternal">179</a> carried down to the river, and from this
      point the return walls stretch along each bank of the stream in the form
      of a rampart of baked bricks: and the city itself is full of houses of
      three and four stories, and the roads by which it is cut up run in
      straight lines, including the cross roads which lead to the river; and
      opposite to each road there were set gates in the rampart which ran along
      the river, in many in number as the ways, <a href="#linknote-180" id="linknoteref-180" class="pginternal">180</a> and these also were of
      bronze and led like the ways <a href="#linknote-181" id="linknoteref-181" class="pginternal">181</a> to the river itself.
    </p>
<p>
      181. This wall then which I have mentioned is as it were a cuirass <a href="#linknote-182" id="linknoteref-182" class="pginternal">182</a>
      for the town, and another wall runs round within it, not much weaker for
      defence than the first but enclosing a smaller space. <a href="#linknote-183" id="linknoteref-183" class="pginternal">183</a>
      And in each division of the city was a building in the midst, in the one
      the king's palace of great extent and strongly fortified round, and in the
      other the temple of Zeus Belos with bronze gates, and this exists still up
      to my time and measures two furlongs each way, <a href="#linknote-184" id="linknoteref-184" class="pginternal">184</a> being of a square
      shape: and in the midst of the temple <a href="#linknote-185" id="linknoteref-185" class="pginternal">185</a> is built a solid tower
      measuring a furlong both in length and in breadth, and on this tower
      another tower has been erected, and another again upon this, and so on up
      to the number of eight towers. An ascent to these has been built running
      outside round about all the towers; and when one reaches about the middle
      of the ascent one finds a stopping-place and seats to rest upon, on which
      those who ascend sit down and rest: and on the top of the last tower there
      is a large cell, <a href="#linknote-186" id="linknoteref-186" class="pginternal">186</a> and in the cell a large couch is laid, well
      covered, and by it is placed a golden table: and there is no image there
      set up nor does any human being spend the night there except only one
      woman of the natives of the place, whomsoever the god shall choose from
      all the woman, as say the Chaldeans who are the priests of this god.
    </p>
<p>
      182. These same men say also, but I do not believe them, that the god
      himself comes often to the cell and rests upon the couch, as happens
      likewise in the Egyptian Thebes according to the report of the Egyptians,
      for there also a woman sleeps in the temple of the Theban Zeus (and both
      these women are said to abstain from commerce with men), and as happens
      also with the prophetess <a href="#linknote-187" id="linknoteref-187" class="pginternal">187</a> of the god in Patara of Lykia, whenever there
      is one, for there is not always an Oracle there, but whenever there is
      one, then she is shut up during the nights in the temple within the cell.
    </p>
<p>
      183. There is moreover in the temple at Babylon another cell below,
      wherein is a great image of Zeus sitting, made of gold, and by it is
      placed a large table of gold, and his footstool and seat are of gold also;
      and, as the Chaldeans reported, the weight of the gold of which these
      things are made is eight hundred talents. Outside this cell is an altar of
      gold; and there is also another altar of great size, where full-grown
      animals <a href="#linknote-188" id="linknoteref-188" class="pginternal">188</a>
      are sacrificed, whereas on the golden altar it is not lawful to sacrifice
      any but young sucklings only: and also on the larger altar the Chaldeans
      offer one thousand talents of frankincense every year at the time when
      they celebrate the feast in honour of this god. There was moreover in
      these precincts still remaining at the time of Cyrus, <a href="#linknote-189" id="linknoteref-189" class="pginternal">189</a> a
      statue twelve cubits high, of gold and solid. This I did not myself see,
      but that which is related by the Chaldeans I relate. Against this statue
      Dareios the son of Hystaspes formed a design, but he did not venture to
      take it: it was taken however by Xerxes the son of Dareios, who also
      killed the priest when he forbade him to meddle with the statue. This
      temple, then, is thus adorned with magnificence, and there are also many
      private votive-offerings.
    </p>
<p>
      184. Of this Babylon, besides many other rulers, of whom I shall make
      mention in the Assyrian history, and who added improvement to the walls
      and temples, there were also two who were women. Of these, the one who
      ruled first, named Semiramis, who lived five generations before the other,
      produced banks of earth in the plain which are a sight worth seeing; and
      before this the river used to flood like a sea over the whole plain.
    </p>
<p>
      185. The queen who lived after her time, named Nitocris, was wiser than
      she who had reigned before; and in the first place she left behind her
      monuments which I shall tell of; then secondly, seeing that the monarchy
      of the Medes was great and not apt to remain still, but that besides other
      cities even Nineveh had been captured by it, she made provision against it
      in so far as she was able. First, as regards the river Euphrates which
      flows through the midst of their city, whereas before this it flowed
      straight, she by digging channels above made it so winding that it
      actually comes three times in its course to one of the villages in
      Assyria; and the name of the village to which the Euphrates comes is
      Ardericca; and at this day those who travel from this Sea of ours to
      Babylon, in their voyage down the river Euphrates <a href="#linknote-18901" id="linknoteref-18901" class="pginternal">18901</a> arrive three
      times at this same village and on three separate days. This she did thus;
      and she also piled up a mound along each bank of the river, which is
      worthy to cause wonder for its size and height: and at a great distance
      above Babylon, she dug a basin for a lake, which she caused to extend
      along at a very small distance from the river, <a href="#linknote-190" id="linknoteref-190" class="pginternal">190</a> excavating it
      everywhere of such depth as to come to water, and making the extent such
      that the circuit of it measured four hundred and twenty furlongs: and the
      earth which was dug out of this excavation she used up by piling it in
      mounds along the banks of the river: and when this had been dug by her she
      brought stones and set them all round it as a facing wall. Both these two
      things she did, that is she made the river to have a winding course, and
      she made the place which was dug out all into a swamp, in order that the
      river might run more slowly, having its force broken by going round many
      bends, and that the voyages might be winding to Babylon, and after the
      voyages there might succeed a long circuit of the pool. These works she
      carried out in that part where the entrance to the country was, and the
      shortest way to it from Media, so that the Medes might not have dealings
      with her kingdom and learn of her affairs.
    </p>
<p>
      186. These defences she cast round her city from the depth; and she made
      the following addition which was dependent upon them:—The city was
      in two divisions, and the river occupied the space between; and in the
      time of the former rulers, when any one wished to pass over from the one
      division to the other, he had to pass over in a boat, and that, as I
      imagine, was troublesome: she however made provision also for this; for
      when she was digging the basin for the lake she left this other monument
      of herself derived from the same work, that is, she caused stones to be
      cut of very great length, and when the stones were prepared for her and
      the place had been dug out, she turned aside the whole stream of the river
      into the place which she had been digging; and while this was being filled
      with water, the ancient bed of the river being dried up in the meantime,
      she both built up with baked bricks after the same fashion as the wall the
      edges of the river, where it flows through the city, and the places of
      descent leading from the small gateways to the river; and also about the
      middle of the city, as I judge, with the stones which she had caused to be
      dug out she proceeded to build a bridge, binding together the stones with
      iron and lead: and upon the top she laid squared timbers across, to remain
      there while it was daytime, over which the people of Babylon made the
      passage across; but at night they used to take away these timbers for this
      reason, namely that they might not go backwards and forwards by night and
      steal from one another: and when the place dug out had been made into a
      lake full of water by the river, and at the same time the bridge had been
      completed, then she conducted the Euphrates back into its ancient channel
      from the lake, and so the place dug out being made into a swamp was
      thought to have served a good purpose, and there had been a bridge set up
      for the men of the city.
    </p>
<p>
      187. This same queen also contrived a snare of the following kind:—Over
      that gate of the city through which the greatest number of people passed
      she set up for herself a tomb above the very gate itself. And on the tomb
      she engraved writing which said thus: "If any of the kings of Babylon who
      come after me shall be in want of wealth, let him open my tomb and take as
      much as he desires; but let him not open it for any other cause, if he be
      not in want; for that will not be well." <a href="#linknote-191" id="linknoteref-191" class="pginternal">191</a> This tomb was
      undisturbed until the kingdom came to Dareios; but to Dareios it seemed
      that it was a monstrous thing not to make any use of this gate, and also,
      when there was money lying there, not to take it, considering that the
      money itself invited him to do so. Now the reason why he would not make
      any use of this gate was because the corpse would have been above his head
      as he drove through. He then, I say, opened the tomb and found not indeed
      money but the corpse, with writing which said thus: "If thou hadst not
      been insatiable of wealth and basely covetous, thou wouldest not have
      opened the resting-places of the dead."
    </p>
<p>
      188. This queen then is reported to have been such as I have described:
      and it was the son of this woman, bearing the same name as his father,
      Labynetos, and being ruler over the Assyrians, against whom Cyrus was
      marching. Now the great king makes his marches not only well furnished <a href="#linknote-192" id="linknoteref-192" class="pginternal">192</a>
      from home with provisions for his table and with cattle, but also taking
      with him water from the river Choaspes, which flows by Susa, of which
      alone and of no other river the king drinks: and of this water of the
      Choaspes boiled, a very great number of waggons, four-wheeled and drawn by
      mules, carry a supply in silver vessels, and go with him wherever he may
      march at any time.
    </p>
<p>
      189. Now when Cyrus on his way towards Babylon arrived at the river
      Gyndes,—of which river the springs are in the mountains of the
      Matienians, and it flows through the Dardanians and runs into another
      river, the Tigris, which flowing by the city of Opis runs out into the
      Erythraian Sea,—when Cyrus, I say, was endeavouring to cross this
      river Gyndes, which is a navigable stream, then one of his sacred white
      horses in high spirit and wantonness went into the river and endeavoured
      to cross, but the stream swept it under water and carried it off
      forthwith. And Cyrus was greatly moved with anger against the river for
      having done thus insolently, and he threatened to make it so feeble that
      for the future even women could cross it easily without wetting the knee.
      So after this threat he ceased from his march against Babylon and divided
      his army into two parts; and having divided it he stretched lines and
      marked out straight channels, <a href="#linknote-193" id="linknoteref-193" class="pginternal">193</a> one hundred and eighty
      on each bank of the Gyndes, directed every way, and having disposed his
      army along them he commanded them to dig: so, as a great multitude was
      working, the work was completed indeed, but they spent the whole summer
      season at this spot working.
    </p>
<p>
      190. When Cyrus had taken vengeance on the river Gyndes by dividing it
      into three hundred and sixty channels, and when the next spring was just
      beginning, then at length he continued his advance upon Babylon: and the
      men of Babylon had marched forth out of their city and were awaiting him.
      So when in his advance he came near to the city, the Babylonians joined
      battle with him, and having been worsted in the fight they were shut up
      close within their city. But knowing well even before this that Cyrus was
      not apt to remain still, and seeing him lay hands on every nation equally,
      they had brought in provisions beforehand <a href="#linknote-194" id="linknoteref-194" class="pginternal">194</a> for very many years.
      So while these made no account of the siege, Cyrus was in straits what to
      do, for much time went by and his affairs made no progress onwards.
    </p>
<p>
      191. Therefore, whether it was some other man who suggested it to him when
      he was in a strait what to do, or whether he of himself perceived what he
      ought to do, he did as follows:—The main body of his army <a href="#linknote-195" id="linknoteref-195" class="pginternal">195</a>
      he posted at the place where the river runs into the city, and then again
      behind the city he set others, where the river issues forth from the city;
      and he proclaimed to his army that so soon as they should see that the
      stream had become passable, they should enter by this way into the city.
      Having thus set them in their places and in this manner exhorted them he
      marched away himself with that part of his army which was not fit for
      fighting: and when he came to the lake, Cyrus also did the same things
      which the queen of the Babylonians had done as regards the river and the
      lake; that is to say, he conducted the river by a channel into the lake,
      which was at that time a swamp, and so made the former course of the river
      passable by the sinking of the stream. When this had been done in such a
      manner, the Persians who had been posted for this very purpose entered by
      the bed of the river Euphrates into Babylon, the stream having sunk so far
      that it reached about to the middle of a man's thigh. Now if the
      Babylonians had had knowledge of it beforehand or had perceived that which
      was being done by Cyrus, they would have allowed <a href="#linknote-196" id="linknoteref-196" class="pginternal">196</a> the Persians to enter
      the city and then destroyed them miserably; for if they had closed all the
      gates that led to the river and mounted themselves upon the ramparts which
      were carried along the banks of the stream, they would have caught them as
      it were in a fish-wheal: but as it was, the Persians came upon them
      unexpectedly; and owing to the size of the city (so it is said by those
      who dwell there) after those about the extremities of the city had
      suffered capture, those Babylonians who dwelt in the middle did not know
      that they had been captured; but as they chanced to be holding a festival,
      they went on dancing and rejoicing during this time until they learnt the
      truth only too well.
    </p>
<p>
      Babylon then had thus been taken for the first time:
    </p>
<p>
      192, and as to the resources of the Babylonians how great they are, I
      shall show by many other proofs and among them also by this:—For the
      support of the great king and his army, apart from the regular tribute the
      whole land of which he is ruler has been distributed into portions. Now
      whereas twelve months go to make up the year, for four of these he has his
      support from the territory of Babylon, and for the remaining eight months
      from the whole of the rest of Asia; thus the Assyrian land is in regard to
      resources the third part of all Asia: and the government, or satrapy as it
      is called by the Persians, of this territory is of all the governments by
      far the best; seeing that when Tritantaichmes son of Artabazos had this
      province from the king, there came in to him every day an <i>artab</i>
      full of silver coin (now the <i>artab</i> is a Persian measure and holds
      more than the <i>medimnos</i> of Attica <a href="#linknote-197" id="linknoteref-197" class="pginternal">197</a> by three Attic <i>choinikes</i>);
      and of horses he had in this province as his private property, apart from
      the horses for use in war, eight hundred stallions and sixteen thousand
      mares, for each of these stallions served twenty mares: of Indian hounds
      moreover such a vast number were kept that four large villages in the
      plain, being free from other contributions, had been appointed to provide
      food for the hounds.
    </p>
<p>
      193. Such was the wealth which belonged to the ruler of Babylon. Now the
      land of the Assyrians has but little rain; and this little gives
      nourishment to the root of the corn, but the crop is ripened and the ear
      comes on by the help of watering from the river, not as in Egypt by the
      coming up of the river itself over the fields, but the crop is watered by
      hand or with swing-buckets. For the whole Babylonian territory like the
      Egyptian is cut up into channels, and the largest of the channels is
      navigable for ships and runs in the direction of the sunrising in winter
      from the Euphrates to another river, namely the Tigris, along the bank of
      which lay the city of Nineveh. This territory is of all that we know the
      best by far for producing corn: <a href="#linknote-198" id="linknoteref-198" class="pginternal">198</a> as to trees, <a href="#linknote-199" id="linknoteref-199" class="pginternal">199</a>
      it does not even attempt to bear them, either fig or vine or olive, but
      for producing corn it is so good that it returns as much as
      two-hundred-fold for the average, and when it bears at its best it
      produces three-hundred-fold. The leaves of the wheat and barley there grow
      to be full four fingers broad; and from millet and sesame seed how large a
      tree grows, I know myself but shall not record, being well aware that even
      what has already been said relating to the crops produced has been enough
      to cause disbelief in those who have not visited the Babylonian land. They
      use no oil of olives, but only that which they make of sesame seed; and
      they have date-palms growing over all the plain, most of them
      fruit-bearing, of which they make both solid food and wine and honey; and
      to these they attend in the same manner as to fig-trees, and in particular
      they take the fruit of those palms which the Hellenes call male-palms, and
      tie them upon the date-bearing palms, so that their gall-fly may enter
      into the date and ripen it and that the fruit of the palm may not fall
      off: for the male-palm produces gall-flies in its fruit just as the
      wild-fig does.
    </p>
<p>
      194. But the greatest marvel of all the things in the land after the city
      itself, to my mind is this which I am about to tell: Their boats, those I
      mean which go down the river to Babylon, are round and all of leather: for
      they make ribs for them of willow which they cut in the land of the
      Armenians who dwell above the Assyrians, and round these they stretch
      hides which serve as a covering outside by way of hull, not making broad
      the stern nor gathering in the prow to a point, but making the boats round
      like a shield: and after that they stow the whole boat with straw and
      suffer it to be carried down the stream full of cargo; and for the most
      part these boats bring down casks of palm-wood <a href="#linknote-200" id="linknoteref-200" class="pginternal">200</a> filled with wine. The
      boat is kept straight by two steering-oars and two men standing upright,
      and the man inside pulls his oar while the man outside pushes. <a href="#linknote-201" id="linknoteref-201" class="pginternal">201</a>
      These vessels are made both of very large size and also smaller, the
      largest of them having a burden of as much as five thousand talents'
      weight; <a href="#linknote-202" id="linknoteref-202" class="pginternal">202</a>
      and in each one there is a live ass, and in those of larger size several.
      So when they have arrived at Babylon in their voyage and have disposed of
      their cargo, they sell by auction the ribs of the boat and all the straw,
      but they pack the hides upon their asses and drive them off to Armenia:
      for up the stream of the river it is not possible by any means to sail,
      owing to the swiftness of the current; and for this reason they make their
      boats not of timber but of hides. Then when they have come back to the
      land of the Armenians, driving their asses with them, they make other
      boats in the same manner.
    </p>
<p>
      195. Such are their boats; and the following is the manner of dress which
      they use, namely a linen tunic reaching to the feet, and over this they
      put on another of wool, and then a white mantle thrown round, while they
      have shoes of a native fashion rather like the Boeotian slippers. They
      wear their hair long and bind their heads round with fillets, <a href="#linknote-203" id="linknoteref-203" class="pginternal">203</a>
      and they are anointed over the whole of their body with perfumes. Each man
      has a seal and a staff carved by hand, and on each staff is carved either
      an apple or a rose or a lily or an eagle or some other device, for it is
      not their custom to have a staff without a device upon it.

<p>
      196. Such is the equipment of their bodies: and the customs which are
      established among them are as follows, the wisest in our opinion being
      this, which I am informed that the Enetoi in Illyria also have. In every
      village once in each year it was done as follows:—When the maidens
      <a href="#linknote-204" id="linknoteref-204" class="pginternal">204</a>
      grew to the age for marriage, they gathered these all together and brought
      them in a body to one place, and round them stood a company of men: and
      the crier caused each one severally to stand up, and proceeded to sell
      them, first the most comely of all, and afterwards, when she had been sold
      and had fetched a large sum of money, he would put up another who was the
      most comely after her: and they were sold for marriage. Now all the
      wealthy men of the Babylonians who were ready to marry vied with one
      another in bidding for the most beautiful maidens; those however of the
      common sort who were ready to marry did not require a fine form, but they
      would accept money together with less comely maidens. For when the crier
      had made an end of selling the most comely of the maidens, then he would
      cause to stand up that one who was least shapely, or any one of them who
      might be crippled in any way, and he would make proclamation of her,
      asking who was willing for least gold to have her in marriage, until she
      was assigned to him who was willing to accept least: and the gold would be
      got from the sale of the comely maidens, and so those of beautiful form
      provided dowries for those which were unshapely or crippled; but to give
      in marriage one's own daughter to whomsoever each man would, was not
      allowed, nor to carry off the maiden after buying her without a surety;
      for it was necessary for the man to provide sureties that he would marry
      her, before he took her away; and if they did not agree well together, the
      law was laid down that he should pay back the money. It was allowed also
      for any one who wished it to come from another village and buy. This then
      was their most honourable custom; it does not however still exist at the
      present time, but they have found out of late another way, in order that
      the men may not ill-treat them or take them to another city: <a href="#linknote-205" id="linknoteref-205" class="pginternal">205</a>
      for since the time when being conquered they were oppressed and ruined,
      each one of the common people when he is in want of livelihood prostitutes
      his female children.
    </p>
<p>
      197. Next in wisdom to that, is this other custom which was established <a href="#linknote-206" id="linknoteref-206" class="pginternal">206</a>
      among them:—they bear out the sick into the market-place; for of
      physicians they make no use. So people come up to the sick man and give
      advice about his disease, if any one himself has ever suffered anything
      like that which the sick man has, or saw any other who had suffered it;
      and coming near they advise and recommend those means by which they
      themselves got rid of a like disease or seen some other get rid of it: and
      to pass by the sick man in silence is not permitted to them, nor until one
      has asked what disease he has.
    </p>
<p>
      198. They bury their dead in honey, and their modes of lamentation are
      similar to those used in Egypt. And whenever a Babylonian man has
      intercourse with his wife, he sits by incense offered, and his wife does
      the same on the other side, and when it is morning they wash themselves,
      both of them, for they will touch no vessel until they have washed
      themselves: and the Arabians do likewise in this matter.
    </p>
<p>
      199. Now the most shameful of the customs of the Babylonians is as
      follows: every woman of the country must sit down in the precincts <a href="#linknote-207" id="linknoteref-207" class="pginternal">207</a>
      of Aphrodite once in her life and have commerce with a man who is a
      stranger: and many women who do not deign to mingle with the rest, because
      they are made arrogant by wealth, drive to the temple with pairs of horses
      in covered carriages, and so take their place, and a large number of
      attendants follow after them; but the greater number do thus,—in the
      sacred enclosure of Aphrodite sit great numbers of women with a wreath of
      cord about their heads; some come and others go; and there are passages in
      straight lines going between the women in every direction, <a href="#linknote-208" id="linknoteref-208" class="pginternal">208</a>
      through which the strangers pass by and make their choice. Here when a
      woman takes her seat she does not depart again to her house until one of
      the strangers has thrown a silver coin into her lap and has had commerce
      with her outside the temple, and after throwing it he must say these words
      only: "I demand thee in the name of the goddess Mylitta": <a href="#linknote-209" id="linknoteref-209" class="pginternal">209</a>
      now Mylitta is the name given by the Assyrians to Aphrodite: and the
      silver coin may be of any value; whatever it is she will not refuse it,
      for that is not lawful for her, seeing that this coin is made sacred by
      the act: and she follows the man who has first thrown and does not reject
      any: and after that she departs to her house, having acquitted herself of
      her duty to the goddess <a href="#linknote-210" id="linknoteref-210" class="pginternal">210</a>, nor will you be able thenceforth to give any
      gift so great as to win her. So then as many as have attained to beauty
      and stature <a href="#linknote-211" id="linknoteref-211" class="pginternal">211</a> are speedily released, but those of them who
      are unshapely remain there much time, not being able to fulfil the law;
      for some of them remain even as much as three or four years: and in some
      parts of Cyprus too there is a custom similar to this.
    </p>
<p>
      200. These customs then are established among the Babylonians: and there
      are of them three tribes <a href="#linknote-212" id="linknoteref-212" class="pginternal">212</a> which eat nothing but fish only: and when
      they have caught them and dried them in the sun they do thus,—they
      throw them into brine, and then pound them with pestles and strain them
      through muslin; and they have them for food either kneaded into a soft
      cake, or baked like bread, according to their liking.
    </p>
<p>
      201. When this nation also had been subdued by Cyrus, he had a desire to
      bring the Massagetai into subjection to himself. This nation is reputed to
      be both great and warlike, and to dwell towards the East and the
      sunrising, beyond the river Araxes and over against <a href="#linknote-213" id="linknoteref-213" class="pginternal">213</a> the Issedonians: and
      some also say that this nation is of Scythian race.
    </p>
<p>
      202. Now the Araxes is said by some to be larger and by others to be
      smaller than the Ister: and they say that there are many islands in it
      about equal in size to Lesbos, and in them people dwelling who feed in the
      summer upon roots of all kinds which they dig up and certain fruits from
      trees, which have been discovered by them for food, they store up, it is
      said, in the season when they are ripe and feed upon them in the winter.
      Moreover it is said that other trees have been discovered by them which
      yield fruit of such a kind that when they have assembled together in
      companies in the same place and lighted a fire, they sit round in a circle
      and throw some of it into the fire, and they smell the fruit which is
      thrown on, as it burns, and are intoxicated by the scent as the Hellenes
      are with wine, and when more of the fruit is thrown on they become more
      intoxicated, until at last they rise up to dance and begin to sing. This
      is said to be their manner of living: and as to the river Araxes, it flows
      from the land of the Matienians, whence flows the Gyndes which Cyrus
      divided into the three hundred and sixty channels, and it discharges
      itself by forty branches, of which all except one end in swamps and
      shallow pools; and among them they say that men dwell who feed on fish
      eaten raw, and who are wont to use as clothing the skins of seals: but the
      one remaining branch of the Araxes flows with unimpeded course into the
      Caspian Sea.
    </p>
<p>
      203. Now the Caspian Sea is apart by itself, not having connection with
      the other Sea: for all that Sea which the Hellenes navigate, and the Sea
      beyond the Pillars, which is called Atlantis, and the Erythraian Sea are
      in fact all one, but the Caspian is separate and lies apart by itself. In
      length it is a voyage of fifteen days if one uses oars, <a href="#linknote-214" id="linknoteref-214" class="pginternal">214</a>
      and in breadth, where it is broadest, a voyage of eight days. On the side
      towards the West of this Sea the Caucasus runs along by it, which is of
      all mountain-ranges both the greatest in extent and the loftiest: and the
      Caucasus has many various races of men dwelling in it, living for the most
      part on the wild produce of the forests; and among them there are said to
      be trees which produce leaves of such a kind that by pounding them and
      mixing water with them they paint figures upon their garments, and the
      figures do not wash out, but grow old with the woollen stuff as if they
      had been woven into it at the first: and men say that the sexual
      intercourse of these people is open like that of cattle.
    </p>
<p>
      204. On the West then of this Sea which is called Caspian the Caucasus is
      the boundary, while towards the East and the rising sun a plain succeeds
      which is of limitless extent to the view. Of this great plain then the
      Massagetai occupy a large part, against whom Cyrus had become eager to
      march; for there were many strong reasons which incited him to it and
      urged him onwards,—first the manner of his birth, that is to say the
      opinion held of him that he was more than a mere mortal man, and next the
      success which he had met with <a href="#linknote-215" id="linknoteref-215" class="pginternal">215</a> in his wars, for
      whithersoever Cyrus directed his march, it was impossible for that nation
      to escape.
    </p>
<p>
      205. Now the ruler of the Massagetai was a woman, who was queen after the
      death of her husband, and her name was Tomyris. To her Cyrus sent and
      wooed her, pretending that he desired to have her for his wife: but
      Tomyris understanding that he was wooing not herself but rather the
      kingdom of the Massagetai, rejected his approaches: and Cyrus after this,
      as he made no progress by craft, marched to the Araxes, and proceeded to
      make an expedition openly against the Massagetai, forming bridges of boats
      over the river for his army to cross, and building towers upon the vessels
      which gave them passage across the river.
    </p>
<p>
      206. While he was busied about this labour, Tomyris sent a herald and said
      thus: "O king of the Medes, cease to press forward the work which thou art
      now pressing forward; for thou canst not tell whether these things will be
      in the end for thy advantage or no; cease to do so, I say, and be king
      over thine own people, and endure to see us ruling those whom we rule.
      Since however I know that thou wilt not be willing to receive this
      counsel, but dost choose anything rather than to be at rest, therefore if
      thou art greatly anxious to make trial of the Massagetai in fight, come
      now, leave that labour which thou hast in yoking together the banks of the
      river, and cross over into our land, when we have first withdrawn three
      days' journey from the river: or if thou desirest rather to receive us
      into your land, do thou this same thing thyself." Having heard this Cyrus
      called together the first men among the Persians, and having gathered
      these together he laid the matter before them for discussion, asking their
      advice as to which of the two things he should do: and their opinions all
      agreed in one, bidding him receive Tomyris and her army into his country.
    </p>
<p>
      207. But Croesus the Lydian, being present and finding fault with this
      opinion, declared an opinion opposite to that which had been set forth,
      saying as follows: "O king, I told thee in former time also, that since
      Zeus had given me over to thee, I would avert according to my power
      whatever occasion of falling I might see coming near thy house: and now my
      sufferings, which have been bitter, <a href="#linknote-216" id="linknoteref-216" class="pginternal">216</a> have proved to be
      lessons of wisdom to me. If thou dost suppose that thou art immortal and
      that thou dost command an army which is also immortal, it will be of no
      use for me to declare to thee my judgment; but if thou hast perceived that
      thou art a mortal man thyself and dost command others who are so likewise,
      then learn this first, that for the affairs of men there is a revolving
      wheel, and that this in its revolution suffers not the same persons always
      to have good fortune. I therefore now have an opinion about the matter
      laid before us, which is opposite to that of these men: for if we shall
      consent to receive the enemy into our land, there is for thee this danger
      in so doing:—if thou shalt be worsted thou wilt lose in addition all
      thy realm, for it is evident that if the Massagetai are victors they will
      not turn back and fly, but will march upon the provinces of thy realm; and
      on the other hand if thou shalt be the victor, thou wilt not be victor so
      fully as if thou shouldest overcome the Massagetai after crossing over
      into their land and shouldest pursue them when they fled. For against that
      which I said before I will set the same again here, and say that thou,
      when thou hast conquered, wilt march straight against the realm of
      Tomyris. Moreover besides that which has been said, it is a disgrace and
      not to be endured that Cyrus the son of Cambyses should yield to a woman
      and so withdraw from her land. Now therefore it seems good to me that we
      should cross over and go forward from the crossing as far as they go in
      their retreat, and endeavour to get the better of them by doing as
      follows:—The Massagetai, as I am informed, are without experience of
      Persian good things, and have never enjoyed any great luxuries. Cut up
      therefore cattle without stint and dress the meat and set out for these
      men a banquet in our camp: moreover also provide without stint bowls of
      unmixed wine and provisions of every kind; and having so done, leave
      behind the most worthless part of thy army and let the rest begin to
      retreat from the camp towards the river: for if I am not mistaken in my
      judgment, they when they see a quantity of good things will fall to the
      feast, and after that it remains for us to display great deeds."
    </p>
<p>
      208. These were the conflicting opinions; and Cyrus, letting go the former
      opinion and choosing that of Croesus, gave notice to Tomyris to retire, as
      he was intending to cross over to her. She then proceeded to retire, as
      she had at first engaged to do, but Cyrus delivered Croesus into the hands
      of his son Cambyses, to whom he meant to give the kingdom, and gave him
      charge earnestly to honour him and to treat him well, if the crossing over
      to go against the Massagetai should not be prosperous. Having thus charged
      him and sent these away to the land of the Persians, he crossed over the
      river both himself and his army.
    </p>
<p>
      209. And when he had passed over the Araxes, night having come on he saw a
      vision in his sleep in the land of the Massagetai, as follows:—in
      his sleep it seemed to Cyrus that he saw the eldest of the sons of
      Hystaspes having upon his shoulders wings, and that with the one of these
      he overshadowed Asia and with the other Europe. Now of Hystaspes the son
      of Arsames, who was a man of the Achaimenid clan, the eldest son was
      Dareios, who was then, I suppose, a youth of about twenty years of age,
      and he had been left behind in the land of the Persians, for he was not
      yet of full age to go out to the wars. So then when Cyrus awoke he
      considered with himself concerning the vision: and as the vision seemed to
      him to be of great import, he called Hystaspes, and having taken him apart
      by himself he said: "Hystaspes, thy son has been found plotting against me
      and against my throne: and how I know this for certain I will declare to
      thee:—The gods have a care of me and show me beforehand all the
      evils that threaten me. So in the night that is past while sleeping I saw
      the eldest of thy sons having upon his shoulders wings, and with the one
      of these he overshadowed Asia and with the other Europe. To judge by this
      vision then, it cannot be but that he is plotting against me. Do thou
      therefore go by the quickest way back to Persia and take care that, when I
      return thither after having subdued these regions, thou set thy son before
      me to be examined."
    </p>
<p>
      210. Cyrus said thus supposing that Dareios was plotting against him; but
      in fact the divine powers were showing him beforehand that he was destined
      to find his end there and that his kingdom was coming about to Dareios. To
      this then Hystaspes replied as follows: "O king, heaven forbid <a href="#linknote-217" id="linknoteref-217" class="pginternal">217</a>
      that there should be any man of Persian race who would plot against thee,
      and if there be any, I pray that he perish as quickly as may be; seeing
      that thou didst make the Persians to be free instead of slaves, and to
      rule all nations instead of being ruled by others. And if any vision
      announces to thee that my son is planning rebellion against thee, I
      deliver him over to thee to do with him whatsoever thou wilt."
    </p>
<p>
      211. Hystaspes then, having made answer with these words and having
      crossed over the Araxes, was going his way to the Persian land to keep
      watch over his son Dareios for Cyrus; and Cyrus meanwhile went forward and
      made a march of one day from the Araxes according to the suggestion of
      Croesus. After this when Cyrus and the best part of the army <a href="#linknote-218" id="linknoteref-218" class="pginternal">218</a>
      of the Persians had marched back to the Araxes, and those who were unfit
      for fighting had been left behind, then a third part of the army of the
      Massagetai came to the attack and proceeded to slay, not without
      resistance, <a href="#linknote-219" id="linknoteref-219" class="pginternal">219</a> those who were left behind of the army of
      Cyrus; and seeing the feast that was set forth, when they had overcome
      their enemies they lay down and feasted, and being satiated with food and
      wine they went to sleep. Then the Persians came upon them and slew many of
      them, and took alive many more even than they slew, and among these the
      son of the queen Tomyris, who was leading the army of the Massagetai; and
      his name was Spargapises.
    </p>
<p>
      212. She then, when she heard that which had come to pass concerning the
      army and also the things concerning her son, sent a herald to Cyrus and
      said as follows: "Cyrus, insatiable of blood, be not elated with pride by
      this which has come to pass, namely because with that fruit of the vine,
      with which ye fill yourselves and become so mad that as the wine descends
      into your bodies, evil words float up upon its stream,—because
      setting a snare, I say, with such a drug as this thou didst overcome my
      son, and not by valour in fight. Now therefore receive the word which I
      utter, giving thee good advice:—Restore to me my son and depart from
      this land without penalty, triumphant over a third part of the army of the
      Massagetai: but if thou shalt not do so, I swear to thee by the Sun, who
      is lord of the Massagetai, that surely I will give thee thy fill of blood,
      insatiable as thou art."
    </p>
<p>
      213. When these words were reported to him Cyrus made no account of them;
      and the son of the queen Tomyris, Spargapises, when the wine left him and
      he learnt in what evil case he was, entreated Cyrus that he might be
      loosed from his chains and gained his request, and then so soon as he was
      loosed and had got power over his hands he put himself to death.
    </p>
<p>
      214. He then ended his life in this manner; but Tomyris, as Cyrus did not
      listen to her, gathered together all her power and joined battle with
      Cyrus. This battle of all the battles fought by Barbarians I judge to have
      been the fiercest, and I am informed that it happened thus:—first,
      it is said, they stood apart and shot at one another, and afterwards when
      their arrows were all shot away, they fell upon one another and engaged in
      close combat with their spears and daggers; and so they continued to be in
      conflict with one another for a long time, and neither side would flee;
      but at last the Massagetai got the better in the fight: and the greater
      part of the Persian army was destroyed there on the spot, and Cyrus
      himself brought his life to an end there, after he had reigned in all
      thirty years wanting one. Then Tomyris filled a skin with human blood and
      had search made among the Persian dead for the corpse of Cyrus: and when
      she found it, she let his head down into the skin and doing outrage to the
      corpse she said at the same time this: "Though I yet live and have
      overcome thee in fight, nevertheless thou didst undo me by taking my son
      with craft: but I according to my threat will give thee thy fill of
      blood." Now as regards the end of the life of Cyrus there are many tales
      told, but this which I have related is to my mind the most worthy of
      belief.
    </p>
<p>
      215. As to the Massagetai, they wear a dress which is similar to that of
      the Scythians, and they have a manner of life which is also like theirs;
      and there are of them horsemen and also men who do not ride on horses (for
      they have both fashions), and moreover there are both archers and
      spearmen, and their custom it is to carry battle-axes; <a href="#linknote-220" id="linknoteref-220" class="pginternal">220</a>
      and for everything they use either gold or bronze, for in all that has to
      do with spear-points or arrow-heads or battle-axes they use bronze, but
      for head-dresses and girdles and belts round the arm-pits <a href="#linknote-221" id="linknoteref-221" class="pginternal">221</a>
      they employ gold as ornament: and in like manner as regards their horses,
      they put breast-plates of bronze about their chests, but on their bridles
      and bits and cheek-pieces they employ gold. Iron however and silver they
      use not at all, for they have them not in their land, but gold and bronze
      in abundance.
    </p>
<p>
      216. These are the customs which they have:—Each marries a wife, but
      they have their wives in common; for that which the Hellenes say that the
      Scythians do, is not in fact done by the Scythians but by the Massagetai,
      that is to say, whatever woman a man of the Massagetai may desire he hangs
      up his quiver in front of the waggon and has commerce with her freely.
      They have no precise limit of age laid down for their life, but when a man
      becomes very old, his nearest of kin come together and slaughter him
      solemnly <a href="#linknote-222" id="linknoteref-222" class="pginternal">222</a> and cattle also with him; and then after that
      they boil the flesh and banquet upon it. This is considered by them the
      happiest lot; but him who has ended his life by disease they do not eat,
      but cover him up in the earth, counting it a misfortune that he did not
      attain to being slaughtered. They sow no crops but live on cattle and on
      fish, which last they get in abundance from the river Araxes; moreover

<h2>
      BOOK II. THE SECOND BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED EUTERPE
    </h2>
<p>
      1. When Cyrus had brought his life to an end, Cambyses received the royal
      power in succession, being the son of Cyrus and of Cassandane the daughter
      of Pharnaspes, for whose death, which came about before his own, Cyrus had
      made great mourning himself and also had proclaimed to all those over whom
      he bore rule that they should make mourning for her: Cambyses, I say,
      being the son of this woman and of Cyrus, regarded the Ionians and
      Aiolians as slaves inherited from his father; and he proceeded to march an
      army against Egypt, taking with him as helpers not only the other nations
      of which he was the ruler, but also those of the Hellenes over whom he had
      power besides.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      2. Now the Egyptians, before the time when Psammetichos <a href="#link2note-1" id="link2noteref-1" class="pginternal">1</a> became
      king over them, were wont to suppose that they had come into being first
      of all men; but since the time when Psammetichos having become king
      desired to know what men had come into being first, they suppose that the
      Phrygians came into being before themselves, but they themselves before
      all other men. Now Psammetichos, when he was not able by inquiry to find
      out any means of knowing who had come into being first of all men,
      contrived a device of the following kind:—Taking two new-born
      children belonging to persons of the common sort he gave them to a
      shepherd to bring up at the place where his flocks were, with a manner of
      bringing up such as I shall say, charging him namely that no man should
      utter any word in their presence, and that they should be placed by
      themselves in a room where none might come, and at the proper time he
      should bring to them she-goats, and when he had satisfied them with milk
      he should do for them whatever else was needed. These things Psammetichos
      did and gave him this charge wishing to hear what word the children would
      let break forth first, after they had ceased from wailings without sense.
      And accordingly so it came to pass; for after a space of two years had
      gone by, during which the shepherd went on acting so, at length, when he
      opened the door and entered, both the children fell before him in entreaty
      and uttered the word <i>bekos</i>, stretching forth their hands. At first
      when he heard this the shepherd kept silence; but since this word was
      often repeated, as he visited them constantly and attended to them, at
      last he declared the matter to his master, and at his command he brought
      the children before his face. Then Psammetichos having himself also heard
      it, began to inquire about what nation of men named anything <i>bekos</i>,
      and inquiring he found that the Phrygians had this name for bread. In this
      manner and guided by an indication such as this, the Egyptians were
      brought to allow that the Phrygians were a more ancient people than
      themselves.
    </p>
<p>
      3. That so it came to pass I heard from the priests of that Hephaistos who
      dwells at Memphis; <a href="#link2note-2" id="link2noteref-2" class="pginternal">2</a> but the Hellenes relate, besides many other idle
      tales, that Psammetichos cut out the tongues of certain women, and then
      caused the children to live with these women.
    </p>
<p>
      With regard then to the rearing of the children they related so much as I
      have said: and I heard also other things at Memphis when I had speech with
      the priests of Hephaistos. Moreover I visited both Thebes and Heliopolis
      <a href="#link2note-3" id="link2noteref-3" class="pginternal">3</a> for
      this very cause, namely because I wished to know whether the priests at
      these places would agree in their accounts with those at Memphis; for the
      men of Heliopolis are said to be the most learned in records of the
      Egyptians. Those of their narrations which I heard with regard to the gods
      I am not earnest to relate in full, but I shall name them only, <a href="#link2note-4" id="link2noteref-4" class="pginternal">4</a>
      because I consider that all men are equally ignorant of these matters: <a href="#link2note-5" id="link2noteref-5" class="pginternal">5</a> and
      whatever things of them I may record, I shall record only because I am
      compelled by the course of the story.
    </p>
<p>
      4. But as to those matters which concern men, the priests agreed with one
      another in saying that the Egyptians were the first of all men on earth to
      find out the course of the year, having divided the seasons into twelve
      parts to make up the whole; and this they said they found out from the
      stars: and they reckon to this extent more wisely than the Hellenes, as it
      seems to me, inasmuch as the Hellenes throw in an intercalated month every
      other year, to make the seasons right, whereas the Egyptians, reckoning
      the twelve months at thirty days each, bring in also every year five days
      beyond the number, and thus the circle of their seasons is completed and
      comes round to the same point whence it set out. They said moreover that
      the Egyptians were the first who brought into use appellations for the
      twelve gods and the Hellenes took up the use from them; and that they were
      the first who assigned altars and images and temples to the gods, and who
      engraved figures on stones; and with regard to the greater number of these
      things they showed me by actual facts that they had happened so. They said
      also that the first man <a href="#link2note-6" id="link2noteref-6" class="pginternal">6</a> who became king of Egypt was Min; <a href="#link2note-7" id="link2noteref-7" class="pginternal">7</a> and
      that in his time all Egypt except the district of Thebes <a href="#link2note-8" id="link2noteref-8" class="pginternal">8</a> was a
      swamp, and none of the regions were then above water which now lie below
      the lake of Moiris, to which lake it is a voyage of seven days up the
      river from the sea:
    </p>
<p>
      5, and I thought that they said well about the land; for it is manifest in
      truth even to a person who has not heard it beforehand but has only seen,
      at least if he have understanding, that the Egypt to which the Hellenes
      come in ships is a land which has been won by the Egyptians as an
      addition, and that it is a gift of the river: moreover the regions which
      lie above this lake also for a distance of three days' sail, about which
      they did not go on to say anything of this kind, are nevertheless another
      instance of the same thing: for the nature of the land of Egypt is as
      follows:—First when you are still approaching it in a ship and are
      distant a day's run from the land, if you let down a sounding-line you
      will bring up mud and will find yourself in eleven fathoms. This then so
      far shows that there is a silting forward of the land.
    </p>
<p>
      6. Then secondly, as to Egypt itself, the extent of it along the sea is
      sixty <i>schoines</i>, according to our definition of Egypt as extending
      from the Gulf of Plinthine to the Serbonian lake, along which stretches
      Mount Casion; from this lake then <a href="#link2note-9" id="link2noteref-9" class="pginternal">9</a> the sixty <i>schoines</i>
      are reckoned: for those of men who are poor in land have their country
      measured by fathoms, those who are less poor by furlongs, those who have
      much land by parasangs, and those who have land in very great abundance by
      <i>schoines</i>: now the parasang is equal to thirty furlongs, and each <i>schoine</i>,
      which is an Egyptian measure, is equal to sixty furlongs. So there would
      be an extent of three thousand six hundred furlongs for the coast-land of
      Egypt. <a href="#link2note-10" id="link2noteref-10" class="pginternal">10</a>
</p>
<p>
      7. From thence and as far as Heliopolis inland Egypt is broad, and the
      land is all flat and without springs of water <a href="#link2note-11" id="link2noteref-11" class="pginternal">11</a> and formed of mud: and
      the road as one goes inland from the sea to Heliopolis is about the same
      in length as that which leads from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens
      to Pisa and the temple of Olympian Zeus: reckoning up you would find the
      difference very small by which these roads fail of being equal in length,
      not more indeed than fifteen furlongs; for the road from Athens to Pisa
      wants fifteen furlongs of being fifteen hundred, while the road to
      Heliopolis from the sea reaches that number completely.
    </p>
<p>
      8. From Heliopolis however, as you go up, Egypt is narrow; for on the one
      side a mountain-range belonging to Arabia stretches along by the side of
      it, going in a direction from North towards the midday and the South Wind,
      tending upwards without a break to that which is called the Erythraian
      Sea, in which range are the stone-quarries which were used in cutting
      stone for the pyramids at Memphis. On this side then the mountain ends
      where I have said, and then takes a turn back; <a href="#link2note-12" id="link2noteref-12" class="pginternal">12</a> and where it is widest,
      as I was informed, it is a journey of two months across from East to West;
      and the borders of it which turn towards the East are said to produce
      frankincense. Such then is the nature of this mountain-range; and on the
      side of Egypt towards Libya another range extends, rocky and enveloped in
      sand: in this are the pyramids, and it runs in the same direction as those
      parts of the Arabian mountains which go towards the midday. So then, I
      say, from Heliopolis the land has no longer a great extent so far as it
      belongs to Egypt, <a href="#link2note-13" id="link2noteref-13" class="pginternal">13</a> and for about four <a href="#link2note-14" id="link2noteref-14" class="pginternal">14</a> days' sail up the river
      Egypt properly so called is narrow: and the space between the
      mountain-ranges which have been mentioned is plain-land, but where it is
      narrowest it did not seem to me to exceed two hundred furlongs from the
      Arabian mountains to those which are called the Libyan. After this again
      Egypt is broad.
    </p>
<p>
      9. Such is the nature of this land: and from Heliopolis to Thebes is a
      voyage up the river of nine days, and the distance of the journey in
      furlongs is four thousand eight hundred and sixty, the number of the <i>schoines</i>
      being eighty-one. If these measures of Egypt in furlongs be put together
      the result is as follows:—I have already before this shown that the
      distance along the sea amounts to three thousand six hundred furlongs, and
      I will now declare what the distance is inland from the sea to Thebes,
      namely six thousand one hundred and twenty furlongs: and again the
      distance from Thebes to the city called Elephantine is one thousand eight
      hundred furlongs.
    </p>
<p>
      10. Of this land then, concerning which I have spoken, it seemed to myself
      also, according as the priests said, that the greater part had been won as
      an addition by the Egyptians; for it was evident to me that the space
      between the aforesaid mountain-ranges, which lie above the city of
      Memphis, once was a gulf of the sea, like the regions about Ilion and
      Teuthrania and Ephesos and the plain of the Maiander, if it be permitted
      to compare small things with great; and small these are in comparison, for
      of the rivers which heaped up the soil in those regions none is worthy to
      be compared in volume with a single one of the mouths of the Nile, which
      has five mouths. <a href="#link2note-15" id="link2noteref-15" class="pginternal">15</a> Moreover there are other rivers also, not in
      size at all equal to the Nile, which have performed great feats; of which
      I can mention the names of several, and especially the Acheloös, which
      flowing through Acarnania and so issuing out into the sea has already made
      half of the Echinades from islands into mainland.
    </p>
<p>
      11. Now there is in the land of Arabia, not far from Egypt, a gulf of the
      sea running in from that which is called the Erythraian Sea, very long and
      narrow, as I am about to tell. With respect to the length of the voyage
      along it, one who set out from the innermost point to sail out through it
      into the open sea, would spend forty days upon the voyage, using oars; <a href="#link2note-16" id="link2noteref-16" class="pginternal">16</a>
      and with respect to breadth, where the gulf is broadest it is half a day's
      sail across: and there is in it an ebb and flow of tide every day. Just
      such another gulf I suppose that Egypt was, and that the one ran in
      towards Ethiopia from the Northern Sea, and the other, the Arabian, of
      which I am about to speak, <a href="#link2note-17" id="link2noteref-17" class="pginternal">17</a> tended from the South towards Syria, the gulfs
      boring in so as almost to meet at their extreme points, and passing by one
      another with but a small space left between. If then the stream of the
      Nile should turn aside into this Arabian gulf, what would hinder that gulf
      from being filled up with silt as the river continued to flow, at all
      events within a period of twenty thousand years? indeed for my part I am
      of opinion that it would be filled up even within ten thousand years. How,
      then, in <a href="#link2note-18" id="link2noteref-18" class="pginternal">18</a> all the time that has elapsed before I came
      into being should not a gulf be filled up even of much greater size than
      this by a river so great and so active?
    </p>
<p>
      12. As regards Egypt then, I both believe those who say that things are
      so, and for myself also I am strongly of opinion that they are so; because
      I have observed that Egypt runs out into the sea further than the
      adjoining land, and that shells are found upon the mountains of it, and an
      efflorescence of salt forms upon the surface, so that even the pyramids
      are being eaten away by it, and moreover that of all the mountains of
      Egypt, the range which lies above Memphis is the only one which has sand:
      besides which I notice that Egypt resembles neither the land of Arabia,
      which borders upon it, nor Libya, nor yet Syria (for they are Syrians who
      dwell in the parts of Arabia lying along the sea), but that it has soil
      which is black and easily breaks up, <a href="#link2note-19" id="link2noteref-19" class="pginternal">19</a> seeing that it is in
      truth mud and silt brought down from Ethiopia by the river: but the soil
      of Libya, we know, is reddish in colour and rather sandy, while that of
      Arabia and Syria is somewhat clayey and rocky. <a href="#link2note-1901" id="link2noteref-1901" class="pginternal">1901</a>
</p>
<p>
      13. The priests also gave me a strong proof concerning this land as
      follows, namely that in the reign of king Moiris, whenever the river
      reached a height of at least eight cubits <a href="#link2note-20" id="link2noteref-20" class="pginternal">20</a> it watered Egypt below
      Memphis; and not yet nine hundred years had gone by since the death of
      Moiris, when I heard these things from the priests: now however, unless
      the river rises to sixteen cubits, or fifteen at the least, it does not go
      over the land. I think too that those Egyptians who dwell below the lake
      of Moiris and especially in that region which is called the Delta, if that
      land continues to grow in height according to this proportion and to
      increase similarly in extent, <a href="#link2note-21" id="link2noteref-21" class="pginternal">21</a> will suffer for all
      remaining time, from the Nile not overflowing their land, that same thing
      which they themselves said that the Hellenes would at some time suffer:
      for hearing that the whole land of the Hellenes has rain and is not
      watered by rivers as theirs is, they said that the Hellenes would at some
      time be disappointed of a great hope and would suffer the ills of famine.
      This saying means that if the god <a href="#link2note-22" id="link2noteref-22" class="pginternal">22</a> shall not send them
      rain, but shall allow drought to prevail for a long time, the Hellenes
      will be destroyed by hunger; for they have in fact no other supply of
      water to save them except from Zeus alone.
    </p>
<p>
      14. This has been rightly said by the Egyptians with reference to the
      Hellenes: but now let me tell how matters are with the Egyptians
      themselves in their turn. If, in accordance with what I before said, their
      land below Memphis (for this is that which is increasing) shall continue
      to increase in height according to the same proportion as in past time,
      assuredly those Egyptians who dwell here will suffer famine, if their land
      shall not have rain nor the river be able to go over their fields. It is
      certain however that now they gather in fruit from the earth with less
      labour than any other men and also with less than the other Egyptians; for
      they have no labour in breaking up furrows with a plough nor in hoeing nor
      in any other of those labours which other men have about a crop; but when
      the river has come up of itself and watered their fields and after
      watering has left them again, then each man sows his own field and turns
      into it swine, and when he has trodden the seed into the ground by means
      of the swine, after that he waits for the harvest; and when he has
      threshed the corn by means of the swine, then he gathers it in.
    </p>
<p>
      15. If we desire to follow the opinions of the Ionians as regards Egypt,
      who say that the Delta alone is Egypt, reckoning its sea-coast to be from
      the watch-tower called of Perseus to the fish-curing houses of Pelusion, a
      distance of forty <i>schoines</i>, and counting it to extend inland as far
      as the city of Kercasoros, where the Nile divides and runs to Pelusion and
      Canobos, while as for the rest of Egypt, they assign it partly to Libya
      and partly to Arabia,—if, I say, we should follow this account, we
      should thereby declare that in former times the Egyptians had no land to
      live in; for, as we have seen, their Delta at any rate is alluvial, and
      has appeared (so to speak) lately, as the Egyptians themselves say and as
      my opinion is. If then at the first there was no land for them to live in,
      why did they waste their labour to prove that they had come into being
      before all other men? They needed not to have made trial of the children
      to see what language they would first utter. However I am not of opinion
      that the Egyptians came into being at the same time as that which is
      called by the Ionians the Delta, but that they existed always ever since
      the human race came into being, and that as their land advanced forwards,
      many of them were left in their first abodes and many came down gradually
      to the lower parts. At least it is certain that in old times Thebes had
      the name of Egypt, and of this <a href="#link2note-23" id="link2noteref-23" class="pginternal">23</a> the circumference
      measures six thousand one hundred and twenty furlongs.
    </p>
<p>
      16. If then we judge aright of these matters, the opinion of the Ionians
      about Egypt is not sound: but if the judgment of the Ionians is right, I
      declare that neither the Hellenes nor the Ionians themselves know how to
      reckon since they say that the whole earth is made up of three divisions,
      Europe, Asia, and Libya: for they ought to count in addition to these the
      Delta of Egypt, since it belongs neither to Asia nor to Libya; for at
      least it cannot be the river Nile by this reckoning which divides Asia
      from Libya, <a href="#link2note-24" id="link2noteref-24" class="pginternal">24</a> but the Nile is cleft at the point of this
      Delta so as to flow round it, and the result is that this land would come
      between Asia and Libya. <a href="#link2note-25" id="link2noteref-25" class="pginternal">25</a>
</p>
<p>
      17. We dismiss then the opinion of the Ionians, and express a judgment of
      our own in this matter also, that Egypt is all that land which is
      inhabited by Egyptians, just as Kilikia is that which is inhabited by
      Kilikians and Assyria that which is inhabited by Assyrians, and we know of
      no boundary properly speaking between Asia and Libya except the borders of
      Egypt. If however we shall adopt the opinion which is commonly held by the
      Hellenes, we shall suppose that the whole of Egypt, beginning from the
      Cataract <a href="#link2note-26" id="link2noteref-26" class="pginternal">26</a> and the city of Elephantine, is divided into
      two parts and that it thus partakes of both the names, since one side will
      thus belong to Libya and the other to Asia; for the Nile from the Cataract
      onwards flows to the sea cutting Egypt through the midst; and as far as
      the city of Kercasoros the Nile flows in one single stream, but from this
      city onwards it is parted into three ways; and one, which is called the
      Pelusian mouth, turns towards the East; the second of the ways goes
      towards the West, and this is called the Canobic mouth; but that one of
      the ways which is straight runs thus,—when the river in its course
      downwards comes to the point of the Delta, then it cuts the Delta through
      the midst and so issues out to the sea. In this we have <a href="#link2note-27" id="link2noteref-27" class="pginternal">27</a> a
      portion of the water of the river which is not the smallest nor the least
      famous, and it is called the Sebennytic mouth. There are also two other
      mouths which part off from the Sebennytic and go to the sea, and these are
      called, one the Saïtic, the other the Mendesian mouth. The Bolbitinitic
      and Bucolic mouths, on the other hand, are not natural but made by
      digging.
    </p>
<p>
      18. Moreover also the answer given by the Oracle of Ammon bears witness in
      support of my opinion that Egypt is of the extent which I declare it to be
      in my account; and of this answer I heard after I had formed my own
      opinion about Egypt. For those of the city of Marea and of Apis, dwelling
      in the parts of Egypt which border on Libya, being of opinion themselves
      that they were Libyans and not Egyptians, and also being burdened by the
      rules of religious service, because they desired not to be debarred from
      the use of cows' flesh, sent to Ammon saying that they had nought in
      common with the Egyptians, for they dwelt outside the Delta and agreed
      with them in nothing; and they said they desired that it might be lawful
      for them to eat everything without distinction. The god however did not
      permit them to do so, but said that that land which was Egypt which the
      Nile came over and watered, and that those were Egyptians who dwelling
      below the city of Elephantine drank of that river. Thus it was answered to
      them by the Oracle about this:
    </p>
<p>
      19, and the Nile, when it is in flood, goes over not only the Delta but
      also of the land which is called Libyan and of that which is called
      Arabian sometimes as much as two days' journey on each side, and at times
      even more than this or at times less.
    </p>
<p>
      As regards the nature of the river, neither from the priests nor yet from
      any other man was I able to obtain any knowledge: and I was desirous
      especially to learn from them about these matters, namely why the Nile
      comes down increasing in volume from the summer solstice onwards for a
      hundred days, and then, when it has reached the number of these days,
      turns and goes back, failing in its stream, so that through the whole
      winter season it continues to be low, and until the summer solstice
      returns. Of none of these things was I able to receive any account from
      the Egyptians, when I inquired of them what power the Nile has whereby it
      is of a nature opposite to that of other rivers. And I made inquiry,
      desiring to know both this which I say and also why, unlike all other
      rivers, it does not give rise to any breezes blowing from it.
    </p>
<p>
      20. However some of the Hellenes who desired to gain distinction for
      cleverness have given an account of this water in three different ways:
      two of these I do not think it worth while even to speak of except only to
      indicate their nature; of which the one says that the Etesian Winds are
      the cause that makes the river rise, by preventing the Nile from flowing
      out into the sea. But often the Etesian Winds fail and yet the Nile does
      the same work as it is wont to do; and moreover, if these were the cause,
      all the other rivers also which flow in a direction opposed to the Etesian
      Winds ought to have been affected in the same way as the Nile, and even
      more, in as much as they are smaller and present to them a feebler flow of
      stream: but there are many of these rivers in Syria and many also in
      Libya, and they are affected in no such manner as the Nile.
    </p>
<p>
      21. The second way shows more ignorance than that which has been
      mentioned, and it is more marvellous to tell; <a href="#link2note-28" id="link2noteref-28" class="pginternal">28</a> for it says that the
      river produces these effects because it flows from the Ocean, and that the
      Ocean flows round the whole earth.
    </p>
<p>
      22. The third of the ways is much the most specious, but nevertheless it
      is the most mistaken of all: for indeed this way has no more truth in it
      than the rest, alleging as it does that the Nile flows from melting snow;
      whereas it flows out of Libya through the midst of the Ethiopians, and so
      comes out into Egypt. How then should it flow from snow, when it flows
      from the hottest parts to those which are cooler? And indeed most of the
      facts are such as to convince a man (one at least who is capable of
      reasoning about such matters), that it is not at all likely that it flows
      from snow. <a href="#link2note-29" id="link2noteref-29" class="pginternal">29</a> The first and greatest evidence is afforded by
      the winds, which blow hot from these regions; the second is that the land
      is rainless always and without frost, whereas after snow has fallen rain
      must necessarily come within five days, so that if it snowed in those
      parts rain would fall there; the third evidence is afforded by the people
      dwelling there, who are of a black colour by reason of the burning heat.
      Moreover kites and swallows remain there through the year and do not leave
      the land; and cranes flying from the cold weather which comes on in the
      region of Scythia come regularly to these parts for wintering: if then it
      snowed ever so little in that land through which the Nile flows and in
      which it has its rise, none of these things would take place, as necessity
      compels us to admit.
    </p>
<p>
      23. As for him who talked about the Ocean, he carried his tale into the
      region of the unknown, and so he need not be refuted; <a href="#link2note-30" id="link2noteref-30" class="pginternal">30</a>
      since I for my part know of no river Ocean existing, but I think that
      Homer or one of the poets who were before him invented the name and
      introduced it into his verse.
    </p>
<p>
      24. If however after I have found fault with the opinions proposed, I am
      bound to declare an opinion of my own about the matters which are in
      doubt, I will tell what to my mind is the reason why the Nile increases in
      the summer. In the winter season the Sun, being driven away from his
      former path through the heaven <a href="#link2note-31" id="link2noteref-31" class="pginternal">31</a> by the stormy winds,
      comes to the upper parts of Libya. If one would set forth the matter in
      the shortest way, all has now been said; for whatever region this god
      approaches most and stands directly above, this it may reasonably be
      supposed is most in want of water, and its native streams of rivers are
      dried up most.
    </p>
<p>
      25. However, to set it forth at greater length, thus it is:—the Sun
      passing in his course by the upper parts of Libya, does thus, that is to
      say, since at all times the air in those parts is clear and the country is
      warm, because there are no cold winds, <a href="#link2note-32" id="link2noteref-32" class="pginternal">32</a> in passing through it
      the Sun does just as he was wont to do in the summer, when going through
      the midst of the heaven, that is he draws to himself the water, and having
      drawn it he drives it away to the upper parts of the country, and the
      winds take it up and scattering it abroad melt it into rain; so it is
      natural that the winds which blow from this region, namely the South and
      South-west Winds, should be much the most rainy of all the winds. I think
      however that the Sun does not send away from himself all the water of the
      Nile of each year, but that he also lets some remain behind with himself.
      Then when the winter becomes milder, the Sun returns back again to the
      midst of the heaven, and from that time onwards he draws equally from all
      rivers; but in the meanwhile they flow in large volume, since water of
      rain mingles with them in great quantity, because their country receives
      rain then and is filled with torrent streams. In summer however they are
      weak, since not only the showers of rain fail then, but also they are
      drawn by the Sun. The Nile however, alone of all rivers, not having rain
      and being drawn by the Sun, naturally flows during this time of winter in
      much less than its proper volume, that is much less than in summer; <a href="#link2note-33" id="link2noteref-33" class="pginternal">33</a>
      for then it is drawn equally with all the other waters, but in winter it
      bears the burden alone. Thus I suppose the Sun to be the cause of these
      things.
    </p>
<p>
      26. He is also the cause in my opinion that the air in these parts is dry,
      since he makes it so by scorching up his path through the heaven: <a href="#link2note-34" id="link2noteref-34" class="pginternal">34</a>
      thus summer prevails always in the upper parts of Libya. If however the
      station of the seasons had been changed, and where now in the heaven are
      placed the North Wind and winter, there was the station of the South Wind
      and of the midday, and where now is placed the South Wind, there was the
      North, if this had been so, the Sun being driven from the midst of the
      heaven by the winter and the North Wind would go to the upper parts of
      Europe, just as now he comes to the upper parts of Libya, and passing in
      his course throughout the whole of Europe I suppose that he would do to
      the Ister that which he now works upon the Nile.
    </p>
<p>
      27. As to the breeze, why none blows from the river, my opinion is that
      from very hot places it is not natural that anything should blow, and that
      a breeze is wont to blow from something cold.
    </p>
<p>
      28. Let these matters then be as they are and as they were at the first:
      but as to the sources of the Nile, not one either of the Egyptians or of
      the Libyans or of the Hellenes, who came to speech with me, professed to
      know anything, except the scribe of the sacred treasury of Athene at the
      city of Saïs in Egypt. To me however this man seemed not to be speaking
      seriously when he said that he had certain knowledge of it; and he said as
      follows, namely that there were two mountains of which the tops ran up to
      a sharp point, situated between the city of Syene, which is in the
      district of Thebes, and Elephantine, and the names of the mountains were,
      of the one Crophi and of the other Mophi. From the middle between these
      two mountains flowed (he said) the sources of the Nile, which were
      fathomless in depth, and half of the water flowed to Egypt and towards the
      North Wind, the other half to Ethiopia and the South Wind. As for the
      fathomless depth of the source, he said that Psammetichos king of Egypt
      came to a trial of this matter; for he had a rope twisted of many
      thousands of fathoms and let it down in this place, and it found no
      bottom. By this the scribe (if this which he told me was really as he
      said) gave me to understand <a href="#link2note-35" id="link2noteref-35" class="pginternal">35</a> that there were certain strong eddies there
      and a backward flow, and that since the water dashed against the
      mountains, therefore the sounding-line could not come to any bottom when
      it was let down.
    </p>
<p>
      29. From no other person was I able to learn anything about this matter;
      but for the rest I learnt so much as here follows by the most diligent
      inquiry; <a href="#link2note-36" id="link2noteref-36" class="pginternal">36</a> for I went myself as an eye-witness as far as
      the city of Elephantine and from that point onwards I gathered knowledge
      by report. From the city of Elephantine as one goes up the river there is
      country which slopes steeply; so that here one must attach ropes to the
      vessel on both sides, as one fastens an ox, and so make one's way onward;
      and if the rope break, the vessel is gone at once, carried away by the
      violence of the stream. Through this country it is a voyage of about four
      days in length, and in this part the Nile is winding like the river
      Maiander, and the distance amounts to twelve <i>schoines</i>, which one
      must traverse in this manner. Then you will come to a level plain, in
      which the Nile flows round an island named Tachompso. (Now in the regions
      above Elephantine there dwell Ethiopians at once succeeding, who also
      occupy half of the island, <a href="#link2note-37" id="link2noteref-37" class="pginternal">37</a> and Egyptians the other half.) Adjoining this
      island there is a great lake, round which dwell Ethiopian nomad tribes;
      and when you have sailed through this you will come to the stream of the
      Nile again, which flows into this lake. After this you will disembark and
      make a journey by land of forty days; for in the Nile sharp rocks stand
      forth out of the water, and there are many reefs, by which it is not
      possible for a vessel to pass. Then after having passed through this
      country in the forty days which I have said, you will embark again in
      another vessel and sail for twelve days; and after this you will come to a
      great city called Meroe. This city is said to be the mother-city of all
      the other Ethiopians: and they who dwell in it reverence of the gods Zeus
      and Dionysos alone, and these they greatly honour; and they have an Oracle
      of Zeus established, and make warlike marches whensoever this god commands
      them by prophesyings and to whatsoever place he commands.
    </p>
<p>
      30. Sailing from this city you will come to the "Deserters" in another
      period of time equal to that in which you came from Elephantine to the
      mother-city of the Ethiopians. Now the name of these "Deserters" is <i>Asmach</i>,
      and this word signifies, when translated into the tongue of the Hellenes,
      "those who stand on the left hand of the king." These were two hundred and
      forty thousand Egyptians of the warrior class, who revolted and went over
      to the Ethiopians for the following cause:—In the reign of
      Psammetichos garrisons were set, one towards the Ethiopians at the city of
      Elephantine, another towards the Arabians and Assyrians at Daphnai of
      Pelusion, and another towards Libya at Marea: and even in my own time the
      garrisons of the Persians too are ordered in the same manner as these were
      in the reign of Psammetichos, for both at Elephantine and at Daphnai the
      Persians have outposts. The Egyptians then of whom I speak had served as
      outposts for three years and no one relieved them from their guard;
      accordingly they took counsel together, and adopting a common plan they
      all in a body revolted from Psammetichos and set out for Ethiopia. Hearing
      this Psammetichos set forth in pursuit, and when he came up with them he
      entreated them much and endeavoured to persuade them not to desert the
      gods of their country and their children and wives: upon which it is said
      that one of them pointed to his privy member and said that wherever this
      was, there would they have both children and wives. When these came to
      Ethiopia they gave themselves over to the king of the Ethiopians; and he
      rewarded them as follows:—there were certain of the Ethiopians who
      had come to be at variance with him; and he bade them drive these out and
      dwell in their land. So since these men settled in the land of the
      Ethiopians, the Ethiopians have come to be of milder manners, from having
      learnt the customs of the Egyptians.
    </p>
<p>
      31. The Nile then, besides that part of its course which is in Egypt, is
      known as far as a four months' journey by river and land: for that is the
      number of months which are found by reckoning to be spent in going from
      Elephantine to these "Deserters": and the river runs from the West and the
      setting of the sun. But what comes after that no one can clearly say; for
      this land is desert by reason of the burning heat.
    </p>
<p>
      32. Thus much however I heard from men of Kyrene, who told me that they
      had been to the Oracle of Ammon, and had come to speech with Etearchos
      king of the Ammonians: and it happened that after speaking of other
      matters they fell to discourse about the Nile and how no one knew the
      sources of it; and Etearchos said that once there had come to him men of
      the Nasamonians (this is a Libyan race which dwells in the Syrtis, and
      also in the land to the East of the Syrtis reaching to no great distance),
      and when the Nasamonians came and were asked by him whether they were able
      to tell him anything more than he knew about the desert parts of Libya,
      they said that there had been among them certain sons of chief men, who
      were of unruly disposition; and these when they grew up to be men had
      devised various other extravagant things and also they had told off by lot
      five of themselves to go to see the desert parts of Libya and to try
      whether they could discover more than those who had previously explored
      furthest: for in those parts of Libya which are by the Northern Sea,
      beginning from Egypt and going as far as the headland of Soloeis, which is
      the extreme point of Libya, Libyans (and of them many races) extend along
      the whole coast, except so much as the Hellenes and Phenicians hold; but
      in the upper parts, which lie above the sea-coast and above those people
      whose land comes down to the sea, Libya is full of wild beasts; and in the
      parts above the land of wild beasts it is full of sand, terribly waterless
      and utterly desert. These young men then (said they), being sent out by
      their companions well furnished with supplies of water and provisions,
      went first through the inhabited country, and after they had passed
      through this they came to the country of wild beasts, and after this they
      passed through the desert, making their journey towards the West Wind; and
      having passed through a great tract of sand in many days, they saw at last
      trees growing in a level place; and having come up to them, they were
      beginning to pluck the fruit which was upon the trees: but as they began
      to pluck it, there came upon them small men, of less stature than men of
      the common size, and these seized them and carried them away; and neither
      could the Nasamonians understand anything of their speech nor could those
      who were carrying them off understand anything of the speech of the
      Nasamonians: and they led them (so it was said) through very great swamps,
      and after passing through these they came to a city in which all the men
      were in size like those who carried them off and in colour of skin black;
      and by the city ran a great river, which ran from the West towards the
      sunrising, and in it were seen crocodiles.
    </p>
<p>
      33. Of the account given by Etearchos the Ammonian let so much suffice as
      is here said, except that, as the men of Kyrene told me, he alleged that
      the Nasamonians returned safe home, and that the people to whom they had
      come were all wizards. Now this river which ran by the city, Etearchos
      conjectured to be the Nile, and moreover reason compels us to think so;
      for the Nile flows from Libya and cuts Libya through in the midst, and as
      I conjecture, judging of what is not known by that which is evident to the
      view, it starts at a distance from its mouth equal to that of the Ister:
      for the river Ister begins from the Keltoi and the city of Pyrene and so
      runs that it divides Europe in the midst (now the Keltoi are outside the
      Pillars of Heracles and border upon the Kynesians, who dwell furthest
      towards the sunset of all those who have their dwelling in Europe); and
      the Ister ends, having its course through the whole of Europe, by flowing
      into the Euxine Sea at the place where the Milesians have their settlement
      of Istria.
    </p>
<p>
      34. Now the Ister, since it flows through land which is inhabited, is
      known by the reports of many; but of the sources of the Nile no one can
      give an account, for the part of Libya through which it flows is
      uninhabited and desert. About its course however so much as it was
      possible to learn by the most diligent inquiry has been told; and it runs
      out into Egypt. Now Egypt lies nearly opposite to the mountain districts
      of Kilikia; and from thence to Sinope, which lies upon the Euxine Sea, is
      a journey in the same straight line of five days for a man without
      encumbrance; <a href="#link2note-3701" id="link2noteref-3701" class="pginternal">3701</a> and Sinope lies opposite to the place
      where the Ister runs out into the sea: thus I think that the Nile passes
      through the whole of Libya and is of equal measure with the Ister.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      Of the Nile then let so much suffice as has been said.
    </p>
<p>
      35. Of Egypt however I shall make my report at length, because it has
      wonders more in number than any other land, and works too it has to show
      as much as any land, which are beyond expression great: for this reason
      then more shall be said concerning it.
    </p>
<p>
      The Egyptians in agreement with their climate, which is unlike any other,
      and with the river, which shows a nature different from all other rivers,
      established for themselves manners and customs in a way opposite to other
      men in almost all matters: for among them the women frequent the market
      and carry on trade, while the men remain at home and weave; and whereas
      others weave pushing the woof upwards, the Egyptians push it downwards:
      the men carry their burdens upon their heads and the women upon their
      shoulders: the women make water standing up and the men crouching down:
      they ease themselves in their houses and they eat without in the streets,
      alleging as reason for this that it is right to do secretly the things
      that are unseemly though necessary, but those which are not unseemly, in
      public: no woman is a minister either of male or female divinity, but men
      of all, both male and female: to support their parents the sons are in no
      way compelled, if they do not desire to do so, but the daughters are
      forced to do so, be they never so unwilling.
    </p>
<p>
      36. The priests of the gods in other lands wear long hair, but in Egypt
      they shave their heads: among other men the custom is that in mourning
      those whom the matter concerns most nearly have their hair cut short, but
      the Egyptians, when deaths occur, let their hair grow long, both that on
      the head and that on the chin, having before been close shaven: other men
      have their daily living separated from beasts, but the Egyptians have
      theirs together with beasts: other men live on wheat and barley, but to
      any one of the Egyptians who makes his living on these it is a great
      reproach; they make their bread of maize, <a href="#link2note-38" id="link2noteref-38" class="pginternal">38</a> which some call spelt;
      <a href="#link2note-39" id="link2noteref-39" class="pginternal">39</a>
      they knead dough with their feet and clay with their hands, with which
      also they gather up dung: and whereas other men, except such as have
      learnt otherwise from the Egyptians, have their members as nature made
      them, the Egyptians practise circumcision: as to garments, the men wear
      two each and the women but one: and whereas others make fast the rings and
      ropes of the sails outside the ship, the Egyptians do this inside: finally
      in the writing of characters and reckoning with pebbles, while the
      Hellenes carry the hand from the left to the right, the Egyptians do this
      from the right to the left; and doing so they say that they do it
      themselves rightwise and the Hellenes leftwise: and they use two kinds of
      characters for writing, of which the one kind is called sacred and the
      other common. <a href="#link2note-40" id="link2noteref-40" class="pginternal">40</a>
</p>
<p>
      37. They are religious excessively beyond all other men, and with regard
      to this they have customs as follows:—they drink from cups of bronze
      and rinse them out every day, and not some only do this but all: they wear
      garments of linen always newly washed, and this they make a special point
      of practice: they circumcise themselves for the sake of cleanliness,
      preferring to be clean rather than comely. The priests shave themselves
      all over their body every other day, so that no lice or any other foul
      thing may come to be upon them when they minister to the gods; and the
      priests wear garments of linen only and sandals of papyrus, and any other
      garment they may not take nor other sandals; these wash themselves in cold
      water twice in the day and twice again in the night; and other religious
      services they perform (one may almost say) of infinite number. <a href="#link2note-41" id="link2noteref-41" class="pginternal">41</a>
      They enjoy also good things not a few, for they do not consume or spend
      anything of their own substance, but there is sacred bread baked for them
      and they have each great quantity of flesh of oxen and geese coming in to
      them each day, and also wine of grapes is given to them; but it is not
      permitted to them to taste of fish: beans moreover the Egyptians do not at
      all sow in their land, and those which grow they neither eat raw nor boil
      for food; nay the priests do not endure even to look upon them, thinking
      this to be an unclean kind of pulse: and there is not one priest only for
      each of the gods but many, and of them one is chief-priest, and whenever a
      priest dies his son is appointed to his place.
    </p>
<p>
      38. The males of the ox kind they consider to belong to Epaphos, and on
      account of him they test them in the following manner:—If the priest
      sees one single black hair upon the beast he counts it not clean for
      sacrifice; and one of the priests who is appointed for the purpose makes
      investigation of these matters, both when the beast is standing upright
      and when it is lying on its back, drawing out its tongue moreover, to see
      if it is clean in respect of the appointed signs, which I shall tell of in
      another part of the history: <a href="#link2note-42" id="link2noteref-42" class="pginternal">42</a> he looks also at the hairs of the tail to see
      if it has them growing in the natural manner: and if it be clean in
      respect of all these things, he marks it with a piece of papyrus, rolling
      this round the horns, and then when he has plastered sealing-earth over it
      he sets upon it the seal of his signet-ring, and after that they take the
      animal away. But for one who sacrifices a beast not sealed the penalty
      appointed is death.
    </p>
<p>
      39. In this way then the beast is tested; and their appointed manner of
      sacrifice is as follows:—they lead the sealed beast to the altar
      where they happen to be sacrificing and then kindle a fire: after that,
      having poured libations of wine over the altar so that it runs down upon
      the victim and having called upon the god, they cut its throat, and having
      cut its throat they sever the head from the body. The body then of the
      beast they flay, but upon the head <a href="#link2note-43" id="link2noteref-43" class="pginternal">43</a> they make many
      imprecations first, and then they who have a market and Hellenes
      sojourning among them for trade, these carry it to the market-place and
      sell it, while they who have no Hellenes among them cast it away into the
      river: and this is the form of imprecation which they utter upon the
      heads, praying that if any evil be about to befall either themselves who
      are offering sacrifice or the land of Egypt in general, it may come rather
      upon this head. Now as regards the heads of the beasts which are
      sacrificed and the pouring over them of the wine, all the Egyptians have
      the same customs equally for all their sacrifices; and by reason of this
      custom none of the Egyptians eat of the head either of this or of any
      other kind of animal:
    </p>
<p>
      40, but the manner of disembowelling the victims and of burning them is
      appointed among them differently for different sacrifices; I shall speak
      however of the sacrifices to that goddess whom they regard as the greatest
      of all, and to whom they celebrate the greatest feast.—When they
      have flayed the bullock and made imprecation, they take out the whole of
      its lower entrails but leave in the body the upper entrails and the fat;
      and they sever from it the legs and the end of the loin and the shoulders
      and the neck: and this done, they fill the rest of the body of the animal
      with consecrated <a href="#link2note-44" id="link2noteref-44" class="pginternal">44</a> loaves and honey and raisins and figs and
      frankincense and myrrh and every other kind of spices, and having filled
      it with these they offer it, pouring over it great abundance of oil. They
      make their sacrifice after fasting, and while the offerings are being
      burnt, they all beat themselves for mourning, and when they have finished
      beating themselves they set forth as a feast that which they left unburnt
      of the sacrifice.
    </p>
<p>
      41. The clean males then of the ox kind, both full-grown animals and
      calves, are sacrificed by all the Egyptians; the females however they may
      not sacrifice, but these are sacred to Isis; for the figure of Isis is in
      the form of a woman with cow's horns, just as the Hellenes present Io in
      pictures, and all the Egyptians without distinction reverence cows far
      more than any other kind of cattle; for which reason neither man nor woman
      of Egyptian race would kiss a man who is a Hellene on the mouth, nor will
      they use a knife or roasting-spits or a caldron belonging to a Hellene,
      nor taste of the flesh even of a clean animal if it has been cut with the
      knife of a Hellene. And the cattle of this kind which die they bury in the
      following manner:—the females they cast into the river, but the
      males they bury, each people in the suburb of their town, with one of the
      horns, or sometimes both, protruding to mark the place; and when the
      bodies have rotted away and the appointed time comes on, then to each city
      comes a boat <a href="#link2note-45" id="link2noteref-45" class="pginternal">45</a> from that which is called the island of
      Prosopitis (this is in the Delta, and the extent of its circuit is nine <i>schoines</i>).
      In this island of Prosopitis is situated, besides many other cities, that
      one from which the boats come to take up the bones of the oxen, and the
      name of the city is Atarbechis, and in it there is set up a holy temple of
      Aphrodite. From this city many go abroad in various directions, some to
      one city and others to another, and when they have dug up the bones of the
      oxen they carry them off, and coming together they bury them in one single
      place. In the same manner as they bury the oxen they bury also their other
      cattle when they die; for about them also they have the same law laid
      down, and these also they abstain from killing.
    </p>
<p>
      42. Now all who have a temple set up to the Theban Zeus or who are of the
      district of Thebes, these, I say, all sacrifice goats and abstain from
      sheep: for not all the Egyptians equally reverence the same gods, except
      only Isis and Osiris (who they say is Dionysos), these they all reverence
      alike: but they who have a temple of Mendes or belong to the Mendesian
      district, these abstain from goats and sacrifice sheep. Now the men of
      Thebes and those who after their example abstain from sheep, say that this
      custom was established among them for the cause which follows:—Heracles
      (they say) had an earnest desire to see Zeus, and Zeus did not desire to
      be seen of him; and at last when Heracles was urgent in entreaty Zeus
      contrived this device, that is to say, he flayed a ram and held in front
      of him the head of the ram which he had cut off, and he put on over him
      the fleece and then showed himself to him. Hence the Egyptians make the
      image of Zeus into the face of a ram; and the Ammonians do so also after
      their example, being settlers both from the Egyptians and from the
      Ethiopians, and using a language which is a medley of both tongues: and in
      my opinion it is from this god that the Ammonians took the name which they
      have, for the Egyptians call Zeus <i>Amun</i>. The Thebans then do not
      sacrifice rams but hold them sacred for this reason; on one day however in
      the year, on the feast of Zeus, they cut up in the same manner and flay
      one single ram and cover with its skin the image of Zeus, and then they
      bring up to it another image of Heracles. This done, all who are in the
      temple beat themselves in lamentation for the ram, and then they bury it
      in a sacred tomb.
    </p>
<p>
      43. About Heracles I heard the account given that he was of the number of
      the twelve gods; but of the other Heracles whom the Hellenes know I was
      not able to hear in any part of Egypt: and moreover to prove that the
      Egyptians did not take the name of Heracles from the Hellenes, but rather
      the Hellenes from the Egyptians,—that is to say those of the
      Hellenes who gave the name Heracles to the son of Amphitryon,—of
      that, I say, besides many other evidences there is chiefly this, namely
      that the parents of this Heracles, Amphitryon and Alcmene, were both of
      Egypt by descent, <a href="#link2note-46" id="link2noteref-46" class="pginternal">46</a> and also that the Egyptians say that they do
      not know the names either of Poseidon or of the Dioscuroi, nor have these
      been accepted by them as gods among the other gods; whereas if they had
      received from the Hellenes the name of any divinity, they would naturally
      have preserved the memory of these most of all, assuming that in those
      times as now some of the Hellenes were wont to make voyages <a href="#link2note-4601" id="link2noteref-4601" class="pginternal">4601</a>
      and were sea-faring folk, as I suppose and as my judgment compels me to
      think; so that the Egyptians would have learnt the names of these gods
      even more than that of Heracles. In fact however Heracles is a very
      ancient Egyptian god; and (as they say themselves) it is seventeen
      thousand years to the beginning of the reign of Amasis from the time when
      the twelve gods, of whom they count that Heracles is one, were begotten of
      the eight gods.
    </p>
<p>
      44. I moreover, desiring to know something certain of these matters so far
      as might be, made a voyage also to Tyre of Phenicia, hearing that in that
      place there was a holy temple of Heracles; and I saw that it was richly
      furnished with many votive offerings besides, and especially there were in
      it two pillars, <a href="#link2note-47" id="link2noteref-47" class="pginternal">47</a> the one of pure gold and the other of an
      emerald stone of such size as to shine by night: <a href="#link2note-48" id="link2noteref-48" class="pginternal">48</a> and having come to
      speech with the priests of the god, I asked them how long time it was
      since their temple had been set up: and these also I found to be at
      variance with the Hellenes, for they said that at the same time when Tyre
      was founded, the temple of the god also had been set up, and that it was a
      period of two thousand three hundred years since their people began to
      dwell at Tyre. I saw also at Tyre another temple of Heracles, with the
      surname Thasian; and I came to Thasos also and there I found a temple of
      Heracles set up by the Phenicians, who had sailed out to seek for Europa
      and had colonised Thasos; and these things happened full five generations
      of men before Heracles the son of Amphitryon was born in Hellas. So then
      my inquiries show clearly that Heracles is an ancient god, and those of
      the Hellenes seem to me to act most rightly who have two temples of
      Heracles set up, and who sacrifice to the one as an immortal god and with
      the title Olympian, and make offerings of the dead <a href="#link2note-49" id="link2noteref-49" class="pginternal">49</a> to the other as a hero.
    </p>
<p>
      45. Moreover, besides many other stories which the Hellenes tell without
      due consideration, this tale is especially foolish which they tell about
      Heracles, namely that when he came to Egypt, the Egyptians put on him
      wreaths and led him forth in procession to sacrifice him to Zeus; and he
      for some time kept quiet, but when they were beginning the sacrifice of
      him at the altar, he betook himself to prowess and slew them all. I for my
      part am of opinion that the Hellenes when they tell this tale are
      altogether without knowledge of the nature and customs of the Egyptians;
      for how should they for whom it is not lawful to sacrifice even beasts,
      except swine <a href="#link2note-50" id="link2noteref-50" class="pginternal">50</a> and the males of oxen and calves (such of them
      as are clean) and geese, how should these sacrifice human beings? Besides
      this, how is it in nature possible that Heracles, being one person only
      and moreover a man (as they assert), should slay many myriads? Having said
      so much of these matters, we pray that we may have grace from both the
      gods and the heroes for our speech.
    </p>
<p>
      46. Now the reason why those of the Egyptians whom I have mentioned do not
      sacrifice goats, female or male, is this:—the Mendesians count Pan
      to be one of the eight gods (now these eight gods they say came into being
      before the twelve gods), and the painters and image-makers represent in
      painting and in sculpture the figure of Pan, just as the Hellenes do, with
      goat's face and legs, not supposing him to be really like this but to
      resemble the other gods; the cause however why they represent him in this
      form I prefer not to say. The Mendesians then reverence all goats and the
      males more than the females (and the goatherds too have greater honour
      than other herdsmen), but of the goats one especially is reverenced, and
      when he dies there is great mourning in all the Mendesian district: and
      both the goat and Pan are called in the Egyptian tongue <i>Mendes</i>.
      Moreover in my lifetime there happened in that district this marvel, that
      is to say a he-goat had intercourse with a woman publicly, and this was so
      done that all men might have evidence of it.
    </p>
<p>
      47. The pig is accounted by the Egyptians an abominable animal; and first,
      if any of them in passing by touch a pig, he goes into the river and dips
      himself forthwith in the water together with his garments; and then too
      swineherds, though they be native Egyptians, unlike all others do not
      enter any of the temples in Egypt, nor is anyone willing to give his
      daughter in marriage to one of them or to take a wife from among them; but
      the swineherds both give in marriage to one another and take from one
      another. Now to the other gods the Egyptians do not think it right to
      sacrifice swine; but to the Moon and to Dionysos alone at the same time
      and on the same full-moon they sacrifice swine, and then eat their flesh:
      and as to the reason why, when they abominate swine at all their other
      feasts, they sacrifice them at this, there is a story told by the
      Egyptians; and this story I know, but it is not a seemly one for me to
      tell. Now the sacrifice of the swine to the Moon is performed as follows:—when
      the priest has slain the victim, he puts together the end of the tail and
      the spleen and the caul, and covers them up with the whole of the fat of
      the animal which is about the paunch, and then he offers them with fire;
      and the rest of the flesh they eat on that day of full moon upon which
      they have held the sacrifice, but on any day after this they will not
      taste of it: the poor however among them by reason of the scantiness of
      their means shape pigs of dough and having baked them they offer these as
      a sacrifice.
    </p>
<p>
      48. Then for Dionysos on the eve of the festival each one kills a pig by
      cutting its throat before his own doors, and after that he gives the pig
      to the swineherd who sold it to him, to carry away again; and the rest of
      the feast of Dionysos is celebrated by the Egyptians in the same way as by
      the Hellenes in almost all things except choral dances, but instead of the
      <i>phallos</i> they have invented another contrivance, namely figures of
      about a cubit in height worked by strings, which women carry about the
      villages, with the privy member made to move and not much less in size
      than the rest of the body: and a flute goes before and they follow singing
      the praises of Dionysos. As to the reason why the figure has this member
      larger than is natural and moves it, though it moves no other part of the
      body, about this there is a sacred story told.
    </p>
<p>
      49. Now I think that Melampus the son of Amytheon was not without
      knowledge of these rites of sacrifice, but was acquainted with them: for
      Melampus is he who first set forth to the Hellenes the name of Dionysos
      and the manner of sacrifice and the procession of the <i>phallos</i>.
      Strictly speaking indeed, he when he made it known did not take in the
      whole, but those wise men who came after him made it known more at large.
      Melampus then is he who taught of the <i>phallos</i> which is carried in
      procession for Dionysos, and from him the Hellenes learnt to do that which
      they do. I say then that Melampus being a man of ability contrived for
      himself an art of divination, and having learnt from Egypt he taught the
      Hellenes many things, and among them those that concern Dionysos, making
      changes in some few points of them: for I shall not say that that which is
      done in worship of the god in Egypt came accidentally to be the same with
      that which is done among the Hellenes, for then these rites would have
      been in character with the Hellenic worship and not lately brought in; nor
      certainly shall I say that the Egyptians took from the Hellenes either
      this or any other customary observance: but I think it most probable that
      Melampus learnt the matters concerning Dionysos from Cadmos the Tyrian and
      from those who came with him from Phenicia to the land which we now call
      Boeotia.
    </p>
<p>
      50. Moreover the naming <a href="#link2note-51" id="link2noteref-51" class="pginternal">51</a> of almost all the gods has come to Hellas from
      Egypt: for that it has come from the Barbarians I find by inquiry is true,
      and I am of opinion that most probably it has come from Egypt, because,
      except in the case of Poseidon and the Dioscuroi (in accordance with that
      which I have said before), and also of Hera and Hestia and Themis and the
      Charites and Nereïds, the Egyptians have had the names of all the other
      gods in their country for all time. What I say here is that which the
      Egyptians think themselves: but as for the gods whose names they profess
      that they do not know, these I think received their naming from the
      Pelasgians, except Poseidon; but about this god the Hellenes learnt from
      the Libyans, for no people except the Libyans have had the name of
      Poseidon from the first and have paid honour to this god always. Nor, it
      may be added, have the Egyptians any custom of worshipping heroes.
    </p>
<p>
      51. These observances then, and others besides these which I shall
      mention, the Hellenes have adopted from the Egyptians; but to make, as
      they do, the images of Hermes with the <i>phallos</i> they have learnt not
      from the Egyptians but from the Pelasgians, the custom having been
      received by the Athenians first of all the Hellenes and from these by the
      rest; for just at the time when the Athenians were beginning to rank among
      the Hellenes, the Pelasgians became dwellers with them in their land, and
      from this very cause it was that they began to be counted as Hellenes.
      Whosoever has been initiated in the mysteries of the Cabeiroi, which the
      Samothrakians perform having received them from the Pelasgians, that man
      knows the meaning of my speech; for these very Pelasgians who became
      dwellers with the Athenians used to dwell before that time in Samothrake,
      and from them the Samothrakians received their mysteries. So then the
      Athenians were the first of the Hellenes who made the images of Hermes
      with the <i>phallos</i>, having learnt from the Pelasgians; and the
      Pelasgians told a sacred story about it, which is set forth in the
      mysteries in Samothrake.
    </p>
<p>
      52. Now the Pelasgians formerly were wont to make all their sacrifices
      calling upon the gods in prayer, as I know from that which I heard at
      Dodona, but they gave no title or name to any of them, for they had not
      yet heard any, but they called them gods ({theous}) from some such notion
      as this, that they had set ({thentes}) in order all things and so had the
      distribution of everything. Afterwards, when much time had elapsed, they
      learnt from Egypt the names of the gods, all except Dionysos, for his name
      they learnt long afterwards; and after a time the Pelasgians consulted the
      Oracle at Dodona about the names, for this prophetic seat is accounted to
      be the most ancient of the Oracles which are among the Hellenes, and at
      that time it was the only one. So when the Pelasgians asked the Oracle at
      Dodona whether they should adopt the names which had come from the
      Barbarians, the Oracle in reply bade them make use of the names. From this
      time they sacrificed using the names of the gods, and from the Pelasgians
      the Hellenes afterwards received them:
    </p>
<p>
      53, but whence the several gods had their birth, or whether they all were
      from the beginning, and of what form they are, they did not learn till
      yesterday, as it were, or the day before: for Hesiod and Homer I suppose
      were four hundred years before my time and not more, and these are they
      who made a theogony for the Hellenes and gave the titles to the gods and
      distributed to them honours and arts, and set forth their forms: but the
      poets who are said to have been before these men were really in my opinion
      after them. Of these things the first are said by the priestesses of
      Dodona, and the latter things, those namely which have regard to Hesiod
      and Homer, by myself.
    </p>
<p>
      54. As regards the Oracles both that among the Hellenes and that in Libya,
      the Egyptians tell the following tale. The priests of the Theban Zeus told
      me that two women in the service of the temple had been carried away from
      Thebes by Phenicians, and that they had heard that one of them had been
      sold to go into Libya and the other to the Hellenes; and these women, they
      said, were they who first founded the prophetic seats among the nations
      which have been named: and when I inquired whence they knew so perfectly
      of this tale which they told, they said in reply that a great search had
      been made by the priests after these women, and that they had not been
      able to find them, but they had heard afterwards this tale about them
      which they were telling.
    </p>
<p>
      55. This I heard from the priests at Thebes, and what follows is said by
      the prophetesses <a href="#link2note-52" id="link2noteref-52" class="pginternal">52</a> of Dodona. They say that two black doves flew
      from Thebes to Egypt, and came one of them to Libya and the other to their
      land. And this latter settled upon an oak-tree <a href="#link2note-53" id="link2noteref-53" class="pginternal">53</a> and spoke with human
      voice, saying that it was necessary that a prophetic seat of Zeus should
      be established in that place; and they supposed that that was of the gods
      which was announced to them, and made one accordingly: and the dove which
      went away to the Libyans, they say, bade the Libyans to make an Oracle of
      Ammon; and this also is of Zeus. The priestesses of Dodona told me these
      things, of whom the eldest was named Promeneia, the next after her
      Timarete, and the youngest Nicandra; and the other people of Dodona who
      were engaged about the temple gave accounts agreeing with theirs.
    </p>
<p>
      56. I however have an opinion about the matter as follows:—If the
      Phenicians did in truth carry away the consecrated women and sold one of
      them into Libya and the other into Hellas, I suppose that in the country
      now called Hellas, which was formerly called Pelasgia, this woman was sold
      into the land of the Thesprotians; and then being a slave there she set up
      a sanctuary of Zeus under a real oak-tree; <a href="#link2note-54" id="link2noteref-54" class="pginternal">54</a> as indeed it was
      natural that being an attendant of the sanctuary of Zeus at Thebes, she
      should there, in the place to which she had come, have a memory of him;
      and after this, when she got understanding of the Hellenic tongue, she
      established an Oracle, and she reported, I suppose, that her sister had
      been sold in Libya by the same Phenicians by whom she herself had been
      sold.
    </p>
<p>
      57. Moreover, I think that the women were called doves by the people of
      Dodona for the reason that they were Barbarians and because it seemed to
      them that they uttered voice like birds; but after a time (they say) the
      dove spoke with human voice, that is when the woman began to speak so that
      they could understand; but so long as she spoke a Barbarian tongue she
      seemed to them to be uttering voice like a bird: for had it been really a
      dove, how could it speak with human voice? And in saying that the dove was
      black, they indicate that the woman was Egyptian. The ways of delivering
      oracles too at Thebes in Egypt and at Dodona closely resemble one another,
      as it happens, and also the method of divination by victims has come from
      Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      58. Moreover, it is true also that the Egyptians were the first of men who
      made solemn assemblies <a href="#link2note-55" id="link2noteref-55" class="pginternal">55</a> and processions and approaches to the temples,
      <a href="#link2note-56" id="link2noteref-56" class="pginternal">56</a>
      and from them the Hellenes have learnt them, and my evidence for this is
      that the Egyptian celebrations of these have been held from a very ancient
      time, whereas the Hellenic were introduced <a href="#link2note-57" id="link2noteref-57" class="pginternal">57</a> but lately.
    </p>
<p>
      59. The Egyptians hold their solemn assemblies not once in the year but
      often, especially and with the greatest zeal and devotion <a href="#link2note-58" id="link2noteref-58" class="pginternal">58</a> at
      the city of Bubastis for Artemis, and next at Busiris for Isis; for in
      this last-named city there is a very great temple of Isis, and this city
      stands in the middle of the Delta of Egypt; now Isis is in the tongue of
      the Hellenes Demeter: thirdly, they have a solemn assembly at the city of
      Saïs for Athene, fourthly at Heliopolis for the Sun (Helios), fifthly at
      the city of Buto in honour of Leto, and sixthly at the city of Papremis
      for Ares.
    </p>
<p>
      60. Now, when they are coming to the city of Bubastis they do as follows:—they
      sail men and women together, and a great multitude of each sex in every
      boat; and some of the women have rattles and rattle with them, while some
      of the men play the flute during the whole time of the voyage, and the
      rest, both women and men, sing and clap their hands; and when as they sail
      they come opposite to any city on the way they bring the boat to land, and
      some of the women continue to do as I have said, others cry aloud and jeer
      at the women in that city, some dance, and some stand up and pull up their
      garments. This they do by every city along the river-bank; and when they
      come to Bubastis they hold festival celebrating great sacrifices, and more
      wine of grapes is consumed upon that festival than during the whole of the
      rest of the year. To this place (so say the natives) they come together
      year by year <a href="#link2note-59" id="link2noteref-59" class="pginternal">59</a> even to the number of seventy myriads <a href="#link2note-5901" id="link2noteref-5901" class="pginternal">5901</a>
      of men and women, besides children.
    </p>
<p>
      61. Thus it is done here; and how they celebrate the festival in honour of
      Isis at the city of Busiris has been told by me before: <a href="#link2note-60" id="link2noteref-60" class="pginternal">60</a>
      for, as I said, they beat themselves in mourning after the sacrifice, all
      of them both men and women, very many myriads of people; but for whom they
      beat themselves it is not permitted to me by religion to say: and so many
      as there are of the Carians dwelling in Egypt do this even more than the
      Egyptians themselves, inasmuch as they cut their foreheads also with
      knives; and by this it is manifested that they are strangers and not
      Egyptians.
    </p>
<p>
      62. At the times when they gather together at the city of Saïs for their
      sacrifices, on a certain night <a href="#link2note-61" id="link2noteref-61" class="pginternal">61</a> they all kindle lamps
      many in number in the open air round about the houses; now the lamps are
      saucers full of salt and oil mixed, and the wick floats by itself on the
      surface, and this burns during the whole night; and to the festival is
      given the name <i>Lychnocaia</i> (the lighting of the lamps). Moreover
      those of the Egyptians who have not come to this solemn assembly observe
      the night of the festival and themselves also light lamps all of them, and
      thus not in Saïs alone are they lighted, but over all Egypt: and as to the
      reason why light and honour are allotted to this night, <a href="#link2note-62" id="link2noteref-62" class="pginternal">62</a>
      about this there is a sacred story told.
    </p>
<p>
      63. To Heliopolis and Buto they go year by year and do sacrifice only: but
      at Papremis they do sacrifice and worship as elsewhere, and besides that,
      when the sun begins to go down, while some few of the priests are occupied
      with the image of the god, the greater number of them stand in the
      entrance of the temple with wooden clubs, and other persons to the number
      of more than a thousand men with purpose to perform a vow, these also
      having all of them staves of wood, stand in a body opposite to those: and
      the image, which is in a small shrine of wood covered over with gold, they
      take out on the day before to another sacred building. The few then who
      have been left about the image, draw a wain with four wheels, which bears
      the shrine and the image that is within the shrine, and the other priests
      standing in the gateway try to prevent it from entering, and the men who
      are under a vow come to the assistance of the god and strike them, while
      the others defend themselves. <a href="#link2note-63" id="link2noteref-63" class="pginternal">63</a> Then there comes to be
      a hard fight with staves, and they break one another's heads, and I am of
      opinion that many even die of the wounds they receive; the Egyptians
      however told me that no one died. This solemn assembly the people of the
      place say that they established for the following reason:—the mother
      of Ares, they say, used to dwell in this temple, and Ares, having been
      brought up away from her, when he grew up came thither desiring to visit
      his mother, and the attendants of his mother's temple, not having seen him
      before, did not permit him to pass in, but kept him away; and he brought
      men to help him from another city and handled roughly the attendants of
      the temple, and entered to visit his mother. Hence, they say, this
      exchange of blows has become the custom in honour of Ares upon his
      festival.
    </p>
<p>
      64. The Egyptians were the first who made it a point of religion not to
      lie with women in temples, nor to enter into temples after going away from
      women without first bathing: for almost all other men except the Egyptians
      and the Hellenes lie with women in temples and enter into a temple after
      going away from women without bathing, since they hold that there is no
      difference in this respect between men and beasts: for they say that they
      see beasts and the various kinds of birds coupling together both in the
      temples and in the sacred enclosures of the gods; if then this were not
      pleasing to the god, the beasts would not do so.
    </p>
<p>
      65. Thus do these defend that which they do, which by me is disallowed:
      but the Egyptians are excessively careful in their observances, both in
      other matters which concern the sacred rites and also in those which
      follow:—Egypt, though it borders upon Libya, <a href="#link2note-6301" id="link2noteref-6301" class="pginternal">6301</a>
      does not very much abound in wild animals, but such as they have are one
      and all accounted by them sacred, some of them living with men and others
      not. But if I should say for what reasons the sacred animals have been
      thus dedicated, I should fall into discourse of matters pertaining to the
      gods, of which I most desire not to speak; and what I have actually said
      touching slightly upon them, I said because I was constrained by
      necessity. About these animals there is a custom of this kind:—persons
      have been appointed of the Egyptians, both men and women, to provide the
      food for each kind of beast separately, and their office goes down from
      father to son; and those who dwell in the various cities perform vows to
      them thus, that is, when they make a vow to the god to whom the animal
      belongs, they shave the head of their children either the whole or the
      half or the third part of it, and then set the hair in the balance against
      silver, and whatever it weighs, this the man gives to the person who
      provides for the animals, and she cuts up fish of equal value and gives it
      for food to the animals. Thus food for their support has been appointed:
      and if any one kill any of these animals, the penalty, if he do it with
      his own will, is death, and if against his will, such penalty as the
      priests may appoint: but whosoever shall kill an ibis or a hawk, whether
      it be with his will or against his will, must die.
    </p>
<p>
      66. Of the animals that live with men there are great numbers, and would
      be many more but for the accidents which befall the cats. For when the
      females have produced young they are no longer in the habit of going to
      the males, and these seeking to be united with them are not able. To this
      end then they contrive as follows,—they either take away by force or
      remove secretly the young from the females and kill them (but after
      killing they do not eat them), and the females being deprived of their
      young and desiring more, therefore come to the males, for it is a creature
      that is fond of its young. Moreover when a fire occurs, the cats seem to
      be divinely possessed; <a href="#link2note-64" id="link2noteref-64" class="pginternal">64</a> for while the Egyptians stand at intervals and
      look after the cats, not taking any care to extinguish the fire, the cats
      slipping through or leaping over the men, jump into the fire; and when
      this happens, great mourning comes upon the Egyptians. And in whatever
      houses a cat has died by a natural death, all those who dwell in this
      house shave their eyebrows only, but those in whose houses a dog has died
      shave their whole body and also their head.
    </p>
<p>
      67. The cats when they are dead are carried away to sacred buildings in
      the city of Bubastis, where after being embalmed they are buried; but the
      dogs they bury each people in their own city in sacred tombs; and the
      ichneumons are buried just in the same way as the dogs. The shrew-mice
      however and the hawks they carry away to the city of Buto, and the ibises
      to Hermopolis; <a href="#link2note-65" id="link2noteref-65" class="pginternal">65</a> the bears (which are not commonly seen) and
      the wolves, not much larger in size than foxes, they bury on the spot
      where they are found lying.
    </p>
<p>
      68. Of the crocodile the nature is as follows:—during the four most
      wintry months this creature eats nothing: she has four feet and is an
      animal belonging to the land and the water both; for she produces and
      hatches eggs on the land, and the most part of the day she remains upon
      dry land, but the whole of the night in the river, for the water in truth
      is warmer than the unclouded open air and the dew. Of all the mortal
      creatures of which we have knowledge this grows to the greatest bulk from
      the smallest beginning; for the eggs which she produces are not much
      larger than those of geese and the newly-hatched young one is in
      proportion to the egg, but as he grows he becomes as much as seventeen
      cubits long and sometimes yet larger. He has eyes like those of a pig and
      teeth large and tusky, in proportion to the size of his body; but unlike
      all other beasts he grows no tongue, neither does he move his lower jaw,
      but brings the upper jaw towards the lower, being in this too unlike all
      other beasts. He has moreover strong claws and a scaly hide upon his back
      which cannot be pierced; and he is blind in the water, but in the air he
      is of very keen sight. Since he has his living in the water he keeps his
      mouth all full within of leeches; and whereas all other birds and beasts
      fly from him, the trochilus is a creature which is at peace with him,
      seeing that from her he receives benefit; for the crocodile having come
      out of the water to the land and then having opened his mouth (this he is
      wont to do generally towards the West Wind), the trochilus upon that
      enters into his mouth and swallows down the leeches, and he being
      benefited is pleased and does no harm to the trochilus.
    </p>
<p>
      69. Now for some of the Egyptians the crocodiles are sacred animals, and
      for others not so, but they treat them on the contrary as enemies: those
      however who dwell about Thebes and about the lake of Moiris hold them to
      be most sacred, and each of these two peoples keeps one crocodile selected
      from the whole number, which has been trained to tameness, and they put
      hanging ornaments of molten stone and of gold into the ears of these and
      anklets round the front feet, and they give them food appointed and
      victims of sacrifices and treat them as well as possible while they live,
      and after they are dead they bury them in sacred tombs, embalming them:
      but those who dwell about the city of Elephantine even eat them, not
      holding them to be sacred. They are called not crocodiles but <i>champsai</i>,
      and the Ionians gave them the name of crocodile, comparing their form to
      that of the crocodiles (lizards) which appear in their country in the
      stone walls.
    </p>
<p>
      70. There are many ways in use of catching them and of various kinds: I
      shall describe that which to me seems the most worthy of being told. A man
      puts the back of a pig upon a hook as bait, and lets it go into the middle
      of the river, while he himself upon the bank of the river has a young live
      pig, which he beats; and the crocodile hearing its cries makes for the
      direction of the sound, and when he finds the pig's back he swallows it
      down: then they pull, and when he is drawn out to land, first of all the
      hunter forthwith plasters up his eyes with mud, and having so done he very
      easily gets the mastery of him, but if he does not do so he has much
      trouble.
    </p>
<p>
      71. The river-horse is sacred in the district of Papremis, but for the
      other Egyptians he is not sacred; and this is the appearance which he
      presents: he is four-footed, cloven-hoofed like an ox, <a href="#link2note-66" id="link2noteref-66" class="pginternal">66</a>
      flat-nosed, with a mane like a horse and showing teeth like tusks, with a
      tail and voice like a horse, and in size as large as the largest ox; and
      his hide is so exceedingly thick that when it has been dried shafts of
      javelins are made of it.
    </p>
<p>
      72. There are moreover otters in the river, which they consider to be
      sacred; and of fish also they esteem that which is called the <i>lepidotos</i>
      to be sacred, and also the eel; and these they say are sacred to the Nile:
      and of birds the fox-goose.
    </p>
<p>
      73. There is also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I did not
      myself see except in painting, for in truth he comes to them very rarely,
      at intervals, as the people of Heliopolis say, of five hundred years; and
      these say that he comes regularly when his father dies; and if he be like
      the painting, he is of this size and nature, that is to say, some of his
      feathers are of gold colour and others red, and in outline and size he is
      as nearly as possible like an eagle. This bird they say (but I cannot
      believe the story) contrives as follows:—setting forth from Arabia
      he conveys his father, they say, to the temple of the Sun (Helios)
      plastered up in myrrh, and buries him in the temple of the Sun; and he
      conveys him thus:—he forms first an egg of myrrh as large as he is
      able to carry, and then he makes trial of carrying it, and when he has
      made trial sufficiently, then he hollows out the egg and places his father
      within it and plasters over with other myrrh that part of the egg where he
      hollowed it out to put his father in, and when his father is laid in it,
      it proves (they say) to be of the same weight as it was; and after he has
      plastered it up, he conveys the whole to Egypt to the temple of the Sun.
      Thus they say that this bird does.
    </p>
<p>
      74. There are also about Thebes sacred serpents, not at all harmful to
      men, which are small in size and have two horns growing from the top of
      the head: these they bury when they die in the temple of Zeus, for to this
      god they say that they are sacred.
    </p>
<p>
      75. There is a region moreover in Arabia, situated nearly over against the
      city of Buto, to which place I came to inquire about the winged serpents:
      and when I came thither I saw bones of serpents and spines in quantity so
      great that it is impossible to make report of the number, and there were
      heaps of spines, some heaps large and others less large and others smaller
      still than these, and these heaps were many in number. This region in
      which the spines are scattered upon the ground is of the nature of an
      entrance from a narrow mountain pass to a great plain, which plain adjoins
      the plain of Egypt; and the story goes that at the beginning of spring
      winged serpents from Arabia fly towards Egypt, and the birds called ibises
      meet them at the entrance to this country and do not suffer the serpents
      to go by but kill them. On account of this deed it is (say the Arabians)
      that the ibis has come to be greatly honoured by the Egyptians, and the
      Egyptians also agree that it is for this reason that they honour these
      birds.
    </p>
<p>
      76. The outward form of the ibis is this:—it is a deep black all
      over, and has legs like those of a crane and a very curved beak, and in
      size it is about equal to a rail: this is the appearance of the black kind
      which fight with the serpents, but of those which most crowd round men's
      feet (for there are two several kinds of ibises) the head is bare and also
      the whole of the throat, and it is white in feathering except the head and
      neck and the extremities of the wings and the rump (in all these parts of
      which I have spoken it is a deep black), while in legs and in the form of
      the head it resembles the other. As for the serpent its form is like that
      of the watersnake; and it has wings not feathered but most nearly
      resembling the wings of the bat. Let so much suffice as has been said now
      concerning sacred animals.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      77. Of the Egyptians themselves, those who dwell in the part of Egypt
      which is sown for crops <a href="#link2note-67" id="link2noteref-67" class="pginternal">67</a> practise memory more than any other men and
      are the most learned in history by far of all those of whom I have had
      experience: and their manner of life is as follows:—For three
      successive days in each month they purge, hunting after health with
      emetics and clysters, and they think that all the diseases which exist are
      produced in men by the food on which they live; for the Egyptians are from
      other causes also the most healthy of all men next after the Libyans (in
      my opinion on account of the seasons, because the seasons do not change,
      for by the changes of things generally, and especially of the seasons,
      diseases are most apt to be produced in men), and as to their diet, it is
      as follows:—they eat bread, making loaves of maize, which they call
      <i>kyllestis</i>, and they use habitually a wine made out of barley, for
      vines they have not in their land. Of their fish some they dry in the sun
      and then eat them without cooking, others they eat cured in brine. Of
      birds they eat quails and ducks and small birds without cooking, after
      first curing them; and everything else which they have belonging to the
      class of birds or fishes, except such as have been set apart by them as
      sacred, they eat roasted or boiled.
    </p>
<p>
      78. In the entertainments of the rich among them, when they have finished
      eating, a man bears round a wooden figure of a dead body in a coffin, made
      as like the reality as may be both by painting and carving, and measuring
      about a cubit or two cubits each way; <a href="#link2note-68" id="link2noteref-68" class="pginternal">68</a> and this he shows to
      each of those who are drinking together, saying: "When thou lookest upon
      this, drink and be merry, for thou shalt be such as this when thou art
      dead." Thus they do at their carousals.
    </p>
<p>
      79. The customs which they practise are derived from their fathers and
      they do not acquire others in addition; but besides other customary things
      among them which are worthy of mention, they have one song, <a href="#link2note-6801" id="link2noteref-6801" class="pginternal">6801</a>
      that of Linos, the same who is sung of both in Phenicia and in Cyprus and
      elsewhere, having however a name different according to the various
      nations. This song agrees exactly with that which the Hellenes sing
      calling on the name of Linos, <a href="#link2note-69" id="link2noteref-69" class="pginternal">69</a> so that besides many
      other things about which I wonder among those matters which concern Egypt,
      I wonder especially about this, namely whence they got the song of Linos.
      <a href="#link2note-70" id="link2noteref-70" class="pginternal">70</a>
      It is evident however that they have sung this song from immemorial time,
      and in the Egyptian tongue Linos is called Maneros. The Egyptians told me
      that he was the only son of him who first became king of Egypt, and that
      he died before his time and was honoured with these lamentations by the
      Egyptians, and that this was their first and only song.
    </p>
<p>
      80. In another respect the Egyptians are in agreement with some of the
      Hellenes, namely with the Lacedemonians, but not with the rest, that is to
      say, the younger of them when they meet the elder give way and move out of
      the path, and when their elders approach they rise out of their seat. In
      this which follows however they are not in agreement with any of the
      Hellenes,—instead of addressing one another in the roads they do
      reverence, lowering their hand down to their knee.
    </p>
<p>
      81. They wear tunics of linen about their legs with fringes, which they
      call <i>calasiris</i>; above these they have garments of white wool thrown
      over: woollen garments however are not taken into the temples, nor are
      they buried with them, for this is not permitted by religion. In these
      points they are in agreement with the observances called Orphic and
      Bacchic (which are really Egyptian), <a href="#link2note-71" id="link2noteref-71" class="pginternal">71</a> and also with those of
      the Pythagoreans, for one who takes part in these mysteries is also
      forbidden by religious rule to be buried in woollen garments; and about
      this there is a sacred story told.
    </p>
<p>
      82. Besides these things the Egyptians have found out also to what god
      each month and each day belongs, and what fortunes a man will meet with
      who is born on any particular day, and how he will die, and what kind of a
      man he will be: and these inventions were taken up by those of the
      Hellenes who occupied themselves about poesy. Portents too have been found
      out by them more than by all other men besides; for when a portent has
      happened, they observe and write down the event which comes of it, and if
      ever afterwards anything resembling this happens, they believe that the
      event which comes of it will be similar.
    </p>
<p>
      83. Their divination is ordered thus:—the art is assigned not to any
      man, but to certain of the gods, for there are in their land Oracles of
      Heracles, of Apollo, of Athene, of Artemis, of Ares, and of Zeus, and
      moreover that which they hold most in honour of all, namely the Oracle of
      Leto which is in the city of Buto. The manner of divination however is not
      yet established among them according to the same fashion everywhere, but
      is different in different places.
    </p>
<p>
      84. The art of medicine among them is distributed thus:—each
      physician is a physician of one disease and of no more; and the whole
      country is full of physicians, for some profess themselves to be
      physicians of the eyes, others of the head, others of the teeth, others of
      the affections of the stomach, and others of the more obscure ailments.
    </p>
<p>
      85. Their fashions of mourning and of burial are these:—Whenever any
      household has lost a man who is of any regard amongst them, the whole
      number of women of that house forthwith plaster over their heads or even
      their faces with mud. Then leaving the corpse within the house they go
      themselves to and fro about the city and beat themselves, with their
      garments bound up by a girdle <a href="#link2note-72" id="link2noteref-72" class="pginternal">72</a> and their breasts
      exposed, and with them go all the women who are related to the dead man,
      and on the other side the men beat themselves, they too having their
      garments bound up by a girdle; and when they have done this, they then
      convey the body to the embalming.
    </p>
<p>
      86. In this occupation certain persons employ themselves regularly and
      inherit this as a craft. These, whenever a corpse is conveyed to them,
      show to those who brought it wooden models of corpses made like reality by
      painting, and the best of the ways of embalming they say is that of him
      whose name I think it impiety to mention when speaking of a matter of such
      a kind; <a href="#link2note-73" id="link2noteref-73" class="pginternal">73</a>
      the second which they show is less good than this and also less expensive;
      and the third is the least expensive of all. Having told them about this,
      they inquire of them in which way they desire the corpse of their friend
      to be prepared. Then they after they have agreed for a certain price
      depart out of the way, and the others being left behind in the buildings
      embalm according to the best of these ways thus:—First with a
      crooked iron tool they draw out the brain through the nostrils, extracting
      it partly thus and partly by pouring in drugs; and after this with a sharp
      stone of Ethiopia they make a cut along the side and take out the whole
      contents of the belly, and when they have cleared out the cavity and
      cleansed it with palm-wine they cleanse it again with spices pounded up:
      then they fill the belly with pure myrrh pounded up and with cassia and
      other spices except frankincense, and sew it together again. Having so
      done they keep it for embalming covered up in natron for seventy days, but
      for a longer time than this it is not permitted to embalm it; and when the
      seventy days are past, they wash the corpse and roll its whole body up in
      fine linen <a href="#link2note-74" id="link2noteref-74" class="pginternal">74</a> cut into bands, smearing these beneath with
      gum, <a href="#link2note-75" id="link2noteref-75" class="pginternal">75</a>
      which the Egyptians use generally instead of glue. Then the kinsfolk
      receive it from them and have a wooden figure made in the shape of a man,
      and when they have had this made they enclose the corpse, and having shut
      it up within, they store it then in a sepulchral chamber, setting it to
      stand upright against the wall.
    </p>
<p>
      87. Thus they deal with the corpses which are prepared in the most costly
      way; but for those who desire the middle way and wish to avoid great cost
      they prepare the corpse as follows:—having filled their syringes
      with the oil which is got from cedar-wood, with this they forthwith fill
      the belly of the corpse, and this they do without having either cut it
      open or taken out the bowels, but they inject the oil by the breech, and
      having stopped the drench from returning back they keep it then the
      appointed number of days for embalming, and on the last of the days they
      let the cedar oil come out from the belly, which they before put in; and
      it has such power that it brings out with it the bowels and interior
      organs of the body dissolved; and the natron dissolves the flesh, so that
      there is left of the corpse only the skin and the bones. When they have
      done this they give back the corpse at once in that condition without
      working upon it any more.
    </p>
<p>
      88. The third kind of embalming, by which are prepared the bodies of those
      who have less means, is as follows:—they cleanse out the belly with
      a purge and then keep the body for embalming during the seventy days, and
      at once after that they give it back to the bringers to carry away.
    </p>
<p>
      89. The wives of men of rank when they die are not given at once to be
      embalmed, nor such women as are very beautiful or of greater regard than
      others, but on the third or fourth day after their death (and not before)
      they are delivered to the embalmers. They do so about this matter in order
      that the embalmers may not abuse their women, for they say that one of
      them was taken once doing so to the corpse of a woman lately dead, and his
      fellow-craftsman gave information.
    </p>
<p>
      90. Whenever any one, either of the Egyptians themselves or of strangers,
      is found to have been carried off by a crocodile or brought to his death
      by the river itself, the people of any city by which he may have been cast
      up on land must embalm him and lay him out in the fairest way they can and
      bury him in a sacred burial-place, nor may any of his relations or friends
      besides touch him, but the priests of the Nile themselves handle the
      corpse and bury it as that of one who was something more than man.
    </p>
<p>
      91. Hellenic usages they will by no means follow, and to speak generally
      they follow those of no other men whatever. This rule is observed by most
      of the Egyptians; but there is a large city named Chemmis in the Theban
      district near Neapolis, and in this city there is a temple of Perseus the
      son of Danae which is of a square shape, and round it grow date-palms: the
      gateway of the temple is built of stone and of very great size, and at the
      entrance of it stand two great statues of stone. Within this enclosure is
      a temple-house <a href="#link2note-76" id="link2noteref-76" class="pginternal">76</a> and in it stands an image of Perseus. These
      people of Chemmis say that Perseus is wont often to appear in their land
      and often within the temple, and that a sandal which has been worn by him
      is found sometimes, being in length two cubits, and whenever this appears
      all Egypt prospers. This they say, and they do in honour of Perseus after
      Hellenic fashion thus,—they hold an athletic contest, which includes
      the whole list of games, and they offer in prizes cattle and cloaks and
      skins: and when I inquired why to them alone Perseus was wont to appear,
      and wherefore they were separated from all the other Egyptians in that
      they held an athletic contest, they said that Perseus had been born of
      their city, for Danaos and Lynkeus were men of Chemmis and had sailed to
      Hellas, and from them they traced a descent and came down to Perseus: and
      they told me that he had come to Egypt for the reason which the Hellenes
      also say, namely to bring from Libya the Gorgon's head, and had then
      visited them also and recognised all his kinsfolk, and they said that he
      had well learnt the name of Chemmis before he came to Egypt, since he had
      heard it from his mother, and that they celebrated an athletic contest for
      him by his own command.
    </p>
<p>
      92. All these are customs practised by the Egyptians who dwell above the
      fens: and those who are settled in the fen-land have the same customs for
      the most part as the other Egyptians, both in other matters and also in
      that they live each with one wife only, as do the Hellenes; but for
      economy in respect of food they have invented these things besides:—when
      the river has become full and the plains have been flooded, there grow in
      the water great numbers of lilies, which the Egyptians call <i>lotos</i>;
      these they cut with a sickle and dry in the sun, and then they pound that
      which grows in the middle of the lotos and which is like the head of a
      poppy, and they make of it loaves baked with fire. The root also of this
      lotos is edible and has a rather sweet taste: <a href="#link2note-77" id="link2noteref-77" class="pginternal">77</a> it is round in shape
      and about the size of an apple. There are other lilies too, in flower
      resembling roses, which also grow in the river, and from them the fruit is
      produced in a separate vessel springing from the root by the side of the
      plant itself, and very nearly resembles a wasp's comb: in this there grow
      edible seeds in great numbers of the size of an olive-stone, and they are
      eaten either fresh <a href="#link2note-78" id="link2noteref-78" class="pginternal">78</a> or dried. Besides this they pull up from the
      fens the papyrus which grows every year, and the upper parts of it they
      cut off and turn to other uses, but that which is left below for about a
      cubit in length they eat or sell: and those who desire to have the papyrus
      at its very best bake it in an oven heated red-hot, and then eat it. Some
      too of these people live on fish alone, which they dry in the sun after
      having caught them and taken out the entrails, and then when they are dry,
      they use them for food.
    </p>
<p>
      93. Fish which swim in shoals are not much produced in the rivers, but are
      bred in the lakes, and they do as follows:—When there comes upon
      them the desire to breed, they swim out in shoals towards the sea; and the
      males lead the way shedding forth their milt as they go, while the
      females, coming after and swallowing it up, from it become impregnated:
      and when they have become full of young in the sea they swim up back
      again, each shoal to its own haunts. The same however no longer lead the
      way as before, but the lead comes now to the females, and they leading the
      way in shoals do just as the males did, that is to say they shed forth
      their eggs by a few grains at a time, <a href="#link2note-79" id="link2noteref-79" class="pginternal">79</a> and the males coming
      after swallow them up. Now these grains are fish, and from the grains
      which survive and are not swallowed, the fish grow which afterwards are
      bred up. Now those of the fish which are caught as they swim out to sea
      are found to be rubbed on the left side of the head, but those which are
      caught as they swim up again are rubbed on the right side. This happens to
      them because as they swim down to the sea they keep close to the land on
      the left side of the river, and again as they swim up they keep to the
      same side, approaching and touching the bank as much as they can, for fear
      doubtless of straying from their course by reason of the stream. When the
      Nile begins to swell, the hollow places of the land and the depressions by
      the side of the river first begin to fill, as the water soaks through from
      the river, and so soon as they become full of water, at once they are all
      filled with little fishes; and whence these are in all likelihood
      produced, I think that I perceive. In the preceding year, when the Nile
      goes down, the fish first lay eggs in the mud and then retire with the
      last of the retreating waters; and when the time comes round again, and
      the water once more comes over the land, from these eggs forthwith are
      produced the fishes of which I speak.
    </p>
<p>
      94. Thus it is as regards the fish. And for anointing those of the
      Egyptians who dwell in the fens use oil from the castor-berry, <a href="#link2note-80" id="link2noteref-80" class="pginternal">80</a>
      which oil the Egyptians call <i>kiki</i>, and thus they do:—they sow
      along the banks of the rivers and pools these plants, which in a wild form
      grow of themselves in the land of the Hellenes; these are sown in Egypt
      and produce berries in great quantity but of an evil smell; and when they
      have gathered these, some cut them up and press the oil from them, others
      again roast them first and then boil them down and collect that which runs
      away from them. The oil is fat and not less suitable for burning than
      olive-oil, but it gives forth a disagreeable smell.
    </p>
<p>
      95. Against the gnats, which are very abundant, they have contrived as
      follows:—those who dwell above the fen-land are helped by the
      towers, to which they ascend when they go to rest; for the gnats by reason
      of the winds are not able to fly up high: but those who dwell in the
      fen-land have contrived another way instead of the towers, and this is it:—every
      man of them has got a casting net, with which by day he catches fish, but
      in the night he uses it for this purpose, that is to say he puts the
      casting-net round about the bed in which he sleeps, and then creeps in
      under it and goes to sleep: and the gnats, if he sleeps rolled up in a
      garment or a linen sheet, bite through these, but through the net they do
      not even attempt to bite.
    </p>
<p>
      96. Their boats with which they carry cargoes are made of the thorny
      acacia, of which the form is very like that of the Kyrenian lotos, and
      that which exudes from it is gum. From this tree they cut pieces of wood
      about two cubits in length and arrange them like bricks, fastening the
      boat together by running a great number of long bolts through the
      two-cubit pieces; and when they have thus fastened the boat together, they
      lay cross-pieces <a href="#link2note-81" id="link2noteref-81" class="pginternal">81</a> over the top, using no ribs for the sides; and
      within they caulk the seams with papyrus. They make one steering-oar for
      it, which is passed through the bottom of the boat; and they have a mast
      of acacia and sails of papyrus. These boats cannot sail up the river
      unless there be a very fresh wind blowing, but are towed from the shore:
      down-stream however they travel as follows:—they have a door-shaped
      crate made of tamarisk wood and reed mats sewn together, and also a stone
      of about two talents weight bored with a hole; and of these the boatman
      lets the crate float on in front of the boat, fastened with a rope, and
      the stone drag behind by another rope. The crate then, as the force of the
      stream presses upon it, goes on swiftly and draws on the <i>baris</i> (for
      so these boats are called), while the stone dragging after it behind and
      sunk deep in the water keeps its course straight. These boats they have in
      great numbers and some of them carry many thousands of talents' burden.
    </p>
<p>
      97. When the Nile comes over the land, the cities alone are seen rising
      above the water, resembling more nearly than anything else the islands in
      the Egean sea; for the rest of Egypt becomes a sea and the cities alone
      rise above water. Accordingly, whenever this happens, they pass by water
      not now by the channels of the river but over the midst of the plain: for
      example, as one sails up from Naucratis to Memphis the passage is then
      close by the pyramids, whereas the usual passage is not the same even
      here, <a href="#link2note-82" id="link2noteref-82" class="pginternal">82</a>
      but goes by the point of the Delta and the city of Kercasoros; while if
      you sail over the plain to Naucratis from the sea and from Canobos, you
      will go by Anthylla and the city called after Archander.
    </p>
<p>
      98. Of these Anthylla is a city of note and is especially assigned to the
      wife of him who reigns over Egypt, to supply her with sandals, (this is
      the case since the time when Egypt came to be under the Persians): the
      other city seems to me to have its name from Archander the son-in-law of
      Danaos, who was the son of Phthios, the son of Achaios; for it is called
      the City of Archander. There might indeed be another Archander, but in any
      case the name is not Egyptian.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      99. Hitherto my own observation and judgment and inquiry are the vouchers
      for that which I have said; but from this point onwards I am about to tell
      the history of Egypt according to that which I heard, to which will be
      added also something of that which I have myself seen.
    </p>
<p>
      Of Min, who first became king of Egypt, the priests said that on the one
      hand he banked off the site of Memphis from the river: for the whole
      stream of the river used to flow along by the sandy mountain-range on the
      side of Libya, but Min formed by embankments that bend of the river which
      lies to the South about a hundred furlongs above Memphis, and thus he
      dried up the old stream and conducted the river so that it flowed in the
      middle between the mountains: and even now this bend of the Nile is by the
      Persians kept under very careful watch, that it may flow in the channel to
      which it is confined, <a href="#link2note-83" id="link2noteref-83" class="pginternal">83</a> and the bank is repaired every year; for if
      the river should break through and overflow in this direction, Memphis
      would be in danger of being overwhelmed by flood. When this Min, who first
      became king, had made into dry land the part which was dammed off, on the
      one hand, I say, he founded in it that city which is now called Memphis;
      for Memphis too is in the narrow part of Egypt; <a href="#link2note-84" id="link2noteref-84" class="pginternal">84</a> and outside the city he
      dug round it on the North and West a lake communicating with the river,
      for the side towards the East is barred by the Nile itself. Then secondly
      he established in the city the temple of Hephaistos a great work and most
      worthy of mention.
    </p>
<p>
      100. After this man the priests enumerated to me from a papyrus roll the
      names of other kings, three hundred and thirty in number; and in all these
      generations of men eighteen were Ethiopians, one was a woman, a native
      Egyptian, and the rest were men and of Egyptian race: and the name of the
      woman who reigned was the same as that of the Babylonian queen, namely
      Nitocris. Of her they said that desiring to take vengeance for her
      brother, whom the Egyptians had slain when he was their king and then,
      after having slain him, had given his kingdom to her,—desiring, I
      say, to take vengeance for him, she destroyed by craft many of the
      Egyptians. For she caused to be constructed a very large chamber under
      ground, and making as though she would handsel it but in her mind devising
      other things, she invited those of the Egyptians whom she knew to have had
      most part in the murder, and gave a great banquet. Then while they were
      feasting, she let in the river upon them by a secret conduit of large
      size. Of her they told no more than this, except that, when this had been
      accomplished, she threw herself into a room full of embers, in order that
      she might escape vengeance.
    </p>
<p>
      101. As for the other kings, they could tell me of no great works which
      had been produced by them, and they said that they had no renown <a href="#link2note-85" id="link2noteref-85" class="pginternal">85</a>
      except only the last of them, Moris: he (they said) produced as a memorial
      of himself the gateway of the temple of Hephaistos which is turned towards
      the North Wind, and dug a lake, about which I shall set forth afterwards
      how many furlongs of circuit it has, and in it built pyramids of the size
      which I shall mention at the same time when I speak of the lake itself.
      He, they said, produced these works, but of the rest none produced any.
    </p>
<p>
      102. Therefore passing these by I shall make mention of the king who came
      after these, whose name was Sesostris. He (the priests said) first of all
      set out with ships of war from the Arabian gulf and subdued those who
      dwelt by the shores of the Erythraian Sea, until as he sailed he came to a
      sea which could no further be navigated by reason of shoals: then
      secondly, after he had returned to Egypt, according to the report of the
      priests he took a great army <a href="#link2note-86" id="link2noteref-86" class="pginternal">86</a> and marched over the continent, subduing every
      nation which stood in his way: and those of them whom he found valiant and
      fighting desperately for their freedom, in their lands he set up pillars
      which told by inscriptions his own name and the name of his country, and
      how he had subdued them by his power; but as to those of whose cities he
      obtained possession without fighting or with ease, on their pillars he
      inscribed words after the same tenor as he did for the nations which had
      shown themselves courageous, and in addition he drew upon them the hidden
      parts of a woman, desiring to signify by this that the people were cowards
      and effeminate.
    </p>
<p>
      103. Thus doing he traversed the continent, until at last he passed over
      to Europe from Asia and subdued the Scythians and also the Thracians.
      These, I am of opinion, were the furthest <a href="#link2note-87" id="link2noteref-87" class="pginternal">87</a> people to which the
      Egyptian army came, for in their country the pillars are found to have
      been set up, but in the land beyond this they are no longer found. From
      this point he turned and began to go back; and when he came to the river
      Phasis, what happened then I cannot say for certain, whether the king
      Sesostris himself divided off a certain portion of his army and left the
      men there as settlers in the land, or whether some of his soldiers were
      wearied by his distant marches and remained by the river Phasis.
    </p>
<p>
      104. For the people of Colchis are evidently Egyptian, and this I
      perceived for myself before I heard it from others. So when I had come to
      consider the matter I asked them both; and the Colchians had remembrance
      of the Egyptians more than the Egyptians of the Colchians; but the
      Egyptians said they believed that the Colchians were a portion of the army
      of Sesostris. That this was so I conjectured myself not only because they
      are dark-skinned and have curly hair (this of itself amounts to nothing,
      for there are other races which are so), but also still more because the
      Colchians, Egyptians, and Ethiopians alone of all the races of men have
      practised circumcision from the first. The Phenicians and the Syrians <a href="#link2note-88" id="link2noteref-88" class="pginternal">88</a>
      who dwell in Palestine confess themselves that they have learnt it from
      the Egyptians, and the Syrians <a href="#link2note-89" id="link2noteref-89" class="pginternal">89</a> about the river
      Thermodon and the river Parthenios, and the Macronians, who are their
      neighbours, say that they have learnt it lately from the Colchians. These
      are the only races of men who practise circumcision, and these evidently
      practise it in the same manner as the Egyptians. Of the Egyptians
      themselves however and the Ethiopians, I am not able to say which learnt
      from the other, for undoubtedly it is a most ancient custom; but that the
      other nations learnt it by intercourse with the Egyptians, this among
      others is to me a strong proof, namely that those of the Phenicians who
      have intercourse with Hellas cease to follow the example of the Egyptians
      in this matter, and do not circumcise their children.
    </p>
<p>
      105. Now let me tell another thing about the Colchians to show how they
      resemble the Egyptians:—they alone work flax in the same fashion as
      the Egyptians, <a href="#link2note-90" id="link2noteref-90" class="pginternal">90</a> and the two nations are like one another in
      their whole manner of living and also in their language: now the linen of
      Colchis is called by the Hellenes Sardonic, whereas that from Egypt is
      called Egyptian.
    </p>
<p>
      106. The pillars which Sesostris of Egypt set up in the various countries
      are for the most part no longer to be seen extant; but in Syria Palestine
      I myself saw them existing with the inscription upon them which I have
      mentioned and the emblem. Moreover in Ionia there are two figures of this
      man carved upon rocks, one on the road by which one goes from the land of
      Ephesos to Phocaia, and the other on the road from Sardis to Smyrna. In
      each place there is a figure of a man cut in the rock, of four cubits and
      a span in height, holding in his right hand a spear and in his left a bow
      and arrows, and the other equipment which he has is similar to this, for
      it is both Egyptian and Ethiopian: and from the one shoulder to the other
      across the breast runs an inscription carved in sacred Egyptian
      characters, saying thus, "This land with my shoulders I won for myself."
      But who he is and from whence, he does not declare in these places, though
      in other places he has declared this. Some of those who have seen these
      carvings conjecture that the figure is that of Memnon, but herein they are
      very far from the truth.
    </p>
<p>
      107. As this Egyptian Sesostris was returning and bringing back many men
      of the nations whose lands he had subdued, when he came (said the priests)
      to Daphnai in the district of Pelusion on his journey home, his brother to
      whom Sesostris had entrusted the charge of Egypt invited him and with him
      his sons to a feast; and then he piled the house round with brushwood and
      set it on fire: and Sesostris when he discovered this forthwith took
      counsel with his wife, for he was bringing with him (they said) his wife
      also; and she counselled him to lay out upon the pyre two of his sons,
      which were six in number, and so to make a bridge over the burning mass,
      and that they passing over their bodies should thus escape. This, they
      said, Sesostris did, and two of his sons were burnt to death in this
      manner, but the rest got away safe with their father.
    </p>
<p>
      108. Then Sesostris, having returned to Egypt and having taken vengeance
      on his brother, employed the multitude which he had brought in of those
      whose lands he had subdued, as follows:—these were they who drew the
      stones which in the reign of this king were brought to the temple of
      Hephaistos, being of very great size; and also these were compelled to dig
      all the channels which now are in Egypt; and thus (having no such purpose)
      they caused Egypt, which before was all fit for riding and driving, to be
      no longer fit for this from thenceforth: for from that time forward Egypt,
      though it is plain land, has become all unfit for riding and driving, and
      the cause has been these channels, which are many and run in all
      directions. But the reason why the king cut up the land was this, namely
      because those of the Egyptians who had their cities not on the river but
      in the middle of the country, being in want of water when the river went
      down from them, found their drink brackish because they had it from wells.
    </p>
<p>
      109. For this reason Egypt was cut up; and they said that this king
      distributed the land to all the Egyptians, giving an equal square portion
      to each man, and from this he made his revenue, having appointed them to
      pay a certain rent every year: and if the river should take away anything
      from any man's portion, he would come to the king and declare that which
      had happened, and the king used to send men to examine and to find out by
      measurement how much less the piece of land had become, in order that for
      the future the man might pay less, in proportion to the rent appointed:
      and I think that thus the art of geometry was found out and afterwards
      came into Hellas also. For as touching the sun-dial <a href="#link2note-91" id="link2noteref-91" class="pginternal">91</a> and the gnomon <a href="#link2note-92" id="link2noteref-92" class="pginternal">92</a>
      and the twelve divisions of the day, they were learnt by the Hellenes from
      the Babylonians.
    </p>
<p>
      110. He moreover alone of all the Egyptian kings had rule over Ethiopia;
      and he left as memorials of himself in front of the temple of Hephaistos
      two stone statues of thirty cubits each, representing himself and his
      wife, and others of twenty cubits each representing his four sons: and
      long afterwards the priest of Hephaistos refused to permit Dareios the
      Persian to set up a statue of himself in front of them, saying that deeds
      had not been done by him equal to those which were done by Sesostris the
      Egyptian; for Sesostris had subdued other nations besides, not fewer than
      he, and also the Scythians; but Dareios had not been able to conquer the
      Scythians: wherefore it was not just that he should set up a statue in
      front of those which Sesostris had dedicated, if he did not surpass him in
      his deeds. Which speech, they say, Dareios took in good part.
    </p>
<p>
      111. Now after Sesostris had brought his life to an end, his son Pheros,
      they told me, received in succession the kingdom, and he made no warlike
      expedition, and moreover it chanced to him to become blind by reason of
      the following accident:—when the river had come down in flood rising
      to a height of eighteen cubits, higher than ever before that time, and had
      gone over the fields, a wind fell upon it and the river became agitated by
      waves: and this king (they say) moved by presumptuous folly took a spear
      and cast it into the midst of the eddies of the stream; and immediately
      upon this he had a disease of the eyes and was by it made blind. For ten
      years then he was blind, and in the eleventh year there came to him an
      oracle from the city of Buto saying that the time of his punishment had
      expired, and that he should see again if he washed his eyes with the water
      of a woman who had accompanied with her own husband only and had not
      knowledge of other men: and first he made trial of his own wife, and then,
      as he continued blind, he went on to try all the women in turn; and when
      he had at last regained his sight he gathered together all the women of
      whom he had made trial, excepting her by whose means he had regained his
      sight, to one city which now is named Erythrabolos, <a href="#link2note-93" id="link2noteref-93" class="pginternal">93</a> and having gathered
      them to this he consumed them all by fire, as well as the city itself; but
      as for her by whose means he had regained his sight, he had her himself to
      wife. Then after he had escaped the malady of his eyes he dedicated
      offerings at each one of the temples which were of renown, and especially
      (to mention only that which is most worthy of mention) he dedicated at the
      temple of the Sun works which are worth seeing, namely two obelisks of
      stone, each of a single block, measuring in length a hundred cubits each
      one and in breadth eight cubits.
    </p>
<p>
      112. After him, they said, there succeeded to the throne a man of Memphis,
      whose name in the tongue of the Hellenes was Proteus; for whom there is
      now a sacred enclosure at Memphis, very fair and well ordered, lying on
      that side of the temple of Hephaistos which faces the North Wind. Round
      about this enclosure dwell Phenicians of Tyre, and this whole region is
      called the Camp of the Tyrians. <a href="#link2note-94" id="link2noteref-94" class="pginternal">94</a> Within the enclosure of
      Proteus there is a temple called the temple of the "foreign Aphrodite,"
      which temple I conjecture to be one of Helen the daughter of Tyndareus,
      not only because I have heard the tale how Helen dwelt with Proteus, but
      also especially because it is called by the name of the "foreign
      Aphrodite," for the other temples of Aphrodite which there are have none
      of them the addition of the word "foreign" to the name.
    </p>
<p>
      113. And the priests told me, when I inquired, that the things concerning
      Helen happened thus:—Alexander having carried off Helen was sailing
      away from Sparta to his own land, and when he had come to the Egean Sea
      contrary winds drove him from his course to the Sea of Egypt; and after
      that, since the blasts did not cease to blow, he came to Egypt itself, and
      in Egypt to that which is now named the Canobic mouth of the Nile and to
      Taricheiai. Now there was upon the shore, as still there is now, a temple
      of Heracles, in which if any man's slave take refuge and have the sacred
      marks set upon him, giving himself over to the god, it is not lawful to
      lay hands upon him; and this custom has continued still unchanged from the
      beginning down to my own time. Accordingly the attendants of Alexander,
      having heard of the custom which existed about the temple, ran away from
      him, and sitting down as suppliants of the god, accused Alexander, because
      they desired to do him hurt, telling the whole tale how things were about
      Helen and about the wrong done to Menelaos; and this accusation they made
      not only to the priests but also to the warden of this river-mouth, whose
      name was Thonis.
    </p>
<p>
      114. Thonis then having heard their tale sent forthwith a message to
      Proteus at Memphis, which said as follows: "There hath come a stranger, a
      Teucrian by race, who hath done in Hellas an unholy deed; for he hath
      deceived the wife of his own host, and is come hither bringing with him
      this woman herself and very much wealth, having been carried out of his
      way by winds to thy land. <a href="#link2note-95" id="link2noteref-95" class="pginternal">95</a> Shall we then allow him to sail out unharmed,
      or shall we first take away from him that which he brought with him?" In
      reply to this Proteus sent back a messenger who said thus: "Seize this
      man, whosoever he may be, who has done impiety to his own host, and bring
      him away into my presence, that I may know what he will find to say."
    </p>
<p>
      115. Hearing this, Thonis seized Alexander and detained his ships, and
      after that he brought the man himself up to Memphis and with him Helen and
      the wealth he had, and also in addition to them the suppliants. So when
      all had been conveyed up thither, Proteus began to ask Alexander who he
      was and from whence he was voyaging; and he both recounted to him his
      descent and told him the name of his native land, and moreover related of
      his voyage, from whence he was sailing. After this Proteus asked him
      whence he had taken Helen; and when Alexander went astray in his account
      and did not speak the truth, those who had become suppliants convicted him
      of falsehood, relating in full the whole tale of the wrong done. At length
      Proteus declared to them this sentence, saying, "Were it not that I count
      it a matter of great moment not to slay any of those strangers who being
      driven from their course by winds have come to my land hitherto, I should
      have taken vengeance on thee on behalf of the man of Hellas, seeing that
      thou, most base of men, having received from him hospitality, didst work
      against him a most impious deed. For thou didst go in to the wife of thine
      own host; and even this was not enough for thee, but thou didst stir her
      up with desire and hast gone away with her like a thief. Moreover not even
      this by itself was enough for thee, but thou art come hither with plunder
      taken from the house of thy host. Now therefore depart, seeing that I have
      counted it of great moment not to be a slayer of strangers. This woman
      indeed and the wealth which thou hast I will not allow thee to carry away,
      but I shall keep them safe for the Hellene who was thy host, until he come
      himself and desire to carry them off to his home; to thyself however and
      thy fellow-voyagers I proclaim that ye depart from your anchoring within
      three days and go from my land to some other; and if not, that ye will be
      dealt with as enemies."
    </p>
<p>
      116. This the priests said was the manner of Helen's coming to Proteus;
      and I suppose that Homer also had heard this story, but since it was not
      so suitable to the composition of his poem as the other which he followed,
      he dismissed it finally, <a href="#link2note-96" id="link2noteref-96" class="pginternal">96</a> making it clear at the same time that he was
      acquainted with that story also: and according to the manner in which he
      described <a href="#link2note-97" id="link2noteref-97" class="pginternal">97</a> the wanderings of Alexander in the Iliad (nor
      did he elsewhere retract that which he had said) it is clear that when he
      brought Helen he was carried out of his course, wandering to various
      lands, and that he came among other places to Sidon in Phenicia. Of this
      the poet has made mention in the "prowess of Diomede," and the verses run
      this: <a href="#link2note-98" id="link2noteref-98" class="pginternal">98</a>
</p>
<pre>
 "There she had robes many-coloured, the works of women of Sidon,
  Those whom her son himself the god-like of form Alexander
  Carried from Sidon, what time the broad sea-path he sailed over
  Bringing back Helene home, of a noble father begotten."
</pre>
<p>
      And in the Odyssey also he has made mention of it in these verses: <a href="#link2note-99" id="link2noteref-99" class="pginternal">99</a>
</p>
<pre>
 "Such had the daughter of Zeus, such drugs of exquisite cunning,
  Good, which to her the wife of Thon, Polydamna, had given,
  Dwelling in Egypt, the land where the bountiful meadow produces
  Drugs more than all lands else, many good being mixed, many evil."
</pre>
<p>
      And thus too Menelaos says to Telemachos: <a href="#link2note-100" id="link2noteref-100" class="pginternal">100</a>
</p>
<pre>
 "Still the gods stayed me in Egypt, to come back hither desiring,
  Stayed me from voyaging home, since sacrifice was due I performed not."
</pre>
<p>
      In these lines he makes it clear that he knew of the wandering of
      Alexander to Egypt, for Syria borders upon Egypt and the Phenicians, of
      whom is Sidon, dwell in Syria.
    </p>
<p>
      117. By these lines and by this passage <a href="#link2note-101" id="link2noteref-101" class="pginternal">101</a> it is also most
      clearly shown that the "Cyprian Epic" was not written by Homer but by some
      other man: for in this it is said that on the third day after leaving
      Sparta Alexander came to Ilion bringing with him Helen, having had a
      "gently-blowing wind and a smooth sea," whereas in the Iliad it says that
      he wandered from his course when he brought her.
    </p>
<p>
      118. Let us now leave Homer and the "Cyprian" Epic; but this I will say,
      namely that I asked the priests whether it is but an idle tale which the
      Hellenes tell of that which they say happened about Ilion; and they
      answered me thus, saying that they had their knowledge by inquiries from
      Menelaos himself. After the rape of Helen there came indeed, they said, to
      the Teucrian land a large army of Hellenes to help Menelaos; and when the
      army had come out of the ships to land and had pitched its camp there,
      they sent messengers to Ilion, with whom went also Menelaos himself; and
      when these entered within the wall they demanded back Helen and the wealth
      which Alexander had stolen from Menelaos and had taken away; and moreover
      they demanded satisfaction for the wrongs done: and the Teucrians told the
      same tale then and afterwards, both with oath and without oath, namely
      that in deed and in truth they had not Helen nor the wealth for which
      demand was made, but that both were in Egypt; and that they could not
      justly be compelled to give satisfaction for that which Proteus the king
      of Egypt had. The Hellenes however thought that they were being mocked by
      them and besieged the city, until at last they took it; and when they had
      taken the wall and did not find Helen, but heard the same tale as before,
      then they believed the former tale and sent Menelaos himself to Proteus.
    </p>
<p>
      119. And Menelaos having come to Egypt and having sailed up to Memphis,
      told the truth of these matters, and not only found great entertainment,
      but also received Helen unhurt, and all his own wealth besides. Then
      however, after he had been thus dealt with, Menelaos showed himself
      ungrateful to the Egyptians; for when he set forth to sail away, contrary
      winds detained him, and as this condition of things lasted long, he
      devised an impious deed; for he took two children of natives and made
      sacrifice of them. After this, when it was known that he had done so, he
      became abhorred, and being pursued he escaped and got away in his ships to
      Libya; but whither he went besides after this, the Egyptians were not able
      to tell. Of these things they said that they found out part by inquiries,
      and the rest, namely that which happened in their own land, they related
      from sure and certain knowledge.
    </p>
<p>
      120. Thus the priests of the Egyptians told me; and I myself also agree
      with the story which was told of Helen, adding this consideration, namely
      that if Helen had been in Ilion she would have been given up to the
      Hellenes, whether Alexander consented or no; for Priam assuredly was not
      so mad, nor yet the others of his house, that they were desirous to run
      risk of ruin for themselves and their children and their city, in order
      that Alexander might have Helen as his wife: and even supposing that
      during the first part of the time they had been so inclined, yet when many
      others of the Trojans besides were losing their lives as often as they
      fought with the Hellenes, and of the sons of Priam himself always two or
      three or even more were slain when a battle took place (if one may trust
      at all to the Epic poets),—when, I say, things were coming thus to
      pass, I consider that even if Priam himself had had Helen as his wife, he
      would have given her back to the Achaians, if at least by so doing he
      might be freed from the evils which oppressed him. Nor even was the
      kingdom coming to Alexander next, so that when Priam was old the
      government was in his hands; but Hector, who was both older and more of a
      man than he, would have received it after the death of Priam; and him it
      behoved not to allow his brother to go on with his wrong-doing,
      considering that great evils were coming to pass on his account both to
      himself privately and in general to the other Trojans. In truth however
      they lacked the power to give Helen back; and the Hellenes did not believe
      them, though they spoke the truth; because, as I declare my opinion, the
      divine power was purposing to cause them utterly to perish, and so make it
      evident to men that for great wrongs great also are the chastisements
      which come from the gods. And thus have I delivered my opinion concerning
      these matters.
    </p>
<p>
      121. After Proteus, they told me, Rhampsinitos received in succession the
      kingdom, who left as a memorial of himself that gateway to the temple of
      Hephaistos which is turned towards the West, and in front of the gateway
      he set up two statues, in height five-and-twenty cubits, of which the one
      which stands on the North side is called by the Egyptians Summer and the
      one on the South side Winter; and to that one which they call Summer they
      do reverence and make offerings, while to the other which is called Winter
      they do the opposite of these things. (a) This king, they said, got great
      wealth of silver, which none of the kings born after him could surpass or
      even come near to; and wishing to store his wealth in safety he caused to
      be built a chamber of stone, one of the walls whereof was towards the
      outside of his palace: and the builder of this, having a design against
      it, contrived as follows, that is, he disposed one of the stones in such a
      manner that it could be taken out easily from the wall either by two men
      or even by one. So when the chamber was finished, the king stored his
      money in it, and after some time the builder, being near the end of his
      life, called to him his sons (for he had two) and to them he related how
      he had contrived in building the treasury of the king, and all in
      forethought for them, that they might have ample means of living. And when
      he had clearly set forth to them everything concerning the taking out of
      the stone, he gave them the measurements, saying that if they paid heed to
      this matter they would be stewards of the king's treasury. So he ended his
      life, and his sons made no long delay in setting to work, but went to the
      palace by night, and having found the stone in the wall of the chamber
      they dealt with it easily and carried forth for themselves great quantity
      of the wealth within. (b) And the king happening to open the chamber, he
      marvelled when he saw the vessels falling short of the full amount, and he
      did not know on whom he should lay the blame, since the seals were
      unbroken and the chamber had been close shut; but when upon his opening
      the chamber a second and a third time the money was each time seen to be
      diminished, for the thieves did not slacken in their assaults upon it, he
      did as follows:—having ordered traps to be made he set these round
      about the vessels in which the money was; and when the thieves had come as
      at former times and one of them had entered, then so soon as he came near
      to one of the vessels he was straightway caught in the trap: and when he
      perceived in what evil case he was, straightway calling his brother he
      showed him what the matter was, and bade him enter as quickly as possible
      and cut off his head, for fear lest being seen and known he might bring
      about the destruction of his brother also. And to the other it seemed that
      he spoke well, and he was persuaded and did so; and fitting the stone into
      its place he departed home bearing with him the head of his brother. (c)
      Now when it became day, the king entered into the chamber and was very
      greatly amazed, seeing the body of the thief held in the trap without his
      head, and the chamber unbroken, with no way to come in or go out: and
      being at a loss he hung up the dead body of the thief upon the wall and
      set guards there, with charge if they saw any one weeping or bewailing
      himself to seize him and bring him before the king. And when the dead body
      had been hung up, the mother was greatly grieved, and speaking with the
      son who survived she enjoined him, in whatever way he could, to contrive
      means by which he might take down and bring home the body of his dead
      brother; and if he should neglect to do this, she earnestly threatened
      that she would go and give information to the king that he had the money.
      (d) So as the mother dealt hardly with the surviving son, and he though
      saying many things to her did not persuade her, he contrived for his
      purpose a device as follows:—Providing himself with asses he filled
      some skins with wine and laid them upon the asses, and after that he drove
      them along: and when he came opposite to those who were guarding the
      corpse hung up, he drew towards him two or three of the necks <a href="#link2note-102" id="link2noteref-102" class="pginternal">102</a>
      of the skins and loosened the cords with which they were tied. Then when
      the wine was running out, he began to beat his head and cry out loudly, as
      if he did not know to which of the asses he should first turn; and when
      the guards saw the wine flowing out in streams, they ran together to the
      road with drinking vessels in their hands and collected the wine that was
      poured out, counting it so much gain; and he abused them all violently,
      making as if he were angry, but when the guards tried to appease him,
      after a time he feigned to be pacified and to abate his anger, and at
      length he drove his asses out of the road and began to set their loads
      right. Then more talk arose among them, and one or two of them made jests
      at him and brought him to laugh with them; and in the end he made them a
      present of one of the skins in addition to what they had. Upon that they
      lay down there without more ado, being minded to drink, and they took him
      into their company and invited him to remain with them and join them in
      their drinking: so he (as may be supposed) was persuaded and stayed. Then
      as they in their drinking bade him welcome in a friendly manner, he made a
      present to them also of another of the skins; and so at length having
      drunk liberally the guards became completely intoxicated; and being
      overcome by sleep they went to bed on the spot where they had been
      drinking. He then, as it was now far on in the night, first took down the
      body of his brother, and then in mockery shaved the right cheeks of all
      the guards; and after that he put the dead body upon the asses and drove
      them away home, having accomplished that which was enjoined him by his
      mother. (e) Upon this the king, when it was reported to him that the dead
      body of the thief had been stolen away, displayed great anger; and
      desiring by all means that it should be found out who it might be who
      devised these things, did this (so at least they said, but I do not
      believe the account),—he caused his own daughter to sit in the
      stews, and enjoined her to receive all equally, and before having commerce
      with any one to compel him to tell her what was the most cunning and what
      the most unholy deed which had been done by him in all his life-time; and
      whosoever should relate that which had happened about the thief, him she
      must seize and not let him go out. Then as she was doing that which was
      enjoined by her father, the thief, hearing for what purpose this was done
      and having a desire to get the better of the king in resource, did thus:—from
      the body of one lately dead he cut off the arm at the shoulder and went
      with it under his mantle: and having gone in to the daughter of the king,
      and being asked that which the others also were asked, he related that he
      had done the most unholy deed when he cut off the head of his brother, who
      had been caught in a trap in the king's treasure-chamber, and the most
      cunning deed in that he made drunk the guards and took down the dead body
      of his brother hanging up; and she when she heard it tried to take hold of
      him, but the thief held out to her in the darkness the arm of the corpse,
      which she grasped and held, thinking that she was holding the arm of the
      man himself; but the thief left it in her hands and departed, escaping
      through the door. (f) Now when this also was reported to the king, he was
      at first amazed at the ready invention and daring of the fellow, and then
      afterwards he sent round to all the cities and made proclamation granting
      a free pardon to the thief, and also promising a great reward if he would
      come into his presence. The thief accordingly trusting to the proclamation
      came to the king, and Rhampsinitos greatly marvelled at him, and gave him
      this daughter of his to wife, counting him to be the most knowing of all
      men; for as the Egyptians were distinguished from all other men, so was he
      from the other Egyptians.
    </p>
<p>
      122. After these things they said this king went down alive to that place
      which by the Hellenes is called Hades, and there played at dice with
      Demeter, and in some throws he overcame her and in others he was overcome
      by her; and he came back again having as a gift from her a handkerchief of
      gold: and they told me that because of the going down of Rhampsinitos the
      Egyptians after he came back celebrated a feast, which I know of my own
      knowledge also that they still observe even to my time; but whether it is
      for this cause that they keep the feast or for some other, I am not able
      to say. However, the priests weave a robe completely on the very day of
      the feast, and forthwith they bind up the eyes of one of them with a
      fillet, and having led him with the robe to the way by which one goes to
      the temple of Demeter, they depart back again themselves. This priest,
      they say, with his eyes bound up is led by two wolves to the temple of
      Demeter, which is distant from the city twenty furlongs, and then
      afterwards the wolves lead him back again from the temple to the same
      spot.
    </p>
<p>
      123. Now as to the tales told by the Egyptians, any man may accept them to
      whom such things appear credible; as for me, it is to be understood
      throughout the whole of the history <a href="#link2note-103" id="link2noteref-103" class="pginternal">103</a> that I write by
      hearsay that which is reported by the people in each place. The Egyptians
      say that Demeter and Dionysos are rulers of the world below; and the
      Egyptians are also the first who reported the doctrine that the soul of
      man is immortal, and that when the body dies, the soul enters into another
      creature which chances then to be coming to the birth, and when it has
      gone the round of all the creatures of land and sea and of the air, it
      enters again into a human body as it comes to the birth; and that it makes
      this round in a period of three thousand years. This doctrine certain
      Hellenes adopted, some earlier and some later, as if it were of their own
      invention, and of these men I know the names but I abstain from recording
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      124. Down to the time when Rhampsinitos was king, they told me there was
      in Egypt nothing but orderly rule, and Egypt prospered greatly; but after
      him Cheops became king over them and brought them <a href="#link2note-104" id="link2noteref-104" class="pginternal">104</a> to every kind of
      evil: for he shut up all the temples, and having first kept them from
      sacrificing there, he then bade all the Egyptians work for him. So some
      were appointed to draw stones from the stone-quarries in the Arabian
      mountains to the Nile, and others he ordered to receive the stones after
      they had been carried over the river in boats, and to draw them to those
      which are called the Libyan mountains; and they worked by a hundred
      thousand men at a time, for each three months continually. Of this
      oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which
      they drew the stones, which causeway they built, and it is a work not much
      less, as it appears to me, than the pyramid; for the length of it is five
      furlongs <a href="#link2note-105" id="link2noteref-105" class="pginternal">105</a> and the breadth ten fathoms and the height,
      where it is highest, eight fathoms, and it is made of stone smoothed and
      with figures carved upon it. For this, they said, the ten years were
      spent, and for the underground chambers on the hill upon which the
      pyramids stand, which he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for
      himself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile.
      For the making of the pyramid itself there passed a period of twenty
      years; and the pyramid is square, each side measuring eight hundred feet,
      and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed and fitted
      together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones being less than
      thirty feet in length.
    </p>
<p>
      125. This pyramid was made after the manner of steps, which some call
      "rows" <a href="#link2note-106" id="link2noteref-106" class="pginternal">106</a> and others "bases": <a href="#link2note-107" id="link2noteref-107" class="pginternal">107</a> and when they had
      first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with machines made of
      short pieces of timber, raising them first from the ground to the first
      stage of the steps, and when the stone got up to this it was placed upon
      another machine standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn
      to the second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses of the
      steps, so many machines there were also, or perhaps they transferred one
      and the same machine, made so as easily to be carried, to each stage
      successively, in order that they might take up the stones; for let it be
      told in both ways, according as it is reported. However that may be, the
      highest parts of it were finished first, and afterwards they proceeded to
      finish that which came next to them, and lastly they finished the parts of
      it near the ground and the lowest ranges. On the pyramid it is declared in
      Egyptian writing how much was spent on radishes and onions and leeks for
      the workmen, and if I rightly remember that which the interpreter said in
      reading to me this inscription, a sum of one thousand six hundred talents
      of silver was spent; and if this is so, how much besides is likely to have
      been expended upon the iron with which they worked, and upon bread and
      clothing for the workmen, seeing that they were building the works for the
      time which has been mentioned and were occupied for no small time besides,
      as I suppose, in the cutting and bringing of the stones and in working at
      the excavation under the ground?
    </p>
<p>
      126. Cheops moreover came, they said, to such a pitch of wickedness, that
      being in want of money he caused his own daughter to sit in the stews, and
      ordered her to obtain from those who came a certain amount of money (how
      much it was they did not tell me); but she not only obtained the sum
      appointed by her father, but also she formed a design for herself
      privately to leave behind her a memorial, and she requested each man who
      came in to her to give her one stone upon her building: and of these
      stones, they told me, the pyramid was built which stands in front of the
      great pyramid in the middle of the three, <a href="#link2note-108" id="link2noteref-108" class="pginternal">108</a> each side being one
      hundred and fifty feet in length.
    </p>
<p>
      127. This Cheops, the Egyptians said, reigned fifty years; and after he
      was dead his brother Chephren succeeded to the kingdom. This king followed
      the same manner as the other, both in all the rest and also in that he
      made a pyramid, not indeed attaining to the measurements of that which was
      built by the former (this I know, having myself also measured it), and
      moreover <a href="#link2note-109" id="link2noteref-109" class="pginternal">109</a> there are no underground chambers beneath
      nor does a channel come from the Nile flowing to this one as to the other,
      in which the water coming through a conduit built for it flows round an
      island within, where they say that Cheops himself is laid: but for a
      basement he built the first course of Ethiopian stone of divers colours;
      and this pyramid he made forty feet lower than the other as regards size,
      <a href="#link2note-110" id="link2noteref-110" class="pginternal">110</a>
      building it close to the great pyramid. These stand both upon the same
      hill, which is about a hundred feet high. And Chephren they said reigned
      fifty and six years.
    </p>
<p>
      128. Here then they reckon one hundred and six years, during which they
      say that there was nothing but evil for the Egyptians, and the temples
      were kept closed and not opened during all that time. These kings the
      Egyptians by reason of their hatred of them are not very willing to name;
      nay, they even call the pyramids after the name of Philitis <a href="#link2note-111" id="link2noteref-111" class="pginternal">111</a>
      the shepherd, who at that time pastured flocks in those regions.
    </p>
<p>
      129. After him, they said, Mykerinos became king over Egypt, who was the
      son of Cheops; and to him his father's deeds were displeasing, and he both
      opened the temples and gave liberty to the people, who were ground down to
      the last extremity of evil, to return to their own business and to their
      sacrifices;: also he gave decisions of their causes juster than those of
      all the other kings besides. In regard to this then they commend this king
      more than all the other kings who had arisen in Egypt before him; for he
      not only gave good decisions, but also when a man complained of the
      decision, he gave him recompense from his own goods and thus satisfied his
      desire. But while Mykerinos was acting mercifully to his subjects and
      practising this conduct which has been said, calamities befell him, of
      which the first was this, namely that his daughter died, the only child
      whom he had in his house: and being above measure grieved by that which
      had befallen him, and desiring to bury his daughter in a manner more
      remarkable than others, he made a cow of wood, which he covered over with
      gold, and then within it he buried this daughter who, as I said, had died.
    </p>
<p>
      130. This cow was not covered up in the ground, but it might be seen even
      down to my own time in the city of Saïs, placed within the royal palace in
      a chamber which was greatly adorned; and they offer incense of all kinds
      before it every day, and each night a lamp burns beside it all through the
      night. Near this cow in another chamber stand images of the concubines of
      Mykerinos, as the priests at Saïs told me; for there are in fact colossal
      wooden statues, in number about twenty, made with naked bodies; but who
      they are I am not able to say, except only that which is reported.
    </p>
<p>
      131. Some however tell about this cow and the colossal statues the
      following tale, namely that Mykerinos was enamoured of his own daughter
      and afterwards ravished her; and upon this they say that the girl
      strangled herself for grief, and he buried her in this cow; and her mother
      cut off the hands of the maids who had betrayed the daughter to her
      father; wherefore now the images of them have suffered that which the
      maids suffered in their life. In thus saying they speak idly, as it seems
      to me, especially in what they say about the hands of the statues; for as
      to this, even we ourselves saw that their hands had dropped off from lapse
      of time, and they were to be seen still lying at their feet even down to
      my time.
    </p>
<p>
      132. The cow is covered up with a crimson robe, except only the head and
      the neck, which are seen, overlaid with gold very thickly; and between the
      horns there is the disc of the sun figured in gold. The cow is not
      standing up but kneeling, and in size it is equal to a large living cow.
      Every year it is carried forth from the chamber, at those times, I say,
      the Egyptians beat themselves for that god whom I will not name upon
      occasion of such a matter; at these times, I say, they also carry forth
      the cow to the light of day, for they say that she asked of her father
      Mykerinos, when she was dying, that she might look upon the sun once in
      the year.
    </p>
<p>
      133. After the misfortune of his daughter it happened, they said, secondly
      to this king as follows:—An oracle came to him from the city of
      Buto, saying that he was destined to live but six years more, in the
      seventh year to end his life: and he being indignant at it sent to the
      Oracle a reproach against the god, <a href="#link2note-112" id="link2noteref-112" class="pginternal">112</a> making complaint in
      reply that whereas his father and uncle, who had shut up the temples and
      had not only not remembered the gods, but also had been destroyers of men,
      had lived for a long time, he himself, who practised piety, was destined
      to end his life so soon: and from the Oracle there came a second message,
      which said that it was for this very cause that he was bringing his life
      to a swift close; <a href="#link2note-113" id="link2noteref-113" class="pginternal">113</a> for he had not done that which it was
      appointed for him to do, since it was destined that Egypt should suffer
      evils for a hundred and fifty years, and the two kings who had risen
      before him had perceived this, but he had not. Mykerinos having heard
      this, and considering that this sentence had been passed upon him beyond
      recall, procured many lamps, and whenever night came on he lighted these
      and began to drink and take his pleasure, ceasing neither by day nor by
      night; and he went about to the fen-country and to the woods and wherever
      he heard there were the most suitable places for enjoyment. This he
      devised (having a mind to prove that the Oracle spoke falsely) in order
      that he might have twelve years of life instead of six, the nights being
      turned into days.

<p>
      134. This king also left behind him a pyramid, much smaller than that of
      his father, of a square shape and measuring on each side three hundred
      feet lacking twenty, built moreover of Ethiopian stone up to half the
      height. This pyramid some of the Hellenes say was built by the courtesan
      Rhodopis, not therein speaking rightly: and besides this it is evident to
      me that they who speak thus do not even know who Rhodopis was, for
      otherwise they would not have attributed to her the building of a pyramid
      like this, on which have been spent (so to speak) innumerable thousands of
      talents: moreover they do not know that Rhodopis flourished in the reign
      of Amasis, and not in this king's reign; for Rhodopis lived very many
      years later than the kings who left behind the pyramids. By descent she
      was of Thrace, and she was a slave of Iadmon the son of Hephaistopolis a
      Samian, and a fellow-slave of Esop the maker of fables; for he too was
      once the slave of Iadmon, as was proved especially in this fact, namely
      that when the people of Delphi repeatedly made proclamation in accordance
      with an oracle, to find some one who would take up <a href="#link2note-114" id="link2noteref-114" class="pginternal">114</a> the blood-money for
      the death of Esop, no one else appeared, but at length the grandson of
      Iadmon, called Iadmon also, took it up; and thus it is shown that Esop too
      was the slave of Iadmon.
    </p>
<p>
      135. As for Rhodopis, she came to Egypt brought by Xanthes the Samian, and
      having come thither to exercise her calling she was redeemed from slavery
      for a great sum by a man of Mytilene, Charaxos son of Scamandronymos and
      brother of Sappho the lyric poet. Thus was Rhodopis set free, and she
      remained in Egypt and by her beauty won so much liking that she made great
      gain of money for one like Rhodopis, <a href="#link2note-115" id="link2noteref-115" class="pginternal">115</a> though not enough to
      suffice for the cost of such a pyramid as this. In truth there is no need
      to ascribe to her very great riches, considering that the tithe of her
      wealth may still be seen even to this time by any one who desires it: for
      Rhodopis wished to leave behind her a memorial of herself in Hellas,
      namely to cause a thing to be made such as happens not to have been
      thought of or dedicated in a temple by any besides, and to dedicate this
      at Delphi as a memorial of herself. Accordingly with the tithe of her
      wealth she caused to be made spits of iron of size large enough to pierce
      a whole ox, and many in number, going as far therein as her tithe allowed
      her, and she sent them to Delphi: these are even at the present time lying
      there, heaped all together behind the altar which the Chians dedicated,
      and just opposite to the cell of the temple. <a href="#link2note-116" id="link2noteref-116" class="pginternal">116</a> Now at Naucratis, as
      it happens, the courtesans are rather apt to win credit; <a href="#link2note-117" id="link2noteref-117" class="pginternal">117</a>
      for this woman first, about whom the story to which I refer is told,
      became so famous that all the Hellenes without exception come to know the
      name of Rhodopis, and then after her one whose name was Archidiche became
      a subject of song over all Hellas, though she was less talked of than the
      other. As for Charaxos, when after redeeming Rhodopis he returned back to
      Mytilene, Sappho in an ode violently abused him. <a href="#link2note-118" id="link2noteref-118" class="pginternal">118</a> Of Rhodopis then I
      shall say no more.
    </p>
<p>
      136. After Mykerinos the priests said Asychis became king of Egypt, and he
      made for Hephaistos the temple gateway <a href="#link2note-119" id="link2noteref-119" class="pginternal">119</a> which is towards the
      sunrising, by far the most beautiful and the largest of the gateways; for
      while they all have figures carved upon them and innumerable ornaments of
      building <a href="#link2note-120" id="link2noteref-120" class="pginternal">120</a> besides, this has them very much more than
      the rest. In this king's reign they told me that, as the circulation of
      money was very slow, a law was made for the Egyptians that a man might
      have that money lent to him which he needed, by offering as security the
      dead body of his father; and there was added moreover to this law another,
      namely that he who lent the money should have a claim also to the whole
      sepulchral chamber belonging to him who received it, and that the man who
      offered that security should be subject to this penalty, if he refused to
      pay back the debt, namely that neither the man himself should be allowed
      to have burial when he died, either in that family burial-place or in any
      other, nor should he be allowed to bury any one of his kinsmen whom he
      lost by death. This king desiring to surpass the kings of Egypt who had
      arisen before him left as a memorial of himself a pyramid which he made of
      bricks, and on it there is an inscription carved in stone and saying thus:
      "Despise not me in comparison with the pyramids of stone, seeing that I
      excel them as much as Zeus excels the other gods; for with a pole they
      struck into the lake, and whatever of the mud attached itself to the pole,
      this they gathered up and made bricks, and in such manner they finished
      me."
    </p>
<p>
      Such were the deeds which this king performed;
    </p>
<p>
      137, and after him reigned a blind man of the city of Anysis, whose name
      was Anysis. In his reign the Ethiopians and Sabacos the king of the
      Ethiopians marched upon Egypt with a great host of men; so this blind man
      departed, flying to the fen-country, and the Ethiopian was king over Egypt
      for fifty years, during which he performed deeds as follows:—whenever
      any man of the Egyptians committed any transgression, he would never put
      him to death, but he gave sentence upon each man according to the
      greatness of the wrong-doing, appointing them work at throwing up an
      embankment before that city from whence each man came of those who
      committed wrong. Thus the cities were made higher still than before; for
      they were embanked first by those who dug the channels in the reign of
      Sesostris, and then secondly in the reign of the Ethiopian, and thus they
      were made very high: and while other cities in Egypt also stood <a href="#link2note-121" id="link2noteref-121" class="pginternal">121</a>
      high, I think in the town at Bubastis especially the earth was piled up.
      In this city there is a temple very well worthy of mention, for though
      there are other temples which are larger and built with more cost, none
      more than this is a pleasure to the eyes. Now Bubastis in the Hellenic
      tongue is Artemis,
    </p>
<p>
      138, and her temple is ordered thus:—Except the entrance it is
      completely surrounded by water; for channels come in from the Nile, not
      joining one another, but each extending as far as the entrance of the
      temple, one flowing round on the one side and the other on the other side,
      each a hundred feet broad and shaded over with trees; and the gateway has
      a height of ten fathoms, and it is adorned with figures six cubits high,
      very noteworthy. This temple is in the middle of the city and is looked
      down upon from all sides as one goes round, for since the city has been
      banked up to a height, while the temple has not been moved from the place
      where it was at the first built, it is possible to look down into it: and
      round it runs a stone wall with figures carved upon it, while within it
      there is a grove of very large trees planted round a large temple-house,
      within which is the image of the goddess: and the breadth and length of
      the temple is a furlong every way. Opposite the entrance there is a road
      paved with stone for about three furlongs, which leads through the
      market-place towards the East, with a breadth of about four hundred feet;
      and on this side and on that grow trees of height reaching to heaven: and
      the road leads to the temple of Hermes. This temple then is thus ordered.
    </p>
<p>
      139. The final deliverance from the Ethiopian came about (they said) as
      follows:—he fled away because he had seen in his sleep a vision, in
      which it seemed to him that a man came and stood by him and counselled him
      to gather together all the priests of Egypt and cut them asunder in the
      midst. Having seen this dream, he said that it seemed to him that the gods
      were foreshowing him this to furnish an occasion against him, <a href="#link2note-122" id="link2noteref-122" class="pginternal">122</a>
      in order that he might do an impious deed with respect to religion, and so
      receive some evil either from the gods or from men: he would not however
      do so, but in truth (he said) the time had expired, during which it had
      been prophesied to him that he should rule Egypt before he departed
      thence. For when he was in Ethiopia the Oracles which the Ethiopians
      consult had told him that it was fated for him to rule Egypt fifty years:
      since then this time was now expiring, and the vision of the dream also
      disturbed him, Sabacos departed out of Egypt of his own free will.
    </p>
<p>
      140. Then when the Ethiopian had gone away out of Egypt, the blind man
      came back from the fen-country and began to rule again, having lived there
      during fifty years upon an island which he had made by heaping up ashes
      and earth: for whenever any of the Egyptians visited him bringing food,
      according as it had been appointed to them severally to do without the
      knowledge of the Ethiopian, he bade them bring also some ashes for their
      gift. <a href="#link2note-123" id="link2noteref-123" class="pginternal">123</a> This island none was able to find before
      Amyrtaios; that is, for more than seven hundred years <a href="#link2note-124" id="link2noteref-124" class="pginternal">124</a>
      the kings who arose before Amyrtaios were not able to find it. Now the
      name of this island is Elbo, and its size is ten furlongs each way.
    </p>
<p>
      141. After him there came to the throne the priest of Hephaistos, whose
      name was Sethos. This man, they said, neglected and held in no regard the
      warrior class of the Egyptians, considering that he would have no need of
      them; and besides other slights which he put upon them, he also took from
      them the yokes of corn-land <a href="#link2note-125" id="link2noteref-125" class="pginternal">125</a> which had been given
      to them as a special gift in the reigns of the former kings, twelve yokes
      to each man. After this, Sanacharib king of the Arabians and of the
      Assyrians marched a great host against Egypt. Then the warriors of the
      Egyptians refused to come to the rescue, and the priest, being driven into
      a strait, entered into the sanctuary of the temple <a href="#link2note-126" id="link2noteref-126" class="pginternal">126</a> and bewailed to the
      image of the god the danger which was impending over him; and as he was
      thus lamenting, sleep came upon him, and it seemed to him in his vision
      that the god came and stood by him and encouraged him, saying that he
      should suffer no evil if he went forth to meet the army of the Arabians;
      for he himself would send him helpers. Trusting in these things seen in
      sleep, he took with him, they said, those of the Egyptians who were
      willing to follow him, and encamped in Pelusion, for by this way the
      invasion came: and not one of the warrior class followed him, but
      shop-keepers and artisans and men of the market. Then after they came,
      there swarmed by night upon their enemies mice of the fields, and ate up
      their quivers and their bows, and moreover the handles of their shields,
      so that on the next day they fled, and being without defence of arms great
      numbers fell. And at the present time this king stands in the temple of
      Hephaistos in stone, holding upon his hand a mouse, and by letters
      inscribed he says these words: "Let him who looks upon me learn to fear
      the gods."
    </p>
<p>
      142. So far in the story the Egyptians and the priests were they who made
      the report, declaring that from the first king down to this priest of
      Hephaistos who reigned last, there had been three hundred and forty-one
      generations of men, and that in them there had been the same number of
      chief-priests and of kings: but three hundred generations of men are equal
      to ten thousand years, for a hundred years is three generations of men;
      and in the one-and-forty generations which remain, those I mean which were
      added to the three hundred, there are one thousand three hundred and forty
      years. Thus in the period of eleven thousand three hundred and forty years
      they said that there had arisen no god in human form; nor even before that
      time or afterwards among the remaining kings who arose in Egypt, did they
      report that anything of that kind had come to pass. In this time they said
      that the sun had moved four times from his accustomed place of rising, and
      where he now sets he had thence twice had his rising, and in the place
      from whence he now rises he had twice had his setting; <a href="#link2note-127" id="link2noteref-127" class="pginternal">127</a>
      and in the meantime nothing in Egypt had been changed from its usual
      state, neither that which comes from the earth nor that which comes to
      them from the river nor that which concerns diseases or deaths.
    </p>
<p>
      143. And formerly when Hecataios the historian was in Thebes, and had
      traced his descent and connected his family with a god in the sixteenth
      generation before, the priests of Zeus did for him much the same as they
      did for me (though I had not traced my descent). They led me into the
      sanctuary of the temple, which is of great size, and they counted up the
      number, showing colossal wooden statues in number the same as they said;
      for each chief-priest there sets up in his lifetime an image of himself:
      accordingly the priests, counting and showing me these, declared to me
      that each one of them was a son succeeding his own father, and they went
      up through the series of images from the image of the one who had died
      last, until they had declared this of the whole number. And when Hecataios
      had traced his descent and connected his family with a god in the
      sixteenth generation, they traced a descent in opposition to this, besides
      their numbering, not accepting it from him that a man had been born from a
      god; and they traced their counter-descent thus, saying that each one of
      the statues had been <i>piromis</i> son of <i>piromis</i>, until they had
      declared this of the whole three hundred and forty-five statues, each one
      being surnamed <i>piromis</i>; and neither with a god nor a hero did they
      connect their descent. Now <i>piromis</i> means in the tongue of Hellas
      "honourable and good man."
    </p>
<p>
      144. From their declaration then it followed, that they of whom the images
      were had been of form like this, and far removed from being gods: but in
      the time before these men they said that gods were the rulers in Egypt,
      not mingling <a href="#link2note-128" id="link2noteref-128" class="pginternal">128</a> with men, and that of these always one had
      power at a time; and the last of them who was king over Egypt was Oros the
      son of Osiris, whom the Hellenes call Apollo: he was king over Egypt last,
      having deposed Typhon. Now Osiris in the tongue of Hellas is Dionysos.
    </p>
<p>
      145. Among the Hellenes Heracles and Dionysos and Pan are accounted the
      latest-born of the gods; but with the Egyptians Pan is a very ancient god,
      and he is one of those which are called the eight gods, while Heracles is
      of the second rank, who are called the twelve gods, and Dionysos is of the
      third rank, namely of those who were born of the twelve gods. Now as to
      Heracles I have shown already how many years old he is according to the
      Egyptians themselves, reckoning down to the reign of Amasis, and Pan is
      said to have existed for yet more years than these, and Dionysos for the
      smallest number of years as compared with the others; and even for this
      last they reckon down to the reign of Amasis fifteen thousand years. This
      the Egyptians say that they know for a certainty, since they always kept a
      reckoning and wrote down the years as they came. Now the Dionysos who is
      said to have been born of Semele the daughter of Cadmos, was born about
      sixteen hundred years before my time, and Heracles who was the son of
      Alcmene, about nine hundred years, and that Pan who was born of Penelope,
      for of her and of Hermes Pan is said by the Hellenes to have been born,
      came into being later than the wars of Troy, about eight hundred years
      before my time.
    </p>
<p>
      146. Of these two accounts every man may adopt that one which he shall
      find the more credible when he hears it. I however, for my part, have
      already declared my opinion about them. <a href="#link2note-129" id="link2noteref-129" class="pginternal">129</a> For if these also,
      like Heracles the son of Amphitryon, had appeared before all men's eyes
      and had lived their lives to old age in Hellas, I mean Dionysos the son of
      Semele and Pan the son of Penelope, then one would have said that these
      also <a href="#link2note-130" id="link2noteref-130" class="pginternal">130</a>
      had been born mere men, having the names of those gods who had come into
      being long before: but as it is, with regard to Dionysos the Hellenes say
      that as soon as he was born Zeus sewed him up in his thigh and carried him
      to Nysa, which is above Egypt in the land of Ethiopia; and as to Pan, they
      cannot say whither he went after he was born. Hence it has become clear to
      me that the Hellenes learnt the names of these gods later than those of
      the other gods, and trace their descent as if their birth occurred at the
      time when they first learnt their names.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus far then the history is told by the Egyptians themselves;
    </p>
<p>
      147, but I will now recount that which other nations also tell, and the
      Egyptians in agreement with the others, of that which happened in this
      land: and there will be added to this also something of that which I have
      myself seen.
    </p>
<p>
      Being set free after the reign of the priest of Hephaistos, the Egyptians,
      since they could not live any time without a king, set up over them twelve
      kings, having divided all Egypt into twelve parts. These made
      intermarriages with one another and reigned, making agreement that they
      would not put down one another by force, nor seek to get an advantage over
      one another, but would live in perfect friendship: and the reason why they
      made these agreements, guarding them very strongly from violation, was
      this, namely that an oracle had been given to them at first when they
      began to exercise their rule, that he of them who should pour a libation
      with a bronze cup in the temple of Hephaistos, should be king of all Egypt
      (for they used to assemble together in all the temples).
    </p>
<p>
      148. Moreover they resolved to join all together and leave a memorial of
      themselves; and having so resolved they caused to be made a labyrinth,
      situated a little above the lake of Moiris and nearly opposite to that
      which is called the City of Crocodiles. This I saw myself, and I found it
      greater than words can say. For if one should put together and reckon up
      all the buildings and all the great works produced by the Hellenes, they
      would prove to be inferior in labour and expense to this labyrinth, though
      it is true that both the temple at Ephesos and that at Samos are works
      worthy of note. The pyramids also were greater than words can say, and
      each one of them is equal to many works of the Hellenes, great as they may
      be; but the labyrinth surpasses even the pyramids. It has twelve courts
      covered in, with gates facing one another, six upon the North side and six
      upon the South, joining on one to another, and the same wall surrounds
      them all outside; and there are in it two kinds of chambers, the one kind
      below the ground and the other above upon these, three thousand in number,
      of each kind fifteen hundred. The upper set of chambers we ourselves saw,
      going through them, and we tell of them having looked upon them with our
      own eyes; but the chambers under ground we heard about only; for the
      Egyptians who had charge of them were not willing on any account to show
      them, saying that here were the sepulchres of the kings who had first
      built this labyrinth and of the sacred crocodiles. Accordingly we speak of
      the chambers below by what we received from hearsay, while those above we
      saw ourselves and found them to be works of more than human greatness. For
      the passages through the chambers, and the goings this way and that way
      through the courts, which were admirably adorned, afforded endless matter
      for marvel, as we went through from a court to the chambers beyond it, and
      from the chambers to colonnades, and from the colonnades to other rooms,
      and then from the chambers again to other courts. Over the whole of these
      is a roof made of stone like the walls; and the walls are covered with
      figures carved upon them, each court being surrounded with pillars of
      white stone fitted together most perfectly; and at the end of the
      labyrinth, by the corner of it, there is a pyramid of forty fathoms, upon
      which large figures are carved, and to this there is a way made under
      ground.
    </p>
<p>
      149. Such is this labyrinth; but a cause for marvel even greater than this
      is afforded by the lake, which is called the lake of Moiris, along the
      side of which this labyrinth is built. The measure of its circuit is three
      thousand six hundred furlongs <a href="#link2note-131" id="link2noteref-131" class="pginternal">131</a> (being sixty <i>schoines</i>),
      and this is the same number of furlongs as the extent of Egypt itself
      along the sea. The lake lies extended lengthwise from North to South, and
      in depth where it is deepest it is fifty fathoms. That this lake is
      artificial and formed by digging is self-evident, for about in the middle
      of the lake stand two pyramids, each rising above the water to a height of
      fifty fathoms, the part which is built below the water being of just the
      same height; and upon each is placed a colossal statue of stone sitting
      upon a chair. Thus the pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and these
      hundred fathoms are equal to a furlong of six hundred feet, the fathom
      being measured as six feet or four cubits, the feet being four palms each,
      and the cubits six. The water in the lake does not come from the place
      where it is, for the country there is very deficient in water, but it has
      been brought thither from the Nile by a canal: and for six months the
      water flows into the lake, and for six months out into the Nile again; and
      whenever it flows out, then for the six months it brings into the royal
      treasury a talent of silver a day from the fish which are caught, and
      twenty pounds <a href="#link2note-132" id="link2noteref-132" class="pginternal">132</a> when the water comes in.
    </p>
<p>
      150. The natives of the place moreover said that this lake had an outlet
      under ground to the Syrtis which is in Libya, turning towards the interior
      of the continent upon the Western side and running along by the mountain
      which is above Memphis. Now since I did not see anywhere existing the
      earth dug out of this excavation (for that was a matter which drew my
      attention), I asked those who dwelt nearest to the lake where the earth
      was which had been dug out. These told me to what place it had been
      carried away; and I readily believed them, for I knew by report that a
      similar thing had been done at Nineveh, the city of the Assyrians. There
      certain thieves formed a design once to carry away the wealth of
      Sardanapallos son of Ninos, the king, which wealth was very great and was
      kept in treasure-houses under the earth. Accordingly they began from their
      own dwelling, and making estimate of their direction they dug under ground
      towards the king's palace; and the earth which was brought out of the
      excavation they used to carry away, when night came on, to the river
      Tigris which flows by the city of Nineveh, until at last they accomplished
      that which they desired. Similarly, as I heard, the digging of the lake in
      Egypt was effected, except that it was done not by night but during the
      day; for as they dug the Egyptians carried to the Nile the earth which was
      dug out; and the river, when it received it, would naturally bear it away
      and disperse it. Thus is this lake said to have been dug out.
    </p>
<p>
      151. Now the twelve kings continued to rule justly, but in course of time
      it happened thus:—After sacrifice in the temple of Hephaistos they
      were about to make libation on the last day of the feast, and the
      chief-priest, in bringing out for them the golden cups with which they had
      been wont to pour libations, missed his reckoning and brought eleven only
      for the twelve kings. Then that one of them who was standing last in
      order, namely Psammetichos, since he had no cup took off from his head his
      helmet, which was of bronze, and having held it out to receive the wine he
      proceeded to make libation: likewise all the other kings were wont to wear
      helmets and they happened to have them then. Now Psammetichos held out his
      helmet with no treacherous meaning; but they taking note of that which had
      been done by Psammetichos and of the oracle, namely how it had been
      declared to them that whosoever of them should make libation with a bronze
      cup should be sole king of Egypt, recollecting, I say, the saying of the
      Oracle, they did not indeed deem it right to slay Psammetichos, since they
      found by examination that he had not done it with any forethought, but
      they determined to strip him of almost all his power and to drive him away
      into the fen-country, and that from the fen-country he should not hold any
      dealings with the rest of Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      152. This Psammetichos had formerly been a fugitive from the Ethiopian
      Sabacos who had killed his father Necos, from him, I say, he had then been
      a fugitive in Syria; and when the Ethiopian had departed in consequence of
      the vision of the dream, the Egyptians who were of the district of Saïs
      brought him back to his own country. Then afterwards, when he was king, it
      was his fate to be a fugitive a second time on account of the helmet,
      being driven by the eleven kings into the fen-country. So then holding
      that he had been grievously wronged by them, he thought how he might take
      vengeance on those who had driven him out: and when he had sent to the
      Oracle of Leto in the city of Buto, where the Egyptians have their most
      truthful Oracle, there was given to him the reply that vengeance would
      come when men of bronze appeared from the sea. And he was strongly
      disposed not to believe that bronze men would come to help him; but after
      no long time had passed, certain Ionians and Carians who had sailed forth
      for plunder were compelled to come to shore in Egypt, and they having
      landed and being clad in bronze armour, one of the Egyptians, not having
      before seen men clad in bronze armour, came to the fen-land and brought a
      report to Psammetichos that bronze men had come from the sea and were
      plundering the plain. So he, perceiving that the saying of the Oracle was
      coming to pass, dealt in a friendly manner with the Ionians and Carians,
      and with large promises he persuaded them to take his part. Then when he
      had persuaded them, with the help of those Egyptians who favoured his
      cause and of these foreign mercenaries he overthrew the kings.
    </p>
<p>
      153. Having thus got power over all Egypt, Psammetichos made for
      Hephaistos that gateway of the temple at Memphis which is turned towards
      the South Wind; and he built a court for Apis, in which Apis is kept when
      he appears, opposite to the gateway of the temple, surrounded all with
      pillars and covered with figures; and instead of columns there stand to
      support the roof of the court colossal statues twelve cubits high. Now
      Apis is in the tongue of the Hellenes Epaphos.
    </p>
<p>
      154. To the Ionians and to the Carians who had helped him Psammetichos
      granted portions of land to dwell in, opposite to one another with the
      river Nile between, and these were called "Encampments": <a href="#link2note-133" id="link2noteref-133" class="pginternal">133</a>
      these portions of land he gave them, and he paid them besides all that he
      had promised: moreover he placed with them Egyptian boys to have them
      taught the Hellenic tongue; and from these, who learnt the language
      thoroughly, are descended the present class of interpreters in Egypt. Now
      the Ionians and Carians occupied these portions of land for a long time,
      and they are towards the sea a little below the city of Bubastis, on that
      which is called the Pelusian mouth of the Nile. These men king Amasis
      afterwards removed from thence and established them at Memphis, making
      them into a guard for himself against the Egyptians: and they being
      settled in Egypt, we who are Hellenes know by intercourse with them the
      certainty of all that which happened in Egypt beginning from king
      Psammetichos and afterwards; for these were the first men of foreign
      tongue who settled in Egypt: and in the land from which they were removed
      there still remained down to my time the sheds where their ships were
      drawn up and the ruins of their houses.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus then Psammetichos obtained Egypt:
    </p>
<p>
      155, and of the Oracle which is in Egypt I have made mention often before
      this, and now I will give an account of it, seeing that it is worthy to be
      described. This Oracle which is in Egypt is sacred to Leto, and it is
      established in a great city near that mouth of the Nile which is called
      Sebennytic, as one sails up the river from the sea; and the name of this
      city where the Oracle is found is Buto, as I have said before in
      mentioning it. In this Buto there is a temple of Apollo and Artemis; and
      the temple-house <a href="#link2note-134" id="link2noteref-134" class="pginternal">134</a> of Leto, in which the Oracle is, is both
      great in itself and has a gateway of the height of ten fathoms: but that
      which caused me most to marvel of the things to be seen there, I will now
      tell. There is in this sacred enclosure a house of Leto made of one single
      stone as regards both height and length, and of which all the walls are in
      these two directions equal, each being forty cubits; and for the covering
      in of the roof there lies another stone upon the top, the cornice
      measuring four cubits. <a href="#link2note-135" id="link2noteref-135" class="pginternal">135</a>
</p>
<p>
      156. This house then of all the things that were to be seen by me in that
      temple is the most marvellous, and among those which come next is the
      island called Chemmis. This is situated in a deep and broad lake by the
      side of the temple at Buto, and it is said by the Egyptians that this
      island is a floating island. I myself did not see it either floating about
      or moved from its place, and I feel surprise at hearing of it, wondering
      if it be indeed a floating island. In this island of which I speak there
      is a great temple-house of Apollo, and three several altars are set up
      within, and there are planted in the island many palm-trees and other
      trees, both bearing fruit and not bearing fruit. And the Egyptians, when
      they say that it is floating, add this story, namely that in this island,
      which formerly was not floating, Leto, being one of the eight gods who
      came into existence first, and dwelling in the city of Buto where she has
      this Oracle, received Apollo from Isis as a charge and preserved him,
      concealing him in the island which is said now to be a floating island, at
      that time when Typhon came after him seeking everywhere and desiring to
      find the son of Osiris. Now they say that Apollo and Artemis are children
      of Dionysos and of Isis, and that Leto became their nurse and preserver;
      and in the Egyptian tongue Apollo is Oros, Demeter is Isis, and Artemis is
      Bubastis. From this story and from no other Æschylus the son of Euphorion
      took <a href="#link2note-136" id="link2noteref-136" class="pginternal">136</a>
      this which I shall say, wherein he differs from all the preceding poets;
      he represented namely that Artemis was the daughter of Demeter. For this
      reason then, they say, it became a floating island.
    </p>
<p>
      Such is the story which they tell;
    </p>
<p>
      157, but as for Psammetichos, he was king over Egypt for four-and-fifty
      years, of which for thirty years save one he was sitting before Azotos, a
      great city of Syria, besieging it, until at last he took it: and this
      Azotos of all cities about which we have knowledge held out for the
      longest time under a siege.
    </p>
<p>
      158. The son of Psammetichos was Necos, and he became king of Egypt. This
      man was the first who attempted the channel leading to the Erythraian Sea,
      which Dareios the Persian afterwards completed: the length of this is a
      voyage of four days, and in breadth it was so dug that two triremes could
      go side by side driven by oars; and the water is brought into it from the
      Nile. The channel is conducted a little above the city of Bubastis by
      Patumos the Arabian city, and runs into the Erythraian Sea: and it is dug
      first along those parts of the plain of Egypt which lie towards Arabia,
      just above which run the mountains which extend opposite Memphis, where
      are the stone-quarries,—along the base of these mountains the
      channel is conducted from West to East for a great way; and after that it
      is directed towards a break in the hills and tends from these mountains
      towards the noon-day and the South Wind to the Arabian gulf. Now in the
      place where the journey is least and shortest from the Northern to the
      Southern Sea (which is also called Erythraian), that is from Mount Casion,
      which is the boundary between Egypt and Syria, the distance is exactly <a href="#link2note-137" id="link2noteref-137" class="pginternal">137</a>
      a thousand furlongs to the Arabian gulf; but the channel is much longer,
      since it is more winding; and in the reign of Necos there perished while
      digging it twelve myriads <a href="#link2note-13701" id="link2noteref-13701" class="pginternal">13701</a> of the
      Egyptians. Now Necos ceased in the midst of his digging, because the
      utterance of an Oracle impeded him, which was to the effect that he was
      working for the Barbarian: and the Egyptians call all men Barbarians who
      do not agree with them in speech.
    </p>
<p>
      159. Thus having ceased from the work of the channel, Necos betook himself
      to waging wars, and triremes were built by him, some for the Northern Sea
      and others in the Arabian gulf for the Erythraian Sea; and of these the
      sheds are still to be seen. These ships he used when he needed them; and
      also on land Necos engaged battle at Magdolos with the Syrians, and
      conquered them; and after this he took Cadytis, which is a great city of
      Syria: and the dress which he wore when he made these conquests he
      dedicated to Apollo, sending it to Branchidai of the Milesians. After
      this, having reigned in all sixteen years, he brought his life to an end,
      and handed on the kingdom to Psammis his son.
    </p>
<p>
      160. While this Psammis was king of Egypt, there came to him men sent by
      the Eleians, who boasted that they ordered the contest at Olympia in the
      most just and honourable manner possible and thought that not even the
      Egyptians, the wisest of men, could find out anything besides, to be added
      to their rules. Now when the Eleians came to Egypt and said that for which
      they had come, then this king called together those of the Egyptians who
      were reputed the wisest, and when the Egyptians had come together they
      heard the Eleians tell of all that which it was their part to do in regard
      to the contest; and when they had related everything, they said that they
      had come to learn in addition anything which the Egyptians might be able
      to find out besides, which was juster than this. They then having
      consulted together asked the Eleians whether their own citizens took part
      in the contest; and they said that it was permitted to any one who desired
      it, both of their own people and of the other Hellenes equally, to take
      part in the contest: upon which the Egyptians said that in so ordering the
      games they had wholly missed the mark of justice; for it could not be but
      that they would take part with the man of their own State, if he was
      contending, and so act unfairly to the stranger: but if they really
      desired, as they said, to order the games justly, and if this was the
      cause for which they had come to Egypt, they advised them to order the
      contest so as to be for strangers alone to contend in, and that no Eleian
      should be permitted to contend. Such was the suggestion made by the
      Egyptians to the Eleians.
    </p>
<p>
      161. When Psammis had been king of Egypt for only six years and had made
      an expedition to Ethiopia and immediately afterwards had ended his life,
      Apries the son of Psammis received the kingdom in succession. This man
      came to be the most prosperous of all the kings up to that time except
      only his forefather Psammetichos; and he reigned five-and-twenty years,
      during which he led an army against Sidon and fought a sea-fight with the
      king of Tyre. Since however it was fated that evil should come upon him,
      it came by occasion of a matter which I shall relate at greater length in
      the Libyan history, <a href="#link2note-138" id="link2noteref-138" class="pginternal">138</a> and at present but shortly. Apries having
      sent a great expedition against the Kyrenians, met with correspondingly
      great disaster; and the Egyptians considering him to blame for this
      revolted from him, supposing that Apries had with forethought sent them
      out to evident calamity, in order (as they said) that there might be a
      slaughter of them, and he might the more securely rule over the other
      Egyptians. Being indignant at this, both these men who had returned from
      the expedition and also the friends of those who had perished made revolt
      openly.
    </p>
<p>
      162. Hearing this Apries sent to them Amasis, to cause them to cease by
      persuasion; and when he had come and was seeking to restrain the
      Egyptians, as he was speaking and telling them not to do so, one of the
      Egyptians stood up behind him and put a helmet <a href="#link2note-139" id="link2noteref-139" class="pginternal">139</a> upon his head,
      saying as he did so that he put it on to crown him king. And to him this
      that was done was in some degree not unwelcome, as he proved by his
      behaviour; for as soon as the revolted Egyptians had set him up as king,
      he prepared to march against Apries: and Apries hearing this sent to
      Amasis one of the Egyptians who were about his own person, a man of
      reputation, whose name was Patarbemis, enjoining him to bring Amasis alive
      into his presence. When this Patarbemis came and summoned Amasis, the
      latter, who happened to be sitting on horseback, lifted up his leg and
      behaved in an unseemly manner, <a href="#link2note-140" id="link2noteref-140" class="pginternal">140</a> bidding him take
      that back to Apries. Nevertheless, they say, Patarbemis made demand of him
      that he should go to the king, seeing that the king had sent to summon
      him; and he answered him that he had for some time past been preparing to
      do so, and that Apries would have no occasion to find fault with him. Then
      Patarbemis both perceiving his intention from that which he said, and also
      seeing his preparations, departed in haste, desiring to make known as
      quickly as possible to the king the things which were being done: and when
      he came back to Apries not bringing Amasis, the king paying no regard to
      that which he said, <a href="#link2note-141" id="link2noteref-141" class="pginternal">141</a> but being moved by violent anger, ordered
      his ears and his nose to be cut off. And the rest of the Egyptians who
      still remained on his side, when they saw the man of most repute among
      them thus suffering shameful outrage, waited no longer but joined the
      others in revolt, and delivered themselves over to Amasis.
    </p>
<p>
      163. Then Apries having heard this also, armed his foreign mercenaries and
      marched against the Egyptians: now he had about him Carian and Ionian
      mercenaries to the number of thirty thousand; and his royal palace was in
      the city of Saïs, of great size and worthy to be seen. So Apries and his
      army were going against the Egyptians, and Amasis and those with him were
      going against the mercenaries; and both sides came to the city of
      Momemphis and were about to make trial of one another in fight.
    </p>
<p>
      164. Now of the Egyptians there are seven classes, and of these one class
      is called that of the priests, and another that of the warriors, while the
      others are the cowherds, swineherds, shopkeepers, interpreters, and
      boatmen. This is the number of the classes of the Egyptians, and their
      names are given them from the occupations which they follow. Of them the
      warriors are called Calasirians and Hermotybians, and they are of the
      following districts, <a href="#link2note-142" id="link2noteref-142" class="pginternal">142</a>—for all Egypt is divided into
      districts.
    </p>
<p>
      165. The districts of the Hermotybians are those of Busiris, Saïs,
      Chemmis, Papremis, the island called Prosopitis, and the half of Natho,—of
      these districts are the Hermotybians, who reached when most numerous the
      number of sixteen myriads. <a href="#link2note-14201" id="link2noteref-14201" class="pginternal">14201</a> Of these not
      one has learnt anything of handicraft, but they are given up to war
      entirely.
    </p>
<p>
      166. Again the districts of the Calasirians are those of Thebes, Bubastis,
      Aphthis, Tanis, Mendes, Sebennytos, Athribis, Pharbaithos, Thmuïs Onuphis,
      Anytis, Myecphoris,—this last is on an island opposite to the city
      of Bubastis. These are the districts of the Calasirians; and they reached,
      when most numerous, to the number of five-and-twenty myriads <a href="#link2note-14202" id="link2noteref-14202" class="pginternal">14202</a>
      of men; nor is it lawful for these, any more than for the others, to
      practise any craft; but they practise that which has to do with war only,
      handing down the tradition from father to son.
    </p>
<p>
      167. Now whether the Hellenes have learnt this also from the Egyptians, I
      am not able to say for certain, since I see that the Thracians also and
      Scythians and Persians and Lydians and almost all the Barbarians esteem
      those of their citizens who learn the arts, and the descendants of them,
      as less honourable than the rest; while those who have got free from all
      practice of manual arts are accounted noble, and especially those who are
      devoted to war: however that may be, the Hellenes have all learnt this,
      and especially the Lacedemonians; but the Corinthians least of all cast
      slight upon those who practise handicrafts.
    </p>
<p>
      168. The following privilege was specially granted to this class and to
      none others of the Egyptians except the priests, that is to say, each man
      had twelve yokes <a href="#link2note-143" id="link2noteref-143" class="pginternal">143</a> of land specially granted to him free from
      imposts: now the yoke of land measures a hundred Egyptian cubits every
      way, and the Egyptian cubit is, as it happens, equal to that of Samos.
      This, I say, was a special privilege granted to all, and they also had
      certain advantages in turn and not the same men twice; that is to say, a
      thousand of the Calasirians and a thousand of the Hermotybians acted as
      body-guard to the king during each year; <a href="#link2note-144" id="link2noteref-144" class="pginternal">144</a> and these had
      besides their yokes of land an allowance given them for each day of five
      pounds weight <a href="#link2note-14401" id="link2noteref-14401" class="pginternal">14401</a> of bread to each man, and two pounds of
      beef, and four half-pints <a href="#link2note-145" id="link2noteref-145" class="pginternal">145</a> of wine. This was the allowance given to
      those who were serving as the king's bodyguard for the time being.
    </p>
<p>
      169. So when Apries leading his foreign mercenaries, and Amasis at the
      head of the whole body of the Egyptians, in their approach to one another
      had come to the city of Momemphis, they engaged battle: and although the
      foreign troops fought well, yet being much inferior in number they were
      worsted by reason of this. But Apries is said to have supposed that not
      even a god would be able to cause him to cease from his rule, so firmly
      did he think that it was established. In that battle then, I say, he was
      worsted, and being taken alive was brought away to the city of Saïs, to
      that which had formerly been his own dwelling but from thenceforth was the
      palace of Amasis. There for some time he was kept in the palace, and
      Amasis dealt well with him; but at last, since the Egyptians blamed him,
      saying that he acted not rightly in keeping alive him who was the greatest
      foe both to themselves and to him, therefore he delivered Apries over to
      the Egyptians; and they strangled him, and after that buried him in the
      burial-place of his fathers: this is in the temple of Athene, close to the
      sanctuary, on the left hand as you enter. Now the men of Saïs buried all
      those of this district who had been kings, within the temple; for the tomb
      of Amasis also, though it is further from the sanctuary than that of
      Apries and his forefathers, yet this too is within the court of the
      temple, and it consists of a colonnade of stone of great size, with
      pillars carved to imitate date-palms, and otherwise sumptuously adorned;
      and within the colonnade are double-doors, and inside the doors a
      sepulchral chamber.
    </p>
<p>
      170. Also at Saïs there is the burial-place of him whom I account it not
      pious to name in connexion with such a matter, which is in the temple of
      Athene behind the house of the goddess, <a href="#link2note-146" id="link2noteref-146" class="pginternal">146</a> stretching along the
      whole wall of it; and in the sacred enclosure stand great obelisks of
      stone, and near them is a lake adorned with an edging of stone and fairly
      made in a circle, being in size, as it seemed to me, equal to that which
      is called the "Round Pool" <a href="#link2note-147" id="link2noteref-147" class="pginternal">147</a> in Delos.
    </p>
<p>
      171. On this lake they perform by night the show of his sufferings, and
      this the Egyptians call Mysteries. Of these things I know more fully in
      detail how they take place, but I shall leave this unspoken; and of the
      mystic rites of Demeter, which the Hellenes call <i>thesmophoria</i>, of
      these also, although I know, I shall leave unspoken all except so much as
      piety permits me to tell. The daughters of Danaos were they who brought
      this rite out of Egypt and taught it to the women of the Pelasgians; then
      afterwards when all the inhabitants of Peloponnese were driven out by the
      Dorians, the rite was lost, and only those who were left behind of the
      Peloponnesians and not driven out, that is to say the Arcadians, preserved
      it.
    </p>
<p>
      172. Apries having thus been overthrown, Amasis became king, being of the
      district of Saïs, and the name of the city whence he was is Siuph. Now at
      the first the Egyptians despised Amasis and held him in no great regard,
      because he had been a man of the people and was of no distinguished
      family; but afterwards Amasis won them over to himself by wisdom and not
      wilfulness. Among innumerable other things of price which he had, there
      was a foot-basin of gold in which both Amasis himself and all his guests
      were wont always to wash their feet. This he broke up, and of it he caused
      to be made the image of a god, and set it up in the city, where it was
      most convenient; and the Egyptians went continually to visit the image and
      did great reverence to it. Then Amasis, having learnt that which was done
      by the men of the city, called together the Egyptians and made known to
      them the matter, saying that the image had been produced from the
      foot-basin, into which formerly the Egyptians used to vomit and make
      water, and in which they washed their feet, whereas now they did to it
      great reverence; and just so, he continued, had he himself now fared, as
      the foot-basin; for though formerly he was a man of the people, yet now he
      was their king, and he bade them accordingly honour him and have regard
      for him.
    </p>
<p>
      173. In such manner he won the Egyptians to himself, so that they
      consented to be his subjects; and his ordering of affairs was thus:—In
      the early morning, and until the time of the filling of the market he did
      with a good will the business which was brought before him; but after this
      he passed the time in drinking and in jesting at his boon-companions, and
      was frivolous and playful. And his friends being troubled at it admonished
      him in some such words as these: "O king, thou dost not rightly govern
      thyself in thus letting thyself descend to behaviour so trifling; for thou
      oughtest rather to have been sitting throughout the day stately upon a
      stately throne and administering thy business; and so the Egyptians would
      have been assured that they were ruled by a great man, and thou wouldest
      have had a better report: but as it is, thou art acting by no means in a
      kingly fashion." And he answered them thus: "They who have bows stretch
      them at such time as they wish to use them, and when they have finished
      using them they loose them again; <a href="#link2note-148" id="link2noteref-148" class="pginternal">148</a> for if they were
      stretched tight always they would break, so that the men would not be able
      to use them when they needed them. So also is the state of man: if he
      should always be in earnest and not relax himself for sport at the due
      time, he would either go mad or be struck with stupor before he was aware;
      and knowing this well, I distribute a portion of the time to each of the
      two ways of living." Thus he replied to his friends.
    </p>
<p>
      174. It is said however that Amasis, even when he was in a private
      station, was a lover of drinking and of jesting, and not at all seriously
      disposed; and whenever his means of livelihood failed him through his
      drinking and luxurious living, he would go about and steal; and they from
      whom he stole would charge him with having their property, and when he
      denied it would bring him before the judgment of an Oracle, whenever there
      was one in their place; and many times he was convicted by the Oracles and
      many times he was absolved: and then when finally he became king he did as
      follows:—as many of the gods as had absolved him and pronounced him
      not to be a thief, to their temples he paid no regard, nor gave anything
      for the further adornment of them, nor even visited them to offer
      sacrifice, considering them to be worth nothing and to possess lying
      Oracles; but as many as had convicted him of being a thief, to these he
      paid very great regard, considering them to be truly gods, and to present
      Oracles which did not lie.
    </p>
<p>
      175. First in Saïs he built and completed for Athene a temple-gateway
      which is a great marvel, and he far surpassed herein all who had done the
      like before, both in regard to height and greatness, so large are the
      stones and of such quality. Then secondly he dedicated great colossal
      statues and man-headed sphinxes very large, and for restoration he brought
      other stones of monstrous size. Some of these he caused to be brought from
      the stone-quarries which are opposite Memphis, others of very great size
      from the city of Elephantine, distant a voyage of not less than twenty
      days from Saïs: and of them all I marvel most at this, namely a monolith
      chamber which he brought from the city of Elephantine; and they were three
      years engaged in bringing this, and two thousand men were appointed to
      convey it, who all were of the class of boatmen. Of this house the length
      outside is one-and-twenty cubits, the breadth is fourteen cubits, and the
      height eight. These are the measures of the monolith house outside; but
      the length inside is eighteen cubits and five-sixths of a cubit, <a href="#link2note-149" id="link2noteref-149" class="pginternal">149</a>
      the breadth twelve cubits, and the height five cubits. This lies by the
      side of the entrance to the temple; for within the temple they did not
      draw it, because, as it said, while the house was being drawn along, the
      chief artificer of it groaned aloud, seeing that much time had been spent
      and he was wearied by the work; and Amasis took it to heart as a warning
      and did not allow them to draw it further onwards. Some say on the other
      hand that a man was killed by it, of those who were heaving it with
      levers, and that it was not drawn in for that reason.
    </p>
<p>
      176. Amasis also dedicated in all the other temples which were of repute,
      works which are worth seeing for their size, and among them also at
      Memphis the colossal statue which lies on its back in front of the temple
      of Hephaistos, whose length is five-and-seventy feet; and on the same base
      made of the same stone <a href="#link2note-150" id="link2noteref-150" class="pginternal">150</a> are set two colossal statues, each of twenty
      feet in length, one on this side and the other on that side of the large
      statue. <a href="#link2note-151" id="link2noteref-151" class="pginternal">151</a> There is also another of stone of the same
      size in Saïs, lying in the same manner as that at Memphis. Moreover Amasis
      was he who built and finished for Isis her temple at Memphis, which is of
      great size and very worthy to be seen.
    </p>
<p>
      177. In the reign of Amasis it is said that Egypt became more prosperous
      than at any other time before, both in regard to that which comes to the
      land from the river and in regard to that which comes from the land to its
      inhabitants, and that at this time the inhabited towns in it numbered in
      all twenty thousand. It was Amasis too who established the law that every
      year each one of the Egyptians should declare to the ruler of his
      district, from what source he got his livelihood, and if any man did not
      do this or did not make declaration of an honest way of living, he should
      be punished with death. Now Solon the Athenian received from Egypt this
      law and had it enacted for the Athenians, and they have continued to
      observe it, since it is a law with which none can find fault.
    </p>
<p>
      178. Moreover Amasis became a lover of the Hellenes; and besides other
      proofs of friendship which he gave to several among them, he also granted
      the city of Naucratis for those of them who came to Egypt to dwell in; and
      to those who did not desire to stay, but who made voyages thither, he
      granted portions of land to set up altars and make sacred enclosures for
      their gods. Their greatest enclosure and that one which has most name and
      is most frequented is called the Hellenion, and this was established by
      the following cities in common:—of the Ionians Chios, Teos, Phocaia,
      Clazomenai, of the Dorians Rhodes, Cnidos, Halicarnassos, Phaselis, and of
      the Aiolians Mytilene alone. To these belongs this enclosure and these are
      the cities which appoint superintendents of the port; and all other cities
      which claim a share in it, are making a claim without any right. <a href="#link2note-152" id="link2noteref-152" class="pginternal">152</a>
      Besides this the Eginetans established on their own account a sacred
      enclosure dedicated to Zeus, the Samians one to Hera, and the Milesians
      one to Apollo.
    </p>
<p>
      179. Now in old times Naucratis alone was an open trading-place, and no
      other place in Egypt: and if any one came to any other of the Nile mouths,
      he was compelled to swear that he came not thither of his own will, and
      when he had thus sworn his innocence he had to sail with his ship to the
      Canobic mouth, or if it were not possible to sail by reason of contrary
      winds, then he had to carry his cargo round the head of the Delta in boats
      to Naucratis: thus highly was Naucratis privileged.
    </p>
<p>
      180. Moreover when the Amphictyons had let out the contract for building
      the temple which now exists at Delphi, agreeing to pay a sum of three
      hundred talents, (for the temple which formerly stood there had been burnt
      down of itself), it fell to the share of the people of Delphi to provide
      the fourth part of the payment; and accordingly the Delphians went about
      to various cities and collected contributions. And when they did this they
      got from Egypt as much as from any place, for Amasis gave them a thousand
      talents' weight of alum, while the Hellenes who dwelt in Egypt gave them
      twenty pounds of silver. <a href="#link2note-153" id="link2noteref-153" class="pginternal">153</a>
</p>
<p>
      181. Also with the people of Kyrene Amasis made an agreement for
      friendship and alliance; and he resolved too to marry a wife from thence,
      whether because he desired to have a wife of Hellenic race, or apart from
      that, on account of friendship for the people of Kyrene: however that may
      be, he married, some say the daughter of Battos, others of Arkesilaos, <a href="#link2note-154" id="link2noteref-154" class="pginternal">154</a>
      and others of Critobulos, a man of repute among the citizens; and her name
      was Ladike. Now whenever Amasis lay with her he found himself unable to
      have intercourse, but with his other wives he associated as he was wont;
      and as this happened repeatedly, Amasis said to his wife, whose name was
      Ladike: "Woman, thou hast given me drugs, and thou shalt surely perish <a href="#link2note-155" id="link2noteref-155" class="pginternal">155</a>
      more miserably than any other woman." Then Ladike, when by her denials
      Amasis was not at all appeased in his anger against her, made a vow in her
      soul to Aphrodite, that if Amasis on that night had intercourse with her
      (seeing that this was the remedy for her danger), she would send an image
      to be dedicated to her at Kyrene; and after the vow immediately Amasis had
      intercourse, and from thenceforth whenever Amasis came in to her he had
      intercourse with her; and after this he became very greatly attached to
      her. And Ladike paid the vow that she had made to the goddess; for she had
      an image made and sent it to Kyrene, and it was still preserved even to my
      own time, standing with its face turned away from the city of the
      Kyrenians. This Ladike Cambyses, having conquered Egypt and heard from her
      who she was, sent back unharmed to Kyrene.
    </p>
<p>
      182. Amasis also dedicated offerings in Hellas, first at Kyrene an image
      of Athene covered over with gold and a figure of himself made like by
      painting; then in the temple of Athene at Lindson two images of stone and
      a corslet of linen worthy to be seen; and also at Samos two wooden figures
      of himself dedicated to Hera, which were standing even to my own time in
      the great temple, behind the doors. Now at Samos he dedicated offerings
      because of the guest-friendship between himself and Polycrates the son of
      Aiakes; at Lindos for no guest-friendship but because the temple of Athene
      at Lindos is said to have been founded by the daughters of Danaos, who had
      touched land there at the time when they were fleeing from the sons of
      Aigyptos. These offerings were dedicated by Amasis; and he was the first
      of men who conquered Cyprus and subdued it so that it paid him tribute.

      altogether; and either they must add the Delta as a fourth part of the
      world, or they must give up the Nile as a boundary. If the name Egypt be
      extended, as it is by the other Hellenes, to the upper course of the Nile,
      it is then possible to retain the Nile as a boundary, saying that half of
      Egypt belongs to Asia and half to Libya, and disregarding the Delta (ch.
      17). This also would be an error of reckoning, but less serious than to
      omit Egypt together." The reasoning is obscure because it alludes to
      theories (of Hecataios and other writers) which are presumed to be already
      known to the reader.]

<h2>
      BOOK III. THE THIRD BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED THALEIA
    </h2>
<p>
      1. Against this Amasis then Cambyses the son of Cyrus was making his
      march, taking with him not only other nations of which he was ruler, but
      also Hellenes, both Ionians and Aiolians: <a href="#link32Hnote-1" id="link32noteref-1" class="pginternal">1</a> and the cause of the
      expedition was as follows:—Cambyses sent an envoy to Egypt and asked
      Amasis to give him his daughter; and he made the request by counsel of an
      Egyptian, who brought this upon Amasis <a href="#link32Hnote-2" id="link32noteref-2" class="pginternal">2</a> having a quarrel with
      him for the following reason:—at the time when Cyrus sent to Amasis
      and asked him for a physician of the eyes, whosoever was the best of those
      in Egypt, Amasis had selected him from all the physicians in Egypt and had
      torn him away from his wife and children and delivered him up to Persia.
      Having, I say, this cause of quarrel, the Egyptian urged Cambyses on by
      his counsel bidding him ask Amasis for his daughter, in order that he
      might either be grieved if he gave her, or if he refused to give her,
      might offend Cambyses. So Amasis, who was vexed by the power of the
      Persians and afraid of it, knew neither how to give nor how to refuse: for
      he was well assured that Cambyses did not intend to have her as his wife
      but as a concubine. So making account of the matter thus, he did as
      follows:—there was a daughter of Apries the former king, very tall
      and comely of form and the only person left of his house, and her name was
      Nitetis. This girl Amasis adorned with raiment and with gold, and sent her
      away to Persia as his own daughter: but after a time, when Cambyses
      saluted her calling her by the name of her father, the girl said to him:
      "O king, thou dost not perceive how thou hast been deceived by Amasis; for
      he adorned me with ornaments and sent me away giving me to thee as his own
      daughter, whereas in truth I am the daughter of Apries against whom Amasis
      rose up with the Egyptians and murdered him, who was his lord and master."
      These words uttered and this occasion having arisen, led Cambyses the son
      of Cyrus against Egypt, moved to very great anger.
    </p>
<p>
      2. Such is the report made by the Persians; but as for the Egyptians they
      claim Cambyses as one of themselves, saying that he was born of this very
      daughter of Apries; for they say that Cyrus was he who sent to Amasis for
      his daughter, and not Cambyses. In saying this however they say not
      rightly; nor can they have failed to observe (for the Egyptians fully as
      well as any other people are acquainted with the laws and customs of the
      Persians), first that it is not customary among them for a bastard to
      become king, when there is a son born of a true marriage, and secondly
      that Cambyses was the son of Cassandane the daughter of Pharnaspes, a man
      of the Achaimenid family, and not the son of the Egyptian woman: but they
      pervert the truth of history, claiming to be kindred with the house of
      Cyrus. Thus it is with these matters;
    </p>
<p>
      3, and the following story is also told, which for my part I do not
      believe, namely that one of the Persian women came in to the wives of
      Cyrus, and when she saw standing by the side of Cassandane children comely
      of form and tall, she was loud in her praises of them, expressing great
      admiration; and Cassandane, who was the wife of Cyrus, spoke as follows:
      "Nevertheless, though I am the mother of such children of these, Cyrus
      treats me with dishonour and holds in honour her whom he has brought in
      from Egypt." Thus she spoke, they say, being vexed by Nitetis, and upon
      that Cambyses the elder of her sons said: "For this cause, mother, when I
      am grown to be a man, I will make that which is above in Egypt to be
      below, and that which is below above." This he is reported to have said
      when he was perhaps about ten years old, and the women were astonished by
      it: and he, they say, kept it ever in mind, and so at last when he had
      become a man and had obtained the royal power, he made the expedition
      against Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      4. Another thing also contributed to this expedition, which was as
      follows:—There was among the foreign mercenaries <a href="#link32Hnote-3" id="link32noteref-3" class="pginternal">3</a> of
      Amasis a man who was by race of Halicarnassos, and his name was Phanes,
      one who was both capable in judgment and valiant in that which pertained
      to war. This Phanes, having (as we may suppose) some quarrel with Amasis,
      fled away from Egypt in a ship, desiring to come to speech with Cambyses:
      and as he was of no small repute among the mercenaries and was very
      closely acquainted with all the affairs of Egypt, Amasis pursued him and
      considered it a matter of some moment to capture him: and he pursued by
      sending after him the most trusted of his eunuchs with a trireme, who
      captured him in Lykia; but having captured him he did not bring him back
      to Egypt, since Phanes got the better of him by cunning; for he made his
      guards drunk and escaped to Persia. So when Cambyses had made his resolve
      to march upon Egypt, and was in difficulty about the march, as to how he
      should get safely through the waterless region, this man came to him and
      besides informing of the other matters of Amasis, he instructed him also
      as to the march, advising him to send to the king of the Arabians and ask
      that he would give him safety of passage through this region.
    </p>
<p>
      5. Now by this way only is there a known entrance to Egypt: for from
      Phenicia to the borders of the city of Cadytis belongs to the Syrians <a href="#link32Hnote-4" id="link32noteref-4" class="pginternal">4</a>
      who are called of Palestine, and from Cadytis, which is a city I suppose
      not much less than Sardis, from this city the trading stations on the
      sea-coast as far as the city of Ienysos belong to the king of Arabia, and
      then from Ienysos again the country belongs to the Syrians as far as the
      Serbonian lake, along the side of which Mount Casion extends towards the
      Sea. After that, from the Serbonian lake, in which the story goes that
      Typhon is concealed, from this point onwards the land is Egypt. Now the
      region which lies between the city of Ienysos on the one hand and Mount
      Casion and the Serbonian lake on the other, which is of no small extent
      but as much as a three days' journey, is grievously destitute of water.
    </p>
<p>
      6. And one thing I shall tell of, which few of those who go in ships to
      Egypt have observed, and it is this:—into Egypt from all parts of
      Hellas and also from Phenicia are brought twice every year earthenware
      jars full of wine, and yet it may almost be said that you cannot see there
      one single empty <a href="#link32Hnote-5" id="link32noteref-5" class="pginternal">5</a> wine-jar.
    </p>
<p>
      7. In what manner, then, it will be asked, are they used up? This also I
      will tell. The head-man <a href="#link32Hnote-6" id="link32noteref-6" class="pginternal">6</a> of each place must collect all the earthenware
      jars from his own town and convey them to Memphis, and those at Memphis
      must fill them with water and convey them to these same waterless regions
      of Syria: this the jars which come regularly to Egypt and are emptied <a href="#link32Hnote-7" id="link32noteref-7" class="pginternal">7</a>
      there, are carried to Syria to be added to that which has come before. It
      was the Persians who thus prepared this approach to Egypt, furnishing it
      with water in the manner which has been said, from the time when they
      first took possession of Egypt: but at the time of which I speak, seeing
      that water was not yet provided, Cambyses, in accordance with what he was
      told by his Halicarnassian guest, sent envoys to the Arabian king and from
      him asked and obtained the safe passage, having given him pledges of
      friendship and received them from him in return.
    </p>
<p>
      8. Now the Arabians have respect for pledges of friendship as much as
      those men in all the world who regard them most; and they give them in the
      following manner:—A man different from those who desire to give the
      pledges to one another, standing in the midst between the two, cuts with a
      sharp stone the inner parts of the hands, along by the thumbs, of those
      who are giving the pledges to one another, and then he takes a thread from
      the cloak of each one and smears with the blood seven stones laid in the
      midst between them; and as he does this he calls upon Dionysos and Urania.
      When the man has completed these ceremonies, he who has given the pledges
      commends to the care of his friends the stranger (or the fellow-tribesman,
      if he is giving the pledges to one who is a member of his tribe), and the
      friends think it right that they also should have regard for the pledges
      given. Of gods they believe in Dionysos and Urania alone: moreover they
      say that the cutting of their hair is done after the same fashion as that
      of Dionysos himself; and they cut their hair in a circle round, shaving
      away the hair of the temples. Now they call Dionysos Orotalt <a href="#link32Hnote-8" id="link32noteref-8" class="pginternal">8</a>
      and Urania they call Alilat.
    </p>
<p>
      9. So then when the Arabian king had given the pledge of friendship to the
      men who had come to him from Cambyses, he contrived as follows:—he
      took skins of camels and filled them with water and loaded them upon the
      backs of all the living camels that he had; and having so done he drove
      them to the waterless region and there awaited the army of Cambyses. This
      which has been related is the more credible of the accounts given, but the
      less credible must also be related, since it is a current account. There
      is a great river in Arabia called Corys, and this runs out into the Sea
      which is called Erythraian. From this river then it is said that the king
      of the Arabians, having got a conduit pipe made by sewing together raw
      ox-hides and other skins, of such a length as to reach to the waterless
      region, conducted the water through these forsooth, <a href="#link32Hnote-9" id="link32noteref-9" class="pginternal">9</a>
      and had great cisterns dug in the waterless region, that they might
      receive the water and preserve it. Now it is a journey of twelve days from
      the river to this waterless region; and moreover the story says that he
      conducted the water by three <a href="#link32Hnote-10" id="link32noteref-10" class="pginternal">10</a> conduit-pipes to
      three different parts of it.
    </p>
<p>
      10. Meanwhile Psammenitos the son of Amasis was encamped at the Pelusian
      mouth of the Nile waiting for the coming of Cambyses: for Cambyses did not
      find Amasis yet living when he marched upon Egypt, but Amasis had died
      after having reigned forty and four years during which no great misfortune
      had befallen him: and when he had died and had been embalmed he was buried
      in the burial-place in the temple, which he had built for himself. <a href="#link32Hnote-11" id="link32noteref-11" class="pginternal">11</a>
      Now when Psammenitos son of Amasis was reigning as king, there happened to
      the Egyptians a prodigy, the greatest that had ever happened: for rain
      fell at Thebes in Egypt, where never before had rain fallen nor afterwards
      down to my time, as the Thebans themselves say; for in the upper parts of
      Egypt no rain falls at all: but at the time of which I speak rain fell at
      Thebes in a drizzling shower. <a href="#link32Hnote-12" id="link32noteref-12" class="pginternal">12</a>
</p>
<p>
      11. Now when the Persians had marched quite through the waterless region
      and were encamped near the Egyptians with design to engage battle, then
      the foreign mercenaries of the Egyptian king, who were Hellenes and
      Carians, having a quarrel with Phanes because he had brought against Egypt
      an army of foreign speech, contrived against him as follows:—Phanes
      had children whom he had left behind in Egypt: these they brought to their
      camp and into the sight of their father, and they set up a mixing-bowl
      between the two camps, and after that they brought up the children one by
      one and cut their throats so that the blood ran into the bowl. Then when
      they had gone through the whole number of the children, they brought and
      poured into the bowl both wine and water, and not until the mercenaries
      had all drunk of the blood, did they engage battle. Then after a battle
      had been fought with great stubbornness, and very many had fallen of both
      the armies, the Egyptians at length turned to flight.
    </p>
<p>
      12. I was witness moreover of a great marvel, being informed of it by the
      natives of the place; for of the bones scattered about of those who fell
      in this fight, each side separately, since the bones of the Persians were
      lying apart on one side according as they were divided at first, and those
      of the Egyptians on the other, the skulls of the Persians are so weak that
      if you shall hit them only with a pebble you will make a hole in them,
      while those of the Egyptians are so exceedingly strong that you would
      hardly break them if you struck them with a large stone. The cause of it,
      they say, was this, and I for my part readily believe them, namely that
      the Egyptians beginning from their early childhood shave their heads, and
      the bone is thickened by exposure to the sun: and this is also the cause
      of their not becoming bald-headed; for among the Egyptians you see fewer
      bald-headed men than among any other race. This then is the reason why
      these have their skulls strong; and the reason why the Persians have
      theirs weak is that they keep them delicately in the shade from the first
      by wearing <i>tiaras</i>, that is felt caps. So far of this: and I saw
      also a similar thing to this at Papremis, in the case of those who were
      slain together with Achaimenes the son of Dareios, by Inaros the Libyan.
    </p>
<p>
      13. The Egyptians when they turned to flight from the battle fled in
      disorder: and they being shut up in Memphis, Cambyses sent a ship of
      Mytilene up the river bearing a Persian herald, to summon the Egyptians to
      make terms of surrender; but they, when they saw the ship had entered into
      Memphis, pouring forth in a body from the fortress <a href="#link32Hnote-13" id="link32noteref-13" class="pginternal">13</a>
      both destroyed the ship and also tore the men in it limb from limb, and so
      bore them into the fortress. After this the Egyptians being besieged, in
      course of time surrendered themselves; and the Libyans who dwell on the
      borders of Egypt, being struck with terror by that which had happened to
      Egypt, delivered themselves up without resistance, and they both laid on
      themselves a tribute and sent presents: likewise also those of Kyrene and
      Barca, being struck with terror equally with <a href="#link32Hnote-14" id="link32noteref-14" class="pginternal">14</a> the Libyans, acted in
      a similar manner: and Cambyses accepted graciously the gifts which came
      from the Libyans, but as for those which came from the men of Kyrene,
      finding fault with them, as I suppose, because they were too small in
      amount (for the Kyrenians sent in fact five hundred pounds' weight <a href="#link32Hnote-15" id="link32noteref-15" class="pginternal">15</a>
      of silver), he took the silver by handfuls and scattered it with his own
      hand among his soldiers.
    </p>
<p>
      14. On the tenth day after that on which he received the surrender of the
      fortress of Memphis, Cambyses set the king of the Egyptians Psammenitos,
      who had been king for six months, to sit in the suburb of the city, to do
      him dishonour,—him I say with other Egyptians he set there, and he
      proceeded to make trial of his spirit as follows:—having arrayed his
      daughter in the clothing of a slave, he sent her forth with a pitcher to
      fetch water, and with her he sent also other maidens chosen from the
      daughters of the chief men, arrayed as was the daughter of the king: and
      as the maidens were passing by their fathers with cries and lamentation,
      the other men all began to cry out and lament aloud, <a href="#link32Hnote-16" id="link32noteref-16" class="pginternal">16</a>
      seeing that their children had been evilly entreated, but Psammenitos when
      he saw it before his eyes and perceived it bent himself down to the earth.
      Then when the water-bearers had passed by, next Cambyses sent his son with
      two thousand Egyptians besides who were of the same age, with ropes bound
      round their necks and bits placed in their mouths; and these were being
      led away to execution to avenge the death of the Mytilenians who had been
      destroyed at Memphis with their ship: for the Royal Judges <a href="#link32Hnote-17" id="link32noteref-17" class="pginternal">17</a>
      had decided that for each man ten of the noblest Egyptians should lose
      their lives in retaliation. He then, when he saw them passing out by him
      and perceived that his son was leading the way <a href="#link32Hnote-18" id="link32noteref-18" class="pginternal">18</a> to die, did the same
      as he had done with respect to his daughter, while the other Egyptians who
      sat round him were lamenting and showing signs of grief. When these also
      had passed by, it chanced that a man of his table companions, advanced in
      years, who had been deprived of all his possessions and had nothing except
      such things as a beggar possesses, and was asking alms from the soldiers,
      passed by Psammenitos the son of Amasis and the Egyptians who were sitting
      in the suburb of the city: and when Psammenitos saw him he uttered a great
      cry of lamentation, and he called his companion by name and beat himself
      upon the head. Now there was, it seems, men set to watch him, who made
      known to Cambyses all that he did on the occasion of each going forth: and
      Cambyses marvelled at that which he did, and he sent a messenger and asked
      him thus: "Psammenitos, thy master Cambyses asks thee for what reason,
      when thou sawest thy daughter evilly entreated and thy son going to death,
      thou didst not cry aloud nor lament for them, whereas thou didst honour
      with these signs of grief the beggar who, as he hears from others, is not
      in any way related to thee?" Thus he asked, and the other answered as
      follows: "O son of Cyrus, my own troubles were too great for me to lament
      them aloud, but the trouble of my companion was such as called for tears,
      seeing that he has been deprived of great wealth, and has come to beggary
      upon the threshold of old age." When this saying was reported by the
      messenger, it seemed to them <a href="#link32Hnote-19" id="link32noteref-19" class="pginternal">19</a> that it was well
      spoken; and, as is reported by the Egyptians, Croesus shed tears (for he
      also, as fortune would have it, had accompanied Cambyses to Egypt) and the
      Persians who were present shed tears also; and there entered some pity
      into Cambyses himself, and forthwith he bade them save the life of the son
      of Psammenitos from among those who were being put to death, and also he
      bade them raise Psammenitos himself from his place in the suburb of the
      city and bring him into his own presence.
    </p>
<p>
      15. As for the son, those who went for him found that he was no longer
      alive, but had been cut down first of all, but Psammenitos himself they
      raised from his place and brought him into the presence of Cambyses, with
      whom he continued to live for the rest of his time without suffering any
      violence; and if he had known how to keep himself from meddling with
      mischief, he would have received Egypt so as to be ruler of it, since the
      Persians are wont to honour the sons of kings, and even if the kings have
      revolted from them, they give back the power into the hands of their sons.
      Of this, namely that it is their established rule to act so, one may judge
      by many instances besides and especially <a href="#link32Hnote-20" id="link32noteref-20" class="pginternal">20</a> by the case of
      Thannyras the son of Inaros, who received back the power which his father
      had, and by that of Pausiris the son of Amyrtaios, for he too received
      back the power of his father: yet it is certain that no men ever up to
      this time did more evil to the Persians than Inaros and Amyrtaios. As it
      was, however, Psammenitos devised evil and received the due reward: for he
      was found to be inciting the Egyptians to revolt; and when this became
      known to Cambyses, Psammenitos drank bull's blood and died forthwith. Thus
      he came to his end.
    </p>
<p>
      16. From Memphis Cambyses came to the city of Saïs with the purpose of
      doing that which in fact he did: for when he had entered into the palace
      of Amasis, he forthwith gave command to bring the corpse of Amasis forth
      out of his burial-place; and when this had been accomplished, he gave
      command to scourge it and pluck out the hair and stab it, and to do to it
      dishonour in every possible way besides: and when they had done this too
      until they were wearied out, for the corpse being embalmed held out
      against the violence and did not fall to pieces in any part, Cambyses gave
      command to consume it with fire, enjoining thereby a thing which was not
      permitted by religion: for the Persians hold fire to be a god. To consume
      corpses with fire then is by no means according to the custom of either
      people, of the Persians for the reason which has been mentioned, since
      they say that it is not right to give the dead body of a man to a god;
      while the Egyptians have the belief established that fire is a living wild
      beast, and that it devours everything which it catches, and when it is
      satiated with the food it dies itself together with that which it devours:
      but it is by no means their custom to give the corpse of a man to wild
      beasts, for which reason they embalm it, that it may not be eaten by worms
      as it lies in the tomb. Thus then Cambyses was enjoining them to do that
      which is not permitted by the customs of either people. However, the
      Egyptians say that it was not Amasis who suffered this outrage, but
      another of the Egyptians who was of the same stature of body as Amasis;
      and that to him the Persians did outrage, thinking that they were doing it
      to Amasis: for they say that Amasis learnt from an Oracle that which was
      about to happen with regard to himself after his death; and accordingly,
      to avert the evil which threatened to come upon him, he buried the dead
      body of this man who was scourged within his own sepulchral chamber near
      the doors, and enjoined his son to lay his own body as much as possible in
      the inner recess of the chamber. These injunctions, said to have been
      given by Amasis with regard to his burial and with regard to the man
      mentioned, were not in my opinion really given at all, but I think that
      the Egyptians make pretence of it from pride and with no good ground.
    </p>
<p>
      17. After this Cambyses planned three several expeditions, one against the
      Carthaginians, another against the Ammonians, and a third against the
      "Long-lived" Ethiopians, who dwell in that part of Libya which is by the
      Southern Sea: and in forming these designs he resolved to send his naval
      force against the Carthaginians, and a body chosen from his land-army
      against the Ammonians; and to the Ethiopians to send spies first, both to
      see whether the table of the Sun existed really, which is said to exist
      among these Ethiopians, and in addition to this to spy out all else, but
      pretending to be bearers of gifts for their king.
    </p>
<p>
      18. Now the table of the Sun is said to be as follows:—there is a
      meadow in the suburb of their city full of flesh-meat boiled of all
      four-footed creatures; and in this, it is said, those of the citizens who
      are in authority at the time place the flesh by night, managing the matter
      carefully, and by day any man who wishes comes there and feasts himself;
      and the natives (it is reported) say that the earth of herself produces
      these things continually.
    </p>
<p>
      19. Of such nature is the so-called table of the Sun said to be. So when
      Cambyses had resolved to send the spies, forthwith he sent for those men
      of the Ichthyophagoi who understood the Ethiopian tongue, to come from the
      city of Elephantine: and while they were going to fetch these men, he gave
      command to the fleet to sail against Carthage: but the Phenicians said
      that they would not do so, for they were bound not to do so by solemn
      vows, and they would not be acting piously if they made expedition against
      their own sons: and as the Phenicians were not willing, the rest were
      rendered unequal to the attempt. Thus then the Carthaginians escaped being
      enslaved by the Persians; for Cambyses did not think it right to apply
      force to compel the Phenicians, both because they had delivered themselves
      over to the Persians of their own accord and because the whole naval force
      was dependent upon the Phenicians. Now the men of Cyprus also had
      delivered themselves over to the Persians, and were joining in the
      expedition against Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      20. Then as soon as the Ichthyophagoi came to Cambyses from Elephantine,
      he sent them to the Ethiopians, enjoining them what they should say and
      giving them gifts to bear with them, that is to say a purple garment, and
      a collar of twisted gold with bracelets, and an alabaster box of perfumed
      ointment, and a jar of palm-wine. Now these Ethiopians to whom Cambyses
      was sending are said to be the tallest and the most beautiful of all men;
      and besides other customs which they are reported to have different from
      other men, there is especially this, it is said, with regard to their
      regal power,—whomsoever of the men of their nation they judge to be
      the tallest and to have strength in proportion to his stature, this man
      they appoint to reign over them.
    </p>
<p>
      21. So when the Ichthyophagoi had come to this people they presented their
      gifts to the king who ruled over them, and at the same time they said as
      follows: "The king of the Persians Cambyses, desiring to become a friend
      and guest to thee, sent us with command to come to speech with thee, and
      he gives thee for gifts these things which he himself most delights to
      use." The Ethiopian however, perceiving that they had come as spies, spoke
      to them as follows: "Neither did the king of the Persians send you bearing
      gifts because he thought it a matter of great moment to become my
      guest-friend, nor do ye speak true things (for ye have come as spies of my
      kingdom), nor again is he a righteous man; for if he had been righteous he
      would not have coveted a land other than his own, nor would he be leading
      away into slavery men at whose hands he has received no wrong. Now however
      give him this bow and speak to him these words: The king of the Ethiopians
      gives this counsel to the king of the Persians, that when the Persians
      draw their bows (of equal size to mine) as easily as I do this, then he
      should march against the Long-lived Ethiopians, provided that he be
      superior in numbers; but until that time he should feel gratitude to the
      gods that they do not put it into the mind of the sons of the Ethiopians
      to acquire another land in addition to their own."
    </p>
<p>
      22. Having thus said and having unbent the bow, he delivered it to those
      who had come. Then he took the garment of purple and asked what it was and
      how it had been made: and when the Ichthyophagoi had told him the truth
      about the purple-fish and the dyeing of the tissue, he said that the men
      were deceitful and deceitful also were their garments. Then secondly he
      asked concerning the twisted gold of the collar and the bracelets; and
      when the Ichthyophagoi were setting forth to him the manner in which it
      was fashioned, the king broke into a laugh and said, supposing them to be
      fetters, that they had stronger fetters than those in their country.
      Thirdly he asked about the perfumed ointment, and when they had told him
      of the manner of its making and of the anointing with it, he said the same
      as he had said before about the garment. Then when he came to the wine,
      and had learned about the manner of its making, being exceedingly
      delighted with the taste of the drink he asked besides what food the king
      ate, and what was the longest time that a Persian man lived. They told him
      that he ate bread, explaining to him first the manner of growing the
      wheat, and they said that eighty years was the longest term of life
      appointed for a Persian man. In answer to this the Ethiopian said that he
      did not wonder that they lived but a few years, when they fed upon dung;
      for indeed they would not be able to live even so many years as this, if
      they did not renew their vigour with the drink, indicating to the
      Ichthyophagoi the wine; for in regard to this, he said, his people were
      much behind the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      23. Then when the Ichthyophagoi asked the king in return about the length
      of days and the manner of life of his people, he answered that the greater
      number of them reached the age of a hundred and twenty years, and some
      surpassed even this; and their food was boiled flesh and their drink was
      milk. And when the spies marvelled at the number of years, he conducted
      them to a certain spring, in the water of which they washed and became
      more sleek of skin, as if it were a spring of oil; and from it there came
      a scent as it were of violets: and the water of this spring, said the
      spies, was so exceedingly weak that it was not possible for anything to
      float upon it, either wood or any of those things which are lighter than
      wood, but they all went to the bottom. If this water which they have be
      really such as it is said to be, it would doubtless be the cause why the
      people are long-lived, as making use of it for all the purposes of life.
      Then when they departed from this spring, he led them to a prison-house
      for men, and there all were bound in fetters of gold. Now among these
      Ethiopians bronze is the rarest and most precious of all things. Then when
      they had seen the prison-house they saw also the so-called table of the
      Sun:
    </p>
<p>
      24, and after this they saw last of all their receptacles of dead bodies,
      which are said to be made of crystal in the following manner:—when
      they have dried the corpse, whether it be after the Egyptian fashion or in
      some other way, they cover it over completely with plaster <a href="#link32Hnote-21" id="link32noteref-21" class="pginternal">21</a>
      and then adorn it with painting, making the figure as far as possible like
      the living man. After this they put about it a block of crystal hollowed
      out; for this they dig up in great quantity and it is very easy to work:
      and the dead body being in the middle of the block is visible through it,
      but produces no unpleasant smell nor any other effect which is unseemly,
      and it has all its parts visible like the dead body itself. For a year
      then they who are most nearly related to the man keep the block in their
      house, giving to the dead man the first share of everything and offering
      to him sacrifices: and after this period they carry it out and set it up
      round about the city.
    </p>
<p>
      25. After they had seen all, the spies departed to go back; and when they
      reported these things, forthwith Cambyses was enraged and proceeded to
      march his army against the Ethiopians, not having ordered any provision of
      food nor considered with himself that he was intending to march an army to
      the furthest extremities of the earth; but as one who is mad and not in
      his right senses, when he heard the report of the Ichthyophagoi he began
      the march, ordering those of the Hellenes who were present to remain
      behind in Egypt, and taking with him his whole land force: and when in the
      course of his march he had arrived at Thebes, he divided off about fifty
      thousand of his army, and these he enjoined to make slaves of the
      Ammonians and to set fire to the seat of the Oracle of Zeus, but he
      himself with the remainder of his army went on against the Ethiopians. But
      before the army had passed over the fifth part of the way, all that they
      had of provisions came to an end completely; and then after the provisions
      the beasts of burden also were eaten up and came to an end. Now if
      Cambyses when he perceived this had changed his plan and led his army
      back, he would have been a wise man in spite of <a href="#link32Hnote-22" id="link32noteref-22" class="pginternal">22</a> his first mistake; as
      it was, however, he paid no regard, but went on forward without stopping.
      The soldiers accordingly, so long as they were able to get anything from
      the ground, prolonged their lives by eating grass; but when they came to
      the sand, some did a fearful deed, that is to say, out of each company of
      ten they selected by lot one of themselves and devoured him: and Cambyses,
      when he heard it, being alarmed by this eating of one another gave up the
      expedition against the Ethiopians and set forth to go back again; and he
      arrived at Thebes having suffered loss of a great number of his army. Then
      from Thebes he came down to Memphis and allowed the Hellenes to sail away
      home.
    </p>
<p>
      26. Thus fared the expedition against the Ethiopians: and those of the
      Persians who had been sent to march against the Ammonians set forth from
      Thebes and went on their way with guides; and it is known that they
      arrived at the city of Oasis, which is inhabited by Samians said to be of
      the Aischrionian tribe, and is distant seven days' journey from Thebes
      over sandy desert: now this place is called in the speech of the Hellenes
      the "Isle of the Blessed." It is said that the army reached this place,
      but from that point onwards, except the Ammonians themselves and those who
      have heard the account from them, no man is able to say anything about
      them; for they neither reached the Ammonians nor returned back. This
      however is added to the story by the Ammonians themselves:—they say
      that as the army was going from this Oasis through the sandy desert to
      attack them, and had got to a point about mid-way between them and the
      Oasis, while they were taking their morning meal a violent South Wind blew
      upon them, and bearing with it heaps of the desert sand it buried them
      under it, and so they disappeared and were seen no more. Thus the
      Ammonians say that it came to pass with regard to this army.
    </p>
<p>
      27. When Cambyses arrived at Memphis, Apis appeared to the Egyptians, whom
      the Hellenes call Epaphos: and when he had appeared, forthwith the
      Egyptians began to wear their fairest garments and to have festivities.
      Cambyses accordingly seeing the Egyptians doing thus, and supposing that
      they were certainly acting so by way of rejoicing because he had fared
      ill, called for the officers who had charge of Memphis; and when they had
      come into his presence, he asked them why when he was at Memphis on the
      former occasion, the Egyptians were doing nothing of this kind, but only
      now, when he came there after losing a large part of his army. They said
      that a god had appeared to them, who was wont to appear at intervals of
      long time, and that whenever he appeared, then all the Egyptians rejoiced
      and kept festival. Hearing this Cambyses said that they were lying, and as
      liars he condemned them to death.
    </p>
<p>
      28. Having put these to death, next he called the priests into his
      presence; and when the priests answered him after the same manner, he said
      that it should not be without his knowledge if a tame god had come to the
      Egyptians; and having so said he bade the priests bring Apis away into his
      presence: so they went to bring him. Now this Apis-Epaphos is a calf born
      of a cow who after this is not permitted to conceive any other offspring;
      and the Egyptians say that a flash of light comes down from heaven upon
      this cow, and of this she produces Apis. This calf which is called Apis is
      black and has the following signs, namely a white square <a href="#link32Hnote-23" id="link32noteref-23" class="pginternal">23</a>
      upon the forehead, and on the back the likeness of an eagle, and in the
      tail the hairs are double, and on <a href="#link32Hnote-24" id="link32noteref-24" class="pginternal">24</a> the tongue there is a
      mark like a beetle.
    </p>
<p>
      29. When the priests had brought Apis, Cambyses being somewhat affected
      with madness drew his dagger, and aiming at the belly of Apis, struck his
      thigh: then he laughed and said to the priests: "O ye wretched creatures,
      are gods born such as this, with blood and flesh, and sensible of the
      stroke of iron weapons? Worthy indeed of Egyptians is such a god as this.
      Ye however at least shall not escape without punishment for making a mock
      of me." Having thus spoken he ordered those whose duty it was to do such
      things, to scourge the priests without mercy, and to put to death any one
      of the other Egyptians whom they should find keeping the festival. Thus
      the festival of the Egyptians had been brought to an end, and the priests
      were being chastised, and Apis wounded by the stroke in his thigh lay
      dying in the temple.
    </p>
<p>
      30. Him, when he had brought his life to an end by reason of the wound,
      the priests buried without the knowledge of Cambyses: but Cambyses, as the
      Egyptians say, immediately after this evil deed became absolutely mad, not
      having been really in his right senses even before that time: and the
      first of his evil deeds was that he put to death his brother Smerdis, who
      was of the same father and the same mother as himself. This brother he had
      sent away from Egypt to Persia in envy, because alone of all the Persians
      he had been able to draw the bow which the Ichthyophagoi brought from the
      Ethiopian king, to an extent of about two finger-breadths; while of the
      other Persians not one had proved able to do this. Then when Smerdis had
      gone away to Persia, Cambyses saw a vision in his sleep of this kind:—it
      seemed to him that a messenger came from Persia and reported that Smerdis
      sitting upon the royal throne had touched the heaven with his head.
      Fearing therefore with regard to this lest his brother might slay him and
      reign in his stead, he sent Prexaspes to Persia, the man whom of all the
      Persians he trusted most, with command to slay him. He accordingly went up
      to Susa and slew Smerdis; and some say that he took him out of the chase
      and so slew him, others that he brought him to the Erythraian Sea and
      drowned him.
    </p>
<p>
      31. This they say was the first beginning of the evil deeds of Cambyses;
      and next after this he put to death his sister, who had accompanied him to
      Egypt, to whom also he was married, she being his sister by both parents.
      Now he took her to wife in the following manner (for before this the
      Persians had not been wont at all to marry their sisters):—Cambyses
      fell in love with one of his sisters, and desired to take her to wife; so
      since he had it in mind to do that which was not customary, he called the
      Royal Judges and asked them whether there existed any law which permitted
      him who desired it to marry his sister. Now the Royal Judges are men
      chosen out from among the Persians, and hold their office until they die
      or until some injustice is found in them, so long and no longer. These
      pronounce decisions for the Persians and are the expounders of the
      ordinances of their fathers, and all matters are referred to them. So when
      Cambyses asked them, they gave him an answer which was both upright and
      safe, saying that they found no law which permitted a brother to marry his
      sister, but apart from that they had found a law to the effect that the
      king of the Persians might do whatsoever he desired. Thus on the one hand
      they did not tamper with the law for fear of Cambyses, and at the same
      time, that they might not perish themselves in maintaining the law, they
      found another law beside that which was asked for, which was in favour of
      him who wished to marry his sisters. So Cambyses at that time took to wife
      her with whom he was in love, but after no long time he took another
      sister. Of these it was the younger whom he put to death, she having
      accompanied him to Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      32. About her death, as about the death of Smerdis, two different stories
      are told. The Hellenes say that Cambyses had matched a lion's cub in fight
      with a dog's whelp, and this wife of his was also a spectator of it; and
      when the whelp was being overcome, another whelp, its brother, broke its
      chain and came to help it; and having become two instead of one, the
      whelps then got the better of the cub: and Cambyses was pleased at the
      sight, but she sitting by him began to weep; and Cambyses perceived it and
      asked wherefore she wept; and she said that she had wept when she saw that
      the whelp had come to the assistance of its brother, because she
      remembered Smerdis and perceived that there was no one who would come to
      his <a href="#link32Hnote-25" id="link32noteref-25" class="pginternal">25</a>
      assistance. The Hellenes say that it was for this saying that she was
      killed by Cambyses: but the Egyptians say that as they were sitting round
      at table, the wife took a lettuce and pulled off the leaves all round, and
      then asked her husband whether the lettuce was fairer when thus plucked
      round or when covered with leaves, and he said "when covered with leaves":
      she then spoke thus: "Nevertheless thou didst once produce the likeness of
      this lettuce, when thou didst strip bare the house of Cyrus." And he moved
      to anger leapt upon her, being with child, and she miscarried and died.
    </p>
<p>
      33. These were the acts of madness done by Cambyses towards those of his
      own family, whether the madness was produced really on account of Apis or
      from some other cause, as many ills are wont to seize upon men; for it is
      said moreover that Cambyses had from his birth a certain grievous malady,
      that which is called by some the "sacred" disease: <a href="#link32Hnote-26" id="link32noteref-26" class="pginternal">26</a>
      and it was certainly nothing strange that when the body was suffering from
      a grievous malady, the mind should not be sound either.
    </p>
<p>
      34. The following also are acts of madness which he did to the other
      Persians:—To Prexaspes, the man whom he honoured most and who used
      to bear his messages <a href="#link32Hnote-2601" id="link32noteref-2601" class="pginternal">2601</a> (his son also was cup-bearer to Cambyses,
      and this too was no small honour),—to him it is said that he spoke
      as follows: "Prexaspes, what kind of a man do the Persians esteem me to
      be, and what speech do they hold concerning me?" and he said: "Master, in
      all other respects thou art greatly commended, but they say that thou art
      overmuch given to love of wine." Thus he spoke concerning the Persians;
      and upon that Cambyses was roused to anger, and answered thus: "It appears
      then that the Persians say I am given to wine, and that therefore I am
      beside myself and not in my right mind; and their former speech then was
      not sincere." For before this time, it seems, when the Persians and
      Croesus were sitting with him in council, Cambyses asked what kind of a
      man they thought he was as compared with his father Cyrus; <a href="#link32Hnote-27" id="link32noteref-27" class="pginternal">27</a>
      and they answered that he was better than his father, for he not only
      possessed all that his father had possessed, but also in addition to this
      had acquired Egypt and the Sea. Thus the Persians spoke; but Croesus, who
      was present and was not satisfied with their judgment, spoke thus to
      Cambyses: "To me, O son of Cyrus, thou dost not appear to be equal to thy
      father, for not yet hast thou a son such as he left behind him in you."
      Hearing this Cambyses was pleased, and commended the judgment of Croesus.
    </p>
<p>
      35. So calling to mind this, he said in anger to Prexaspes: "Learn then
      now for thyself whether the Persians speak truly, or whether when they say
      this they are themselves out of their senses: for if I, shooting at thy
      son there standing before the entrance of the chamber, hit him in the very
      middle of the heart, the Persians will be proved to be speaking falsely,
      but if I miss, then thou mayest say that the Persians are speaking the
      truth and that I am not in my right mind." Having thus said he drew his
      bow and hit the boy; and when the boy had fallen down, it is said that he
      ordered them to cut open his body and examine the place where he was hit;
      and as the arrow was found to be sticking in the heart, he laughed and was
      delighted, and said to the father of the boy: "Prexaspes, it has now been
      made evident, as thou seest, that I am not mad, but that it is the
      Persians who are out of their senses; and now tell me, whom of all men
      didst thou ever see before this time hit the mark so well in shooting?"
      Then Prexaspes, seeing that the man was not in his right senses and
      fearing for himself, said: "Master, I think that not even God himself
      could have hit the mark so fairly." Thus he did at that time: and at
      another time he condemned twelve of the Persians, men equal to the best,
      on a charge of no moment, and buried them alive with the head downwards.
    </p>
<p>
      36. When he was doing these things, Croesus the Lydian judged it right to
      admonish him in the following words: "O king, do not thou indulge the heat
      of thy youth and passion in all things, but retain and hold thyself back:
      it is a good thing to be prudent, and forethought is wise. Thou however
      are putting to death men who are of thine own people, condemning them on
      charges of no moment, and thou art putting to death men's sons also. If
      thou do many such things, beware lest the Persians make revolt from thee.
      As for me, thy father Cyrus gave me charge, earnestly bidding me to
      admonish thee, and suggest to thee that which I should find to be good."
      Thus he counselled him, manifesting goodwill towards him; but Cambyses
      answered: "Dost <i>thou</i> venture to counsel me, who excellently well
      didst rule thine own country, and well didst counsel my father, bidding
      him pass over the river Araxes and go against the Massagetai, when they
      were willing to pass over into our land, and so didst utterly ruin thyself
      by ill government of thine own land, and didst utterly ruin Cyrus, who
      followed thy counsel. However thou shalt not escape punishment now, for
      know that before this I had very long been desiring to find some occasion
      against thee." Thus having said he took his bow meaning to shoot him, but
      Croesus started up and ran out: and so since he could not shoot him, he
      gave orders to his attendants to take and slay him. The attendants
      however, knowing his moods, concealed Croesus, with the intention that if
      Cambyses should change his mind and seek to have Croesus again, they might
      produce him and receive gifts as the price of saving his life; but if he
      did not change his mind nor feel desire to have him back, then they might
      kill him. Not long afterwards Cambyses did in fact desire to have Croesus
      again, and the attendants perceiving this reported to him that he was
      still alive: and Cambyses said that he rejoiced with Croesus that he was
      still alive, but that they who had preserved him should not get off free,
      but he would put them to death: and thus he did.
    </p>
<p>
      37. Many such acts of madness did he both to Persians and allies,
      remaining at Memphis and opening ancient tombs and examining the dead
      bodies. Likewise also he entered into the temple of Hephaistos and very
      much derided the image of the god: for the image of Hephaistos very nearly
      resembles the Phenician <i>Pataicoi</i>, which the Phenicians carry about
      on the prows of their triremes; and for him who has not seen these, I will
      indicate its nature,—it is the likeness of a dwarfish man. He
      entered also into the temple of the Cabeiroi, into which it is not lawful
      for any one to enter except the priest only, and the images there he even
      set on fire, after much mockery of them. Now these also are like the
      images of Hephaistos, and it is said that they are the children of that
      god.
    </p>
<p>
      38. It is clear to me therefore by every kind of proof that Cambyses was
      mad exceedingly; for otherwise he would not have attempted to deride
      religious rites and customary observances. For if one should propose to
      all men a choice, bidding them select the best customs from all the
      customs that there are, each race of men, after examining them all, would
      select those of his own people; thus all think that their own customs are
      by far the best: and so it is not likely that any but a madman would make
      a jest of such things. Now of the fact that all men are thus wont to think
      about their customs, we may judge by many other proofs and more specially
      by this which follows:—Dareios in the course of his reign summoned
      those of the Hellenes who were present in his land, and asked them for
      what price they would consent to eat up their fathers when they died; and
      they answered that for no price would they do so. After this Dareios
      summoned those Indians who are called Callatians, who eat their parents,
      and asked them in presence of the Hellenes, who understood what they said
      by help of an interpreter, for what payment they would consent to consume
      with fire the bodies of their fathers when they died; and they cried out
      aloud and bade him keep silence from such words. Thus then these things
      are established by usage, and I think that Pindar spoke rightly in his
      verse, when he said that "of all things law is king." <a href="#link32Hnote-28" id="link32noteref-28" class="pginternal">28</a>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
      39. Now while Cambyses was marching upon Egypt, the Lacedemonians also had
      made an expedition against Samos and against Polycrates the son of Aiakes,
      who had risen against the government and obtained rule over Samos. At
      first he had divided the State into three parts and had given a share to
      his brothers Pantagnotos and Syloson; but afterwards he put to death one
      of these, and the younger, namely Syloson, he drove out, and so obtained
      possession of the whole of Samos. Then, being in possession, <a href="#link32Hnote-29" id="link32noteref-29" class="pginternal">29</a>
      he made a guest-friendship with Amasis the king of Egypt, sending him
      gifts and receiving gifts in return from him. After this straightway
      within a short period of time the power of Polycrates increased rapidly,
      and there was much fame of it not only in Ionia, but also over the rest of
      Hellas: for to whatever part he directed his forces, everything went
      fortunately for him: and he had got for himself a hundred fifty-oared
      galleys and a thousand archers, and he plundered from all, making no
      distinction of any; for it was his wont to say that he would win more
      gratitude from his friend by giving back to him that which he had taken,
      than by not taking at all. <a href="#link32Hnote-30" id="link32noteref-30" class="pginternal">30</a> So he had conquered
      many of the islands and also many cities of the continent, and besides
      other things he gained the victory in a sea-fight over the Lesbians, as
      they were coming to help the Milesians with their forces, and conquered
      them: these men dug the whole trench round the wall of the city of Samos
      working in chains.
    </p>
<p>
      40. Now Amasis, as may be supposed, did not fail to perceive that
      Polycrates was very greatly fortunate, and <a href="#link32Hnote-31" id="link32noteref-31" class="pginternal">31</a> it was to him an
      object of concern; and as much more good fortune yet continued to come to
      Polycrates, he wrote upon a paper these words and sent them to Samos:
      "Amasis to Polycrates thus saith:—It is a pleasant thing indeed to
      hear that one who is a friend and guest is faring well; yet to me thy
      great good fortune is not pleasing, since I know that the Divinity is
      jealous; and I think that I desire, both for myself and for those about
      whom I have care, that in some of our affairs we should be prosperous and
      in others should fail, and thus go through life alternately faring <a href="#link32Hnote-32" id="link32noteref-32" class="pginternal">32</a>
      well and ill, rather than that we should be prosperous in all things: for
      never yet did I hear tell of any one who was prosperous in all things and
      did not come to an utterly <a href="#link32Hnote-33" id="link32noteref-33" class="pginternal">33</a> evil end at the last.
      Now therefore do thou follow my counsel and act as I shall say with
      respect to thy prosperous fortunes. Take thought and consider, and that
      which thou findest to be the most valued by thee, and for the loss of
      which thou wilt most be vexed in thy soul, that take and cast away in such
      a manner that it shall never again come to the sight of men; and if in
      future from that time forward good fortune does not befall thee in
      alternation with calamities, <a href="#link32Hnote-34" id="link32noteref-34" class="pginternal">34</a> apply remedies in the
      manner by me suggested."
    </p>
<p>
      41. Polycrates, having read this and having perceived by reflection that
      Amasis suggested to him good counsel, sought to find which one of his
      treasures he would be most afflicted in his soul to lose; and seeking he
      found this which I shall say:—he had a signet which he used to wear,
      enchased in gold and made of an emerald stone; and it was the work of
      Theodoros the son of Telecles of Samos. <a href="#link32Hnote-35" id="link32noteref-35" class="pginternal">35</a> Seeing then that he
      thought it good to cast this away, he did thus:—he manned a
      fifty-oared galley with sailors and went on board of it himself; and then
      he bade them put out into the deep sea. And when he had got to a distance
      from the island, he took off the signet-ring, and in the sight of all who
      were with him in the ship he threw it into the sea. Thus having done he
      sailed home; and when he came to his house he mourned for his loss.
    </p>
<p>
      42. But on the fifth or sixth day after these things it happened to him as
      follows:—a fisherman having caught a large and beautiful fish,
      thought it right that this should be given as a gift to Polycrates. He
      bore it therefore to the door of the palace and said that he desired to
      come into the presence of Polycrates, and when he had obtained this he
      gave him the fish, saying: "O king, having taken this fish I did not think
      fit to bear it to the market, although I am one who lives by the labour of
      his hands; but it seemed to me that it was worthy of thee and of thy
      monarchy: therefore I bring it and present it to thee." He then, being
      pleased at the words spoken, answered thus: "Thou didst exceedingly well,
      and double thanks are due to thee, for thy words and also for thy gift;
      and we invite thee to come to dinner." The fisherman then, thinking this a
      great thing, went away to this house; and the servants as they were
      cutting up the fish found in its belly the signet-ring of Polycrates. Then
      as soon as they had seen it and taken it up, they bore it rejoicing to
      Polycrates, and giving him the signet-ring they told him in what manner it
      had been found: and he perceiving that the matter was of God, wrote upon
      paper all that he had done and all that had happened to him, and having
      written he despatched it to Egypt. <a href="#link32Hnote-36" id="link32noteref-36" class="pginternal">36</a>
</p>
<p>
      43. Then Amasis, when he had read the paper which had come from
      Polycrates, perceived that it was impossible for man to rescue man from
      the event which was to come to pass, and that Polycrates was destined not
      to have a good end, being prosperous in all things, seeing that he found
      again even that which he cast away. Therefore he sent an envoy to him in
      Samos and said that he broke off the guest-friendship; and this he did
      lest when a fearful and great mishap befell Polycrates, he might himself
      be grieved in his soul as for a man who was his guest.
    </p>
<p>
      44. It was this Polycrates then, prosperous in all things, against whom
      the Lacedemonians were making an expedition, being invited by those
      Samians who afterwards settled at Kydonia in Crete, to come to their
      assistance. Now Polycrates had sent an envoy to Cambyses the son of Cyrus
      without the knowledge of the Samians, as he was gathering an army to go
      against Egypt, and had asked him to send to him in Samos and to ask for an
      armed force. So Cambyses hearing this very readily sent to Samos to ask
      Polycrates to send a naval force with him against Egypt: and Polycrates
      selected of the citizens those whom he most suspected of desiring to rise
      against him and sent them away in forty triremes, charging Cambyses not to
      send them back.
    </p>
<p>
      45. Now some say that those of the Samians who were sent away by
      Polycrates never reached Egypt, but when they arrived on their voyage at
      Carpathos, <a href="#link32Hnote-37" id="link32noteref-37" class="pginternal">37</a> they considered with themselves, and resolved
      not to sail on any further: others say that they reached Egypt and being
      kept under guard there, they made their escape from thence. Then, as they
      were sailing in to Samos, Polycrates encountered them with ships and
      engaged battle with them; and those who were returning home had the better
      and landed in the island; but having fought a land-battle in the island,
      they were worsted, and so sailed to Lacedemon. Some however say that those
      from Egypt defeated Polycrates in the battle; but this in my opinion is
      not correct, for there would have been no need for them to invite the
      assistance of the Lacedemonians if they had been able by themselves to
      bring Polycrates to terms. Moreover, it is not reasonable either, seeing
      that he had foreign mercenaries and native archers very many in number, to
      suppose that he was worsted by the returning Samians, who were but few.
      Then Polycrates gathered together the children and wives of his subjects
      and confined them in the ship-sheds, keeping them ready so that, if it
      should prove that his subjects deserted to the side of the returning
      exiles, he might burn them with the sheds.
    </p>
<p>
      46. When those of the Samians who had been driven out by Polycrates
      reached Sparta, they were introduced before the magistrates and spoke at
      length, being urgent in their request. The magistrates however at the
      first introduction replied that they had forgotten the things which had
      been spoken at the beginning, and did not understand those which were
      spoken at the end. After this they were introduced a second time, and
      bringing with them a bag they said nothing else but this, namely that the
      bag was in want of meal; to which the others replied that they had
      overdone it with the bag. <a href="#link32Hnote-38" id="link32noteref-38" class="pginternal">38</a> However, they resolved to help them.
    </p>
<p>
      47. Then the Lacedemonians prepared a force and made expedition to Samos,
      in repayment of former services, as the Samians say, because the Samians
      had first helped them with ships against the Messenians; but the
      Lacedemonians say that they made the expedition not so much from desire to
      help the Samians at their request, as to take vengeance on their own
      behalf for the robbery of the mixing-bowl which they had been bearing as a
      gift to Croesus, <a href="#link32Hnote-39" id="link32noteref-39" class="pginternal">39</a> and of the corslet which Amasis the king of
      Egypt had sent as a gift to them; for the Samians had carried off the
      corslet also in the year before they took the bowl; and it was of linen
      with many figures woven into it and embroidered with gold and with cotton;
      and each thread of this corslet is worthy of admiration, for that being
      itself fine it has in it three hundred and sixty fibres, all plain to
      view. Such another as this moreover is that which Amasis dedicated as an
      offering to Athene at Lindos.
    </p>
<p>
      48. The Corinthians also took part with zeal in this expedition against
      Samos, that it might be carried out; for there had been an offence
      perpetrated against them also by the Samians a generation before <a href="#link32Hnote-40" id="link32noteref-40" class="pginternal">40</a>
      the time of this expedition and about the same time as the robbery of the
      bowl. Periander the son of Kypselos had despatched three hundred sons of
      the chief men of Corcyra to Alyattes at Sardis to be made eunuchs; and
      when the Corinthians who were conducting the boys had put in to Samos, the
      Samians, being informed of the story and for what purpose they were being
      conducted to Sardis, first instructed the boys to lay hold of the temple
      of Artemis, and then they refused to permit the Corinthians to drag the
      suppliants away from the temple: and as the Corinthians cut the boys off
      from supplies of food, the Samians made a festival, which they celebrate
      even to the present time in the same manner: for when night came on, as
      long as the boys were suppliants they arranged dances of maidens and
      youths, and in arranging the dances they made it a rule of the festival
      that sweet cakes of sesame and honey should be carried, in order that the
      Corcyrean boys might snatch them and so have support; and this went on so
      long that at last the Corinthians who had charge of the boys departed and
      went away; and as for the boys, the Samians carried them back to Corcyra.
    </p>
<p>
      49. Now, if after the death of Periander the Corinthians had been on
      friendly terms with the Corcyreans, they would not have joined in the
      expedition against Samos for the cause which has been mentioned; but as it
      is, they have been ever at variance with one another since they first
      colonised the island. <a href="#link32Hnote-41" id="link32noteref-41" class="pginternal">41</a> This then was the cause why the Corinthians
      had a grudge against the Samians.
    </p>
<p>
      50. Now Periander had chosen out the sons of the chief men of Corcyra and
      was sending them to Sardis to be made eunuchs, in order that he might have
      revenge; since the Corcyreans had first begun the offence and had done to
      him a deed of reckless wrong. For after Periander had killed his wife
      Melissa, it chanced to him to experience another misfortune in addition to
      that which had happened to him already, and this was as follows:—He
      had by Melissa two sons, the one of seventeen and the other of eighteen
      years. These sons their mother's father Procles, who was despot of
      Epidauros, sent for to himself and kindly entertained, as was to be
      expected seeing that they were the sons of his own daughter; and when he
      was sending them back, he said in taking leave of them: "Do ye know, boys,
      who it was that killed your mother?" Of this saying the elder of them took
      no account, but the younger, whose name was Lycophron, was grieved so
      greatly at hearing it, that when he reached Corinth again he would neither
      address his father, nor speak to him when his father would have conversed
      with him, nor give any reply when he asked questions, regarding him as the
      murderer of his mother. At length Periander being enraged with his son
      drove him forth out of his house.
    </p>
<p>
      51. And having driven him forth, he asked of the elder son what his
      mother's father had said to them in his conversation. He then related how
      Procles had received them in a kindly manner, but of the saying which he
      had uttered when he parted from them he had no remembrance, since he had
      taken no note of it. So Periander said that it could not be but that he
      had suggested to them something, and urged him further with questions; and
      he after that remembered, and told of this also. Then Periander taking
      note of it <a href="#link32Hnote-42" id="link32noteref-42" class="pginternal">42</a> and not desiring to show any indulgence, sent
      a messenger to those with whom the son who had been driven forth was
      living at that time, and forbade them to receive him into their houses;
      and whenever having been driven away from one house he came to another, he
      was driven away also from this, since Periander threatened those who
      received him, and commanded them to exclude him; and so being driven away
      again he would go to another house, where persons lived who were his
      friends, and they perhaps received him because he was the son of
      Periander, notwithstanding that they feared.
    </p>
<p>
      52. At last Periander made a proclamation that whosoever should either
      receive him into their houses or converse with him should be bound to pay
      a fine <a href="#link32Hnote-43" id="link32noteref-43" class="pginternal">43</a> to Apollo, stating the amount that it should
      be. Accordingly, by reason of this proclamation no one was willing either
      to converse with him or to receive him into their house; and moreover even
      he himself did not think it fit to attempt it, since it had been
      forbidden, but he lay about in the porticoes enduring exposure: and on the
      fourth day after this, Periander seeing him fallen into squalid misery and
      starvation felt pity for him; and abating his anger he approached him and
      began to say: "Son, which of these two is to be preferred, the fortune
      which thou dost now experience and possess, <a href="#link32Hnote-44" id="link32noteref-44" class="pginternal">44</a> or to inherit the
      power and wealth which I possess now, by being submissive to thy father's
      will? Thou however, being my son and the prince <a href="#link32Hnote-45" id="link32noteref-45" class="pginternal">45</a> of wealthy Corinth,
      didst choose nevertheless the life of a vagabond by making opposition and
      displaying anger against him with whom it behoved thee least to deal so;
      for if any misfortune happened in those matters, for which cause thou hast
      suspicion against me, this has happened to me first, and I am sharer in
      the misfortune more than others, inasmuch as I did the deed <a href="#link32Hnote-46" id="link32noteref-46" class="pginternal">46</a>
      myself. Do thou however, having learnt by how much to be envied is better
      than to be pitied, and at the same time what a grievous thing it is to be
      angry against thy parents and against those who are stronger than thou,
      come back now to the house." Periander with these words endeavoured to
      restrain him; but he answered nothing else to his father, but said only
      that he ought to pay a fine to the god for having come to speech with him.
      Then Periander, perceiving that the malady of his son was hopeless and
      could not be overcome, despatched a ship to Corcyra, and so sent him away
      out of his sight, for he was ruler also of that island; and having sent
      him away, Periander proceeded to make war against his father-in-law
      Procles, esteeming him most to blame for the condition in which he was;
      and he took Epidauros and took also Procles himself and made him a
      prisoner.
    </p>
<p>
      53. When however, as time went on, Periander had passed his prime and
      perceived within himself that he was no longer able to overlook and manage
      the government of the State, he sent to Corcyra and summoned Lycophron to
      come back and take the supreme power; for in the elder of his sons he did
      not see the required capacity, but perceived clearly that he was of wits
      too dull. Lycophron however did not deign even to give an answer to the
      bearer of his message. Then Periander, clinging still in affection to the
      youth, sent to him next his own daughter, the sister of Lycophron,
      supposing that he would yield to her persuasion more than to that of
      others; and she arrived there and spoke to him thus: "Boy, dost thou
      desire that both the despotism should fall to others, and also the
      substance of thy father, carried off as plunder, rather than that thou
      shouldest return back and possess them? Come back to thy home: cease to
      torment thyself. Pride is a mischievous possession. Heal not evil with
      evil. Many prefer that which is reasonable to that which is strictly just;
      and many ere now in seeking the things of their mother have lost the
      things of their father. Despotism is an insecure thing, and many desire
      it: moreover he is now an old man and past his prime. Give not thy good
      things unto others." She thus said to him the most persuasive things,
      having been before instructed by her father: but he in answer said, that
      he would never come to Corinth so long as he heard that his father was yet
      alive. When she had reported this, Periander the third time sent an envoy,
      and said that he desired himself to come to Corcyra, exhorting Lycophron
      at the same time to come back to Corinth and to be his successor on the
      throne. The son having agreed to return on these terms, Periander was
      preparing to sail to Corcyra and his son to Corinth; but the Corcyreans,
      having learnt all that had taken place, put the young man to death, in
      order that Periander might not come to their land. For this cause it was
      that Periander took vengeance on those of Corcyra.
    </p>
<p>
      54. The Lacedemonians then had come with a great armament and were
      besieging Samos; and having made an attack upon the wall, they occupied
      the tower which stands by the sea in the suburb of the city, but
      afterwards when Polycrates came up to the rescue with a large body they
      were driven away from it. Meanwhile by the upper tower which is upon the
      ridge of the mountain there had come out to the fight the foreign
      mercenaries and many of the Samians themselves, and these stood their
      ground against the Lacedemonians for a short while and then began to fly
      backwards; and the Lacedemonians followed and were slaying them.
    </p>
<p>
      55. Now if the Lacedemonians there present had all been equal on that day
      to Archias and Lycopas, Samos would have been captured; for Archias and
      Lycopas alone rushed within the wall together with the flying Samians, and
      being shut off from retreat were slain within the city of the Samians. I
      myself moreover had converse in Pitane (for to that deme he belonged) with
      the third in descent from this Archias, another Archias the son of Samios
      the son of Archias, who honoured the Samians of all strangers most; and
      not only so, but he said that his own father had been called Samios
      because <i>his</i> father Archias had died by a glorious death in Samos;
      and he said that he honoured Samians because his grandfather had been
      granted a public funeral by the Samians.
    </p>
<p>
      56. The Lacedemonians then, when they had been besieging Samos for forty
      days and their affairs made no progress, set forth to return to
      Peloponnesus. But according to the less credible account which has been
      put abroad of these matters Polycrates struck in lead a quantity of a
      certain native coin, and having gilded the coins over, gave them to the
      Lacedemonians, and they received them and upon that set forth to depart.
      This was the first expedition which the Lacedemonians (being Dorians) <a href="#link32Hnote-4601" id="link32noteref-4601" class="pginternal">4601</a>
      made into Asia.
    </p>
<p>
      57. Those of the Samians who had made the expedition against Polycrates
      themselves also sailed away, when the Lacedemonians were about to desert
      them, and came to Siphnos: for they were in want of money, and the people
      of Siphnos were then at their greatest height of prosperity and possessed
      wealth more than all the other islanders, since they had in their island
      mines of gold and silver, so that there is a treasury dedicated at Delphi
      with the tithe of the money which came in from these mines, and furnished
      in a manner equal to the wealthiest of these treasuries: and the people
      used to divide among themselves the money which came in from the mines
      every year. So when they were establishing the treasury, they consulted
      the Oracle as to whether their present prosperity was capable of remaining
      with them for a long time, and the Pythian prophetess gave them this
      reply:
    </p>
<pre>
 "But when with white shall be shining <a href="#link32Hnote-47" id="link32noteref-47" class="pginternal">47</a> the hall of the city <a href="#link32Hnote-48" id="link32noteref-48" class="pginternal">48</a>
    in Siphnos,
  And when the market is white of brow, one wary is needed
  Then, to beware of an army <a href="#link32Hnote-49" id="link32noteref-49" class="pginternal">49</a> of wood and a red-coloured herald."
</pre>
<p>
      Now just at that time the market-place and city hall of the Siphnians had
      been decorated with Parian marble.
    </p>
<p>
      58. This oracle they were not able to understand either then at first or
      when the Samians had arrived: for as soon as the Samians were putting in
      <a href="#link32Hnote-50" id="link32noteref-50" class="pginternal">50</a>
      to Siphnos they sent one of their ships to bear envoys to the city: now in
      old times all ships were painted with red, and this was that which the
      Pythian prophetess was declaring beforehand to the Siphnians, bidding them
      guard against the "army of wood" and the "red-coloured herald." The
      messengers accordingly came and asked the Siphnians to lend them ten
      talents; and as they refused to lend to them, the Samians began to lay
      waste their lands: so when they were informed of it, forthwith the
      Siphnians came to the rescue, and having engaged battle with them were
      defeated, and many of them were cut off by the Samians and shut out of the
      city; and the Samians after this imposed upon them a payment of a hundred
      talents.
    </p>
<p>
      59. Then from the men of Hermion they received by payment of money the
      island of Hydrea, which is near the coast of Peloponnese, and they gave it
      in charge to the Troizenians, but they themselves settled at Kydonia which
      is in Crete, not sailing thither for that purpose but in order to drive
      the Zakynthians out of the island. Here they remained and were prosperous
      for five years, so much so that they were the builders of the temples
      which are now existing in Kydonia, and also of the house of Dictyna. <a href="#link32Hnote-51" id="link32noteref-51" class="pginternal">51</a>
      In the sixth year however the Eginetans together with the Cretans
      conquered them in a sea-fight and brought them to slavery; and they cut
      off the prows of their ships, which were shaped like boars, and dedicated
      them in the temple of Athene in Egina. This the Eginetans did because they
      had a grudge against the Samians; for the Samians had first made
      expedition against Egina, when Amphicrates was king in Samos, and had done
      much hurt to the Eginetans and suffered much hurt also from them. Such was
      the cause of this event:
    </p>
<p>
      60, and about the Samians I have spoken at greater length, because they
      have three works which are greater than any others that have been made by
      Hellenes: first a passage beginning from below and open at both ends, dug
      through a mountain not less than a hundred and fifty fathoms <a href="#link32Hnote-52" id="link32noteref-52" class="pginternal">52</a>
      in height; the length of the passage is seven furlongs <a href="#link32Hnote-53" id="link32noteref-53" class="pginternal">53</a>
      and the height and breadth each eight feet, and throughout the whole of it
      another passage has been dug twenty cubits in depth and three feet in
      breadth, through which the water is conducted and comes by the pipes to
      the city, brought from an abundant spring: and the designer of this work
      was a Megarian, Eupalinos the son of Naustrophos. This is one of the
      three; and the second is a mole in the sea about the harbour, going down
      to a depth of as much as <a href="#link32Hnote-54" id="link32noteref-54" class="pginternal">54</a> twenty fathoms; and the length of the mole is
      more than two furlongs. The third work which they have executed is a
      temple larger than all the other temples of which we know. Of this the
      first designer was Rhoicos the son of Philes, a native of Samos. For this
      reason I have spoken at greater length of the Samians.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      61. Now while Cambyses the son of Cyrus was spending a long time in Egypt
      and had gone out of his right mind, there rose up against him two
      brothers, Magians, of whom the one had been left behind by Cambyses as
      caretaker of his household. This man, I say, rose up against him
      perceiving that the occurrence of the death of Smerdis was being kept
      secret, and that there were but few of the Persians who were aware of it,
      while the greater number believed without doubt that he was still alive.
      Therefore he endeavoured to obtain the kingdom, and he formed his plan as
      follows:—he had a brother (that one who, as I said, rose up with him
      against Cambyses), and this man in form very closely resembled Smerdis the
      son of Cyrus, whom Cambyses had slain, being his own brother. He was like
      Smerdis, I say, in form, and not only so but he had the same name,
      Smerdis. Having persuaded this man that he would manage everything for
      him, the Magian Patizeithes brought him and seated him upon the royal
      throne: and having so done he sent heralds about to the various provinces,
      and among others one to the army in Egypt, to proclaim to them that they
      must obey Smerdis the son of Cyrus for the future instead of Cambyses.
    </p>
<p>
      62. So then the other heralds made this proclamation, and also the one who
      was appointed to go to Egypt, finding Cambyses and his army at Agbatana in
      Syria, stood in the midst and began to proclaim that which had been
      commanded to him by the Magian. Hearing this from the herald, and
      supposing that the herald was speaking the truth and that he had himself
      been betrayed by Prexaspes, that is to say, that when Prexaspes was sent
      to kill Smerdis he had not done so, Cambyses looked upon Prexaspes and
      said: "Prexaspes, was it thus that thou didst perform for me the thing
      which I gave over to thee to do?" and he said: "Master, the saying is not
      true that Smerdis thy brother has risen up against thee, nor that thou
      wilt have any contention arising from him, either great or small: for I
      myself, having done that which thou didst command me to do, buried him
      with my own hands. If therefore the dead have risen again to life, then
      thou mayest expect that Astyages also the Mede will rise up against thee;
      but if it is as it was beforetime, there is no fear now that any trouble
      shall spring up for you, at least from him. Now therefore I think it well
      that some should pursue after the herald and examine him, asking from whom
      he has come to proclaim to us that we are to obey Smerdis as king."
    </p>
<p>
      63. When Prexaspes had thus spoken, Cambyses was pleased with the advice,
      and accordingly the herald was pursued forthwith and returned. Then when
      he had come back, Prexaspes asked him as follows: "Man, thou sayest that
      thou art come as a messenger from Smerdis the son of Cyrus: now therefore
      speak the truth and go away in peace. I ask thee whether Smerdis himself
      appeared before thine eyes and charged thee to say this, or some one of
      those who serve him." He said: "Smerdis the son of Cyrus I have never yet
      seen, since the day that king Cambyses marched to Egypt: but the Magian
      whom Cambyses appointed to be guardian of his household, he, I say, gave
      me this charge, saying that Smerdis the son of Cyrus was he who laid the
      command upon me to speak these things to you." Thus he spoke to them,
      adding no falsehoods to the first, and Cambyses said: "Prexaspes, thou
      hast done that which was commanded thee like an honest man, and hast
      escaped censure; but who of the Persians may this be who has risen up
      against me and usurped the name of Smerdis?" He said: "I seem to myself, O
      king, to have understanding of this which has come to pass: the Magians
      have risen against thee, Patizeithes namely, whom thou didst leave as
      caretaker of thy household, and his brother Smerdis."
    </p>
<p>
      64. Then Cambyses, when he heard the name of Smerdis, perceived at once
      the true meaning of this report and of the dream, for he thought in his
      sleep that some one had reported to him that Smerdis was sitting upon the
      royal throne and had touched the heaven with his head: and perceiving that
      he had slain his brother without need, he began to lament for Smerdis; and
      having lamented for him and sorrowed greatly for the whole mishap, he was
      leaping upon his horse, meaning as quickly as possible to march his army
      to Susa against the Magian; and as he leapt upon his horse, the cap of his
      sword-sheath fell off, and the sword being left bare struck his thigh.
      Having been wounded then in the same part where he had formerly struck
      Apis the god of the Egyptians, and believing that he had been struck with
      a mortal blow, Cambyses asked what was the name of that town, and they
      said "Agbatana." Now even before this he had been informed by the Oracle
      at the city of Buto that in Agbatana he should bring his life to an end:
      and he supposed that he should die of old age in Agbatana in Media, where
      was his chief seat of power; but the oracle, it appeared, meant in
      Agbatana of Syria. So when by questioning now he learnt the name of the
      town, being struck with fear both by the calamity caused by the Magian and
      at the same time by the wound, he came to his right mind, and
      understanding the meaning of the oracle he said: "Here it is fated that
      Cambyses the son of Cyrus shall end his life."
    </p>
<p>
      65. So much only he said at that time; but about twenty days afterwards he
      sent for the most honourable of the Persians who were with him, and said
      to them as follows: "Persians, it has become necessary for me to make
      known to you the thing which I was wont to keep concealed beyond all other
      things. Being in Egypt I saw a vision in my sleep, which I would I had
      never seen, and it seemed to me that a messenger came from home and
      reported to me that Smerdis was sitting upon the royal throne and had
      touched the heaven with his head. Fearing then lest I should be deprived
      of my power by my brother, I acted quickly rather than wisely; for it
      seems that it is not possible for man <a href="#link32Hnote-55" id="link32noteref-55" class="pginternal">55</a> to avert that which
      is destined to come to pass. I therefore, fool that I was, sent away
      Prexaspes to Susa to kill Smerdis; and when this great evil had been done,
      I lived in security, never considering the danger that some other man
      might at some time rise up against me, now that Smerdis had been removed:
      and altogether missing the mark of that which was about to happen, I have
      both made myself the murderer of my brother, when there was no need, and I
      have been deprived none the less of the kingdom; for it was in fact
      Smerdis the Magian of whom the divine power declared to me beforehand in
      the vision that he should rise up against me. So then, as I say, this deed
      has been done by me, and ye must imagine that ye no longer have Smerdis
      the son of Cyrus alive: but it is in truth the Magians who are masters of
      your kingdom, he whom I left as guardian of my household and his brother
      Smerdis. The man then who ought above all others to have taken vengeance
      on my behalf for the dishonour which I have suffered from the Magians, has
      ended his life by an unholy death received from the hands of those who
      were his nearest of kin; and since he is no more, it becomes most needful
      for me, as the thing next best of those which remain, <a href="#link32Hnote-56" id="link32noteref-56" class="pginternal">56</a>
      to charge you, O Persians, with that which dying I desire should be done
      for me. This then I lay upon you, calling upon the gods of the royal house
      to witness it,—upon you and most of all upon those of the
      Achaemenidai who are present here,—that ye do not permit the return
      of the chief power to the Medes, but that if they have acquired it by
      craft, by craft they be deprived of it by you, or if they have conquered
      it by any kind of force, by force and by a strong hand ye recover it. And
      if ye do this, may the earth bring forth her produce and may your wives
      and your cattle be fruitful, while ye remain free for ever; but if ye do
      not recover the power nor attempt to recover it, I pray that curses the
      contrary of these blessings may come upon you, and moreover that each man
      of the Persians may have an end to his life like that which has come upon
      me." Then as soon as he had finished speaking these things, Cambyses began
      to bewail and make lamentation for all his fortunes.
    </p>
<p>
      66. And the Persians, when they saw that the king had begun to bewail
      himself, both rent the garments which they wore and made lamentation
      without stint. After this, when the bone had become diseased and the thigh
      had mortified, Cambyses the son of Cyrus was carried off by the wound,
      having reigned in all seven years and five months, and being absolutely
      childless both of male and female offspring. The Persians meanwhile who
      were present there were very little disposed to believe <a href="#link32Hnote-57" id="link32noteref-57" class="pginternal">57</a>
      that the power was in the hands of the Magians: on the contrary, they were
      surely convinced that Cambyses had said that which he said about the death
      of Smerdis to deceive them, in order that all the Persians might be moved
      to war against him. These then were surely convinced that Smerdis the son
      of Cyrus was established to be king; for Prexaspes also very strongly
      denied that he had slain Smerdis, since it was not safe, now that Cambyses
      was dead, for him to say that he had destroyed with his own hand the son
      of Cyrus.
    </p>
<p>
      67. Thus when Cambyses had brought his life to an end, the Magian became
      king without disturbance, usurping the place of his namesake Smerdis the
      son of Cyrus; and he reigned during the seven months which were wanting
      yet to Cambyses for the completion of the eight years: and during them he
      performed acts of great benefit to all his subjects, so that after his
      death all those in Asia except the Persians themselves mourned for his
      loss: for the Magian sent messengers abroad to every nation over which he
      ruled, and proclaimed freedom from military service and from tribute for
      three years.
    </p>
<p>
      68. This proclamation, I say, he made at once when he established himself
      upon the throne: but in the eighth month it was discovered who he was in
      the following manner:—There was one Otanes the son of Pharnaspes, in
      birth and in wealth not inferior to any of the Persians. This Otanes was
      the first who had had suspicion of the Magian, that he was not Smerdis the
      son of Cyrus but the person that he really was, drawing his inference from
      these facts, namely that he never went abroad out of the fortress, and
      that he did not summon into his presence any of the honourable men among
      the Persians: and having formed a suspicion of him, he proceeded to do as
      follows:—Cambyses had taken to wife his daughter, whose name was
      Phaidyme; <a href="#link32Hnote-58" id="link32noteref-58" class="pginternal">58</a> and this same daughter the Magian at that
      time was keeping as his wife and living with her as with all the rest also
      of the wives of Cambyses. Otanes therefore sent a message to this daughter
      and asked her who the man was by whose side she slept, whether Smerdis the
      son of Cyrus or some other. She sent back word to him saying that she did
      not know, for she had never seen Smerdis the son of Cyrus, nor did she
      know otherwise who he was who lived with her. Otanes then sent a second
      time and said: "If thou dost not thyself know Smerdis the son of Cyrus,
      then do thou ask of Atossa who this man is, with whom both she and thou
      live as wives; for assuredly it must be that she knows her own brother."
    </p>
<p>
      69. To this the daughter sent back word: "I am not able either to come to
      speech with Atossa or to see any other of the women who live here with me;
      for as soon as this man, whosoever he may be, succeeded to the kingdom, he
      separated us and placed us in different apartments by ourselves." When
      Otanes heard this, the matter became more and more clear to him, and he
      sent another message in to her, which said: "Daughter, it is right for
      thee, nobly born as thou art, to undertake any risk which thy father bids
      thee take upon thee: for if in truth this is not Smerdis the son of Cyrus
      but the man whom I suppose, he ought not to escape with impunity either
      for taking thee to his bed or for holding the dominion of Persians, but he
      must pay the penalty. Now therefore do as I say. When he sleeps by thee
      and thou perceivest that he is sound asleep, feel his ears; and if it
      prove that he has ears, then believe that thou art living with Smerdis the
      son of Cyrus, but if not, believe that it is with the Magian Smerdis." To
      this Phaidyme sent an answer saying that, if she should do so, she would
      run a great risk; for supposing that he should chance not to have his
      ears, and she were detected feeling for them, she was well assured that he
      would put her to death; but nevertheless she would do this. So she
      undertook to do this for her father: but as for this Magian Smerdis, he
      had had his ears cut off by Cyrus the son of Cambyses when he was king,
      for some grave offence. This Phaidyme then, the daughter of Otanes,
      proceeding to perform all that she had undertaken for her father, when her
      turn came to go to the Magian (for the wives of the Persians go in to them
      regularly each in her turn), came and lay down beside him: and when the
      Magian was in deep sleep, she felt his ears; and perceiving not with
      difficulty but easily that her husband had no ears, so soon as it became
      day she sent and informed her father of that which had taken place.
    </p>
<p>
      70. Then Otanes took to him Aspathines and Gobryas, <a href="#link32Hnote-59" id="link32noteref-59" class="pginternal">59</a>
      who were leading men among the Persians and also his own most trusted
      friends, and related to them the whole matter: and they, as it then
      appeared, had suspicions also themselves that it was so; and when Otanes
      reported this to them, they readily accepted his proposals. Then it was
      resolved by them that each one should associate with himself that man of
      the Persians whom he trusted most; so Otanes brought in Intaphrenes, <a href="#link32Hnote-60" id="link32noteref-60" class="pginternal">60</a>
      Gobryas brought in Megabyzos, and Aspathines brought in Hydarnes. When
      they had thus become six, Dareios the son of Hystaspes arrived at Susa,
      having come from the land of Persia, for of this his father was governor.
      Accordingly when he came, the six men of the Persians resolved to
      associate Dareios also with themselves.
    </p>
<p>
      71. These then having come together, being seven in number, gave pledges
      of faith to one another and deliberated together; and when it came to
      Dareios to declare his opinion, he spoke to them as follows: "I thought
      that I alone knew this, namely that it was the Magian who was reigning as
      king and that Smerdis the son of Cyrus had brought his life to an end; and
      for this very reason I am come with earnest purpose to contrive death for
      the Magian. Since however it has come to pass that ye also know and not I
      alone, I think it well to act at once and not to put the matter off, for
      that is not the better way." To this replied Otanes: "Son of Hystaspes,
      thou art the scion of a noble stock, and thou art showing thyself, as it
      seems, in no way inferior to thy father: do not however hasten this
      enterprise so much without consideration, but take it up more prudently;
      for we must first become more in numbers, and then undertake the matter."
      In answer to this Dareios said: "Men who are here present, if ye shall
      follow the way suggested by Otanes, know that ye will perish miserably;
      for some one will carry word to the Magian, getting gain thereby privately
      for himself. Your best way would have been to do this action upon your own
      risk alone; but since it seemed good to you to refer the matter to a
      greater number, and ye communicated it to me, either let us do the deed
      to-day, or be ye assured that if this present day shall pass by, none
      other shall prevent me <a href="#link32Hnote-61" id="link32noteref-61" class="pginternal">61</a> as your accuser, but I will myself tell these
      things to the Magian."
    </p>
<p>
      72. To this Otanes, when he saw Dareios in violent haste, replied: "Since
      thou dost compel us to hasten the matter and dost not permit us to delay,
      come expound to us thyself in what manner we shall pass into the palace
      and lay hands upon them: for that there are guards set in various parts,
      thou knowest probably thyself as well as we, if not from sight at least
      from hearsay; and in what manner shall we pass through these?" Dareios
      made reply with these words: "Otanes, there are many things in sooth which
      it is not possible to set forth in speech, but only in deed; and other
      things there are which in speech can be set forth, but from them comes no
      famous deed. Know ye however that the guards which are set are not
      difficult to pass: for in the first place, we being what we are, there is
      no one who will not let us go by, partly, as may be supposed, from having
      respect for us, and partly also perhaps from fear; and secondly I have
      myself a most specious pretext by means of which we may pass by; for I
      shall say that I am just now come from the Persian land and desire to
      declare to the king a certain message from my father: for where it is
      necessary that a lie be spoken, let it be spoken; seeing that we all aim
      at the same object, both they who lie and they who always speak the truth;
      those lie whenever they are likely to gain anything by persuading with
      their lies, and these tell the truth in order that they may draw to
      themselves gain by the truth, and that things <a href="#link32Hnote-62" id="link32noteref-62" class="pginternal">62</a> may be entrusted to
      them more readily. Thus, while practising different ways, we aim all at
      the same thing. If however they were not likely to make any gain by it,
      the truth-teller would lie and the liar would speak the truth, with
      indifference. Whosoever then of the door-keepers shall let us pass by of
      his own free will, for him it shall be the better afterwards; but
      whosoever shall endeavour to oppose our passage, let him then and there be
      marked as our enemy, <a href="#link32Hnote-63" id="link32noteref-63" class="pginternal">63</a> and after that let us push in and set about
      our work."
    </p>
<p>
      73. Then said Gobryas: "Friends, at what time will there be a fairer
      opportunity for us either to recover our rule, or, if we are not able to
      get it again, to die? seeing that we being Persians on the one hand lie
      under the rule of a Mede, a Magian, and that too a man whose ears have
      been cut off. Moreover all those of you who stood by the side of Cambyses
      when he was sick remember assuredly what he laid upon the Persians as he
      was bringing his life to an end, if they should not attempt to win back
      the power; and this we did not accept then, but supposed that Cambyses had
      spoken in order to deceive us. Now therefore I give my vote that we follow
      the opinion of Dareios, and that we do not depart from this assembly to go
      anywhither else but straight to attack the Magian." Thus spoke Gobryas,
      and they all approved of this proposal.
    </p>
<p>
      74. Now while these were thus taking counsel together, it was coming to
      pass by coincidence as follows:—The Magians taking counsel together
      had resolved to join Prexaspes with themselves as a friend, both because
      he had suffered grievous wrong from Cambyses, who had killed his son by
      shooting him, and because he alone knew for a certainty of the death of
      Smerdis the son of Cyrus, having killed him with his own hands, and
      finally because Prexaspes was in very great repute among the Persians. For
      these reasons they summoned him and endeavoured to win him to be their
      friend, engaging him by pledge and with oaths, that he would assuredly
      keep to himself and not reveal to any man the deception which had been
      practised by them upon the Persians, and promising to give him things
      innumerable <a href="#link32Hnote-64" id="link32noteref-64" class="pginternal">64</a> in return. After Prexaspes had promised to do
      this, the Magians, having persuaded him so far, proposed to him a second
      thing, and said that they would call together all the Persians to come up
      to the wall of the palace, and bade him go up upon a tower and address
      them, saying that they were living under the rule of Smerdis the son of
      Cyrus and no other. This they so enjoined because they supposed <a href="#link32Hnote-65" id="link32noteref-65" class="pginternal">65</a>
      that he had the greatest credit among the Persians, and because he had
      frequently declared the opinion that Smerdis the son of Cyrus was still
      alive, and had denied that he had slain him.
    </p>
<p>
      75. When Prexaspes said that he was ready to do this also, the Magians
      having called together the Persians caused him to go up upon a tower and
      bade him address them. Then he chose to forget those things which they
      asked of him, and beginning with Achaimenes he traced the descent of Cyrus
      on the father's side, and then, when he came down to Cyrus, he related at
      last what great benefits he had conferred upon the Persians; and having
      gone through this recital he proceeded to declare the truth, saying that
      formerly he kept it secret, since it was not safe for him to tell of that
      which had been done, but at the present time he was compelled to make it
      known. He proceeded to say how he had himself slain Smerdis the son of
      Cyrus, being compelled by Cambyses, and that it was the Magians who were
      now ruling. Then he made imprecation of many evils on the Persians, if
      they did not win back again the power and take vengeance upon the Magians,
      and upon that he let himself fall down from the tower head foremost. Thus
      Prexaspes ended his life, having been throughout his time a man of repute.
    </p>
<p>
      76. Now the seven of the Persians, when they had resolved forthwith to lay
      hands upon the Magians and not to delay, made prayer to the gods and went,
      knowing nothing of that which had been done with regard to Prexaspes: and
      as they were going and were in the middle of their course, they heard that
      which had happened about Prexaspes. Upon that they retired out of the way
      and again considered with themselves, Otanes and his supporters strongly
      urging that they should delay and not set to the work when things were
      thus disturbed, <a href="#link32Hnote-66" id="link32noteref-66" class="pginternal">66</a> while Dareios and those of his party urged
      that they should go forthwith and do that which had been resolved, and not
      delay. Then while they were contending, there appeared seven pairs of
      hawks pursuing two pairs of vultures, plucking out their feathers and
      tearing them. Seeing this the seven all approved the opinion of Dareios
      and thereupon they went to the king's palace, encouraged by the sight of
      the birds.
    </p>
<p>
      77. When they appeared at the gates, it happened nearly as Dareios
      supposed, for the guards, having respect for men who were chief among the
      Persians, and not suspecting that anything would be done by them of the
      kind proposed, allowed them to pass in under the guiding of heaven, and
      none asked them any question. Then when they had passed into the court,
      they met the eunuchs who bore in the messages to the king; and these
      inquired of them for what purpose they had come, and at the same time they
      threatened with punishment the keepers of the gates for having let them
      pass in, and tried to stop the seven when they attempted to go forward.
      Then they gave the word to one another and drawing their daggers stabbed
      these men there upon the spot, who tried to stop them, and themselves went
      running on towards the chamber of the men. <a href="#link32Hnote-6601" id="link32noteref-6601" class="pginternal">6601</a>
</p>
<p>
      78. Now the Magians happened both of them to be there within, consulting
      about that which had been done by Prexaspes. So when they saw that the
      eunuchs had been attacked and were crying aloud, they ran back <a href="#link32Hnote-67" id="link32noteref-67" class="pginternal">67</a>
      both of them, and perceiving that which was being done they turned to
      self-defence: and one of them got down his bow and arrows before he was
      attacked, while the other had recourse to his spear. Then they engaged in
      combat with one another; and that one of them who had taken up his bow and
      arrows found them of no use, since his enemies were close at hand and
      pressed hard upon him, but the other defended himself with his spear, and
      first he struck Aspathines in the thigh, and then Intaphrenes in the eye;
      and Intaphrenes lost his eye by reason of the wound, but his life he did
      not lose. These then were wounded by one of the Magians, but the other,
      when his bow and arrows proved useless to him, fled into a bedchamber
      which opened into the chamber of the men, intending to close the door; and
      with him there rushed in two of the seven, Dareios and Gobryas. And when
      Gobryas was locked together in combat with the Magian, Dareios stood by
      and was at a loss what to do, because it was dark, and he was afraid lest
      he should strike Gobryas. Then seeing him standing by idle, Gobryas asked
      why he did not use his hands, and he said: "Because I am afraid lest I may
      strike thee": and Gobryas answered: "Thrust with thy sword even though it
      stab through us both." So Dareios was persuaded, and he thrust with his
      danger and happened to hit the Magian.
    </p>
<p>
      79. So when they had slain the Magians and cut off their heads, they left
      behind those of their number who were wounded, both because they were
      unable to go, and also in order that they might take charge of the
      fortress, and the five others taking with them the heads of the Magians
      ran with shouting and clashing of arms and called upon the other Persians
      to join them, telling them of that which had been done and showing the
      heads, and at the same time they proceeded to slay every one of the
      Magians who crossed their path. So the Persians when they heard of that
      which had been brought to pass by the seven and of the deceit of the
      Magians, thought good themselves also to do the same, and drawing their
      daggers they killed the Magians wherever they found one; so that if night
      had not come on and stopped them, they would not have left a single Magian
      alive. This day the Persians celebrate in common more than all other days,
      and upon it they keep a great festival which is called by the Persians the
      festival of the slaughter of the Magians, <a href="#link32Hnote-6701" id="link32noteref-6701" class="pginternal">6701</a> on which no
      Magian is permitted to appear abroad, but the Magians keep themselves
      within their houses throughout that day.
    </p>
<p>
      80. When the tumult had subsided and more than five days had elapsed, <a href="#link32Hnote-68" id="link32noteref-68" class="pginternal">68</a>
      those who had risen against the Magians began to take counsel about the
      general state, and there were spoken speeches which some of the Hellenes
      do not believe were really uttered, but spoken they were nevertheless. <a href="#link32Hnote-69" id="link32noteref-69" class="pginternal">69</a>
      On the one hand Otanes urged that they should resign the government into
      the hands of the whole body of the Persians, and his words were as
      follows: "To me it seems best that no single one of us should henceforth
      be ruler, for that is neither pleasant nor profitable. Ye saw the insolent
      temper of Cambyses, to what lengths it went, and ye have had experience
      also of the insolence of the Magian: and how should the rule of one alone
      be a well-ordered thing, seeing that the monarch may do what he desires
      without rendering any account of his acts? Even the best of all men, if he
      were placed in this disposition, would be caused by it to change from his
      wonted disposition: for insolence is engendered in him by the good things
      which he possesses, and envy is implanted in man from the beginning; and
      having these two things, he has all vice: for he does many deeds of
      reckless wrong, partly moved by insolence proceeding from satiety, and
      partly by envy. And yet a despot at least ought to have been free from
      envy, seeing that he has all manner of good things. He is however
      naturally in just the opposite temper towards his subjects; for he grudges
      to the nobles that they should survive and live, but delights in the
      basest of citizens, and he is more ready than any other man to receive
      calumnies. Then of all things he is the most inconsistent; for if you
      express admiration of him moderately, he is offended that no very great
      court is paid to him, whereas if you pay court to him extravagantly, he is
      offended with you for being a flatterer. And the most important matter of
      all is that which I am about to say:—he disturbs the customs handed
      down from our fathers, he is a ravisher of women, and he puts men to death
      without trial. On the other hand the rule of many has first a name
      attaching to it which is the fairest of all names, that is to say
      'Equality'; <a href="#link32Hnote-70" id="link32noteref-70" class="pginternal">70</a> next, the multitude does none of those things
      which the monarch does: offices of state are exercised by lot, and the
      magistrates are compelled to render account of their action: and finally
      all matters of deliberation are referred to the public assembly. I
      therefore give as my opinion that we let monarchy go and increase the
      power of the multitude; for in the many is contained everything."
    </p>
<p>
      81. This was the opinion expressed by Otanes; but Megabyzos urged that
      they should entrust matters to the rule of a few, saying these words:
      "That which Otanes said in opposition to a tyranny, let it be counted as
      said for me also, but in that which he said urging that we should make
      over the power to the multitude, he has missed the best counsel: for
      nothing is more senseless or insolent than a worthless crowd; and for men
      flying from the insolence of a despot to fall into that of unrestrained
      popular power, is by no means to be endured: for he, if he does anything,
      does it knowing what he does, but the people cannot even know; for how can
      that know which has neither been taught anything noble by others nor
      perceived anything of itself, <a href="#link32Hnote-71" id="link32noteref-71" class="pginternal">71</a> but pushes on matters
      with violent impulse and without understanding, like a torrent stream?
      Rule of the people then let them adopt who are foes to the Persians; but
      let us choose a company of the best men, and to them attach the chief
      power; for in the number of these we shall ourselves also be, and it is
      likely that the resolutions taken by the best men will be the best."
    </p>
<p>
      82. This was the opinion expressed by Megabyzos; and thirdly Dareios
      proceeded to declare his opinion, saying: "To me it seems that in those
      things which Megabyzos said with regard to the multitude he spoke rightly,
      but in those which he said with regard to the rule of a few, not rightly:
      for whereas there are three things set before us, and each is supposed <a href="#link32Hnote-72" id="link32noteref-72" class="pginternal">72</a>
      to be the best in its own kind, that is to say a good popular government,
      and the rule of a few, and thirdly the rule of one, I say that this last
      is by far superior to the others; for nothing better can be found than the
      rule of an individual man of the best kind; seeing that using the best
      judgment he would be guardian of the multitude without reproach; and
      resolutions directed against enemies would so best be kept secret. In an
      oligarchy however it happens often that many, while practising virtue with
      regard to the commonwealth, have strong private enmities arising among
      themselves; for as each man desires to be himself the leader and to
      prevail in counsels, they come to great enmities with one another, whence
      arise factions among them, and out of the factions comes murder, and from
      murder results the rule of one man; and thus it is shown in this instance
      by how much that is the best. Again, when the people rules, it is
      impossible that corruption <a href="#link32Hnote-73" id="link32noteref-73" class="pginternal">73</a> should not arise, and
      when corruption arises in the commonwealth, there arise among the corrupt
      men not enmities but strong ties of friendship: for they who are acting
      corruptly to the injury of the commonwealth put their heads together
      secretly to do so. And this continues so until at last some one takes the
      leadership of the people and stops the course of such men. By reason of
      this the man of whom I speak is admired by the people, and being so
      admired he suddenly appears as monarch. Thus he too furnishes herein an
      example to prove that the rule of one is the best thing. Finally, to sum
      up all in a single word, whence arose the liberty which we possess, and
      who gave it to us? Was it a gift of the people or of an oligarchy or of a
      monarch? I therefore am of opinion that we, having been set free by one
      man, should preserve that form of rule, and in other respects also that we
      should not annul the customs of our fathers which are ordered well; for
      that is not the better way."
    </p>
<p>
      83. These three opinions then had been proposed, and the other four men of
      the seven gave their assent to the last. So when Otanes, who was desirous
      to give equality to the Persians, found his opinion defeated, he spoke to
      those assembled thus: "Partisans, it is clear that some one of us must
      become king, selected either by casting lots, or by entrusting the
      decision to the multitude of the Persians and taking him whom it shall
      choose, or by some other means. I therefore shall not be a competitor with
      you, for I do not desire either to rule or to be ruled; and on this
      condition I withdraw from my claim to rule, namely that I shall not be
      ruled by any of you, either I myself or my descendants in future time."
      When he had said this, the six made agreement with him on those terms, and
      he was no longer a competitor with them, but withdrew from the assembly;
      and at the present time this house remains free alone of all the Persian
      houses, and submits to rule only so far as it wills to do so itself, not
      transgressing the laws of the Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      84. The rest however of the seven continued to deliberate how they should
      establish a king in the most just manner; and it was resolved by them that
      to Otanes and his descendants in succession, if the kingdom should come to
      any other of the seven, there should be given as special gifts a Median
      dress every year and all those presents which are esteemed among the
      Persians to be the most valuable: and the reason why they determined that
      these things should be given to him, was because he first suggested to
      them the matter and combined them together. These were special gifts for
      Otanes; and this they also determined for all in common, namely that any
      one of the seven who wished might pass in to the royal palaces without any
      to bear in a message, unless the king happened to be sleeping with his
      wife; and that it should not be lawful for the king to marry from any
      other family, but only from those of the men who had made insurrection
      with him: and about the kingdom they determined this, namely that the man
      whose horse should first neigh at sunrise in the suburb of the city when
      they were mounted upon their horses, he should have the kingdom.
    </p>
<p>
      85. Now Dareios had a clever horse-keeper, whose name was Oibares. To this
      man, when they had left their assembly, Dareios spoke these words:
      "Oibares, we have resolved to do about the kingdom thus, namely that the
      man whose horse first neighs at sunrise, when we are mounted upon our
      horses he shall be king. Now therefore, if thou hast any cleverness,
      contrive that we may obtain this prize, and not any other man." Oibares
      replied thus: "If, my master, it depends in truth upon this whether thou
      be king or no, have confidence so far as concerns this and keep a good
      heart, for none other shall be king before thee; such charms have I at my
      command." Then Dareios said: "If then thou hast any such trick, it is time
      to devise it and not to put things off, for our trial is to-morrow."
      Oibares therefore hearing this did as follows:—when night was coming
      on he took one of the mares, namely that one which the horse of Dareios
      preferred, and this he led into the suburb of the city and tied her up:
      then he brought to her the horse of Dareios, and having for some time led
      him round her, making him go so close by so as to touch the mare, at last
      he let the horse mount.
    </p>
<p>
      86. Now at dawn of day the six came to the place as they had agreed,
      riding upon their horses; and as they rode through by the suburb of the
      city, when they came near the place where the mare had been tied up on the
      former night, the horse of Dareios ran up to the place and neighed; and
      just when the horse had done this, there came lightning and thunder from a
      clear sky: and the happening of these things to Dareios consummated his
      claim, for they seemed to have come to pass by some design, and the others
      leapt down from their horses and did obeisance to Dareios.
    </p>
<p>
      87. Some say that the contrivance of Oibares was this, but others say as
      follows (for the story is told by the Persians in both ways), namely that
      he touched with his hands the parts of this mare and kept his hand hidden
      in his trousers; and when at sunrise they were about to let the horses go,
      this Oibares pulled out his hand and applied it to the nostrils of the
      horse of Dareios; and the horse, perceiving the smell, snorted and
      neighed.
    </p>
<p>
      88. So Dareios the son of Hystaspes had been declared king; and in Asia
      all except the Arabians were his subjects, having been subdued by Cyrus
      and again afterwards by Cambyses. The Arabians however were never obedient
      to the Persians under conditions of subjection, but had become
      guest-friends when they let Cambyses pass by to Egypt: for against the
      will of the Arabians the Persians would not be able to invade Egypt.
      Moreover Dareios made the most noble marriages possible in the estimation
      of the Persians; for he married two daughters of Cyrus, Atossa and
      Artystone, of whom the one, Arossa, had before been the wife of Cambyses
      her brother and then afterwards of the Magian, while Artystone was a
      virgin; and besides them he married the daughter of Smerdis the son of
      Cyrus, whose name was Parmys; and he also took to wife the daughter of
      Otanes, he who had discovered the Magian; and all things became filled
      with his power. And first he caused to be a carving in stone, and set it
      up; and in it there was the figure of a man on horseback, and he wrote
      upon it writing to this effect: "Dareios son of Hystaspes by the
      excellence of his horse," mentioning the name of it, "and of his
      horse-keeper Oibares obtained the kingdom of the Persians."
    </p>
<p>
      89. Having so done in Persia, he established twenty provinces, which the
      Persians themselves call <i>satrapies</i>; and having established the
      provinces and set over them rulers, he appointed tribute to come to him
      from them according to races, joining also to the chief races those who
      dwelt on their borders, or passing beyond the immediate neighbours and
      assigning to various races those which lay more distant. He divided the
      provinces and the yearly payment of tribute as follows: and those of them
      who brought in silver were commanded to pay by the standard of the
      Babylonian talent, but those who brought in gold by the Euboïc talent; now
      the Babylonian talent is equal to eight-and-seventy Euboïc pounds. <a href="#link32Hnote-74" id="link32noteref-74" class="pginternal">74</a>
      For in the reign of Cyrus, and again of Cambyses, nothing was fixed about
      tribute, but they used to bring gifts: and on account of this appointing
      of tribute and other things like this, the Persians say that Dareios was a
      shopkeeper, Cambyses a master, and Cyrus a father; the one because he
      dealt with all his affairs like a shopkeeper, the second because he was
      harsh and had little regard for any one, and the other because he was
      gentle and contrived for them all things good.
    </p>
<p>
      90. From the Ionians and the Magnesians who dwell in Asia and the
      Aiolians, Carians, Lykians, Milyans and Pamphylians (for one single sum
      was appointed by him as tribute for all these) there came in four hundred
      talents of silver. This was appointed by him to be the first division. <a href="#link32Hnote-75" id="link32noteref-75" class="pginternal">75</a>
      From the Mysians and Lydians and Lasonians and Cabalians and Hytennians <a href="#link32Hnote-76" id="link32noteref-76" class="pginternal">76</a>
      there came in five hundred talents: this is the second division. From the
      Hellespontians who dwell on the right as one sails in and the Phrygians
      and the Thracians who dwell in Asia and the Paphlagonians and Mariandynoi
      and Syrians <a href="#link32Hnote-77" id="link32noteref-77" class="pginternal">77</a> the tribute was three hundred and sixty
      talents: this is the third division. From the Kilikians, besides three
      hundred and sixty white horses, one for every day in the year, there came
      also five hundred talents of silver; of these one hundred and forty
      talents were spent upon the horsemen which served as a guard to the
      Kilikian land, and the remaining three hundred and sixty came in year by
      year to Dareios: this is the fourth division.
    </p>
<p>
      91. From that division which begins with the city of Posideion, founded by
      Amphilochos the son of Amphiaraos on the borders of the Kilikians and the
      Syrians, and extends as far as Egypt, not including the territory of the
      Arabians (for this was free from payment), the amount was three hundred
      and fifty talents; and in this division are the whole of Phenicia and
      Syria which is called Palestine and Cyprus: this is the fifth division.
      From Egypt and the Libyans bordering upon Egypt, and from Kyrene and
      Barca, for these were so ordered as to belong to the Egyptian division,
      there came in seven hundred talents, without reckoning the money produced
      by the lake of Moiris, that is to say from the fish; <a href="#link32Hnote-7701" id="link32noteref-7701" class="pginternal">7701</a>
      without reckoning this, I say, or the corn which was contributed in
      addition by measure, there came in seven hundred talents; for as regards
      the corn, they contribute by measure one hundred and twenty thousand <a href="#link32Hnote-78" id="link32noteref-78" class="pginternal">78</a>
      bushels for the use of those Persians who are established in the "White
      Fortress" at Memphis, and for their foreign mercenaries: this is the sixth
      division. The Sattagydai and Gandarians and Dadicans and Aparytai, being
      joined together, brought in one hundred and seventy talents: this is the
      seventh division. From Susa and the rest of the land of the Kissians there
      came in three hundred: this is the eighth division.
    </p>
<p>
      92. From Babylon and from the rest of Assyria there came in to him a
      thousand talents of silver and five hundred boys for eunuchs: this is the
      ninth division. From Agbatana and from the rest of Media and the
      Paricanians and Orthocorybantians, four hundred and fifty talents: this is
      the tenth division. The Caspians and Pausicans <a href="#link32Hnote-79" id="link32noteref-79" class="pginternal">79</a> and Pantimathoi and
      Dareitai, contributing together, brought in two hundred talents: this is
      the eleventh division. From the Bactrians as far as the Aigloi the tribute
      was three hundred and sixty talents: this is the twelfth division.
    </p>
<p>
      93. From Pactyïke and the Armenians and the people bordering upon them as
      far as the Euxine, four hundred talents: this is the thirteenth division.
      From the Sagartians and Sarangians and Thamanaians and Utians and Mycans
      and those who dwell in the islands of the Erythraian Sea, where the king
      settles those who are called the "Removed," <a href="#link32Hnote-80" id="link32noteref-80" class="pginternal">80</a> from all these
      together a tribute was produced of six hundred talents: this is the
      fourteenth division. The Sacans and the Caspians <a href="#link32Hnote-81" id="link32noteref-81" class="pginternal">81</a> brought in two
      hundred and fifty talents: this is the fifteenth division. The Parthians
      and Chorasmians and Sogdians and Areians three hundred talents: this is
      the sixteenth division.
    </p>
<p>
      94. The Paricanians and Ethiopians in Asia brought in four hundred
      talents: this is the seventeenth division. To the Matienians and
      Saspeirians and Alarodians was appointed a tribute of two hundred talents:
      this is the eighteenth division. To the Moschoi and Tibarenians and
      Macronians and Mossynoicoi and Mares three hundred talents were ordered:
      this is the nineteenth division. Of the Indians the number is far greater
      than that of any other race of men of whom we know; and they brought in a
      tribute larger than all the rest, that is to say three hundred and sixty
      talents of gold-dust: this is the twentieth division.
    </p>
<p>
      95. Now if we compare Babylonian with Euboïc talents, the silver is found
      to amount to nine thousand eight hundred and eighty <a href="#link32Hnote-82" id="link32noteref-82" class="pginternal">82</a>
      talents; and if we reckon the gold at thirteen times the value of silver,
      weight for weight, the gold-dust is found to amount to four thousand six
      hundred and eighty Euboïc talents. These being all added together, the
      total which was collected as yearly tribute for Dareios amounts to
      fourteen thousand five hundred and sixty Euboïc talents: the sums which
      are less than these <a href="#link32Hnote-83" id="link32noteref-83" class="pginternal">83</a> I pass over and do not mention.
    </p>
<p>
      96. This was the tribute which came in to Dareios from Asia and from a
      small part of Libya: but as time went on, other tribute came in also from
      the islands and from those who dwell in Europe as far as Thessaly. This
      tribute the king stores up in his treasury in the following manner:—he
      melts it down and pours it into jars of earthenware, and when he has
      filled the jars he takes off the earthenware jar from the metal; and when
      he wants money he cuts off so much as he needs on each occasion.
    </p>
<p>
      97. These were the provinces and the assessments of tribute: and the
      Persian land alone has not been mentioned by me as paying a contribution,
      for the Persians have their land to dwell in free from payment. The
      following moreover had no tribute fixed for them to pay, but brought
      gifts, namely the Ethiopians who border upon Egypt, whom Cambyses subdued
      as he marched against the Long-lived Ethiopians, those <a href="#link32Hnote-84" id="link32noteref-84" class="pginternal">84</a>
      who dwell about Nysa, which is called "sacred," and who celebrate the
      festivals in honour of Dionysos: these Ethiopians and those who dwell near
      them have the same kind of seed as the Callantian Indians, and they have
      underground dwellings. <a href="#link32Hnote-85" id="link32noteref-85" class="pginternal">85</a> These both together brought every other year,
      and continue to bring even to my own time, two quart measures <a href="#link32Hnote-86" id="link32noteref-86" class="pginternal">86</a>
      of unmelted gold and two hundred blocks of ebony and five Ethiopian boys
      and twenty large elephant tusks. The Colchians also had set themselves
      among those who brought gifts, and with them those who border upon them
      extending as far as the range of the Caucasus (for the Persian rule
      extends as far as these mountains, but those who dwell in the parts beyond
      Caucasus toward the North Wind regard the Persians no longer),—these,
      I say, continued to bring the gifts which they had fixed for themselves
      every four years <a href="#link32Hnote-87" id="link32noteref-87" class="pginternal">87</a> even down to my own time, that is to say, a
      hundred boys and a hundred maidens. Finally, the Arabians brought a
      thousand talents of frankincense every year. Such were the gifts which
      these brought to the king apart from the tribute.
    </p>
<p>
      98. Now this great quantity of gold, out of which the Indians bring in to
      the king the gold-dust which has been mentioned, is obtained by them in a
      manner which I shall tell:—That part of the Indian land which is
      towards the rising sun is sand; for of all the peoples in Asia of which we
      know or about which any certain report is given, the Indians dwell
      furthest away towards the East and the sunrising; seeing that the country
      to the East of the Indians is desert on account of the sand. Now there are
      many tribes of Indians, and they do not agree with one another in
      language; and some of them are pastoral and others not so, and some dwell
      in the swamps of the river <a href="#link32Hnote-88" id="link32noteref-88" class="pginternal">88</a> and feed upon raw
      fish, which they catch by fishing from boats made of cane; and each boat
      is made of one joint of cane. These Indians of which I speak wear clothing
      made of rushes: they gather and cut the rushes from the river and then
      weave them together into a kind of mat and put it on like a corslet.
    </p>
<p>
      99. Others of the Indians, dwelling to the East of these, are pastoral and
      eat raw flesh: these are called Padaians, and they practise the following
      customs:—whenever any of their tribe falls ill, whether it be a
      woman or a man, if a man then the men who are his nearest associates put
      him to death, saying that he is wasting away with the disease and his
      flesh is being spoilt for them: <a href="#link32Hnote-89" id="link32noteref-89" class="pginternal">89</a> and meanwhile he
      denies stoutly and says that he is not ill, but they do not agree with
      him; and after they have killed him they feast upon his flesh: but if it
      be a woman who falls ill, the women who are her greatest intimates do to
      her in the same manner as the men do in the other case. For <a href="#link32Hnote-90" id="link32noteref-90" class="pginternal">90</a>
      in fact even if a man has come to old age they slay him and feast upon
      him; but very few of them come to be reckoned as old, for they kill every
      one who falls into sickness, before he reaches old age.
    </p>
<p>
      100. Other Indians have on the contrary a manner of life as follows:—they
      neither kill any living thing nor do they sow any crops nor is it their
      custom to possess houses; but they feed on herbs, and they have a grain of
      the size of millet, in a sheath, which grows of itself from the ground;
      this they gather and boil with the sheath, and make it their food: and
      whenever any of them falls into sickness, he goes to the desert country
      and lies there, and none of them pay any attention either to one who is
      dead or to one who is sick.
    </p>
<p>
      101. The sexual intercourse of all these Indians of whom I have spoken is
      open like that of cattle, and they have all one colour of skin, resembling
      that of the Ethiopians: moreover the seed which they emit is not white
      like that of other races, but black like their skin; and the Ethiopians
      also are similar in this respect. These tribes of Indians dwell further
      off than the Persian power extends, and towards the South Wind, and they
      never became subjects of Dareios.
    </p>
<p>
      102. Others however of the Indians are on the borders of the city of
      Caspatyros and the country of Pactyïke, dwelling towards the North <a href="#link32Hnote-91" id="link32noteref-91" class="pginternal">91</a>
      of the other Indians; and they have a manner of living nearly the same as
      that of the Bactrians: these are the most warlike of the Indians, and
      these are they who make expeditions for the gold. For in the parts where
      they live it is desert on account of the sand; and in this desert and
      sandy tract are produced ants, which are in size smaller than dogs but
      larger than foxes, for <a href="#link32Hnote-92" id="link32noteref-92" class="pginternal">92</a> there are some of them kept at the residence
      of the king of Persia, which are caught here. These ants then make their
      dwelling under ground and carry up the sand just in the same manner as the
      ants found in the land of the Hellenes, which they themselves <a href="#link32Hnote-93" id="link32noteref-93" class="pginternal">93</a>
      also very much resemble in form; and the sand which is brought up contains
      gold. To obtain this sand the Indians make expeditions into the desert,
      each one having yoked together three camels, placing a female in the
      middle and a male like a trace-horse to draw by each side. On this female
      he mounts himself, having arranged carefully that she shall be taken to be
      yoked from young ones, the more lately born the better. For their female
      camels are not inferior to horses in speed, and moreover they are much
      more capable of bearing weights.
    </p>
<p>
      103. As to the form of the camel, I do not here describe it, since the
      Hellenes for whom I write are already acquainted with it, but I shall tell
      that which is not commonly known about it, which is this:—the camel
      has in the hind legs four thighs and four knees, <a href="#link32Hnote-94" id="link32noteref-94" class="pginternal">94</a> and its organs of
      generation are between the hind legs, turned towards the tail.
    </p>
<p>
      104. The Indians, I say, ride out to get the gold in the manner and with
      the kind of yoking which I have described, making calculations so that
      they may be engaged in carrying it off at the time when the greatest heat
      prevails; for the heat causes the ants to disappear underground. Now among
      these nations the sun is hottest in the morning hours, not at midday as
      with others, but from sunrise to the time of closing the market: and
      during this time it produces much greater heat than at midday in Hellas,
      so that it is said that then they drench themselves with water. Midday
      however has about equal degree of heat with the Indians as with other men,
      while after midday their sun becomes like the morning sun with other men,
      and after this, as it goes further away, it produces still greater
      coolness, until at last at sunset it makes the air very cool indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      105. When the Indians have come to the place with bags, they fill them
      with the sand and ride away back as quickly as they can, for forthwith the
      ants, perceiving, as the Persians allege, by the smell, begin to pursue
      them: and this animal, they say, is superior to every other creature in
      swiftness, so that unless the Indians got a start in their course, while
      the ants were gathering together, not one of them would escape. So then
      the male camels, for they are inferior in speed of running to the females,
      if they drag behind are even let loose <a href="#link32Hnote-95" id="link32noteref-95" class="pginternal">95</a> from the side of the
      female, one after the other; <a href="#link32Hnote-96" id="link32noteref-96" class="pginternal">96</a> the females however,
      remembering the young which they left behind, do not show any slackness in
      their course. <a href="#link32Hnote-97" id="link32noteref-97" class="pginternal">97</a> Thus it is that the Indians get most part of
      the gold, as the Persians say; there is however other gold also in their
      land obtained by digging, but in smaller quantities.
    </p>
<p>
      106. It seems indeed that the extremities of the inhabited world had
      allotted to them by nature the fairest things, just as it was the lot of
      Hellas to have its seasons far more fairly tempered than other lands: for
      first, India is the most distant of inhabited lands towards the East, as I
      have said a little above, and in this land not only the animals, birds as
      well as four-footed beasts, are much larger than in other places (except
      the horses, which are surpassed by those of Media called Nessaian), but
      also there is gold in abundance there, some got by digging, some brought
      down by rivers, and some carried off as I explained just now: and there
      also the trees which grow wild produce wool which surpasses in beauty and
      excellence that from sheep, and the Indians wear clothing obtained from
      these trees.
    </p>
<p>
      107. Then again Arabia is the furthest of inhabited lands in the direction
      of the midday, and in it alone of all lands grow frankincense and myrrh
      and cassia and cinnamon and gum-mastich. All these except myrrh are got
      with difficulty by the Arabians. Frankincense they collect by burning the
      storax, which is brought thence to the Hellenes by the Phenicians, by
      burning this, I say, so as to produce smoke they take it; for these trees
      which produce frankincense are guarded by winged serpents, small in size
      and of various colours, which watch in great numbers about each tree, of
      the same kind as those which attempt to invade Egypt: <a href="#link32Hnote-9701" id="link32noteref-9701" class="pginternal">9701</a>
      and they cannot be driven away from the trees by any other thing but only
      the smoke of storax.
    </p>
<p>
      108. The Arabians say also that all the world would have been by this time
      filled with these serpents, if that did not happen with regard to them
      which I knew happened with regard to vipers: and it seems that the Divine
      Providence, as indeed was to be expected, seeing that it is wise, has made
      all those animals prolific which are of cowardly spirit and good for food,
      in order that they may not be all eaten up and their race fail, whereas it
      has made those which are bold and noxious to have small progeny. For
      example, because the hare is hunted by every beast and bird as well as by
      man, therefore it is so very prolific as it is: and this is the only one
      of all beasts which becomes pregnant again before the former young are
      born, and has in its womb some of its young covered with fur and others
      bare; and while one is just being shaped in the matrix, another is being
      conceived. Thus it is in this case; whereas the lioness, which is the
      strongest and most courageous of creatures, produces one cub once only in
      her life; for when she produces young she casts out her womb together with
      her young; and the cause of it is this:—when the cub being within
      the mother <a href="#link32Hnote-98" id="link32noteref-98" class="pginternal">98</a> begins to move about, then having claws by
      far sharper than those of any other beast he tears the womb, and as he
      grows larger he proceeds much further in his scratching: at last the time
      of birth approaches and there is now nothing at all left of it in a sound
      condition.
    </p>
<p>
      109. Just so also, if vipers and the winged serpents of the Arabians were
      produced in the ordinary course of their nature, man would not be able to
      live upon the earth; but as it is, when they couple with one another and
      the male is in the act of generation, as he lets go from him the seed, the
      female seizes hold of his neck, and fastening on to it does not relax her
      hold till she has eaten it through. The male then dies in the manner which
      I have said, but the female pays the penalty of retribution for the male
      in this manner:—the young while they are still in the womb take
      vengeance for their father by eating through their mother, <a href="#link32Hnote-99" id="link32noteref-99" class="pginternal">99</a>
      and having eaten through her belly they thus make their way out for
      themselves. Other serpents however, which are not hurtful to man, produce
      eggs and hatch from them a very large number of offspring. Now vipers are
      distributed over all the earth; but the others, which are winged, are
      found in great numbers together in Arabia and in no other land: therefore
      it is that they appear to be numerous.
    </p>
<p>
      110. This frankincense then is obtained thus by the Arabians; and cassia
      is obtained as follows:—they bind up in cows'-hide and other kinds
      of skins all their body and their face except only the eyes, and then go
      to get the cassia. This grows in a pool not very deep, and round the pool
      and in it lodge, it seems, winged beasts nearly resembling bats, and they
      squeak horribly and are courageous in fight. These they must keep off from
      their eyes, and so cut the cassia.
    </p>
<p>
      111. Cinnamon they collect in a yet more marvellous manner than this: for
      where it grows and what land produces it they are not able to tell, except
      only that some say (and it is a probable account) that it grows in those
      regions where Dionysos was brought up; and they say that large birds carry
      those dried sticks which we have learnt from the Phenicians to call
      cinnamon, carry them, I say, to nests which are made of clay and stuck on
      to precipitous sides of mountains, which man can find no means of scaling.
      With regard to this then the Arabians practise the following contrivance:—they
      divide up the limbs of the oxen and asses that die and of their other
      beasts of burden, into pieces as large as convenient, and convey them to
      these places, and when they have laid them down not far from the nests,
      they withdraw to a distance from them: and the birds fly down and carry
      the limbs <a href="#link32Hnote-100" id="link32noteref-100" class="pginternal">100</a> of the beasts of burden off to their nests;
      and these are not able to bear them, but break down and fall to the earth;
      and the men come up to them and collect the cinnamon. Thus cinnamon is
      collected and comes from this nation to the other countries of the world.
    </p>
<p>
      112. Gum-mastich however, which the Arabians call <i>ladanon</i>, comes in
      a still more extraordinary manner; for though it is the most sweet-scented
      of all things, it comes in the most evil-scented thing, since it is found
      in the beards of he-goats, produced there like resin from wood: this is of
      use for the making of many perfumes, and the Arabians use it more than
      anything else as incense.
    </p>
<p>
      113. Let what we have said suffice with regard to spices; and from the
      land of Arabia there blows a scent of them most marvellously sweet. They
      have also two kinds of sheep which are worthy of admiration and are not
      found in any other land: the one kind has the tail long, not less than
      three cubits in length; and if one should allow these to drag these after
      them, they would have sores <a href="#link32Hnote-101" id="link32noteref-101" class="pginternal">101</a> from their tails
      being worn away against the ground; but as it is, every one of the
      shepherds knows enough of carpentering to make little cars, which they tie
      under the tails, fastening the tail of each animal to a separate little
      car. The other kind of sheep has the tail broad, even as much as a cubit
      in breadth.
    </p>
<p>
      114. As one passes beyond the place of the midday, the Ethiopian land is
      that which extends furthest of all inhabited lands towards the sunset.
      This produces both gold in abundance and huge elephants and trees of all
      kinds growing wild and ebony, and men who are of all men the tallest, the
      most beautiful and the most long-lived.
    </p>
<p>
      115. These are the extremities in Asia and in Libya; but as to the
      extremities of Europe towards the West, I am not able to speak with
      certainty: for neither do I accept the tale that there is a river called
      in Barbarian tongue Eridanos, flowing into the sea which lies towards the
      North Wind, whence it is said that amber comes; nor do I know of the real
      existence of "Tin Islands" <a href="#link32Hnote-102" id="link32noteref-102" class="pginternal">102</a> from which tin <a href="#link32Hnote-103" id="link32noteref-103" class="pginternal">103</a>
      comes to us: for first the name Eridanos itself declares that it is
      Hellenic and that it does not belong to a Barbarian speech, but was
      invented by some poet; and secondly I am not able to hear from any one who
      has been an eye-witness, though I took pains to discover this, that there
      is a sea on the other side of Europe. However that may be, tin and amber
      certainly come to us from the extremity of Europe.
    </p>
<p>
      116. Then again towards the North of Europe, there is evidently a quantity
      of gold by far larger than in any other land: as to how it is got, here
      again I am not able to say for certain, but it is said to be carried off
      from the griffins by Arimaspians, a one-eyed race of men. <a href="#link32Hnote-104" id="link32noteref-104" class="pginternal">104</a>
      But I do not believe this tale either, that nature produces one-eyed men
      which in all other respects are like other men. However, it would seem
      that the extremities which bound the rest of the world on every side and
      enclose it in the midst, possess the things which by us are thought to be
      the most beautiful and the most rare.
    </p>
<p>
      117. Now there is a plain in Asia bounded by mountains on all sides, and
      through the mountains there are five clefts. This plain belonged once to
      the Chorasmians, and it lies on the borders of the Chorasmians themselves,
      the Hyrcanians, Parthians, Sarangians, and Thamanaians; but from the time
      that the Persians began to bear rule it belongs to the king. From this
      enclosing mountain of which I speak there flows a great river, and its
      name is Akes. This formerly watered the lands of these nations which have
      been mentioned, being divided into five streams and conducted through a
      separate cleft in the mountains to each separate nation; but from the time
      that they have come to be under the Persians they have suffered as
      follows:—the king built up the clefts in the mountains and set gates
      at each cleft; and so, since the water has been shut off from its outlet,
      the plain within the mountains is made into a sea, because the river runs
      into it and has no way out in any direction. Those therefore who in former
      times had been wont to make use of the water, not being able now to make
      use of it are in great trouble: for during the winter they have rain from
      heaven, as also other men have, but in the summer they desire to use the
      water when they sow millet and sesame seed. So then, the water not being
      granted to them, they come to the Persians both themselves and their
      wives, and standing at the gates of the king's court they cry and howl;
      and the king orders that for those who need it most, the gates which lead
      to their land shall be opened; and when their land has become satiated
      with drinking in the water, these gates are closed, and he orders the
      gates to be opened for others, that is to say those most needing it of the
      rest who remain: and, as I have heard, he exacts large sums of money for
      opening them, besides the regular tribute.
    </p>
<p>
      118. Thus it is with these matters: but of the seven men who had risen
      against the Magian, it happened to one, namely Intaphrenes, to be put to
      death immediately after their insurrection for an outrage which I shall
      relate. He desired to enter into the king's palace and confer with the
      king; for the law was in fact so, that those who had risen up against the
      Magian were permitted to go in to the king's presence without any one to
      announce them, unless the king happened to be lying with his wife.
      Accordingly Intaphrenes did not think it fit that any one should announce
      his coming; but as he was one of the seven, he desired to enter. The
      gatekeeper however and the bearer of messages endeavoured to prevent him,
      saying that the king was lying with his wife: but Intaphrenes believing
      that they were not speaking the truth, drew his sword <a href="#link32Hnote-105" id="link32noteref-105" class="pginternal">105</a>
      and cut off their ears and their noses, and stringing these upon his
      horse's bridle he tied them round their necks and so let them go.
    </p>
<p>
      119. Upon this they showed themselves to the king and told the cause for
      which they had suffered this; and Dareios, fearing that the six might have
      done this by common design, sent for each one separately and made trial of
      his inclinations, as to whether he approved of that which had been done:
      and when he was fully assured that Intaphrenes had not done this in
      combination with them, he took both Intaphrenes himself and his sons and
      all his kinsmen, being much disposed to believe that he was plotting
      insurrection against him with the help of his relations; and having seized
      them he put them in bonds as for execution. Then the wife of Intaphrenes,
      coming constantly to the doors of the king's court, wept and bewailed
      herself; and by doing this continually after the same manner she moved
      Dareios to pity her. Accordingly he sent a messenger and said to her:
      "Woman, king Dareios grants to thee to save from death one of thy kinsmen
      who are lying in bonds, whomsoever thou desirest of them all." She then,
      having considered with herself, answered thus: "If in truth the king
      grants me the life of one, I choose of them all my brother." Dareios being
      informed of this, and marvelling at her speech, sent and addressed her
      thus: "Woman, the king asks thee what was in thy mind, that thou didst
      leave thy husband and thy children to die, and didst choose thy brother to
      survive, seeing that he is surely less near to thee in blood than thy
      children, and less dear to thee than thy husband." She made answer: "O
      king, I might, if heaven willed, have another husband and other children,
      if I should lose these; but another brother I could by no means have,
      seeing that my father and my mother are no longer alive. This was in my
      mind when I said those words." To Dareios then it seemed that the woman
      had spoken well, and he let go not only him for whose life she asked, but
      also the eldest of her sons because he was pleased with her: but all the
      others he slew. One therefore of the seven had perished immediately in the
      manner which has been related.
    </p>
<p>
      120. Now about the time of the sickness of Cambyses it had come to pass as
      follows:—There was one Oroites, a Persian, who had been appointed by
      Cyrus to be governor of the province of Sardis. <a href="#link32Hnote-106" id="link32noteref-106" class="pginternal">106</a> This man had set
      his desire upon an unholy thing; for though from Polycrates the Samian he
      had never suffered anything nor heard any offensive word nor even seen him
      before that time, he desired to take him and put him to death for a reason
      of this kind, as most who report the matter say:—while Oroites and
      another Persian whose name was Mitrobates, ruler of the province of
      Daskyleion, <a href="#link32Hnote-107" id="link32noteref-107" class="pginternal">107</a> were sitting at the door of the king's
      court, they came from words to strife with one another; and as they
      debated their several claims to excellence, Mitrobates taunting Oroites
      said: "Dost <i>thou</i> <a href="#link32Hnote-108" id="link32noteref-108" class="pginternal">108</a> count thyself a man, who didst never yet
      win for the king the island of Samos, which lies close to thy province,
      when it is so exceedingly easy of conquest that one of the natives of it
      rose up against the government with fifteen men-at-arms and got possession
      of the island, and is now despot of it?" Some say that because he heard
      this and was stung by the reproach, he formed the desire, not so much to
      take vengeance on him who said this, as to bring Polycrates to destruction
      at all costs, since by reason of him he was ill spoken of:
    </p>
<p>
      121, the lesser number however of those who tell the tale say that Oroites
      sent a herald to Samos to ask for something or other, but what it was is
      not mentioned; and Polycrates happened to be lying down in the men's
      chamber <a href="#link32Hnote-109" id="link32noteref-109" class="pginternal">109</a> of his palace, and Anacreon also of Teos
      was present with him: and somehow, whether it was by intention and because
      he made no account of the business of Oroites, or whether some chance
      occurred to bring it about, it happened that the envoy of Oroites came
      into his presence and spoke with him, and Polycrates, who chanced to be
      turned away <a href="#link32Hnote-110" id="link32noteref-110" class="pginternal">110</a> towards the wall, neither turned round at
      all nor made any answer.
    </p>
<p>
      122. The cause then of the death of Polycrates is reported in these two
      different ways, and we may believe whichever of them we please. Oroites
      however, having his residence at that Magnesia which is situated upon the
      river Maiander, sent Myrsos the son of Gyges, a Lydian, to Samos bearing a
      message, since he had perceived the designs of Polycrates. For Polycrates
      was the first of the Hellenes of whom we have any knowledge, who set his
      mind upon having command of the sea, excepting Minos the Cnossian and any
      other who may have had command of the sea before his time. Of that which
      we call mortal race Polycrates was the first; and he had great expectation
      of becoming ruler of Ionia and of the islands. Oroites accordingly, having
      perceived that he had this design, sent a message to him and said thus:
      "Oroites to Polycrates saith as follows: I hear that thou art making plans
      to get great power, and that thou hast not wealth according to thy high
      thoughts. Now therefore if thou shalt do as I shall say, thou wilt do well
      for thyself on the one hand, and also save me from destruction: for king
      Cambyses is planning death for me, and this is reported to me so that I
      cannot doubt it. Do thou then carry away out of danger both myself and
      with me my wealth; and of this keep a part for thyself and a part let me
      keep, and then so far as wealth may bring it about, thou shalt be ruler of
      all Hellas. And if thou dost not believe that which I say about the money,
      send some one, whosoever happens to be most trusted by thee, and to him I
      will show it."
    </p>
<p>
      123. Polycrates having heard this rejoiced, and was disposed to agree; and
      as he had a great desire, it seems, for wealth, he first sent Maiandrios
      the son of Maiandrios, a native of Samos who was his secretary, to see it:
      this man was the same who not long after these events dedicated all the
      ornaments of the men's chamber in the palace of Polycrates, ornaments well
      worth seeing, as an offering to the temple of Hera. Oroites accordingly,
      having heard that the person sent to examine might be expected soon to
      come, did as follows, that is to say, he filled eight chests with stones
      except a small depth at the very top of each, and laid gold above upon the
      stones; then he tied up the chests and kept them in readiness. So
      Maiandrios came and looked at them and brought back word to Polycrates:
    </p>
<p>
      124, and he upon that prepared to set out thither, although the diviners
      and also his friends strongly dissuaded him from it, and in spite moreover
      of a vision which his daughter had seen in sleep of this kind,—it
      seemed to her that her father was raised up on high and was bathed by Zeus
      and anointed by the Sun. Having seen this vision, she used every kind of
      endeavour to dissuade Polycrates from leaving his land to go to Oroites,
      and besides that, as he was going to his fifty-oared galley she
      accompanied his departure with prophetic words: and he threatened her that
      if he should return safe, she should remain unmarried for long; but she
      prayed that this might come to pass, for she desired rather, she said, to
      be unmarried for long than to be an orphan, having lost her father.
    </p>
<p>
      125. Polycrates however neglected every counsel and set sail to go to
      Oroites, taking with him, besides many others of his friends, Demokedes
      also the son of Calliphon, a man of Croton, who was a physician and
      practised his art better than any other man of his time. Then when he
      arrived at Magnesia, Polycrates was miserably put to death in a manner
      unworthy both of himself and of his high ambition: for excepting those who
      become despots of the Syracusans, not one besides of the Hellenic despots
      is worthy to be compared with Polycrates in magnificence. And when he had
      killed him in a manner not fit to be told, Oroites impaled his body: and
      of those who accompanied him, as many as were Samians he released, bidding
      them be grateful to him that they were free men; but all those of his
      company who were either allies or servants, he held in the estimation of
      slaves and kept them. Polycrates then being hung up accomplished wholly
      the vision of his daughter, for he was bathed by Zeus whenever it rained,
      <a href="#link32Hnote-11001" id="link32noteref-11001" class="pginternal">11001</a> and anointed by the Sun, giving forth
      moisture himself from his body.
    </p>
<p>
      126. To this end came the great prosperity of Polycrates, as Amasis the
      king of Egypt had foretold to him: <a href="#link32Hnote-111" id="link32noteref-111" class="pginternal">111</a> but not long
      afterwards retribution overtook Oroites in his turn for the murder of
      Polycrates. For after the death of Cambyses and the reign of the Magians
      Oroites remained at Sardis and did no service to the Persians, when they
      had been deprived of their empire by the Medes; moreover during this time
      of disturbance he slew Mitrobates the governor in Daskyleion, who had
      brought up against him the matter of Polycrates as a reproach; and he slew
      also Cranaspes the son of Mitrobates, both men of repute among the
      Persians: and besides other various deeds of insolence, once when a bearer
      of messages had come to him from Dareios, not being pleased with the
      message which he brought he slew him as he was returning, having set men
      to lie in wait for him by the way; and having slain him he made away with
      the bodies both of the man and of his horse.
    </p>
<p>
      127. Dareios accordingly, when he had come to the throne, was desirous of
      taking vengeance upon Oroites for all his wrongdoings and especially for
      the murder of Mitrobates and his son. However he did not think it good to
      act openly and to send an army against him, since his own affairs were
      still in a disturbed state <a href="#link32Hnote-112" id="link32noteref-112" class="pginternal">112</a> and he had only
      lately come to the throne, while he heard that the strength of Oroites was
      great, seeing that he had a bodyguard of a thousand Persian spearmen and
      was in possession of the divisions <a href="#link32Hnote-113" id="link32noteref-113" class="pginternal">113</a> of Phrygia and
      Lydia and Ionia. Therefore Dareios contrived as follows:—having
      called together those of the Persians who were of most repute, he said to
      them: "Persians, which of you all will undertake to perform this matter
      for me with wisdom, and not by force or with tumult? for where wisdom is
      wanted, there is no need of force. Which of you, I say, will either bring
      Oroites alive to me or slay him? for he never yet did any service to the
      Persians, and on the other hand he has done to them great evil. First he
      destroyed two of us, Mitrobates and his son; then he slays the men who go
      to summon him, sent by me, displaying insolence not to be endured. Before
      therefore he shall accomplish any other evil against the Persians, we must
      check his course by death."
    </p>
<p>
      128. Thus Dareios asked, and thirty men undertook the matter, each one
      separately desiring to do it himself; and Dareios stopped their contention
      and bade them cast lots: so when they cast lots, Bagaios the son of
      Artontes obtained the lot from among them all. Bagaios accordingly, having
      obtained the lot, did thus:—he wrote many papers dealing with
      various matters and on them set the seal of Dareios, and with them he went
      to Sardis. When he arrived there and came into the presence of Oroites, he
      took the covers off the papers one after another and gave them to the
      Royal Secretary to read; for all the governors of provinces have Royal
      Secretaries. Now Bagaios thus gave the papers in order to make trial of
      the spearmen of the guard, whether they would accept the motion to revolt
      from Oroites; and seeing that they paid great reverence to the papers and
      still more to the words which were recited from them, he gave another
      paper in which were contained these words: "Persians, king Dareios forbids
      you to serve as guards to Oroites": and they hearing this lowered to him
      the points of their spears. Then Bagaios, seeing that in this they were
      obedient to the paper, took courage upon that and gave the last of the
      papers to the secretary; and in it was written: "King Dareios commands the
      Persians who are in Sardis to slay Oroites." So the spearmen of the guard,
      when they heard this, drew their swords and slew him forthwith. Thus did
      retribution for the murder of Polycrates the Samian overtake Oroites.
    </p>
<p>
      129. When the wealth of Oroites had come or had been carried <a href="#link32Hnote-114" id="link32noteref-114" class="pginternal">114</a>
      up to Susa, it happened not long after, that king Dareios while engaged in
      hunting wild beasts twisted his foot in leaping off his horse, and it was
      twisted, as it seems, rather violently, for the ball of his ankle-joint
      was put out of the socket. Now he had been accustomed to keep about him
      those of the Egyptians who were accounted the first in the art of
      medicine, and he made use of their assistance then: but these by wrenching
      and forcing the foot made the evil continually greater. For seven days
      then and seven nights Dareios was sleepless owing to the pain which he
      suffered; and at last on the eighth day, when he was in a wretched state,
      some one who had heard talk before while yet at Sardis of the skill of
      Demokedes of Croton, reported this to Dareios; and he bade them bring him
      forthwith into his presence. So having found him somewhere unnoticed among
      the slaves of Oroites, they brought him forth into the midst dragging
      fetters after him and clothed in rags.
    </p>
<p>
      130. When he had been placed in the midst of them, Dareios asked him
      whether he understood the art; but he would not admit it, fearing lest, if
      he declared himself to be what he was, he might lose for ever the hope of
      returning to Hellas: and it was clear to Dareios that he understood that
      art but was practising another, <a href="#link32Hnote-115" id="link32noteref-115" class="pginternal">115</a> and he commanded
      those who had brought him thither to produce scourges and pricks.
      Accordingly upon that he spoke out, saying that he did not understand it
      precisely, but that he had kept company with a physician and had some poor
      knowledge of the art. Then after this, when Dareios had committed the case
      to him, by using Hellenic drugs and applying mild remedies after the
      former violent means, he caused him to get sleep, and in a short time made
      him perfectly well, though he had never hoped to be sound of foot again.
      Upon this Dareios presented him with two pairs of golden fetters; and he
      asked him whether it was by design that he had given to him a double share
      of his suffering, because he had made him well. Being pleased by this
      saying, Dareios sent him to visit his wives, and the eunuchs in bringing
      him in said to the women that this was he who had restored to the king his
      life. Then each one of them plunged a cup into the gold-chest <a href="#link32Hnote-116" id="link32noteref-116" class="pginternal">116</a>
      and presented Demokedes with so abundant a gift that his servant, whose
      name was Skiton, following and gathering up the coins <a href="#link32Hnote-117" id="link32noteref-117" class="pginternal">117</a>
      which fell from the cups, collected for himself a very large sum of gold.
    </p>
<p>
      131. This Demokedes came from Croton, and became the associate of
      Polycrates in the following manner:—at Croton he lived in strife
      with his father, who was of a harsh temper, and when he could no longer
      endure him, he departed and came to Egina. Being established there he
      surpassed in the first year all the other physicians, although he was
      without appliances and had none of the instruments which are used in the
      art. In the next year the Eginetan State engaged him for a payment of one
      talent, in the third year he was engaged by the Athenians for a hundred
      pounds weight of silver, <a href="#link32Hnote-118" id="link32noteref-118" class="pginternal">118</a> and in the fourth
      by Polycrates for two talents. Thus he arrived in Samos; and it was by
      reason of this man more than anything else that the physicians of Croton
      got their reputation: for this event happened at the time when the
      physicians of Croton began to be spoken of as the first in Hellas, while
      the Kyrenians were reputed to have the second place. About this same time
      also the Argives had the reputation of being the first musicians in
      Hellas. <a href="#link32Hnote-119" id="link32noteref-119" class="pginternal">119</a>
</p>
<p>
      132. Then Demokedes having healed king Dareios had a very great house in
      Susa, and had been made a table-companion of the king; and except the one
      thing of returning to the land of the Hellenes, he had everything. And
      first as regards the Egyptian physicians who tried to heal the king before
      him, when they were about to be impaled because they had proved inferior
      to a physician who was a Hellene, he asked their lives of the king and
      rescued them from death: then secondly, he rescued an Eleian prophet, who
      had accompanied Polycrates and had remained unnoticed among the slaves. In
      short Demokedes was very great in the favour of the king.
    </p>
<p>
      133. Not long time after this another thing came to pass which was this:—Atossa
      the daughter of Cyrus and wife of Dareios had a tumour upon her breast,
      which afterwards burst and then was spreading further: and so long as it
      was not large, she concealed it and said nothing to anybody, because she
      was ashamed; but afterwards when she was in evil case, she sent for
      Demokedes and showed it to him: and he said that he would make her well,
      and caused her to swear that she would surely do for him in return that
      which he should ask of her; and he would ask, he said, none of such things
      as are shameful.
    </p>
<p>
      134. So when after this by his treatment he had made her well, then Atossa
      instructed by Demokedes uttered to Dareios in his bedchamber some such
      words as these: "O king, though thou hast such great power, thou dost sit
      still, and dost not win in addition any nation or power for the Persians:
      and yet it is reasonable that a man who is both young and master of much
      wealth should be seen to perform some great deed, in order that the
      Persians may know surely that he is a man by whom they are ruled. It is
      expedient indeed in two ways that thou shouldest do so, both in order that
      the Persians may know that their ruler is a man, and in order that they
      may be worn down by war and not have leisure to plot against thee. For now
      thou mightest display some great deed, while thou art still young; seeing
      that as the body grows the spirit grows old also with it, and is blunted
      for every kind of action." Thus she spoke according to instructions
      received, and he answered thus: "Woman, thou hast said all the things
      which I myself have in mind to do; for I have made the plan to yoke
      together a bridge from this continent to the other and to make expedition
      against the Scythians, and these designs will be by way of being fulfilled
      within a little time." Then Atossa said: "Look now,—forbear to go
      first against the Scythians, for these will be in thy power whenever thou
      desirest: but do thou, I pray thee, make an expedition against Hellas; for
      I am desirous to have Lacedemonian women and Argive and Athenian and
      Corinthian, for attendants, because I hear of them by report: and thou
      hast the man who of all men is most fitted to show thee all things which
      relate to Hellas and to be thy guide, that man, I mean, who healed thy
      foot." Dareios made answer: "Woman, since it seems good to thee that we
      should first make trial of Hellas, I think it better to send first to them
      men of the Persians together with him of whom thou speakest, to make
      investigation, that when these have learnt and seen, they may report each
      several thing to us; and then I shall go to attack them with full
      knowledge of all."
    </p>
<p>
      135. Thus he said, and he proceeded to do the deed as he spoke the word:
      for as soon as day dawned, he summoned fifteen Persians, men of repute,
      and bade them pass through the coasts of Hellas in company with Demokedes,
      and take care not to let Demokedes escape from them, but bring him back at
      all costs. Having thus commanded them, next he summoned Demokedes himself
      and asked him to act as a guide for the whole of Hellas and show it to the
      Persians, and then return back: and he bade him take all his movable goods
      and carry them as gifts to his father and his brothers, saying that he
      would give him in their place many times as much; and besides this, he
      said, he would contribute to the gifts a merchant ship filled with all
      manner of goods, which should sail with him. Dareios, as it seems to me,
      promised him these things with no crafty design; but Demokedes was afraid
      that Dareios was making trial of him, and did not make haste to accept all
      that was offered, but said that he would leave his own things where they
      were, so that he might have them when he came back; he said however that
      he accepted the merchant ship which Dareios promised him for the presents
      to his brothers. Dareios then, having thus given command to him also, sent
      them away to the sea.
    </p>
<p>
      136. So these, when they had gone down to Phenicia and in Phenicia to the
      city of Sidon, forthwith manned two triremes, and besides them they also
      filled a large ship of burden with all manner of goods. Then when they had
      made all things ready they set sail for Hellas, and touching at various
      places they saw the coast regions of it and wrote down a description,
      until at last, when they had seen the greater number of the famous places,
      they came to Taras <a href="#link32Hnote-120" id="link32noteref-120" class="pginternal">120</a> in Italy. There from complaisance <a href="#link32Hnote-121" id="link32noteref-121" class="pginternal">121</a>
      to Demokedes Aristophilides the king of the Tarentines unfastened and
      removed the steering-oars of the Median ships, and also confined the
      Persians in prison, because, as he alleged, they came as spies. While they
      were being thus dealt with, Demokedes went away and reached Croton; and
      when he had now reached his own native place, Aristophilides set the
      Persians free and gave back to them those parts of their ships which he
      had taken away.
    </p>
<p>
      137. The Persians then sailing thence and pursuing Demokedes reached
      Croton, and finding him in the market-place they laid hands upon him; and
      some of the men of Croton fearing the Persian power were willing to let
      him go, but others took hold of him and struck with their staves at the
      Persians, who pleaded for themselves in these words: "Men of Croton, take
      care what ye are about: ye are rescuing a man who was a slave of king
      Dareios and who ran away from him. How, think you, will king Dareios be
      content to receive such an insult; and how shall this which ye do be well
      for you, if ye take him away from us? Against what city, think you, shall
      we make expedition sooner than against this, and what city before this
      shall we endeavour to reduce to slavery?" Thus saying they did not however
      persuade the men of Croton, but having had Demokedes rescued from them and
      the ship of burden which they were bringing with them taken away, they set
      sail to go back to Asia, and did not endeavour to visit any more parts of
      Hellas or to find out about them, being now deprived of their guide. This
      much however Demokedes gave them as a charge when they were putting forth
      to sea, bidding them say to Dareios that Demokedes was betrothed to the
      daughter of Milon: for the wrestler Milon had a great name at the king's
      court; and I suppose that Demokedes was urgent for this marriage, spending
      much money to further it, in order that Dareios might see that he was held
      in honour also in his own country.
    </p>
<p>
      138. The Persians however, after they had put out from Croton, were cast
      away with their ships in Iapygia; and as they were remaining there as
      slaves, Gillos a Tarentine exile rescued them and brought them back to
      king Dareios. In return for this Dareios offered to give him whatsoever
      thing he should desire; and Gillos chose that he might have the power of
      returning to Taras, narrating first the story of his misfortune: and in
      order that he might not disturb all Hellas, as would be the case if on his
      account a great armament should sail to invade Italy, he said it was
      enough for him that the men of Cnidos should be those who brought him
      back, without any others; because he supposed that by these, who were
      friends with the Tarentines, his return from exile would most easily be
      effected. Dareios accordingly having promised proceeded to perform; for he
      sent a message to Cnidos and bade them being back Gillos to Taras: and the
      men of Cnidos obeyed Dareios, but nevertheless they did not persuade the
      Tarentines, and they were not strong enough to apply force. Thus then it
      happened with regard to these things; and these were the first Persians
      who came from Asia to Hellas, and for the reason which has been mentioned
      these were sent as spies.
    </p>
<p>
      139. After this king Dareios took Samos before all other cities, whether
      of Hellenes or Barbarians, and for a cause which was as follows:—When
      Cambyses the son of Cyrus was marching upon Egypt, many Hellenes arrived
      in Egypt, some, as might be expected, joining in the campaign to make
      profit, <a href="#link32Hnote-122" id="link32noteref-122" class="pginternal">122</a> and some also coming to see the land
      itself; and among these was Syoloson the son of Aiakes and brother of
      Polycrates, an exile from Samos. To this Syloson a fortunate chance
      occurred, which was this:—he had taken and put upon him a
      flame-coloured mantle, and was about the market-place in Memphis; and
      Dareios, who was then one of the spearmen of Cambyses and not yet held in
      any great estimation, seeing him had a desire for the mantle, and going up
      to him offered to buy it. Then Syloson, seeing that Dareios very greatly
      desired the mantle, by some divine inspiration said: "I will not sell this
      for any sum, but I will give it thee for nothing, if, as it appears, it
      must be thine at all costs." To this Dareios agreed and received from him
      the garment.
    </p>
<p>
      140. Now Syloson supposed without any doubt that he had altogether lost
      this by easy simplicity; but when in course of time Cambyses was dead, and
      the seven Persians had risen up against the Magian, and of the seven
      Dareios had obtained the kingdom, Syloson heard that the kingdom had come
      about to that man to whom once in Egypt he had given the garment at his
      request: accordingly he went up to Susa and sat down at the entrance <a href="#link32Hnote-123" id="link32noteref-123" class="pginternal">123</a>
      of the king's palace, and said that he was a benefactor of Dareios. The
      keeper of the door hearing this reported it to the king; and he marvelled
      at it and said to him: "Who then of the Hellenes is my benefactor, to whom
      I am bound by gratitude? seeing that it is now but a short time that I
      possess the kingdom, and as yet scarcely one <a href="#link32Hnote-124" id="link32noteref-124" class="pginternal">124</a> of them has come
      up to our court; and I may almost say that I have no debt owing to a
      Hellene. Nevertheless bring him in before me, that I may know what he
      means when he says these things." Then the keeper of the door brought
      Syloson before him, and when he had been set in the midst, the
      interpreters asked him who he was and what he had done, that he called
      himself the benefactor of the king. Syloson accordingly told all that had
      happened about the mantle, and how he was the man who had given it; to
      which Dareios made answer: "O most noble of men, thou art he who when as
      yet I had no power gavest me a gift, small it may be, but nevertheless the
      kindness is counted with me to be as great as if I should now receive some
      great thing from some one. Therefore I will give thee in return gold and
      silver in abundance, that thou mayest not ever repent that thou didst
      render a service to Dareios the son of Hystaspes." To this Syloson
      replied: "To me, O king, give neither gold nor silver, but recover and
      give to me my fatherland Samos, which now that my brother Polycrates has
      been slain by Oroites is possessed by our slave. This give to me without
      bloodshed or selling into slavery."
    </p>
<p>
      141. Dareios having heard this prepared to send an expedition with Otanes
      as commander of it, who had been one of the seven, charging him to
      accomplish for Syloson all that which he had requested. Otanes then went
      down to the sea-coast and was preparing the expedition.
    </p>
<p>
      142. Now Maiandrios the son of Maiandrios was holding the rule over Samos,
      having received the government as a trust from Polycrates; and he, though
      desiring to show himself the most righteous of men, did not succeed in so
      doing: for when the death of Polycrates was reported to him, he did as
      follows:—first he founded an altar to Zeus the Liberator and marked
      out a sacred enclosure round it, namely that which exists still in the
      suburb of the city: then after he had done this he gathered together an
      assembly of all the citizens and spoke these words: "To me, as ye know as
      well as I, has been entrusted the sceptre of Polycrates and all his power;
      and now it is open to me to be your ruler; but that for the doing of which
      I find fault with my neighbour, I will myself refrain from doing, so far
      as I may: for as I did not approve of Polycrates acting as master of men
      who were not inferior to himself, so neither do I approve of any other who
      does such things. Now Polycrates for his part fulfilled his own appointed
      destiny, and I now give the power into the hands of the people, and
      proclaim to you equality. <a href="#link32Hnote-125" id="link32noteref-125" class="pginternal">125</a> These privileges
      however I think it right to have assigned to me, namely that from the
      wealth of Polycrates six talents should be taken out and given to me as a
      special gift; and in addition to this I choose for myself and for my
      descendants in succession the priesthood of Zeus the Liberator, to whom I
      myself founded a temple, while I bestow liberty upon you." He, as I say,
      made these offers to the Samians; but one of them rose up and said: "Nay,
      but unworthy too art <i>thou</i> <a href="#link32Hnote-126" id="link32noteref-126" class="pginternal">126</a> to be our ruler,
      seeing that thou art of mean birth and a pestilent fellow besides. Rather
      take care that thou give an account of the money which thou hadst to deal
      with."
    </p>
<p>
      143. Thus said one who was a man of repute among the citizens, whose name
      was Telesarchos; and Maiandrios perceiving that if he resigned the power,
      some other would be set up as despot instead of himself, did not keep the
      purpose at all <a href="#link32Hnote-127" id="link32noteref-127" class="pginternal">127</a> of resigning it; but having retired to the
      fortress he sent for each man separately, pretending that he was going to
      give an account of the money, and so seized them and put them in bonds.
      These then had been put in bonds; but Maiandrios after this was overtaken
      by sickness, and his brother, whose name was Lycaretos, expecting that he
      would die, put all the prisoners to death, in order that he might himself
      more easily get possession of the power over Samos: and all this happened
      because, as it appears, they did not choose to be free.
    </p>
<p>
      144. So when the Persians arrived at Samos bringing Syloson home from
      exile, no one raised a hand against them, and moreover the party of
      Maiandrios and Maiandrios himself said that they were ready to retire out
      of the island under a truce. Otanes therefore having agreed on these terms
      and having made a treaty, the most honourable of the Persians had seats
      placed for them in front of the fortress and were sitting there.
    </p>
<p>
      145. Now the despot Maiandrios had a brother who was somewhat mad, and his
      name was Charilaos. This man for some offence which he had been committed
      had been confined in an underground dungeon, <a href="#link32Hnote-128" id="link32noteref-128" class="pginternal">128</a> and at this time
      of which I speak, having heard what was being done and having put his head
      through out of the dungeon, when he saw the Persians peacefully sitting
      there he began to cry out and said that he desired to come to speech with
      Maiandrios. So Maiandrios hearing his voice bade them loose him and bring
      him into his presence; and as soon as he was brought he began to abuse and
      revile him, trying to persuade him to attack the Persians, and saying
      thus: "Thou basest of men, didst thou put me in bonds and judge me worthy
      of the dungeon under ground, who am thine own brother and did no wrong
      worthy of bonds, and when thou seest the Persians casting thee forth from
      the land and making thee homeless, dost thou not dare to take any revenge,
      though they are so exceedingly easy to be overcome? Nay, but if in truth
      thou art afraid of them, give me thy mercenaries and I will take vengeance
      on them for their coming here; and thyself I am willing to let go out of
      the island."
    </p>
<p>
      146. Thus spoke Charilaos, and Maiandrios accepted that which he said,
      not, as I think, because he had reached such a height of folly as to
      suppose that his own power would overcome that of the king, but rather
      because he grudged Syloson that he should receive from him the State
      without trouble, and with no injury inflicted upon it. Therefore he
      desired to provoke the Persians to anger and make the Samian power as
      feeble as possible before he gave it up to him, being well assured that
      the Persians, when they had suffered evil, would be likely to be as bitter
      against the Samians as well as against those who did the wrong, <a href="#link32Hnote-129" id="link32noteref-129" class="pginternal">129</a>
      and knowing also that he had a safe way of escape from the island whenever
      he desired: for he had had a secret passage made under ground, leading
      from the fortress to the sea. Maiandrios then himself sailed out from
      Samos; but Charilaos armed all the mercenaries, and opening wide the gates
      sent them out upon the Persians, who were not expecting any such thing,
      but supposed that all had been arranged: and the mercenaries falling upon
      them began to slay those of the Persians who had seats carried for them <a href="#link32Hnote-130" id="link32noteref-130" class="pginternal">130</a>
      and were of most account. While these were thus engaged, the rest of the
      Persian force came to the rescue, and the mercenaries were hard pressed
      and forced to retire to the fortress.
    </p>
<p>
      147. Then Otanes the Persian commander, seeing that the Persians had
      suffered greatly, purposely forgot the commands which Dareios gave him
      when he sent him forth, not to kill any one of the Samians nor to sell any
      into slavery, but to restore the island to Syloson free from all suffering
      of calamity,—these commands, I say, he purposely forgot, and gave
      the word to his army to slay every one whom they should take, man or boy,
      without distinction. So while some of the army were besieging the
      fortress, others were slaying every one who came in their way, in
      sanctuary or out of sanctuary equally.
    </p>
<p>
      148. Meanwhile Maiandrios had escaped from Samos and was sailing to
      Lacedemon; and having come thither and caused to be brought up to the city
      the things which he had taken with him when he departed, he did as
      follows:—first, he would set out his cups of silver and of gold, and
      then while the servants were cleaning them, he would be engaged in
      conversation with Cleomenes the son of Anaxandrides, then king of Sparta,
      and would bring him on to his house; and when Cleomenes saw the cups he
      marvelled and was astonished at them, and Maiandrios would bid him take
      away with him as many of them as he pleased. Maiandrios said this twice or
      three times, but Cleomenes herein showed himself the most upright of men;
      for he not only did not think fit to take that which was offered, but
      perceiving that Maiandrios would make presents to others of the citizens,
      and so obtain assistance for himself, he went to the Ephors and said that
      it was better for Sparta that the stranger of Samos should depart from
      Peloponnesus, lest he might persuade either himself or some other man of
      the Spartans to act basely. They accordingly accepted his counsel, and
      expelled Maiandrios by proclamation.
    </p>
<p>
      149. As to Samos, the Persians, after sweeping the population off it, <a href="#link32Hnote-131" id="link32noteref-131" class="pginternal">131</a>
      delivered it to Syloson stripped of men. Afterwards however the commander
      Otanes even joined in settling people there, moved by a vision of a dream
      and by a disease which seized him, so that he was diseased in the genital
      organs.
    </p>
<p>
      150. After a naval force had thus gone against Samos, the Babylonians made
      revolt, being for this exceedingly well prepared; for during all the time
      of the reign of the Magian and of the insurrection of the seven, during
      all this time and the attendant confusion they were preparing themselves
      for the siege of their city: and it chanced by some means that they were
      not observed to be doing this. Then when they made open revolt, they did
      as follows:—after setting apart their mothers first, each man set
      apart also for himself one woman, whosoever he wished of his own
      household, and all the remainder they gathered together and killed by
      suffocation. Each man set apart the one who has been mentioned to serve as
      a maker of bread, and they suffocated the rest in order that they might
      not consume their provisions.
    </p>
<p>
      151. Dareios being informed of this and having gathered together all his
      power, made expedition against them, and when he had marched his army up
      to Babylon he began to besiege them; but they cared nothing about the
      siege, for the Babylonians used to go up to the battlements of the wall
      and show contempt of Dareios and of his army by gestures and by words; and
      one of them uttered this saying: "Why, O Persians, do ye remain sitting
      here, and not depart? For then only shall ye capture us, when mules shall
      bring forth young." This was said by one of the Babylonians, not supposing
      that a mule would ever bring forth young.
    </p>
<p>
      152. So when a year and seven months had now passed by, Dareios began to
      be vexed and his whole army with him, not being able to conquer the
      Babylonians. And yet Dareios had used against them every kind of device
      and every possible means, but not even so could he conquer them, though
      besides other devices he had attempted it by that also with which Cyrus
      conquered them; but the Babylonians were terribly on their guard and he
      was not able to conquer them.
    </p>
<p>
      153. Then in the twentieth month there happened to Zopyros the son of that
      Megabyzos who had been of the seven men who slew the Magian, to this
      Zopyros, I say, son of Megabyzos there happened a prodigy,—one of
      the mules which served as bearers of provisions for him produced young:
      and when this was reported to him, and Zopyros had himself seen the foal,
      because he did not believe the report, he charged those who had seen it
      not to tell that which had happened to any one, and he considered with
      himself what to do. And having regard to the words spoken by the
      Babylonian, who had said at first that when mules should produce young,
      then the wall would be taken, having regard (I say) to this ominous
      saying, it seemed to Zopyros that Babylon could be taken: for he thought
      that both the man had spoken and his mule had produced young by divine
      dispensation.
    </p>
<p>
      154. Since then it seemed to him that it was now fated that Babylon should
      be captured, he went to Dareios and inquired of him whether he thought it
      a matter of very great moment to conquer Babylon; and hearing in answer
      that he thought it of great consequence, he considered again how he might
      be the man to take it and how the work might be his own: for among the
      Persians benefits are accounted worthy of a very high degree of honour. <a href="#link32Hnote-132" id="link32noteref-132" class="pginternal">132</a>
      He considered accordingly that he was not able to make conquest of it by
      any other means, but only if he should maltreat himself and desert to
      their side. So, making light esteem of himself, he maltreated his own body
      in a manner which could not be cured; for he cut off his nose and his
      ears, and shaved his hair round in an unseemly way, and scourged himself,
      and so went into the presence of Dareios.
    </p>
<p>
      155. And Dareios was exceedingly troubled when he saw the man of most
      repute with him thus maltreated; and leaping up from his seat he cried
      aloud and asked him who was the person who had maltreated him, and for
      what deed. He replied: "That man does not exist, excepting thee, who has
      so great power as to bring me into this condition; and not any stranger, O
      king, has done this, but I myself to myself, accounting it a very grievous
      thing that the Assyrians should make a mock of the Persians." He made
      answer: "Thou most reckless of men, thou didst set the fairest name to the
      foulest deed when thou saidest that on account of those who are besieged
      thou didst bring thyself into a condition which cannot be cured. How, O
      thou senseless one, will the enemy surrender to us more quickly, because
      thou hast maltreated thyself? Surely thou didst wander out of thy senses
      in thus destroying thyself." And he said, "If I had communicated to thee
      that which I was about to do, thou wouldst not have permitted me to do it;
      but as it was, I did it on my own account. Now therefore, unless something
      is wanting on thy part, we shall conquer Babylon: for I shall go
      straightway as a deserter to the wall; and I shall say to them that I
      suffered this treatment at thy hands: and I think that when I have
      convinced them that this is so, I shall obtain the command of a part of
      their forces. Do thou then on the tenth day from that on which I shall
      enter within the wall take of those troops about which thou wilt have no
      concern if they be destroyed,—of these, I say, get a thousand by <a href="#link32Hnote-133" id="link32noteref-133" class="pginternal">133</a>
      the gate of the city which is called the gate of Semiramis; and after this
      again on the seventh day after the tenth set, I pray thee, two thousand by
      the gate which is called the gate of the Ninevites; and after this seventh
      day let twenty days elapse, and then lead other four thousand and place
      them by the gate called the gate of the Chaldeans: and let neither the
      former men nor these have any weapons to defend them except daggers, but
      this weapon let them have. Then after the twentieth day at once bid the
      rest of the army make an attack on the wall all round, and set the
      Persians, I pray thee, by those gates which are called the gate of Belos
      and the gate of Kissia: for, as I think, when I have displayed great deeds
      of prowess, the Babylonians will entrust to me, besides their other
      things, also the keys which draw the bolts of the gates. Then after that
      it shall be the care of myself and the Persians to do that which ought to
      be done."
    </p>
<p>
      156. Having thus enjoined he proceeded to go to the gate of the city,
      turning to look behind him as he went, as if he were in truth a deserter;
      and those who were set in that part of the wall, seeing him from the
      towers ran down, and slightly opening one wing of the gate asked who he
      was, and for what purpose he had come. And he addressed them and said that
      he was Zopyros, and that he came as a deserter to them. The gate-keepers
      accordingly when they heard this led him to the public assembly of the
      Babylonians; and being introduced before it he began to lament his
      fortunes, saying that he had in fact suffered at his own hands, and that
      he had suffered this because he had counselled the king to withdraw his
      army, since in truth there seemed to be no means of taking the town: "And
      now," he went on to say, "I am come for very great good to you, O
      Babylonians, but for very great evil to Dareios and his army, and to the
      Persians, <a href="#link32Hnote-134" id="link32noteref-134" class="pginternal">134</a> for he shall surely not escape with
      impunity for having thus maltreated me; and I know all the courses of his
      counsels."
    </p>
<p>
      157. Thus he spoke, and the Babylonians, when they saw the man of most
      reputation among the Persians deprived of nose and ears and smeared over
      with blood from scourging, supposing assuredly that he was speaking the
      truth and had come to be their helper, were ready to put in his power that
      for which he asked them, and he asked them that he might command a certain
      force. Then when he had obtained this from them, he did that which he had
      agreed with Dareios that he would do; for he led out on the tenth day the
      army of the Babylonians, and having surrounded the thousand men whom he
      had enjoined Dareios first to set there, he slew them. The Babylonians
      accordingly, perceiving that the deeds which he displayed were in
      accordance with his words, were very greatly rejoiced and were ready to
      serve him in all things: and after the lapse of the days which had been
      agreed upon, he again chose men of the Babylonians and led them out and
      slew the two thousand men of the troops of Dareios. Seeing this deed also,
      the Babylonians all had the name of Zopyros upon their tongues, and were
      loud in his praise. He then again, after the lapse of the days which had
      been agreed upon, led them out to the place appointed, and surrounded the
      four thousand and slew them. When this also had been done, Zopyros was
      everything among the Babylonians, and he was appointed both commander of
      their army and guardian of their walls.
    </p>
<p>
      158. But when Dareios made an attack according to the agreement on every
      side of the wall, then Zopyros discovered all his craft: for while the
      Babylonians, having gone up on the wall, were defending themselves against
      the attacks of the army of Dareios, Zopyros opened the gates called the
      gates of Kissia and of Belos, and let in the Persians within the wall. And
      of the Babylonians those who saw that which was done fled to the temple of
      Zeus Belos, but those who did not see remained each in his own appointed
      place, until at last they also learnt that they had been betrayed.
    </p>
<p>
      159. Thus was Babylon conquered for the second time: and Dareios when he
      had overcome the Babylonians, first took away the wall from round their
      city and pulled down all the gates; for when Cyrus took Babylon before
      him, he did neither of these things: and secondly Dareios impaled the
      leading men to the number of about three thousand, but to the rest of the
      Babylonians he gave back their city to dwell in: and to provide that the
      Babylonians should have wives, in order that their race might be
      propagated, Dareios did as follows (for their own wives, as has been
      declared at the beginning, the Babylonians had suffocated, in provident
      care for their store of food):—he ordered the nations who dwelt
      round to bring women to Babylon, fixing a certain number for each nation,
      so that the sum total of fifty thousand women was brought together, and
      from these women the present Babylonians are descended.
    </p>
<p>
      160. As for Zopyros, in the judgment of Dareios no one of the Persians
      surpassed him in good service, either of those who came after or of those
      who had gone before, excepting Cyrus alone; for to Cyrus no man of the
      Persians ever yet ventured to compare himself: and Dareios is said to have
      declared often that he would rather that Zopyros were free from the injury
      than that he should have twenty Babylons added to his possession in
      addition to that one which he had. Moreover he gave him great honours; for
      not only did he give him every year those things which by the Persians are
      accounted the most honourable, but also he granted him Babylon to rule
      free from tribute, so long as he should live; and he added many other
      gifts. The son of this Zopyros was Megabyzos, who was made commander in
      Egypt against the Athenians and their allies; and the son of this
      Megabyzos was Zopyros, who went over to Athens as a deserter from the
      Persians.

<h2>
      BOOK IV. THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE HISTORIES, CALLED MELPOMENE
    </h2>
<p>
      1. After Babylon had been taken, the march of Dareios himself <a href="#link4note-1" id="link4noteref-1" class="pginternal">1</a>
      against the Scythians took place: for now that Asia was flourishing in
      respect of population, and large sums were being gathered in as revenue,
      Dareios formed the desire to take vengeance upon the Scythians, because
      they had first invaded the Median land and had overcome in fight those who
      opposed them; and thus they had been the beginners of wrong. The Scythians
      in truth, as I have before said, <a href="#link4note-2" id="link4noteref-2" class="pginternal">2</a> had ruled over Upper Asia
      <a href="#link4note-3" id="link4noteref-3" class="pginternal">3</a> for
      eight-and-twenty years; for they had invaded Asia in their pursuit of the
      Kimmerians, and they had deposed <a href="#link4note-4" id="link4noteref-4" class="pginternal">4</a> the Medes from their rule,
      who had rule over Asia before the Scythians came. Now when the Scythians
      had been absent from their own land for eight-and-twenty years, as they
      were returning to it after that interval of time, they were met by a
      contest <a href="#link4note-5" id="link4noteref-5" class="pginternal">5</a>
      not less severe than that which they had had with the Medes, since they
      found an army of no mean size opposing them. For the wives of the
      Scythians, because their husbands were absent from them for a long time,
      had associated with the slaves.
    </p>
<p>
      2. Now the Scythians put out the eyes of all their slaves because of the
      milk which they drink; and they do as follows:—they take blow-pipes
      of bone just like flutes, and these they insert into the vagina of the
      mare and blow with their mouths, and others milk while they blow: and they
      say that they do this because the veins of the mare are thus filled, being
      blown out, and so the udder is let down. When they had drawn the milk they
      pour it into wooden vessels hollowed out, and they set the blind slaves in
      order about <a href="#link4note-6" id="link4noteref-6" class="pginternal">6</a> the vessels and agitate the milk. Then that
      which comes to the top they skim off, considering it the more valuable
      part, whereas they esteem that which settles down to be less good than the
      other. For this reason <a href="#link4note-7" id="link4noteref-7" class="pginternal">7</a> the Scythians put out the eyes of all whom they
      catch; for they are not tillers of the soil but nomads.
    </p>
<p>
      3. From these their slaves then, I say, and from their wives had been born
      and bred up a generation of young men, who having learnt the manner of
      their birth set themselves to oppose the Scythians as they were returning
      from the Medes. And first they cut off their land by digging a broad
      trench extending from the Tauric mountains to the Maiotian lake, at the
      point where <a href="#link4note-8" id="link4noteref-8" class="pginternal">8</a> this is broadest; then afterwards when the
      Scythians attempted to invade the land, they took up a position against
      them and fought; and as they fought many times, and the Scythians were not
      able to get any advantage in the fighting, one of them said: "What a thing
      is this that we are doing, Scythians! We are fighting against our own
      slaves, and we are not only becoming fewer in number ourselves by being
      slain in battle, but also we are killing them, and so we shall have fewer
      to rule over in future. Now therefore to me it seems good that we leave
      spears and bows and that each one take his horse-whip and so go up close
      to them: for so long as they saw us with arms in our hands, they thought
      themselves equal to us and of equal birth; but when they shall see that we
      have whips instead of arms, they will perceive that they are our slaves,
      and having acknowledged this they will not await our onset."
    </p>
<p>
      4. When they heard this, the Scythians proceeded to do that which he said,
      and the others being panic-stricken by that which was done forgot their
      fighting and fled. Thus the Scythians had ruled over Asia; and in such
      manner, when they were driven out again by the Medes, they had returned to
      their own land. For this Dareios wished to take vengeance upon them, and
      was gathering together an army to go against them.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      5. Now the Scythians say that their nation is the youngest of all nations,
      and that this came to pass as follows:—The first man who ever
      existed in this region, which then was desert, was one named Targitaos:
      and of this Targitaos they say, though I do not believe it for my part,
      however they say the parents were Zeus and the daughter of the river
      Borysthenes. Targitaos, they report, was produced from some such origin as
      this, and of him were begotten three sons, Lipoxaïs and Arpoxaïs and the
      youngest Colaxaïs. In the reign of these <a href="#link4note-9" id="link4noteref-9" class="pginternal">9</a> there came down from
      heaven certain things wrought of gold, a plough, a yoke, a battle-axe, <a href="#link4note-10" id="link4noteref-10" class="pginternal">10</a>
      and a cup, and fell in the Scythian land: and first the eldest saw and
      came near them, desiring to take them, but the gold blazed with fire when
      he approached it: then when he had gone away from it, the second
      approached, and again it did the same thing. These then the gold repelled
      by blazing with fire; but when the third and youngest came up to it, the
      flame was quenched, and he carried them to his own house. The elder
      brothers then, acknowledging the significance of this thing, delivered the
      whole of the kingly power to the youngest.
    </p>
<p>
      6. From Lixopaïs, they say, are descended those Scythians who are called
      the race of the Auchatai; from the middle brother Arpoxaïs those who are
      called Catiaroi and Traspians, and from the youngest of them the "Royal"
      tribe, <a href="#link4note-11" id="link4noteref-11" class="pginternal">11</a>
      who are called Paralatai: and the whole together are called, they say,
      Scolotoi, after the name of their king; <a href="#link4note-12" id="link4noteref-12" class="pginternal">12</a> but the Hellenes gave
      them the name of Scythians.
    </p>
<p>
      7. Thus the Scythians say they were produced; and from the time of their
      origin, that is to say from the first king Targitaos, to the passing over
      of Dareios against them, they say that there is a period of a thousand
      years and no more. Now this sacred gold is guarded by the kings with the
      utmost care, and they visit it every year with solemn sacrifices of
      propitiation: moreover if any one goes to sleep while watching in the open
      air over this gold during the festival, the Scythians say that he does not
      live out the year; and there is given him for this so much land as he
      shall ride round himself on his horse in one day. Now as the land was
      large, Colaxaïs, they say, established three kingdoms for his sons; and of
      these he made one larger than the rest, and in this the gold is kept. But
      as to the upper parts which lie on the North side of those who dwell above
      this land, they say one can neither see nor pass through any further by
      reason of feathers which are poured down; for both the earth and the air
      are full of feathers, and this is that which shuts off the view.
    </p>
<p>
      8. Thus say the Scythians about themselves and about the region above
      them; but the Hellenes who dwell about the Pontus say as follows:—Heracles
      driving the cattle of Geryones came to this land, then desert, which the
      Scythians now inhabit; and Geryones, says the tale, dwelt away from the
      region of the Pontus, living in the island called by the Hellenes
      Erytheia, near Gadeira which is outside the Pillars of Heracles by the
      Ocean.—As to the Ocean, they say indeed that it flows round the
      whole earth beginning from the place of the sunrising, but they do not
      prove this by facts.—From thence Heracles came to the land now
      called Scythia; and as a storm came upon him together with icy cold, he
      drew over him his lion's skin and went to sleep. Meanwhile the mares
      harnessed in his chariot disappeared by a miraculous chance, as they were
      feeding.
    </p>
<p>
      9. Then when Heracles woke he sought for them; and having gone over the
      whole land, at last he came to the region which is called Hylaia; and
      there he found in a cave a kind of twofold creature formed by the union of
      a maiden and a serpent, whose upper parts from the buttocks upwards were
      those of a woman, but her lower parts were those of a snake. Having seen
      her and marvelled at her, he asked her then whether she had seen any mares
      straying anywhere; and she said that she had them herself and would not
      give them up until he lay with her; and Heracles lay with her on condition
      of receiving them. She then tried to put off the giving back of the mares,
      desiring to have Heracles with her as long as possible, while he on the
      other hand desired to get the mares and depart; and at last she gave them
      back and said: "These mares when they came hither I saved for thee, and
      thou didst give me reward for saving them; for I have by thee three sons.
      Tell me then, what must I do with these when they shall be grown to
      manhood, whether I shall settle them here, for over this land I have power
      alone, or send them away to thee?" She thus asked of him, and he, they
      say, replied: "When thou seest that the boys are grown to men, do this and
      thou shalt not fail of doing right:—whichsoever of them thou seest
      able to stretch this bow as I do now, and to be girded <a href="#link4note-1201" id="link4noteref-1201" class="pginternal">1201</a>
      with this girdle, him cause to be the settler of this land; but whosoever
      of them fails in the deeds which I enjoin, send him forth out of the land:
      and if thou shalt do thus, thou wilt both have delight thyself and perform
      that which has been enjoined to thee."
    </p>
<p>
      10. Upon this he drew one of his bows (for up to that time Heracles, they
      say, was wont to carry two) and showed her the girdle, and then he
      delivered to her both the bow and the girdle, which had at the end of its
      clasp a golden cup; and having given them he departed. She then, when her
      sons had been born and had grown to be men, gave them names first, calling
      one of them Agathyrsos and the next Gelonos and the youngest Skythes; then
      bearing in mind the charge given to her, she did that which was enjoined.
      And two of her sons, Agathyrsos and Gelonos, not having proved themselves
      able to attain to the task set before them, departed from the land, being
      cast out by her who bore them; but Skythes the youngest of them performed
      the task and remained in the land: and from Skythes the son of Heracles
      were descended, they say, the succeeding kings of the Scythians
      (Skythians): and they say moreover that it is by reason of the cup that
      the Scythians still even to this day wear cups attached to their girdles:
      and this alone his mother contrived for Skythes. <a href="#link4note-13" id="link4noteref-13" class="pginternal">13</a> Such is the story told
      by the Hellenes who dwell about the Pontus.
    </p>
<p>
      11. There is however also another story, which is as follows, and to this
      I am most inclined myself. It is to the effect that the nomad Scythians
      dwelling in Asia, being hard pressed in war by the Massagetai, left their
      abode and crossing the river Araxes came towards the Kimmerian land (for
      the land which now is occupied by the Scythians is said to have been in
      former times the land of the Kimmerians); and the Kimmerians, when the
      Scythians were coming against them, took counsel together, seeing that a
      great host was coming to fight against them; and it proved that their
      opinions were divided, both opinions being vehemently maintained, but the
      better being that of their kings: for the opinion of the people was that
      it was necessary to depart and that they ought not to run the risk of
      fighting against so many, <a href="#link4note-14" id="link4noteref-14" class="pginternal">14</a> but that of the kings was to fight for their
      land with those who came against them: and as neither the people were
      willing by means to agree to the counsel of the kings nor the kings to
      that of the people, the people planned to depart without fighting and to
      deliver up the land to the invaders, while the kings resolved to die and
      to be laid in their own land, and not to flee with the mass of the people,
      considering the many goods of fortune which they had enjoyed, and the many
      evils which it might be supposed would come upon them, if they fled from
      their native land. Having resolved upon this, they parted into two bodies,
      and making their numbers equal they fought with one another: and when
      these had all been killed by one another's hands, then the people of the
      Kimmerians buried them by the bank of the river Tyras (where their
      burial-place is still to be seen), and having buried them, then they made
      their way out from the land, and the Scythians when they came upon it
      found the land deserted of its inhabitants.
    </p>
<p>
      12. And there are at the present time in the land of Scythia Kimmerian
      walls, and a Kimmerian ferry; and there is also a region which is called
      Kimmeria, and the so-called Kimmerian Bosphorus. It is known moreover that
      the Kimmerians, in their flight to Asia from the Scythians, also made a
      settlement on that peninsula on which now stands the Hellenic city of
      Sinope; and it is known too that the Scythians pursued them and invaded
      the land of Media, having missed their way; for while the Kimmerians kept
      ever along by the sea in their flight, the Scythians pursued them keeping
      Caucasus on their right hand, until at last they invaded Media, directing
      their course inland. This then which has been told is another story, and
      it is common both to Hellenes and Barbarians.
    </p>
<p>
      13. Aristeas however the son of Caÿstrobios, a man of Proconnesos, said in
      the verses which he composed, that he came to the land of the Issedonians
      being possessed by Phoebus, and that beyond the Issedonians dwelt
      Arimaspians, a one-eyed race, and beyond these the gold-guarding griffins,
      and beyond them the Hyperboreans extending as far as the sea: and all
      these except the Hyperboreans, beginning with the Arimaspians, were
      continually making war on their neighbours, and the Issedonians were
      gradually driven out of their country by the Arimaspians and the Scythians
      by the Issedonians, and so the Kimmerians, who dwelt on the Southern Sea,
      being pressed by the Scythians left their land. Thus neither does he agree
      in regard to this land with the report of the Scythians.
    </p>
<p>
      14. As to Aristeas who composed <a href="#link4note-15" id="link4noteref-15" class="pginternal">15</a> this, I have said
      already whence he was; and I will tell also the tale which I heard about
      him in Proconnesos and Kyzicos. They say that Aristeas, who was in birth
      inferior to none of the citizens, entered into a fuller's shop in
      Proconnesos and there died; and the fuller closed his workshop and went
      away to report the matter to those who were related to the dead man. And
      when the news had been spread abroad about the city that Aristeas was
      dead, a man of Kyzicos who had come from the town of Artake entered into
      controversy with those who said so, and declared that he had met him going
      towards Kyzicos and had spoken with him: and while he was vehement in
      dispute, those who were related to the dead man came to the fuller's shop
      with the things proper in order to take up the corpse for burial; and when
      the house was opened, Aristeas was not found there either dead or alive.
      In the seventh year after this he appeared at Proconnesos and composed
      those verses which are now called by the Hellenes the <i>Arimaspeia</i>,
      and having composed them he disappeared the second time.
    </p>
<p>
      15. So much is told by these cities; and what follows I know happened to
      the people of Metapontion in Italy <a href="#link4note-16" id="link4noteref-16" class="pginternal">16</a> two hundred <a href="#link4note-17" id="link4noteref-17" class="pginternal">17</a>
      and forty years after the second disappearance of Aristeas, as I found by
      putting together the evidence at Proconnesos and Metapontion. The people
      of Metapontion say that Aristeas himself appeared in their land and bade
      them set up an altar of Apollo and place by its side a statue bearing the
      name of Aristeas of Proconnesos; for he told them that to their land alone
      of all the Italiotes <a href="#link4note-18" id="link4noteref-18" class="pginternal">18</a> Apollo had come, and he, who now was Aristeas,
      was accompanying him, being then a raven when he accompanied the god.
      Having said this he disappeared; and the Metapontines say that they sent
      to Delphi and asked the god what the apparition of the man meant: and the
      Pythian prophetess bade them obey the command of the apparition, and told
      them that if they obeyed, it would be the better for them. They therefore
      accepted this answer and performed the commands; and there stands a statue
      now bearing the name of Aristeas close by the side of the altar dedicated
      to Apollo, <a href="#link4note-19" id="link4noteref-19" class="pginternal">19</a> and round it stand laurel trees; and the altar
      is set up in the market-place. Let this suffice which has been said about
      Aristeas.
    </p>
<p>
      16. Now of the land about which this account has been begun, no one knows
      precisely what lies beyond it: <a href="#link4note-20" id="link4noteref-20" class="pginternal">20</a> for I am not able to
      hear of any one who alleges that he knows as an eye-witness; and even
      Aristeas, the man of whom I was making mention just now, even he, I say,
      did not allege, although he was composing verse, <a href="#link4note-21" id="link4noteref-21" class="pginternal">21</a> that he went further
      than the Issedonians; but that which is beyond them he spoke of by
      hearsay, and reported that it was the Issedonians who said these things.
      So far however as we were able to arrive at certainty by hearsay, carrying
      inquiries as far as possible, all this shall be told.
    </p>
<p>
      17. Beginning with the trading station of the Borysthenites,—for of
      the parts along the sea this is the central point of all Scythia,—beginning
      with this, the first regions are occupied by the Callipidai, who are
      Hellenic Scythians; and above these is another race, who are called
      Alazonians. <a href="#link4note-22" id="link4noteref-22" class="pginternal">22</a> These last and the Callipidai in all other
      respects have the same customs as the Scythians, but they both sow corn
      and use it as food, and also onions, leeks, lentils and millet. Above the
      Alazonians dwell Scythians who till the ground, and these sow their corn
      not for food but to sell.
    </p>
<p>
      18.Beyond them dwell the Neuroi; and beyond the Neuroi towards the North
      Wind is a region without inhabitants, as far as we know. These races are
      along the river Hypanis to the West of the Borysthenes; but after crossing
      the Borysthenes, first from the sea-coast is Hylaia, and beyond this as
      one goes up the river dwell agricultural Scythians, whom the Hellenes who
      live upon the river Hypanis call Borysthenites, calling themselves at the
      same time citizens of Olbia. <a href="#link4note-23" id="link4noteref-23" class="pginternal">23</a> These agricultural Scythians occupy the region
      which extends Eastwards for a distance of three days' journey, <a href="#link4note-24" id="link4noteref-24" class="pginternal">24</a>
      reaching to a river which is called Panticapes, and Northwards for a
      distance of eleven days' sail up the Borysthenes. Then immediately beyond
      these begins the desert <a href="#link4note-25" id="link4noteref-25" class="pginternal">25</a> and extends for a great distance; and on the
      other side of the desert dwell the Androphagoi, <a href="#link4note-26" id="link4noteref-26" class="pginternal">26</a> a race apart by
      themselves and having no connection with the Scythians. Beyond them begins
      a region which is really desert and has no race of men in it, as far as we
      know.
    </p>
<p>
      19. The region which lies to the East of these agricultural Scythians,
      after one has crossed the river Panticapes, is occupied by nomad
      Scythians, who neither sow anything nor plough the earth; and this whole
      region is bare of trees except Hylaia. These nomads occupy a country which
      extends to the river Gerros, a distance of fourteen <a href="#link4note-27" id="link4noteref-27" class="pginternal">27</a> days' journey
      Eastwards.
    </p>
<p>
      20. Then on the other side of the Gerros we have those parts which are
      called the "Royal" lands and those Scythians who are the bravest and most
      numerous and who esteem the other Scythians their slaves. These reach
      Southwards to the Tauric land, and Eastwards to the trench which those who
      were begotten of the blind slaves dug, and to the trading station which is
      called Cremnoi <a href="#link4note-28" id="link4noteref-28" class="pginternal">28</a> upon the Maiotian lake; and some parts of
      their country reach to the river Tanaïs. Beyond the Royal Scythians
      towards the North Wind dwell the Melanchlainoi, <a href="#link4note-29" id="link4noteref-29" class="pginternal">29</a> of a different race and
      not Scythian. The region beyond the Melanchlainoi is marshy and not
      inhabited by any, so far as we know.
    </p>
<p>
      21. After one has crossed the river Tanaïs the country is no longer
      Scythia, but the first of the divisions belongs to the Sauromatai, who
      beginning at the corner of the Maiotian lake occupy land extending towards
      the North Wind fifteen days' journey, and wholly bare of trees both
      cultivated and wild. Above these, holding the next division of land, dwell
      the Budinoi, who occupy a land wholly overgrown with forest consisting of
      all kinds of trees.
    </p>
<p>
      22. Then beyond the Budinoi towards the North, first there is desert for
      seven days' journey; and after the desert turning aside somewhat more
      towards the East Wind we come to land occupied by the Thyssagetai, a
      numerous people and of separate race from the others. These live by
      hunting; and bordering upon them there are settled also in these same
      regions men who are called Irycai, who also live by hunting, which they
      practise in the following manner:—the hunter climbs up a tree and
      lies in wait there for his game (now trees are abundant in all this
      country), and each has a horse at hand, which has been taught to lie down
      upon its belly in order that it may make itself low, and also a dog: and
      when he sees the wild animal from the tree, he first shoots his arrow and
      then mounts upon his horse and pursues it, and the dog seizes hold of it.
      Above these in a direction towards the East dwell other Scythians, who
      have revolted from the Royal Scythians and so have come to this region.
    </p>
<p>
      23. As far as the country of these Scythians the whole land which has been
      described is level plain and has a deep soil; but after this point it is
      stony and rugged. Then when one has passed through a great extent of this
      rugged country, there dwell in the skirts of lofty mountains men who are
      said to be all bald-headed from their birth, male and female equally, and
      who have flat noses and large chins and speak a language of their own,
      using the Scythian manner of dress, and living on the produce of trees.
      The tree on the fruit of which they live is called the Pontic tree, and it
      is about the size of a fig-tree: this bears a fruit the size of a bean,
      containing a stone. When the fruit has ripened, they strain it through
      cloths and there flows from it a thick black juice, and this juice which
      flows from it is called <i>as-chy</i>. This they either lick up or drink
      mixed with milk, and from its lees, that is the solid part, they make
      cakes and use them for food; for they have not many cattle, since the
      pastures there are by no means good. Each man has his dwelling under a
      tree, in winter covering the tree all round with close white felt-cloth,
      and in summer without it. These are injured by no men, for they are said
      to be sacred, and they possess no weapon of war. These are they also who
      decide the disputes rising among their neighbours; and besides this,
      whatever fugitive takes refuge with them is injured by no one: and they
      are called Argippaians. <a href="#link4note-30" id="link4noteref-30" class="pginternal">30</a>
</p>
<p>
      24. Now as far as these bald-headed men there is abundantly clear
      information about the land and about the nations on this side of them; for
      not only do certain of the Scythians go to them, from whom it is not
      difficult to get information, but also some of the Hellenes who are at the
      trading-station of the Borysthenes and the other trading-places of the
      Pontic coast: and those of the Scythians who go to them transact their
      business through seven interpreters and in seven different languages.
    </p>
<p>
      25. So far as these, I say, the land is known; but concerning the region
      to the North of the bald-headed men no one can speak with certainty, for
      lofty and impassable mountains divide it off, and no one passes over them.
      However these bald-headed men say (though I do not believe it) that the
      mountains are inhabited by men with goats' feet; and that after one has
      passed beyond these, others are found who sleep through six months of the
      year. This I do not admit at all as true. However, the country to the East
      of the bald-headed men is known with certainty, being inhabited by the
      Issedonians, but that which lies beyond both the bald-headed men and the
      Issedonians towards the North Wind is unknown, except so far as we know it
      from the accounts given by these nations which have just been mentioned.
    </p>
<p>
      26. The Issedonians are said to have these customs:—when a man's
      father is dead, all the relations bring cattle to the house, and then
      having slain them and cut up the flesh, they cut up also the dead body of
      the father of their entertainer, and mixing all the flesh together they
      set forth a banquet. His skull however they strip of the flesh and clean
      it out and then gild it over, and after that they deal with it as a sacred
      thing <a href="#link4note-31" id="link4noteref-31" class="pginternal">31</a>
      and perform for the dead man great sacrifices every year. This each son
      does for his father, just as the Hellenes keep the day of memorial for the
      dead. <a href="#link4note-32" id="link4noteref-32" class="pginternal">32</a>
      In other respects however this race also is said to live righteously, and
      their women have equal rights with the men.
    </p>
<p>
      27. These then also are known; but as to the region beyond them, it is the
      Issedonians who report that there are there one-eyed men and gold-guarding
      griffins; and the Scythians report this having received it from them, and
      from the Scythians we, that is the rest of mankind, have got our belief;
      and we call them in Scythian language Arimaspians, for the Scythians call
      the number one <i>arima</i> and the eye <i>spu</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      28. This whole land which has been described is so exceedingly severe in
      climate, that for eight months of the year there is frost so hard as to be
      intolerable; and during these if you pour out water you will not be able
      to make mud, but only if you kindle a fire can you make it; and the sea is
      frozen and the whole of the Kimmerian Bosphorus, so that the Scythians who
      are settled within the trench make expeditions and drive their waggons
      over into the country of the Sindians. Thus it continues to be winter for
      eight months, and even for the remaining four it is cold in those parts.
      This winter is distinguished in its character from all the winters which
      come in other parts of the world; for in it there is no rain to speak of
      at the usual season for rain, whereas in summer it rains continually; and
      thunder does not come at the time when it comes in other countries, but is
      very frequent, <a href="#link4note-33" id="link4noteref-33" class="pginternal">33</a> in the summer; and if thunder comes in winter,
      it is marvelled at as a prodigy: just so, if an earthquake happens,
      whether in summer or in winter, it is accounted a prodigy in Scythia.
      Horses are able to endure this winter, but neither mules nor asses can
      endure it at all, whereas in other countries horses if they stand in frost
      lose their limbs by mortification, while asses and mules endure it.
    </p>
<p>
      29. I think also that it is for this reason that the hornless breed of
      oxen in that country have no horns growing; and there is a verse of Homer
      in the Odyssey <a href="#link4note-34" id="link4noteref-34" class="pginternal">34</a> supporting my opinion, which runs this:—
    </p>
<pre>
 "Also the Libyan land, where the sheep very quickly grow hornèd,"
</pre>
<p>
      for it is rightly said that in hot regions the horns come quickly, whereas
      in extreme cold the animals either have no horns growing at all, or hardly
      any. <a href="#link4note-35" id="link4noteref-35" class="pginternal">35</a>
</p>
<p>
      30. In that land then this takes place on account of the cold; but (since
      my history proceeded from the first seeking occasions for digression) <a href="#link4note-36" id="link4noteref-36" class="pginternal">36</a> I
      feel wonder that in the whole land of Elis mules cannot be bred, though
      that region is not cold, nor is there any other evident cause. The Eleians
      themselves say that in consequence of some curse mules are not begotten in
      their land; but when the time approaches for the mares to conceive, they
      drive them out into the neighbouring lands and there in the land of their
      neighbours they admit to them the he-asses until the mares are pregnant,
      and then they drive them back.
    </p>
<p>
      31. As to the feathers of which the Scythians say that the air is full,
      and that by reason of them they are not able either to see or to pass
      through the further parts of the continent, the opinion which I have is
      this:—in the parts beyond this land it snows continually, though
      less in summer than in winter, as might be supposed. Now whomsoever has
      seen close at hand snow falling thickly, knows what I mean without further
      explanation, for the snow is like feathers: and on account of this wintry
      weather, being such as I have said, the Northern parts of this continent
      are uninhabitable. I think therefore that by the feathers the Scythians
      and those who dwell near them mean symbolically the snow. This then which
      has been said goes to the furthest extent of the accounts given.
    </p>
<p>
      32. About a Hyperborean people the Scythians report nothing, nor do any of
      those who dwell in this region, unless it be the Issedonians: but in my
      opinion neither do these report anything; for if they did the Scythians
      also would report it, as they do about the one-eyed people. Hesiod however
      has spoken of Hyperboreans, and so also has Homer in the poem of the
      "Epigonoi," at least if Homer was really the composer of that Epic.
    </p>
<p>
      33. But much more about them is reported by the people of Delos than by
      any others. For these say that sacred offerings bound up in wheat straw
      are carried from the land of the Hyperboreans and come to the Scythians,
      and then from the Scythians the neighbouring nations in succession receive
      them and convey them Westwards, finally as far as the Adriatic: thence
      they are sent forward towards the South, and the people of Dodona receive
      them first of all the Hellenes, and from these they come down to the
      Malian gulf and are passed over to Euboea, where city sends them on to
      city till they come to Carystos. After this Andros is left out, for the
      Carystians are those who bring them to Tenos, and the Tenians to Delos.
      Thus they say that these sacred offerings come to Delos; but at first,
      they say, the Hyperboreans sent two maidens bearing the sacred offerings,
      whose names, say the Delians, were Hyperoche and Laodike, and with them
      for their protection the Hyperboreans sent five men of their nation to
      attend them, those namely who are now called <i>Perphereës</i> and have
      great honours paid to them in Delos. Since however the Hyperboreans found
      that those who were sent away did not return back, they were troubled to
      think that it would always befall them to send out and not to receive
      back; and so they bore the offerings to the borders of their land bound up
      in wheat straw, and laid a charge upon their neighbours, bidding them send
      these forward from themselves to another nation. These things then, they
      say, come to Delos being thus sent forward; and I know of my own knowledge
      that a thing is done which has resemblance to these offerings, namely that
      the women of Thrace and Paionia, when they sacrifice to Artemis "the
      Queen," do not make their offerings without wheat straw.
    </p>
<p>
      34. These I know do as I have said; and for those maidens from the
      Hyperboreans, who died in Delos, both the girls and the boys of the
      Delians cut off their hair: the former before marriage cut off a lock and
      having wound it round a spindle lay it upon the tomb (now the tomb is on
      the left hand as one goes into the temple of Artemis, and over it grows an
      olive-tree), and all the boys of the Delians wind some of their hair about
      a green shoot of some tree, and they also place it upon the tomb.
    </p>
<p>
      35. The maidens, I say, have this honour paid them by the dwellers in
      Delos: and the same people say that Arge and Opis also, being maidens,
      came to Delos, passing from the Hyperboreans by the same nations which
      have been mentioned, even before Hyperoche and Laodike. These last, they
      say, came bearing for Eileithuia the tribute which they had laid upon
      themselves for the speedy birth, <a href="#link4note-37" id="link4noteref-37" class="pginternal">37</a> but Arge and Opis came
      with the divinities themselves, and other honours have been assigned to
      them by the people of Delos: for the women, they say, collect for them,
      naming them by their names in the hymn which Olen a man of Lykia composed
      in their honour; and both the natives of the other islands and the Ionians
      have learnt from them to sing hymns naming Opis and Arge and collecting:—now
      this Olen came from Lukia and composed also the other ancient hymns which
      are sung in Delos:—and moreover they say that when the thighs of the
      victim are consumed upon the altar, the ashes of them are used to cast
      upon the grave of Opis and Arge. Now their grave is behind the temple of
      Artemis, turned towards the East, close to the banqueting hall of the
      Keïeans.
    </p>
<p>
      36. Let this suffice which has been said of the Hyperboreans; for the tale
      of Abaris, who is reported to have been a Hyperborean, I do not tell,
      namely <a href="#link4note-3701" id="link4noteref-3701" class="pginternal">3701</a> how he carried the arrow about all over
      the earth, eating no food. If however there are any Hyperboreans, it
      follows that there are also Hypernotians; and I laugh when I see that,
      though many before this have drawn maps of the Earth, yet no one has set
      the matter forth in an intelligent way; seeing that they draw Ocean
      flowing round the Earth, which is circular exactly as if drawn with
      compasses, and they make Asia equal in size to Europe. In a few words I
      shall declare the size of each division and of what nature it is as
      regards outline.
    </p>
<p>
      37. The Persians inhabit Asia <a href="#link4note-38" id="link4noteref-38" class="pginternal">38</a> extending to the
      Southern Sea, which is called the Erythraian; and above these towards the
      North Wind dwell the Medes, and above the Medes the Saspeirians, and above
      the Saspeirians the Colchians, extending to the Northern Sea, into which
      the river Phasis runs. These four nations inhabit from sea to sea.
    </p>
<p>
      38. From them Westwards two peninsulas <a href="#link4note-39" id="link4noteref-39" class="pginternal">39</a> stretch out from Asia
      into the sea, and these I will describe. The first peninsula on the one of
      its sides, that is the Northern, stretches along beginning from the Phasis
      and extending to the sea, going along the Pontus and the Hellespont as far
      as Sigeion in the land of Troy; and on the Southern side the same
      peninsula stretches from the Myriandrian gulf, which lies near Phenicia,
      in the direction of the sea as far as the headland Triopion; and in this
      peninsula dwell thirty races of men.
    </p>
<p>
      39. This then is one of the peninsulas, and the other beginning from the
      land of the Persians stretches along to the Erythraian Sea, including
      Persia and next after it Assyria, and Arabia after Assyria: and this ends,
      or rather is commonly supposed to end, <a href="#link4note-40" id="link4noteref-40" class="pginternal">40</a> at the Arabian gulf,
      into which Dareios conducted a channel from the Nile. Now in the line
      stretching to Phenicia from the land of the Persians the land is broad and
      the space abundant, but after Phenicia this peninsula goes by the shore of
      our Sea along Palestine, Syria, and Egypt, where it ends; and in it there
      are three nations only.
    </p>
<p>
      40. These are the parts of Asia which tend towards the West from the
      Persian land; but as to those which lie beyond the Persians and Medes and
      Saspeirians and Colchians towards the East and the sunrising, on one side
      the Erythraian Sea runs along by them, and on the North both the Caspian
      Sea and the river Araxes, which flows towards the rising sun: and Asia is
      inhabited as far as the Indian land; but from this onwards towards the
      East it becomes desert, nor can any one say what manner of land it is.
    </p>
<p>
      41. Such and so large is Asia: and Libya is included in the second
      peninsula; for after Egypt Libya succeeds at once. Now about Egypt this
      peninsula is narrow, for from our Sea to the Erythraian Sea is a distance
      there of ten myriads of fathoms, <a href="#link4note-41" id="link4noteref-41" class="pginternal">41</a> which would amount to a
      thousand furlongs; but after this narrow part, the portion of the
      peninsula which is called Libya is, as it chances, extremely broad.
    </p>
<p>
      42. I wonder then at those who have parted off and divided the world into
      Libya, Asia, and Europe, since the difference between these is not small;
      for in length Europe extends along by both, while in breadth it is clear
      to me that it is beyond comparison larger; <a href="#link4note-42" id="link4noteref-42" class="pginternal">42</a> for Libya furnishes
      proofs about itself that it is surrounded by sea, except so much of it as
      borders upon Asia; and this fact was shown by Necos king of the Egyptians
      first of all those about whom we have knowledge. He when he had ceased
      digging the channel <a href="#link4note-43" id="link4noteref-43" class="pginternal">43</a> which goes through from the Nile to the
      Arabian gulf, sent Phenicians with ships, bidding them sail and come back
      through the Pillars of Heracles to the Northern Sea and so to Egypt. The
      Phenicians therefore set forth from the Erythraian Sea and sailed through
      the Southern Sea; and when autumn came, they would put to shore and sow
      the land, wherever in Libya they might happen to be as they sailed, and
      then they waited for the harvest: and having reaped the corn they would
      sail on, so that after two years had elapsed, in the third year they
      turned through the Pillars of Heracles and arrived again in Egypt. And
      they reported a thing which I cannot believe, but another man may, namely
      that in sailing round Libya they had the sun on their right hand.
    </p>
<p>
      43. Thus was this country first known to be what it is, and after this it
      is the Carthaginians who make report of it; for as to Sataspes the son of
      Teaspis the Achaimenid, he did not sail round Libya, though he was sent
      for this very purpose, but was struck with fear by the length of the
      voyage and the desolate nature of the land, and so returned back and did
      not accomplish the task which his mother laid upon him. For this man had
      outraged a daughter of Zopyros the son of Megabyzos, a virgin; and then
      when he was about to be impaled by order of king Xerxes for this offence,
      the mother of Sataspes, who was a sister of Dareios, entreated for his
      life, saying that she would herself lay upon him a greater penalty than
      Xerxes; for he should be compelled (she said) to sail round Libya, until
      in sailing round it he came to the Arabian gulf. So then Xerxes having
      agreed upon these terms, Sataspes went to Egypt, and obtaining a ship and
      sailors from the Egyptians, he sailed to the Pillars of Heracles; and
      having sailed through them and turned the point of Libya which is called
      the promontory of Soloeis, he sailed on towards the South. Then after he
      had passed over much sea in many months, as there was needed ever more and
      more voyaging, he turned about and sailed back again to Egypt: and having
      come from thence into the presence of king Xerxes, he reported saying that
      at the furthest point which he reached he was sailing by dwarfish people,
      who used clothing made from the palm-tree, and who, whenever they came to
      land with their ship, left their towns and fled away to the mountains: and
      they, he said, did no injury when they entered into the towns, but took
      food <a href="#link4note-4301" id="link4noteref-4301" class="pginternal">4301</a> from them only. And the cause, he said,
      why he had not completely sailed round Libya was that the ship could not
      advance any further but stuck fast. Xerxes however did not believe that he
      was speaking the truth, and since he had not performed the appointed task,
      he impaled him, inflicting upon him the penalty pronounced before. A
      eunuch belonging to this Sataspes ran away to Samos as soon as he heard
      that his master was dead, carrying with him large sums of money; and of
      this a man of Samos took possession, whose name I know, but I purposely
      pass it over without mention.
    </p>
<p>
      44. Of Asia the greater part was explored by Dareios, who desiring to know
      of the river Indus, which is a second river producing crocodiles of all
      the rivers in the world,—to know, I say, of this river where it runs
      out into the sea, sent with ships, besides others whom he trusted to speak
      the truth, Skylax also, a man of Caryanda. These starting from the city of
      Caspatyros and the land of Pactyïke, sailed down the river towards the
      East and the sunrising to the sea; and then sailing over the sea Westwards
      they came in the thirtieth month to that place from whence the king of the
      Egyptians had sent out the Phenicians of whom I spoke before, to sail
      round Libya. After these had made their voyage round the coast, Dareios
      both subdued the Indians and made use of this sea. Thus Asia also,
      excepting the parts of it which are towards the rising sun, has been found
      to be similar <a href="#link4note-44" id="link4noteref-44" class="pginternal">44</a> to Libya.
    </p>
<p>
      45. As to Europe, however, it is clearly not known by any, either as
      regards the parts which are towards the rising sun or those towards the
      North, whether it be surrounded by sea: but in length it is known to
      stretch along by both the other divisions. And I am not able to understand
      for what reason it is that to the Earth, which is one, three different
      names are given derived from women, and why there were set as boundaries
      to divide it the river Nile of Egypt and the Phasis in Colchis (or as some
      say the Maiotian river Tanaïs and the Kimmerian ferry); nor can I learn
      who those persons were who made the boundaries, or for what reason they
      gave the names. Libya indeed is said by most of the Hellenes to have its
      name from Libya a woman of that country, and Asia from the wife of
      Prometheus: but this last name is claimed by the Lydians, who say that
      Asia has been called after Asias the son of Cotys the son of Manes, and
      not from Asia the wife of Prometheus; and from him too they say the Asian
      tribe in Sardis has its name. As to Europe however, it is neither known by
      any man whether it is surrounded by sea, nor does it appear whence it got
      this name or who he was who gave it, unless we shall say that the land
      received its name from Europa the Tyrian; and if so, it would appear that
      before this it was nameless like the rest. She however evidently belongs
      to Asia and did not come to this land which is now called by the Hellenes
      Europe, but only from Phenicia to Crete, and from Crete to Lykia. Let this
      suffice now which has been said about these matters; for we will adopt
      those which are commonly accepted of the accounts.
    </p>
<p>
      46. Now the region of the Euxine upon which Dareios was preparing to march
      has, apart from the Scythian race, the most ignorant nations within it of
      all lands: for we can neither put forward any nation of those who dwell
      within the region of Pontus as eminent in ability, nor do we know of any
      man of learning <a href="#link4note-45" id="link4noteref-45" class="pginternal">45</a> having arisen there, apart from the Scythian
      nation and Anacharsis. By the Scythian race one thing which is the most
      important of all human things has been found out more cleverly than by any
      other men of whom we know; but in other respects I have no great
      admiration for them: and that most important thing which they have
      discovered is such that none can escape again who has come to attack them,
      and if they do not desire to be found, it is not possible to catch them:
      for they who have neither cities founded nor walls built, but all carry
      their houses with them and are mounted archers, living not by the plough
      but by cattle, and whose dwellings are upon cars, these assuredly are
      invincible and impossible to approach.
    </p>
<p>
      47. This they have found out, seeing that their land is suitable to it and
      at the same time the rivers are their allies: for first this land is plain
      land and is grassy and well watered, and then there are rivers flowing
      through it not much less in number than the channels in Egypt. Of these as
      many as are noteworthy and also can be navigated from the sea, I will
      name: there is Ister with five mouths, and after this Tyras, Hypanis,
      Borysthenes, Panticapes, Kypakyris, Gerros and Tanaïs. These flow as I
      shall now describe.
    </p>
<p>
      48. The Ister, which is the greatest of all the rivers which we know,
      flows always with equal volume in summer and winter alike. It is the first
      towards the West of all the Scythian rivers, and it has become the
      greatest of all rivers because other rivers flow into it. And these are
      they which make it great: <a href="#link4note-46" id="link4noteref-46" class="pginternal">46</a>—five in number are those <a href="#link4note-47" id="link4noteref-47" class="pginternal">47</a>
      which flow through the Scythian land, namely that which the Scythians call
      Porata and the Hellenes Pyretos, and besides this, Tiarantos and Araros
      and Naparis and Ordessos. The first-mentioned of these is a great river
      lying towards the East, and there it joins waters with the Ister, the
      second Tiarantos is more to the West and smaller, and the Araros and
      Naparis and Ordessos flow into the Ister going between these two.
    </p>
<p>
      49. These are the native Scythian rivers which join to swell its stream,
      while from the Agathyrsians flows the Maris and joins the Ister, and from
      the summits of Haimos flow three other great rivers towards the North Wind
      and fall into it, namely Atlas and Auras and Tibisis. Through Thrace and
      the Thracian Crobyzians flow the rivers Athrys and Noes and Artanes,
      running into the Ister; and from the Paionians and Mount Rhodope the river
      Kios, <a href="#link4note-48" id="link4noteref-48" class="pginternal">48</a>
      cutting through Haimos in the midst, runs into it also. From the Illyrians
      the river Angros flows Northwards and runs out into the Triballian plain
      and into the river Brongos, and the Brongos flows into the Ister; thus the
      Ister receives both these, being great rivers. From the region which is
      above the Ombricans, the river Carpis and another river, the Alpis, flow
      also towards the North Wind and run into it; for the Ister flows in fact
      through the whole of Europe, beginning in the land of the Keltoi, who
      after the Kynesians dwell furthest towards the sun-setting of all the
      peoples of Europe; and thus flowing through all Europe it falls into the
      sea by the side of Scythia.
    </p>
<p>
      50. So then it is because these which have been named and many others join
      their waters together, that Ister becomes the greatest of rivers; since if
      we compare the single streams, the Nile is superior in volume of water;
      for into this no river or spring flows, to contribute to its volume. And
      the Ister flows at an equal level always both in summer and in winter for
      some such cause as this, as I suppose:—in winter it is of the
      natural size, or becomes only a little larger than its nature, seeing that
      this land receives very little rain in winter, but constantly has snow;
      whereas in summer the snow which fell in the winter, in quantity abundant,
      melts and runs from all parts into the Ister. This snow of which I speak,
      running into the river helps to swell its volume, and with it also many
      and violent showers of rain, for it rains during the summer: and thus the
      waters which mingle with the Ister are more copious in summer than they
      are in winter by about as much as the water which the Sun draws to himself
      in summer exceeds that which he draws in winter; and by the setting of
      these things against one another there is produced a balance; so that the
      river is seen to be of equal volume always.
    </p>
<p>
      51. One, I say, of the rivers which the Scythians have is the Ister; and
      after it the Tyras, which starts from the North and begins its course from
      a large lake which is the boundary between the land of the Scythians and
      that of the Neuroi. At its mouth are settled those Hellenes who are called
      Tyritai.
    </p>
<p>
      52. The third river is the Hypanis, which starts from Scythia and flows
      from a great lake round which feed white wild horses; and this lake is
      rightly called "Mother of Hypanis." From this then the river Hypanis takes
      its rise and for a distance of five days' sail it flows shallow and with
      sweet water still; <a href="#link4note-49" id="link4noteref-49" class="pginternal">49</a> but from this point on towards the sea for
      four days' sail it is very bitter, for there flows into it the water of a
      bitter spring, which is so exceedingly bitter that, small as it is, it
      changes the water of the Hypanis by mingling with it, though that is a
      river to which few are equal in greatness. This spring is on the border
      between the lands of the agricultural Scythians and of the Alazonians, and
      the name of the spring and of the place from which it flows is in Scythian
      Exampaios, and in the Hellenic tongue Hierai Hodoi. <a href="#link4note-50" id="link4noteref-50" class="pginternal">50</a> Now the Tyras and the
      Hypanis approach one another in their windings in the land of the
      Alazonians, but after this each turns off and widens the space between
      them as they flow.
    </p>
<p>
      53. Fourth is the river Borysthenes, which is both the largest of these
      after the Ister, and also in our opinion the most serviceable not only of
      the Scythian rivers but also of all the rivers of the world besides,
      excepting only the Nile of Egypt, for to this it is not possible to
      compare any other river: of the rest however the Borysthenes is the most
      serviceable, seeing that it provides both pastures which are the fairest
      and the richest for cattle, and fish which are better by far and more
      numerous than those of any other river, and also it is the sweetest water
      to drink, and flows with clear stream, though others beside it are turbid,
      and along its banks crops are produced better than elsewhere, while in
      parts where it is not sown, grass grows deeper. Moreover at its mouth salt
      forms of itself in abundance, and it produces also huge fish without
      spines, which they call <i>antacaioi</i>, to be used for salting, and many
      other things also worthy of wonder. Now as far as the region of the
      Gerrians, <a href="#link4note-51" id="link4noteref-51" class="pginternal">51</a> to which it is a voyage of forty <a href="#link4note-52" id="link4noteref-52" class="pginternal">52</a>
      days, the Borysthenes is known as flowing from the North Wind; but above
      this none can tell through what nations it flows: it is certain however
      that it runs through desert <a href="#link4note-53" id="link4noteref-53" class="pginternal">53</a> to the land of the agricultural Scythians; for
      these Scythians dwell along its banks for a distance of ten days' sail. Of
      this river alone and of the Nile I cannot tell where the sources are, nor,
      I think, can any of the Hellenes. When the Borysthenes comes near the sea
      in its course, the Hypanis mingles with it, running out into the same
      marsh; <a href="#link4note-5301" id="link4noteref-5301" class="pginternal">5301</a> and the space between these two rivers,
      which is as it were a beak of land, <a href="#link4note-54" id="link4noteref-54" class="pginternal">54</a> is called the point of
      Hippoles, and in it is placed a temple of the Mother, <a href="#link4note-55" id="link4noteref-55" class="pginternal">55</a>
      and opposite the temple upon the river Hypanis are settled the
      Borysthenites.
    </p>
<p>
      54. This is that which has to do with these rivers; and after these there
      is a fifth river besides, called Panticapes. This also flows <a href="#link4note-56" id="link4noteref-56" class="pginternal">56</a>
      both from the North and from a lake, and in the space between this river
      and the Borysthenes dwell the agricultural Scythians: it runs out into the
      region of Hylaia, and having passed by this it mingles with the
      Borysthenes.
    </p>
<p>
      55. Sixth comes the river Hypakyris, which starts from a lake, and flowing
      through the midst of the nomad Scythians runs out into the sea by the city
      of Carkinitis, skirting on its right bank the region of Hylaia and the
      so-called racecourse of Achilles.
    </p>
<p>
      56. Seventh is the Gerros, which parts off from the Borysthenes near about
      that part of the country where the Borysthenes ceases to be known,—it
      parts off, I say, in this region and has the same name which this region
      itself has, namely Gerros; and as it flows to the sea it borders the
      country of the nomad and that of the Royal Scythians, and runs out into
      the Hypakyris.
    </p>
<p>
      57. The eighth is the river Tanaïs, which starts in its flow at first from
      a large lake, and runs out into a still larger lake called Maiotis, which
      is the boundary between the Royal Scythians and the Sauromatai. Into this
      Tanaïs falls another river, whose name is Hyrgis.
    </p>
<p>
      58. So many are the rivers of note with which the Scythians are provided:
      and for cattle the grass which comes up in the land of Scythia is the most
      productive of bile of any grass which we know; and that this is so you may
      judge when you open the bodies of the cattle.
    </p>
<p>
      59. Thus abundant supply have they of that which is most important; and as
      for the rest their customs are as follows. The gods whom they propitiate
      by worship are these only:—Hestia most of all, then Zeus and the
      Earth, supposing that Earth is the wife of Zeus, and after these Apollo,
      and Aphrodite Urania, and Heracles, and Ares. Of these all the Scythians
      have the worship established, and the so-called Royal Scythians sacrifice
      also to Poseidon. Now Hestia is called in Scythian Tabiti, and Zeus, being
      most rightly named in my opinion, is called Papaios, and Earth Api, <a href="#link4note-57" id="link4noteref-57" class="pginternal">57</a>
      and Apollo Oitosyros, <a href="#link4note-58" id="link4noteref-58" class="pginternal">58</a> and Aphrodite Urania is called Argimpasa, <a href="#link4note-59" id="link4noteref-59" class="pginternal">59</a>
      and Poseidon Thagimasidas. <a href="#link4note-60" id="link4noteref-60" class="pginternal">60</a> It is not their custom however to make images,
      altars or temples to any except Ares, but to him it is their custom to
      make them.
    </p>
<p>
      60. They have all the same manner of sacrifice established for all their
      religious rites equally, and it is thus performed:—the victim stands
      with its fore-feet tied, and the sacrificing priest stands behind the
      victim, and by pulling the end of the cord he throws the beast down; and
      as the victim falls, he calls upon the god to whom he is sacrificing, and
      then at once throws a noose round its neck, and putting a small stick into
      it he turns it round and so strangles the animal, without either lighting
      a fire or making any first offering from the victim or pouring any
      libation over it: and when he has strangled it and flayed off the skin, he
      proceeds to boil it.
    </p>
<p>
      61. Now as the land of Scythia is exceedingly ill wooded, this contrivance
      has been invented for the boiling of the flesh:—having flayed the
      victims, they strip the flesh off the bones and then put it into caldrons,
      if they happen to have any, of native make, which very much resemble
      Lesbian mixing-bowls except that they are much larger,—into these
      they put the flesh and boil it by lighting under it the bones of the
      victim: if however thy have not at hand the caldron, they put all the
      flesh into the stomachs of the victims and adding water they light the
      bones under them; and these blaze up beautifully, and the stomachs easily
      hold the flesh when it has been stripped off the bones: thus an ox is made
      to boil itself, and the other kinds of victims each boil themselves also.
      Then when the flesh is boiled, the sacrificer takes a first offering of
      the flesh and of the vital organs and casts it in front of him. And they
      sacrifice various kinds of cattle, but especially horses.
    </p>
<p>
      62. To the others of the gods they sacrifice thus and these kinds of
      beasts, but to Ares as follows:—In each district of the several
      governments <a href="#link4note-61" id="link4noteref-61" class="pginternal">61</a> they have a temple of Ares set up in this way:—bundles
      of brushwood are heaped up for about three furlongs <a href="#link4note-62" id="link4noteref-62" class="pginternal">62</a> in length and in
      breadth, but less in height; and on the top of this there is a level
      square made, and three of the sides rise sheer but by the remaining one
      side the pile may be ascended. Every year they pile on a hundred and fifty
      waggon-loads of brushwood, for it is constantly settling down by reason of
      the weather. <a href="#link4note-63" id="link4noteref-63" class="pginternal">63</a> Upon this pile of which I speak each people
      has an ancient iron sword <a href="#link4note-64" id="link4noteref-64" class="pginternal">64</a> set up, and this is the sacred symbol <a href="#link4note-65" id="link4noteref-65" class="pginternal">65</a> of
      Ares. To this sword they bring yearly offerings of cattle and of horses;
      and they have the following sacrifice in addition, beyond what they make
      to the other gods, that is to say, of all the enemies whom they take
      captive in war they sacrifice one man in every hundred, not in the same
      manner as they sacrifice cattle, but in a different manner: for they first
      pour wine over their heads, and after that they cut the throats of the
      men, so that the blood runs into a bowl; and then they carry this up to
      the top of the pile of brushwood and pour the blood over the sword. This,
      I say, they carry up; and meanwhile below by the side of the temple they
      are doing thus:—they cut off all the right arms of the slaughtered
      men with the hands and throw them up into the air, and then when they have
      finished offering the other victims, they go away; and the arm lies
      wheresoever it has chanced to fall, and the corpse apart from it.
    </p>
<p>
      63. Such are the sacrifices which are established among them; but of swine
      these make no use, nor indeed are they wont to keep them at all in their
      land.
    </p>
<p>
      64. That which relates to war is thus ordered with them:—When a
      Scythian has slain his first man, he drinks some of his blood: and of all
      those whom he slays in the battle he bears the heads to the king; for if
      he has brought a head he shares in the spoil which they have taken, but
      otherwise not. And he takes off the skin of the head by cutting it round
      about the ears and then taking hold of the scalp and shaking it off;
      afterwards he scrapes off the flesh with the rib of an ox, and works the
      skin about with his hands; and when he has thus tempered it, he keeps it
      as a napkin to wipe the hands upon, and hangs it from the bridle of the
      horse on which he himself rides, and takes pride in it; for whosoever has
      the greatest number of skins to wipe the hands upon, he is judged to be
      the bravest man. Many also make cloaks to wear of the skins stripped off,
      sewing them together like shepherds' cloaks of skins; <a href="#link4note-66" id="link4noteref-66" class="pginternal">66</a>
      and many take the skin together with the finger-nails off the right hands
      of their enemies when they are dead, and make them into covers for their
      quivers: now human skin it seems is both thick and glossy in appearance,
      more brilliantly white than any other skin. Many also take the skins off
      the whole bodies of men and stretch them on pieces of wood and carry them
      about on their horses.
    </p>
<p>
      65. Such are their established customs about these things; and to the
      skulls themselves, not of all but of their greatest enemies, they do thus:—the
      man saws off all below the eyebrows and clears out the inside; and if he
      is a poor man he only stretches ox-hide round it and then makes use of it;
      but if he be rich, besides stretching the ox-hide he gilds it over within,
      and makes use of it as a drinking-cup. They do this also if any of their
      own family have been at variance with them and the man gets the better of
      his adversary in trial before the king; and when strangers come to him
      whom he highly esteems, he sets these skulls before them, and adds the
      comment that they being of his own family had made war against him, and
      that he had got the better of them; and this they hold to be a proof of
      manly virtue.
    </p>
<p>
      66. Once every year each ruler of a district mixes in his own district a
      bowl of wine, from which those of the Scythians drink by whom enemies have
      been slain; but those by whom this has not been done do not taste of the
      wine, but sit apart dishonoured; and this is the greatest of all disgraces
      among them: but those of them who have slain a very great number of men,
      drink with two cups together at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
      67. Diviners there are many among the Scythians, and they divine with a
      number of willow rods in the following manner:—they bring large
      bundles of rods, and having laid them on the ground they unroll them, and
      setting each rod by itself apart they prophesy; and while speaking thus,
      they roll the rods together again, and after that they place them in order
      a second time one by one. <a href="#link4note-67" id="link4noteref-67" class="pginternal">67</a> This manner of divination they have from their
      fathers: but the Enareës or "man-women" <a href="#link4note-68" id="link4noteref-68" class="pginternal">68</a> say that Aphrodite gave
      them the gift of divination, and they divine accordingly with the bark of
      the linden-tree. Having divided the linden-bark into three strips, the man
      twists them together in his fingers and untwists them again, and as he
      does this he utters the oracle.
    </p>
<p>
      68. When the king of the Scythians is sick, he sends for three of the
      diviners, namely those who are most in repute, who divine in the manner
      which has been said: and these say for the most part something like this,
      namely that so and so has sworn falsely by the hearth of the king, and
      they name one of the citizens, whosoever it may happen to be: now it is
      the prevailing custom of the Scythians to swear by the hearth of the king
      at the times when they desire to swear the most solemn oath. He then who
      they say has sworn falsely, is brought forthwith held fast on both sides;
      and when he has come the diviners charge him with this, that he is shown
      by their divination to have sworn falsely by the hearth of the king, and
      that for this reason the king is suffering pain: and he denies and says
      that he did not swear falsely, and complains indignantly: and when he
      denies it, the king sends for other diviners twice as many in number, and
      if these also by looking into their divination pronounce him guilty of
      having sworn falsely, at once they cut off the man's head, and the
      diviners who came first part his goods among them by lot; but if the
      diviners who came in afterwards acquit him, other diviners come in, and
      again others after them. If then the greater number acquit the man, the
      sentence is that the first diviners shall themselves be put to death.
    </p>
<p>
      69. They put them to death accordingly in the following manner:—first
      they fill a waggon with brushwood and yoke oxen to it; then having bound
      the feet of the diviners and tied their hands behind them and stopped
      their mouths with gags, they fasten them down in the middle of the
      brushwood, and having set fire to it they scare the oxen and let them go:
      and often the oxen are burnt to death together with the diviners, and
      often they escape after being scorched, when the pole to which they are
      fastened has been burnt: and they burn the diviners in the manner
      described for other causes also, calling them false prophets. Now when the
      king puts any to death, he does not leave alive their sons either, but he
      puts to death all the males, not doing any hurt to the females.
    </p>
<p>
      70. In the following manner the Scythians make oaths to whomsoever they
      make them:—they pour wine into a great earthenware cup and mingle
      with it blood of those who are taking the oath to one another, either
      making a prick with an awl or cutting with a dagger a little way into
      their body, and then they dip into the cup a sword and arrows and a
      battle-axe and a javelin; and having done this, they invoke many curses on
      the breaker of the oath, and afterwards they drink it off, both they who
      are making the oath and the most honourable of their company.
    </p>
<p>
      71. The burial-place of the kings is in the land of the Gerrians, the
      place up to which the Borysthenes is navigable. In this place, when their
      king has died, they make a large square excavation in the earth; and when
      they have made this ready, they take up the corpse (the body being covered
      over with wax and the belly ripped up and cleansed, and then sewn together
      again, after it has been filled with <i>kyperos</i> <a href="#link4note-69" id="link4noteref-69" class="pginternal">69</a> cut up and spices and
      parsley-seed and anise), and they convey it in a waggon to another nation.
      Then those who receive the corpse thus conveyed to them do the same as the
      Royal Scythians, that is they cut off a part of their ear and shave their
      hair round about and cut themselves all over the arms and tear their
      forehead and nose and pass arrows through their left hand. Thence they
      convey in the waggon the corpse of the king to another of the nations over
      whom they rule; and they to whom they came before accompany them: and when
      they have gone round to all conveying the corpse, then they are in the
      land of the Gerrians, who have their settlements furthest away of all the
      nations over whom they rule, and they have reached the spot where the
      burial place is. After that, having placed the corpse in the tomb upon a
      bed of leaves, they stick spears along on this side and that of the corpse
      and stretch pieces of wood over them, and then they cover the place in
      with matting. Then they strangle and bury in the remaining space of the
      tomb one of the king's mistresses, his cup-bearer, his cook, his
      horse-keeper, his attendant, and his bearer of messages, and also horses,
      and a first portion of all things else, and cups of gold; for silver they
      do not use at all, nor yet bronze. <a href="#link4note-70" id="link4noteref-70" class="pginternal">70</a> Having thus done they
      all join together to pile up a great mound, vying with one another and
      zealously endeavouring to make it as large as possible.
    </p>
<p>
      72. Afterwards, when the year comes round again, they do as follows:—they
      take the most capable of the remaining servants,—and these are
      native Scythians, for those serve him whom the king himself commands to do
      so, and his servants are not bought for money,—of these attendants
      then they strangle fifty and also fifty of the finest horses; and when
      they have taken out their bowels and cleansed the belly, they fill it with
      chaff and sew it together again. Then they set the half of a wheel upon
      two stakes with the hollow side upwards, and the other half of the wheel
      upon other two stakes, and in this manner they fix a number of these; and
      after this they run thick stakes through the length of the horses as far
      as the necks, and they mount them upon the wheels; and the front pieces of
      wheel support the shoulders of the horses, while those behind bear up
      their bellies, going by the side of the thighs; and both front and hind
      legs hang in the air. On the horses they put bridles and bits, and stretch
      the bridles tight in front of them and then tie them up to pegs: and of
      the fifty young men who have been strangled they mount each one upon his
      horse, having first <a href="#link4note-71" id="link4noteref-71" class="pginternal">71</a> run a straight stake through each body along
      by the spine up to the neck; and a part of this stake projects below,
      which they fasten into a socket made in the other stake that runs through
      the horse. Having set horsemen such as I have described in a circle round
      the tomb, they then ride away.
    </p>
<p>
      73. Thus they bury their kings; but as for the other Scythians, when they
      die their nearest relations carry them round laid in waggons to their
      friends in succession; and of them each one when he receives the body
      entertains those who accompany it, and before the corpse they serve up of
      all things about the same quantity as before the others. Thus private
      persons are carried about for forty days, and then they are buried: and
      after burying them the Scythians cleanse themselves in the following way:—they
      soap their heads and wash them well, and then, for their body, they set up
      three stakes leaning towards one another and about them they stretch
      woollen felt coverings, and when they have closed them as much as possible
      they throw stones heated red-hot into a basin placed in the middle of the
      stakes and the felt coverings.
    </p>
<p>
      74. Now they have hemp growing in their land, which is very like flax
      except in thickness and in height, for in these respects the hemp is much
      superior. This grows both of itself and with cultivation; and of it the
      Thracians even make garments, which are very like those made of flaxen
      thread, so that he who was not specially conversant with it would not be
      able to decide whether the garments were of flax or of hemp; and he who
      had not before seen stuff woven of hemp would suppose that the garment was
      made of flax.
    </p>
<p>
      75. The Scythians then take the seed of this hemp and creep under the felt
      coverings, and then they throw the seed upon the stones which have been
      heated red-hot: and it burns like incense and produces a vapour so thick
      that no vapour-bath in Hellas would surpass it: and the Scythians being
      delighted with the vapour-bath howl like wolves. <a href="#link4note-72" id="link4noteref-72" class="pginternal">72</a> This is to them instead
      of washing, for in fact they do not wash their bodies at all in water.
      Their women however pound with a rough stone the wood of the cypress and
      cedar and frankincense tree, pouring in water with it, and then with this
      pounded stuff, which is thick, they plaster over all their body and also
      their face; and not only does a sweet smell attach to them by reason of
      this, but also when they take off the plaster on the next day, their skin
      is clean and shining.
    </p>
<p>
      76. This nation also <a href="#link4note-73" id="link4noteref-73" class="pginternal">73</a> is very averse to adopting strange customs,
      rejecting even those of other tribes among themselves, <a href="#link4note-74" id="link4noteref-74" class="pginternal">74</a>
      but especially those of the Hellenes, as the history of Anacharsis and
      also afterwards of Skyles proved. <a href="#link4note-75" id="link4noteref-75" class="pginternal">75</a> For as to Anacharsis
      first, when he was returning to the abodes of the Scythians, after having
      visited many lands <a href="#link4note-76" id="link4noteref-76" class="pginternal">76</a> and displayed in them much wisdom, as he
      sailed through the Hellespont he put in to Kyzicos: and since he found the
      people of Kyzicos celebrating a festival very magnificently in honour of
      the Mother of the gods, Anacharsis vowed to the Mother that if he should
      return safe and sound to his own land, he would both sacrifice to her with
      the same rites as he saw the men of Kyzicos do, and also hold a night
      festival. So when he came to Scythia he went down into the region called
      Hylaia (this is along by the side of the racecourse of Achilles and is
      quite full, as it happens, of trees of all kinds),—into this, I say,
      Anacharsis went down, and proceeded to perform all the ceremonies of the
      festival in honour of the goddess, with a kettle-drum and with images hung
      about himself. And one of the Scythians perceived him doing this and
      declared it to Saulios the king; and the king came himself also, and when
      he saw Anacharsis doing this, he shot him with an arrow and killed him.
      Accordingly at the present time if one asks about Anacharsis, the
      Scythians say that they do not know him, and for this reason, because he
      went out of his own country to Hellas and adopted foreign customs. And as
      I heard from Tymnes the steward <a href="#link4note-77" id="link4noteref-77" class="pginternal">77</a> of Ariapeithes, he was
      the uncle on the father's side of Idanthyrsos king of the Scythians, and
      the son of Gnuros, the son of Lycos, the son of Spargapeithes. If then
      Anacharsis was of this house, let him know that he died by the hand of his
      brother, for Idanthyrsos was the son of Saulios, and Saulios was he who
      killed Anacharsis.
    </p>
<p>
      77. However I have heard also another story, told by the Peloponnesians,
      that Anacharsis was sent out by the king of the Scythians, and so made
      himself a disciple of Hellas; and that when he returned back he said to
      him that had sent him forth, that the Hellenes were all busied about every
      kind of cleverness except the Lacedemonians; but these alone knew how to
      exchange speech sensibly. This story however has been invented <a href="#link4note-78" id="link4noteref-78" class="pginternal">78</a>
      without any ground by the Hellenes themselves; and however that may be,
      the man was slain in the way that was related above.
    </p>
<p>
      78. This man then fared thus badly by reason of foreign customs and
      communication with Hellenes; and very many years afterwards Skyles the son
      of Ariapeithes suffered nearly the same fate as he. For Ariapeithes the
      king of the Scythians with other sons had Skyles born to him: and he was
      born of a woman who was of Istria, and certainly not a native of Scythia;
      and this mother taught him the language and letters of Hellas. Afterwards
      in course of time Ariapeithes was brought to his end by treachery at the
      hands of Spargapeithes the king of the Agathyrsians, and Skyles succeeded
      to the kingdom; and he took not only that but also the wife of his father,
      whose name was Opoia: this Opoia was a native Scythian and from her was
      born Oricos to Ariapeithes. Now when Skyles was king of the Scythians, he
      was by no means satisfied with the Scythian manner of life, but was much
      more inclined towards Hellenic ways because of the training with which he
      had been brought up, and he used to do somewhat as follows:—When he
      came with the Scythians in arms to the city of the Borysthenites (now
      these Borysthenites say that they are of Miletos),—when Skyles came
      to these, he would leave his band in the suburbs of the city and go
      himself within the walls and close the gates. After that he would lay
      aside his Scythian equipments and take Hellenic garments, and wearing them
      he would go about in the market-place with no guards or any other man
      accompanying him (and they watched the gates meanwhile, that none of the
      Scythians might see him wearing this dress): and while in other respects
      too he adopted Hellenic manners of life, he used also to perform worship
      to the gods according to the customs of the Hellenes. Then having stayed a
      month or more than that, he would put on the Scythian dress and depart.
      This he did many times, and he both built for himself a house in
      Borysthenes and also took to it a woman of the place as his wife.
    </p>
<p>
      79. Since however it was fated that evil should happen to him, it happened
      by an occasion of this kind:—he formed a desire to be initiated in
      the rites of Bacchus-Dionysos, and as he was just about to receive <a href="#link4note-79" id="link4noteref-79" class="pginternal">79</a>
      the initiation, there happened a very great portent. He had in the city of
      the Borysthenites a house of great size and built with large expense, of
      which also I made mention a little before this, and round it were placed
      sphinxes and griffins of white stone: on this house Zeus <a href="#link4note-7901" id="link4noteref-7901" class="pginternal">7901</a>
      caused a bolt to fall; and the house was altogether burnt down, but Skyles
      none the less for this completed his initiation. Now the Scythians make
      the rites of Bacchus a reproach against the Hellenes, for they say that it
      is not fitting to invent a god like this, who impels men to frenzy. So
      when Skyles had been initiated into the rites of Bacchus, one of the
      Borysthenites went off <a href="#link4note-80" id="link4noteref-80" class="pginternal">80</a> to the Scythians and said: "Whereas ye laugh
      at us, O Scythians, because we perform the rite of Bacchus and because the
      god seizes us, now this divinity has seized also your king; and he is both
      joining in the rite of Bacchus and maddened by the influence of the god.
      And if ye disbelieve me, follow and I will show you." The chief men of the
      Scythians followed him, and the Borysthenite led them secretly into the
      town and set them upon a tower. So when Skyles passed by with the company
      of revellers, and the Scythians saw him joining in the rite of Bacchus,
      they were exceedingly grieved at it, and they went out and declared to the
      whole band that which they had seen.
    </p>
<p>
      80. After this when Skyles was riding out again to his own abode, the
      Scythians took his brother Octamasades for their leader, who was a son of
      the daughter of Teres, and made insurrection against Skyles. He then when
      he perceived that which was being done to his hurt and for what reason it
      was being done, fled for refuge to Thrace; and Octamasades being informed
      of this, proceeded to march upon Thrace. So when he had arrived at the
      river Ister, the Thracians met him; and as they were about to engage
      battle, Sitalkes sent a messenger to Octamasades and said: "Why must we
      make trial of one another in fight? Thou art my sister's son and thou hast
      in thy power my brother. Do thou give him back to me, and I will deliver
      to thee thy brother Skyles: and let us not either of us set our armies in
      peril, either thou or I." Thus Sitalkes proposed to him by a herald; for
      there was with Octamasades a brother of Sitalkes, who had gone into exile
      for fear of him. And Octamasades agreed to this, and by giving up his own
      mother's brother to Sitalkes he received his brother Skyles in exchange:
      and Sitalkes when he received his brother led him away as a prisoner, but
      Octamasades cut off the head of Skyles there upon the spot. Thus do the
      Scythians carefully guard their own customary observances, and such are
      the penalties which they inflict upon those who acquire foreign customs
      besides their own.
    </p>
<p>
      81. How many the Scythians are I was not able to ascertain precisely, but
      I heard various reports of the number: for reports say both that they are
      very many in number and also that they are few, at least as regards the
      true Scythians. <a href="#link4note-81" id="link4noteref-81" class="pginternal">81</a> Thus far however they gave me evidence of my
      own eyesight:—there is between the river Borysthenes and the Hypanis
      a place called Exampaios, of which also I made mention somewhat before
      this, saying that there was in it a spring of bitter water, from which the
      water flows and makes the river Hypanis unfit to drink. In this place
      there is set a bronze bowl, in size at least six times as large as the
      mixing-bowl at the entrance of the Pontus, which Pausanias the son of
      Cleombrotos dedicated: and for him who has never seen that, I will make
      the matter clear by saying that the bowl in Scythia holds easily six
      hundred amphors, <a href="#link4note-82" id="link4noteref-82" class="pginternal">82</a> and the thickness of this Scythian bowl is six
      fingers. This then the natives of the place told me had been made of
      arrow-heads: for their king, they said, whose name was Ariantas, wishing
      to know how many the Scythians were, ordered all the Scythians to bring
      one arrow-head, each from his own arrow, and whosoever should not bring
      one, he threatened with death. So a great multitude of arrow-heads was
      brought, and he resolved to make of them a memorial and to leave it behind
      him: from these then, they said, he made this bronze bowl and dedicated it
      in this place Exampaios.
    </p>
<p>
      82. This is what I heard about the number of the Scythians. Now this land
      has no marvellous things except that it has rivers which are by far larger
      and more numerous than those of any other land. One thing however shall be
      mentioned which it has to show, and which is worthy of wonder even besides
      the rivers and the greatness of the plain, that is to say, they point out
      a footprint of Heracles in the rock by the bank of the river Tyras, which
      in shape is like the mark of a man's foot but in size is two cubits long.
      This then is such as I have said; and I will go back now to the history
      which I was about to tell at first.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      83. While Dareios was preparing to go against the Scythians and was
      sending messengers to appoint to some the furnishing of a land-army, to
      others that of ships, and to others the bridging over of the Thracian
      Bosphorus, Artabanos, the son of Hystaspes and brother of Dareios, urged
      him by no means to make the march against the Scythians, telling him how
      difficult the Scythians were to deal with. Since however he did not
      persuade him, though he gave him good counsel, he ceased to urge; and
      Dareios, when all his preparations had been made, began to march his army
      forth from Susa.
    </p>
<p>
      84. Then one of the Persians, Oiobazos, made request to Dareios that as he
      had three sons and all were serving in the expedition, one might be left
      behind for him: and Dareios said that as he was a friend and made a
      reasonable request, he would leave behind all the sons. So Oiobazos was
      greatly rejoiced, supposing that his sons had been freed from service, but
      Dareios commanded those who had the charge of such things to put to death
      all the sons of Oiobazos.
    </p>
<p>
      85. These then were left, having been slain upon the spot where they were:
      and Dareios meanwhile set forth from Susa and arrived at the place on the
      Bosphorus where the bridge of ships had been made, in the territory of
      Chalcedon; and there he embarked in a ship and sailed to the so-called
      Kyanean rocks, which the Hellenes say formerly moved backwards and
      forwards; and taking his seat at the temple <a href="#link4note-83" id="link4noteref-83" class="pginternal">83</a> he gazed upon the
      Pontus, which is a sight well worth seeing. Of all seas indeed it is the
      most marvellous in its nature. The length of it is eleven thousand one
      hundred furlongs, <a href="#link4note-84" id="link4noteref-84" class="pginternal">84</a> and the breadth, where it is broadest, three
      thousand three hundred: and of this great Sea the mouth is but four
      furlongs broad, and the length of the mouth, that is of the neck of water
      which is called Bosphorus, where, as I said, the bridge of ships had been
      made, is not less than a hundred and twenty furlongs. This Bosphorus
      extends to the Propontis; and the Propontis, being in breadth five hundred
      furlongs and in length one thousand four hundred, has its outlet into the
      Hellespont, which is but seven furlongs broad at the narrowest place,
      though it is four hundred furlongs in length: and the Hellespont runs out
      into that expanse of sea which is called the Egean.
    </p>
<p>
      86. These measurements I have made as follows:—a ship completes on
      an average in a long day a distance of seventy thousand fathoms, and in a
      night sixty thousand. Now we know that to the river Phasis from the mouth
      of the Sea (for it is here that the Pontus is longest) is a voyage of nine
      days and eight nights, which amounts to one hundred and eleven myriads <a href="#link4note-85" id="link4noteref-85" class="pginternal">85</a> of
      fathoms; and these fathoms are eleven thousand one hundred furlongs. Then
      from the land of the Sindians to Themiskyra on the river Thermodon (for
      here is the broadest part of the Pontus) it is a voyage of three days and
      two nights, which amounts to thirty-three myriads <a href="#link4note-86" id="link4noteref-86" class="pginternal">86</a> of fathoms or three
      thousand three hundred furlongs. This Pontus then and also the Bosphorus
      and the Hellespont have been measured by me thus, and their nature is such
      as has been said: and this Pontus also has a lake which has its outlet
      into it, which lake is not much less in size than the Pontus itself, and
      it is called Maiotis and "Mother of the Pontus."
    </p>
<p>
      87. Dareios then having gazed upon the Pontus sailed back to the bridge,
      of which Mandrocles a Samian had been chief constructor; and having gazed
      upon the Bosphorus also, he set up two pillars <a href="#link4note-8601" id="link4noteref-8601" class="pginternal">8601</a> by it of white
      stone with characters cut upon them, on the one Assyrian and on the other
      Hellenic, being the names of all the nations which he was leading with
      him: and he was leading with him all over whom he was ruler. The whole
      number of them without the naval force was reckoned to be seventy myriads
      <a href="#link4note-87" id="link4noteref-87" class="pginternal">87</a>
      including cavalry, and ships had been gathered together to the number of
      six hundred. These pillars the Byzantians conveyed to their city after the
      events of which I speak, and used them for the altar of Artemis Orthosia,
      excepting one stone, which was left standing by the side of the temple of
      Dionysos in Byzantion, covered over with Assyrian characters. Now the
      place on the Bosphorus where Dareios made his bridge is, as I conclude, <a href="#link4note-8701" id="link4noteref-8701" class="pginternal">8701</a>
      midway between Byzantion and the temple at the mouth of the Pontus.
    </p>
<p>
      88. After this Dareios being pleased with the floating bridge rewarded the
      chief constructor of it, Mandrocles the Samian, with gifts tenfold; <a href="#link4note-88" id="link4noteref-88" class="pginternal">88</a>
      and as an offering from these Mandrocles had a painting made of figures to
      present the whole scene of the bridge over the Bosphorus and king Dareios
      sitting in a prominent seat and his army crossing over; this he caused to
      be painted and dedicated it as an offering in the temple of Hera, with the
      following inscription:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Bosphorus having bridged over, the straits fish-abounding, to Hera
    Mandrocleës dedicates this, of his work to record;
  A crown on himself he set, and he brought to the Samians glory,
    And for Dareios performed everything after his mind."
</pre>
<p>
      89. This memorial was made of him who constructed the bridge: and Dareios,
      after he had rewarded Mandrocles with gifts, passed over into Europe,
      having first commanded the Ionians to sail into the Pontus as far as the
      river Ister, and when they arrived at the Ister, there to wait for him,
      making a bridge meanwhile over the river; for the chief of his naval force
      were the Ionians, the Aiolians and the Hellespontians. So the fleet sailed
      through between the Kyanean rocks and made straight for the Ister; and
      then they sailed up the river a two days' voyage from the sea and
      proceeded to make a bridge across the neck, as it were, of the river,
      where the mouths of the Ister part off. Dareios meanwhile, having crossed
      the Bosphorus on the floating bridge, was advancing through Thrace, and
      when he came to the sources of the river Tearos he encamped for three
      days.
    </p>
<p>
      90. Now the Tearos is said by those who dwell near it to be the best of
      all rivers, both in other respects which tend to healing and especially
      for curing diseases of the skin <a href="#link4note-89" id="link4noteref-89" class="pginternal">89</a> both in men and in
      horses: and its springs are thirty-eight in number, flowing all from the
      same rock, of which some are cold and others warm. The way to them is of
      equal length from the city of Heraion near Perinthos and from Apollonia
      upon the Euxine Sea, that is to say two days' journey by each road. This
      Tearos runs into the river Contadesdos and the Contadesdos into the
      Agrianes and the Agrianes into the Hebros, which flows into the sea by the
      city of Ainos.
    </p>
<p>
      91. Dareios then, having come to this river and having encamped there, was
      pleased with the river and set up a pillar there also, with an inscription
      as follows: "The head-springs of the river Tearos give the best and
      fairest water of all rivers; and to them came leading an army against the
      Scythians the best and fairest of all men, Dareios the son of Hystaspes,
      of the Persians and of all the Continent king." These were the words which
      were there written.
    </p>
<p>
      92. Dareios then set out from thence and came to another river whose name
      is Artescos, which flows through the land of the Odrysians. Having come to
      this river he did as follows:—he appointed a place for his army and
      bade every man as he passed out by it place one stone in this appointed
      place: and when the army had performed this, then he marched away his army
      leaving behind great mounds of these stones.
    </p>
<p>
      93. But before he came to the Ister he conquered first the Getai, who
      believe in immortality: for the Thracians who occupy Salmydessos and are
      settled above the cities of Apollonian and Mesambria, called the Kyrmianai
      <a href="#link4note-90" id="link4noteref-90" class="pginternal">90</a>
      and the Nipsaioi, delivered themselves over to Dareios without fighting;
      but the Getai, who are the bravest and the most upright in their dealings
      of all the Thracians, having betaken themselves to obstinacy were
      forthwith subdued.
    </p>
<p>
      94. And their belief in immortality is of this kind, that is to say, they
      hold that they do not die, but that he who is killed goes to Salmoxis, <a href="#link4note-91" id="link4noteref-91" class="pginternal">91</a> a
      divinity, <a href="#link4note-92" id="link4noteref-92" class="pginternal">92</a> whom some of them call Gebeleizis; and at
      intervals of four years <a href="#link4note-93" id="link4noteref-93" class="pginternal">93</a> they send one of themselves, whomsoever the
      lot may select, as a messenger to Salmoxis, charging him with such
      requests as they have to make on each occasion; and they send him thus:—certain
      of them who are appointed for this have three javelins, and others
      meanwhile take hold on both sides of him who is being sent to Salmoxis,
      both by his hands and his feet, and first they swing him up, then throw
      him into the air so as to fall upon the spear-points: and if when he is
      pierced through he is killed, they think that the god is favourable to
      them; but if he is not killed, they find fault with the messenger himself,
      calling him a worthless man, and then having found fault with him they
      send another: and they give him the charge beforehand, while he is yet
      alive. These same Thracians also shoot arrows up towards the sky when
      thunder and lightning come, and use threats to the god, not believing that
      there exists any other god except their own.
    </p>
<p>
      95. This Salmoxis I hear from the Hellenes who dwell about the Hellespont
      and the Pontus, was a man, and he became a slave in Samos, and was in fact
      a slave of Pythagoras the son of Mnesarchos. Then having become free he
      gained great wealth, and afterwards returned to his own land: and as the
      Thracians both live hardly and are rather simple-minded, this Salmoxis,
      being acquainted with the Ionian way of living and with manners more
      cultivated <a href="#link4note-94" id="link4noteref-94" class="pginternal">94</a> than the Thracians were used to see, since he
      had associated with Hellenes (and not only that but with Pythagoras, not
      the least able philosopher <a href="#link4note-95" id="link4noteref-95" class="pginternal">95</a> of the Hellenes), prepared a banqueting-hall,
      <a href="#link4note-96" id="link4noteref-96" class="pginternal">96</a>
      where he received and feasted the chief men of the tribe and instructed
      them meanwhile that neither he himself nor his guests nor their
      descendants in succession after them would die; but that they would come
      to a place where they would live for ever and have all things good. While
      he was doing that which has been mentioned and was saying these things, he
      was making for himself meanwhile a chamber under the ground; and when his
      chamber was finished, he disappeared from among the Thracians and went
      down into the underground chamber, where he continued to live for three
      years: and they grieved for his loss and mourned for him as dead. Then in
      the fourth year he appeared to the Thracians, and in this way the things
      which Salmoxis said became credible to them.
    </p>
<p>
      96. Thus they say that he did; but as to this matter and the chamber under
      ground, I neither disbelieve it nor do I very strongly believe, but I
      think that this Salmoxis lived many years before Pythagoras. However,
      whether there ever lived a man Salmoxis, or whether he is simply a native
      deity of the Getai, let us bid farewell to him now.
    </p>
<p>
      97. These, I say, having such manners as I have said, were subdued by the
      Persians and accompanied the rest of the army: and when Dareios and with
      him the land-army arrived at the Ister, then after all had passed over,
      Dareios commanded the Ionians to break up the floating bridge and to
      accompany him by land, as well as the rest of the troops which were in the
      ships: and when the Ionians were just about to break it up and to do that
      which he commanded, Coës the son of Erxander, who was commander of the
      Mytilenians, said thus to Dareios, having first inquired whether he was
      disposed to listen to an opinion from one who desired to declare it: "O
      king, seeing that thou art about to march upon a land where no cultivated
      ground will be seen nor any inhabited town, do thou therefore let this
      bridge remain where it is, leaving to guard it those same men who
      constructed it. Then, if we find the Scythians and fare as we desire, we
      have a way of return; and also even if we shall not be able to find them,
      at least our way of return is secured: for that we should be worsted by
      the Scythians in fight I never feared yet, but rather that we might not be
      able to find them, and might suffer some disaster in wandering about.
      Perhaps some one will say that in speaking thus I am speaking for my own
      advantage, in order that I may remain behind; but in truth I am bringing
      forward, O king, the opinion which I found best for thee, and I myself
      will accompany thee and not be left behind." With this opinion Dareios was
      very greatly pleased and made answer to him in these words: "Friend from
      Lesbos, when I have returned safe to my house, be sure that thou appear
      before me, in order that I may requite thee with good deeds for good
      counsel."
    </p>
<p>
      98. Having thus said and having tied sixty knots in a thong, he called the
      despots of the Ionians to speak with him and said as follows: "Men of
      Ionia, know that I have given up the opinion which I formerly declared
      with regard to the bridge; and do ye keep this thong and do as I shall
      say:—so soon as ye shall have seen me go forward against the
      Scythians, from that time begin, and untie a knot on each day: and if
      within this time I am not here, and ye find that the days marked by the
      knots have passed by, then sail away to your own lands. Till then, since
      our resolve has thus been changed, guard the floating bridge, showing all
      diligence to keep it safe and to guard it. And thus acting, ye will do for
      me a very acceptable service." Thus said Dareios and hastened on his march
      forwards.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      99. Now in front of Scythia in the direction towards the sea <a href="#link4note-97" id="link4noteref-97" class="pginternal">97</a>
      lies Thrace; and where a bay is formed in this land, there begins Scythia,
      into which the Ister flows out, the mouth of the river being turned
      towards the South-East Wind. Beginning at the Ister then I am about to
      describe the coast land of the true Scythia, with regard to measurement.
      At once from the Ister begins this original land of Scythia, and it lies
      towards the midday and the South Wind, extending as far as the city called
      Carkinitis. After this the part which lies on the coast of the same sea
      still, a country which is mountainous and runs out in the direction of the
      Pontus, is occupied by the Tauric race, as far as the peninsula which is
      called the "Rugged Chersonese"; and this extends to the sea which lies
      towards the East Wind: for two sides of the Scythian boundaries lie along
      by the sea, one by the sea on the South, and the other by that on the
      East, just as it is with Attica: and in truth the Tauroi occupy a part of
      Scythia which has much resemblance to Attica; it is as if in Attica
      another race and not the Athenians occupied the hill region <a href="#link4note-98" id="link4noteref-98" class="pginternal">98</a> of
      Sunion, supposing it to project more at the point into the sea, that
      region namely which is cut off by a line from Thoricos to Anaphlystos.
      Such I say, if we may be allowed to compare small things such as this with
      great, is the form of the Tauric land. <a href="#link4note-99" id="link4noteref-99" class="pginternal">99</a> For him however who has
      not sailed along this part of the coast of Attica I will make it clear by
      another comparison:—it is as if in Iapygia another race and not the
      Iapygians had cut off for themselves and were holding that extremity of
      the land which is bounded by a line beginning at the harbour of Brentesion
      and running to Taras. And in mentioning these two similar cases I am
      suggesting many other things also to which the Tauric land has
      resemblance.
    </p>
<p>
      100. After the Tauric land immediately come Scythians again, occupying the
      parts above the Tauroi and the coasts of the Eastern sea, that is to say
      the parts to the West of the Kimmerian Bosphorus and of the Maiotian lake,
      as far as the river Tanaïs, which runs into the corner of this lake. In
      the upper parts which tend inland Scythia is bounded (as we know) <a href="#link4note-100" id="link4noteref-100" class="pginternal">100</a>
      by the Agathyrsians first, beginning from the Ister, and then by the
      Neuroi, afterwards by the Androphagoi, and lastly by the Melanchlainoi.
    </p>
<p>
      101. Scythia then being looked upon as a four-sided figure with two of its
      sides bordered by the sea, has its border lines equal to one another in
      each direction, that which tends inland and that which runs along by the
      sea: for from Ister to the Borysthenes is ten days' journey, and from the
      Borysthenes to the Maiotian lake ten days' more; and the distance inland
      to the Melanchlainoi, who are settled above the Scythians, is a journey of
      twenty days. Now I have reckoned the day's journey at two hundred
      furlongs: <a href="#link4note-101" id="link4noteref-101" class="pginternal">101</a> and by this reckoning the cross lines of
      Scythia <a href="#link4note-102" id="link4noteref-102" class="pginternal">102</a> would be four thousand furlongs in length,
      and the perpendiculars which tend inland would be the same number of
      furlongs. Such is the size of this land.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      102. The Scythians meanwhile having considered with themselves that they
      were not able to repel the army of Dareios alone by a pitched battle,
      proceeded to send messengers to those who dwelt near them: and already the
      kings of these nations had come together and were taking counsel with one
      another, since so great an army was marching towards them. Now those who
      had come together were the kings of the Tauroi, Agathyrsians, Neuroi,
      Androphagoi, Melanchlainoi, Gelonians, Budinoi and Sauromatai.
    </p>
<p>
      103. Of these the Tauroi have the following customs:—they sacrifice
      to the "Maiden" both ship-wrecked persons and also those Hellenes whom
      they can capture by putting out to sea against them; <a href="#link4note-103" id="link4noteref-103" class="pginternal">103</a>
      and their manner of sacrifice is this:—when they have made the first
      offering from the victim they strike his head with a club: and some say
      that they push the body down from the top of the cliff (for it is upon a
      cliff that the temple is placed) and set the head up on a stake; but
      others, while agreeing as to the heads, say nevertheless that the body is
      not pushed down from the top of the cliff, but buried in the earth. This
      divinity to whom they sacrifice, the Tauroi themselves say is Iphigeneia
      the daughter of Agamemnon. Whatsoever enemies they have conquered they
      treat in this fashion:—each man cuts off a head and bears it away to
      his house; then he impales it on a long stake and sets it up above his
      house raised to a great height, generally above the chimney; and they say
      that these are suspended above as guards to preserve the whole house. This
      people has its living by plunder and war.
    </p>
<p>
      104. The Agathyrsians are the most luxurious of men and wear gold
      ornaments for the most part: also they have promiscuous intercourse with
      their women, in order that they may be brethren to one another and being
      all nearly related may not feel envy or malice one against another. In
      their other customs they have come to resemble the Thracians.
    </p>
<p>
      105. The Neuroi practise the Scythian customs: and one generation before
      the expedition of Dareios it so befell them that they were forced to quit
      their land altogether by reason of serpents: for their land produced
      serpents in vast numbers, and they fell upon them in still larger numbers
      from the desert country above their borders; until at last being hard
      pressed they left their own land and settled among the Budinoi. These men
      it would seem are wizards; for it is said of them by the Scythians and by
      the Hellenes who are settled in the Scythian land that once in every year
      each of the Neuroi becomes a wolf for a few days and then returns again to
      his original form. For my part I do not believe them when they say this,
      but they say it nevertheless, and swear it moreover.
    </p>
<p>
      106. The Androphagoi have the most savage manners of all human beings, and
      they neither acknowledge any rule of right nor observe any customary law.
      They are nomads and wear clothing like that of the Scythians, but have a
      language of their own; and alone of all these nations they are man-eaters.
    </p>
<p>
      107. The Melanchlainoi wear all of them black clothing, whence also they
      have their name; and they practise the customs of the Scythians.
    </p>
<p>
      108. The Budinoi are a very great and numerous race, and are all very
      blue-eyed and fair of skin: and in their land is built a city of wood, the
      name of which is Gelonos, and each side of the wall is thirty furlongs in
      length and lofty at the same time, all being of wood; and the houses are
      of wood also and the temples; for there are in it temples of Hellenic gods
      furnished after Hellenic fashion with sacred images and altars and cells,
      <a href="#link4note-104" id="link4noteref-104" class="pginternal">104</a>
      all of wood; and they keep festivals every other year <a href="#link4note-105" id="link4noteref-105" class="pginternal">105</a>
      to Dionysos and celebrate the rites of Bacchus: for the Gelonians are
      originally Hellenes, and they removed <a href="#link4note-106" id="link4noteref-106" class="pginternal">106</a> from the trading
      stations on the coast and settled among the Budinoi; and they use partly
      the Scythian language and partly the Hellenic. The Budinoi however do not
      use the same language as the Gelonians, nor is their manner of living the
      same:
    </p>
<p>
      109, for the Budinoi are natives of the soil and a nomad people, and alone
      of the nations in these parts feed on fir-cones; <a href="#link4note-107" id="link4noteref-107" class="pginternal">107</a> but the Gelonians
      are tillers of the ground and feed on corn and have gardens, and resemble
      them not at all either in appearance or in complexion of skin. However by
      the Hellenes the Budinoi also are called Gelonians, not being rightly so
      called. Their land is all thickly overgrown with forests of all kinds of
      trees, and in the thickest forest there is a large and deep lake, and
      round it marshy ground and reeds. In this are caught otters and beavers
      and certainly other wild animals with square-shaped faces. The fur of
      these is sewn as a fringe round their coats of skin, and the testicles are
      made use of by them for curing diseases of the womb.
    </p>
<p>
      110. About the Sauromatai the following tale is told:—When the
      Hellenes had fought with the Amazons,—now the Amazons are called by
      the Scythians <i>Oiorpata</i>, <a href="#link4note-108" id="link4noteref-108" class="pginternal">108</a> which name means in
      the Hellenic tongue "slayers of men," for "man" they call <i>oior</i>, and
      <i>pata</i> means "to slay,"—then, as the story goes, the Hellenes,
      having conquered them in the battle at the Thermodon, were sailing away
      and conveying with them in three ships as many Amazons as they were able
      to take prisoners. These in the open sea set upon the men and cast them
      out of the ships; but they knew nothing about ships, nor how to use
      rudders or sails or oars, and after they had cast out the men they were
      driven about by wave and wind and came to that part of the Maiotian lake
      where Cremnoi stands; now Cremnoi is in the land of the free Scythians. <a href="#link4note-109" id="link4noteref-109" class="pginternal">109</a>
      There the Amazons disembarked from their ships and made their way into the
      country, and having met first with a troop of horses feeding they seized
      them, and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians.
    </p>
<p>
      111. The Scythians meanwhile were not able to understand the matter, for
      they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which
      they belonged, but were in wonder as to whence they had come and thought
      that they were men, of an age corresponding to their appearance: and
      finally they fought a battle against them, and after the battle the
      Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they
      discovered that they were women. They took counsel therefore and resolved
      by no means to go on trying to kill them, but to send against them the
      youngest men from among themselves, making conjecture of the number so as
      to send just as many men as there were women. These were told to encamp
      near them, and do whatsoever they should do; if however the women should
      come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and
      when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan
      was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born
      from them.
    </p>
<p>
      112. The young men accordingly were sent out and did that which had been
      commanded them: and when the Amazons perceived that they had not come to
      do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer
      to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing
      except their arms and their horses, and got their living, as the Amazons
      did, by hunting and by taking booty.
    </p>
<p>
      113. Now the Amazons at midday used to scatter abroad either one by one or
      by two together, dispersing to a distance from one another to ease
      themselves; and the Scythians also having perceived this did the same
      thing: and one of the Scythians came near to one of those Amazons who were
      apart by themselves, and she did not repulse him but allowed him to lie
      with her: and she could not speak to him, for they did not understand one
      another's speech, but she made signs to him with her hand to come on the
      following day to the same place and to bring another with him, signifying
      to him that there should be two of them, and that she would bring another
      with her. The young man therefore, when he returned, reported this to the
      others; and on the next day he came himself to the place and also brought
      another, and he found the Amazon awaiting him with another in her company.
      Then hearing this the rest of the young men also in their turn tamed for
      themselves the remainder of the Amazons;
    </p>
<p>
      114, and after this they joined their camps and lived together, each man
      having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first; and the
      men were not able to learn the speech of the women, but the women came to
      comprehend that of the men. So when they understood one another, the men
      spoke to the Amazons as follows: "We have parents and we have possessions;
      now therefore let us no longer lead a life of this kind, but let us go
      away to the main body of our people and dwell with them; and we will have
      you for wives and no others." They however spoke thus in reply: "We should
      not be able to live with your women, for we and they have not the same
      customs. We shoot with bows and hurl javelins and ride horses, but the
      works of women we never learnt; whereas your women do none of these things
      which we said, but stay in the waggons and work at the works of women,
      neither going out to the chase nor anywhither else. We therefore should
      not be able to live in agreement with them: but if ye desire to keep us
      for your wives and to be thought honest men, go to your parents and obtain
      from them your share of the goods, and then let us go and dwell by
      ourselves."
    </p>
<p>
      115. The young men agreed and did this; and when they had obtained the
      share of the goods which belonged to them and had returned back to the
      Amazons, the women spoke to them as follows: "We are possessed by fear and
      trembling to think that we must dwell in this place, having not only
      separated you from your fathers, but also done great damage to your land.
      Since then ye think it right to have us as your wives, do this together
      with us,—come and let us remove from this land and pass over the
      river Tanaïs and there dwell."
    </p>
<p>
      116. The young men agreed to this also, and they crossed over the Tanaïs
      and made their way towards the rising sun for three days' journey from
      Tanaïs, and also towards the North Wind for three days' journey from the
      Maiotian lake: and having arrived at the place where they are now settled,
      they took up their abode there: and from thenceforward the women of the
      Sauromatai practise their ancient way of living, going out regularly on
      horseback to the chase both in company with the men and apart from them,
      and going regularly to war, and wearing the same dress as the men.
    </p>
<p>
      117. And the Sauromatai make use of the Scythian tongue, speaking it
      barbarously however from the first, since the Amazons did not learn it
      thoroughly well. As regards marriages their rule is this, that no maiden
      is married until she has slain a man of their enemies; and some of them
      even grow old and die before they are married, because they are not able
      to fulfil the requirement of the law.
    </p>
<p>
      118. To the kings of these nations then, which have been mentioned in
      order, the messengers of the Scythians came, finding them gathered
      together, and spoke declaring to them how the Persian king, after having
      subdued all things to himself in the other continent, had laid a bridge
      over the neck of the Bosphorus and had crossed over to that continent, and
      having crossed over and subdued the Thracians, was making a bridge over
      the river Ister, desiring to bring under his power all these regions also.
      "Do ye therefore," they said, "by no means stand aloof and allow us to be
      destroyed, but let us become all of one mind and oppose him who is coming
      against us. If ye shall not do so, we on our part shall either be forced
      by necessity to leave our land, or we shall stay in it and make a treaty
      with the invader; for what else can we do if ye are not willing to help
      us? and for you after this <a href="#link4note-110" id="link4noteref-110" class="pginternal">110</a> it will be in no respect easier; for the
      Persian has come not at all less against you than against us, nor will it
      content him to subdue us and abstain from you. And of the truth of that
      which we say we will mention a strong evidence: if the Persian had been
      making his expedition against us alone, because he desired to take
      vengeance for the former servitude, he ought to have abstained from all
      the rest and to have come at once to invade our land, and he would thus
      have made it clear to all that he was marching to fight against the
      Scythians and not against the rest. In fact however, ever since he crossed
      over to this continent, he has compelled all who came in his way to submit
      to him, and he holds under him now not only the other Thracians but also
      the Getai, who are our nearest neighbours."
    </p>
<p>
      119. When the Scythians proposed this, the kings who had come from the
      various nations took counsel together, and their opinions were divided.
      The kings of the Gelonians, of the Budinoi and of the Sauromatai agreed
      together and accepted the proposal that they should help the Scythians,
      but those of the Agathyrsians, Neuroi, Androphagoi, Melanchlainoi and
      Tauroi returned answer to the Scythians as follows: "If ye had not been
      the first to do wrong to the Persians and to begin war, then we should
      have surely thought that ye were speaking justly in asking for those
      things for which ye now ask, and we should have yielded to your request
      and shared your fortunes. As it is however, ye on the one hand made
      invasion without us into their land, and bare rule over the Persians for
      so long a time as God permitted you; and they in their turn, since the
      same God stirs them up, are repaying you with the like. As for us however,
      neither at that time did we do any wrong to these men nor now shall we
      attempt to do any wrong to them unprovoked: if however the Persians shall
      come against our land also, and do wrong first to us, we also shall refuse
      to submit <a href="#link4note-111" id="link4noteref-111" class="pginternal">111</a>: but until we shall see this, we shall
      remain by ourselves, for we are of opinion that the Persians have come not
      against us, but against those who were the authors of the wrong."
    </p>
<p>
      120. When the Scythians heard this answer reported, they planned not to
      fight a pitched battle openly, since these did not join them as allies,
      but to retire before the Persians and to drive away their cattle from
      before them, choking up with earth the wells and the springs of water by
      which they passed and destroying the grass from off the ground, having
      parted themselves for this into two bodies; and they resolved that the
      Sauromatai should be added to one of their divisions, namely that over
      which Scopasis was king, and that these should move on, if the Persians
      turned in that direction, straight towards the river Tanaïs, retreating
      before him by the shore of the Maiotian lake; and when the Persian marched
      back again, they should come after and pursue him. This was one division
      of their kingdom, appointed to go by the way which has been said; and the
      other two of the kingdoms, the large one over which Idanthyrsos was king,
      and the third of which Taxakis was king, were to join together in one,
      with the Gelonians and the Budinoi added to them, and they also were to
      retire before the Persians one day's march in front of them, going on out
      of their way and doing that which had been planned. First they were to
      move on straight for the countries which had refused to give their
      alliance, in order that they might involve these also in the war, and
      though these had not voluntarily undertaken the war with the Persians,
      they were to involve them in it nevertheless against their will; and after
      that they were to return to their own land and attack the enemy, if it
      should seem good to them in council so to do.
    </p>
<p>
      121. Having formed this plan the Scythians went to meet the army of
      Dareios, sending off the best of their horsemen before them as scouts; but
      all <a href="#link4note-112" id="link4noteref-112" class="pginternal">112</a>
      the waggons in which their children and their women lived they sent on,
      and with them all their cattle (leaving only so much as was sufficient to
      supply them with food), and charged them that they should proceed
      continually towards the North Wind. These, I say, were being carried on
      before:
    </p>
<p>
      122, but when the scouts who went in front of the Scythians discovered the
      Persians distant about three days' march from Ister, then the Scythians
      having discovered them continued to pitch their camp one day's march in
      front, destroying utterly that which grew from the ground: and when the
      Persians saw that the horsemen of the Scythians had made their appearance,
      they came after them following in their track, while the Scythians
      continually moved on. After this, since they had directed their march
      towards the first of the divisions, the Persians continued to pursue
      towards the East and the river Tanaïs; and when the Scythians crossed over
      the river Tanaïs, the Persians crossed over after them and continued still
      to pursue, until they had passed quite through the land of the Sauromatai
      and had come to that of the Budinoi.
    </p>
<p>
      123. Now so long as the Persians were passing through Scythia and the land
      of the Sauromatai, they had nothing to destroy, seeing that the land was
      bare, <a href="#link4note-113" id="link4noteref-113" class="pginternal">113</a> but when they invaded the land of the
      Budinoi, then they fell in with the wooden wall, which had been deserted
      by the Budinoi and left wholly unoccupied, and this they destroyed by
      fire. Having done so they continued to follow on further in the tracks of
      the enemy, until they had passed through the whole of this land and had
      arrived at the desert. This desert region is occupied by no men, and it
      lies above the land of the Budinoi, extending for a seven days' journey;
      and above this desert dwell the Thyssagetai, and four large rivers flow
      from them through the land of the Maiotians and run into that which is
      called the Maiotian lake, their names being as follows,—Lycos,
      Oaros, Tanaïs, Syrgis. <a href="#link4note-114" id="link4noteref-114" class="pginternal">114</a>
</p>
<p>
      124. When therefore Dareios came to the desert region, he ceased from his
      course and halted his army upon the river Oaros. Having so done he began
      to build eight large fortifications at equal distances from one another,
      that is to say about sixty furlongs, of which the ruins still existed down
      to my time; and while he was occupied in this, the Scythians whom he was
      pursuing came round by the upper parts and returned back to Scythia.
      Accordingly, since these had altogether disappeared and were no longer
      seen by the Persians at all, Dareios left those fortifications half
      finished, and turning back himself began to go towards the West, supposing
      that these were the whole body of the Scythians and that they were flying
      towards the West.
    </p>
<p>
      125. And marching his army as quickly as possible, when he came to Scythia
      he met with the two divisions of the Scythians together, and having fallen
      in with these he continued to pursue them, while they retired out of his
      way one day's journey in advance: and as Dareios did not cease to come
      after them, the Scythians according to the plan which they had made
      continued to retire before him towards the land of those who had refused
      to give their alliance, and first towards that of the Melanchlainoi; and
      when Scythians and Persians both together had invaded and disturbed these,
      the Scythians led the way to the country of the Androphagoi; and when
      these had also been disturbed, they proceeded to the land of the Neuroi;
      and while these too were being disturbed, the Scythians went on retiring
      before the enemy to the Agathyrsians. The Agathyrsians however, seeing
      that their next neighbours also were flying from the Scythians and had
      been disturbed, sent a herald before the Scythians invaded their land and
      proclaimed to the Scythians not to set foot upon their confines, warning
      them that if they should attempt to invade the country, they would first
      have to fight with them. The Agathyrsians then having given this warning
      came out in arms to their borders, meaning to drive off those who were
      coming upon them; but the Melanchlainoi and Androphagoi and Neuroi, when
      the Persians and Scythians together invaded them, did not betake
      themselves to brave defence but forgot their former threat <a href="#link4note-115" id="link4noteref-115" class="pginternal">115</a>
      and fled in confusion ever further towards the North to the desert region.
      The Scythians however, when the Agathyrsians had warned them off, did not
      attempt any more to come to these, but led the Persians from the country
      of the Neuroi back to their own land.
    </p>
<p>
      126. Now as this went on for a long time and did not cease, Dareios sent a
      horseman to Idanthyrsos king of the Scythians and said as follows: "Thou
      most wondrous man, why dost thou fly for ever, when thou mightest do of
      these two things one?—if thou thinkest thyself able to make
      opposition to my power, stand thou still and cease from wandering abroad,
      and fight; but if thou dost acknowledge thyself too weak, cease then in
      that case also from thy course, and come to speech with thy master,
      bringing to him gifts of earth and water."
    </p>
<p>
      127. To this the king of the Scythians Idanthyrsos made answer thus: "My
      case, O Persian, stands thus:—Never yet did I fly because I was
      afraid, either before this time from any other man, or now from thee; nor
      have I done anything different now from that which I was wont to do also
      in time of peace: and as to the cause why I do not fight with thee at
      once, this also I will declare to thee. We have neither cities nor land
      sown with crops, about which we should fear lest they should be captured
      or laid waste, and so join battle more speedily with you; but if it be
      necessary by all means to come to this speedily, know that we have
      sepulchres in which our fathers are buried; therefore come now, find out
      these and attempt to destroy them, and ye shall know then whether we shall
      fight with you for the sepulchres or whether we shall not fight. Before
      that however, unless the motion comes upon us, we shall not join battle
      with thee. About fighting let so much as has been said suffice; but as to
      masters, I acknowledge none over me but Zeus my ancestor and Hestia the
      queen of the Scythians. To thee then in place of gifts of earth and water
      I shall send such things as it is fitting that thou shouldest receive; and
      in return for thy saying that thou art my master, for that I say, woe
      betide thee." <a href="#link4note-116" id="link4noteref-116" class="pginternal">116</a> This is the proverbial "saying of the
      Scythians." <a href="#link4note-117" id="link4noteref-117" class="pginternal">117</a>
</p>
<p>
      128. The herald then had departed to report this to Dareios; and the kings
      of the Scythians, having heard mention of subjection to a master, were
      filled with wrath. They sent accordingly the division which was appointed
      to be joined with the Sauromatai, that division of which Scopasis was in
      command, bidding them come to speech with the Ionians, namely those who
      were guarding the bridge of the Ister, and meanwhile they who were left
      behind resolved not to lead the Persians wandering about any more, but to
      attack them constantly as they were getting provisions. Therefore they
      observed the soldiers of Dareios as they got provisions, and did that
      which they had determined: and the cavalry of the Scythians always routed
      that of the enemy, but the Persian horsemen as they fled fell back upon
      the men on foot, and these would come up to their assistance; and
      meanwhile the Scythians when they had driven in the cavalry turned back,
      fearing the men on foot. Also by night the Scythians used to make similar
      attacks:
    </p>
<p>
      129, and the thing which, strange to say, most helped the Persians and
      hindered the Scythians in their attacks upon the camp of Dareios, I will
      mention, namely the voice of the asses and the appearance of the mules;
      for Scythia produces neither ass nor mule, as I have declared before, nor
      is there at all in the Scythian country either ass or mule on account of
      the cold. The asses accordingly by riotously braying used to throw into
      confusion the cavalry of the Scythians; and often, as they were in the
      middle of riding against the Persians, when the horses heard the voice of
      the asses they turned back in confusion and were possessed with wonder,
      pricking up their ears, because they had never heard such a voice nor seen
      the form of the creature before.
    </p>
<p>
      130. So far then the Persians had the advantage for a small part of the
      war. <a href="#link4note-118" id="link4noteref-118" class="pginternal">118</a>
      But the Scythians, whenever they saw that the Persians were disquieted,
      then in order that they might remain a longer time in Scythia and in
      remaining might suffer by being in want of everything, would leave some of
      their own cattle behind with the herdsmen, while they themselves rode out
      of the way to another place, and the Persians would come upon the cattle
      and take them, and having taken them they were elated at what they had
      done.
    </p>
<p>
      131. As this happened often, at length Dareios began to be in straits; and
      the kings of the Scythians perceiving this sent a herald bearing as gifts
      to Dareios a bird and a mouse and a frog and five arrows. The Persians
      accordingly asked the bearer of the gifts as to the meaning of the gifts
      which were offered; but he said that nothing more had been commanded to
      him but to give them and get away as speedily as possible; and he bade the
      Persians find out for themselves, if they had wisdom, that which the gifts
      were meant to express.
    </p>
<p>
      132. Having heard this the Persians took counsel with one another; and the
      opinion of Dareios was that the Scythians were giving to him both
      themselves and also earth and water, making his conjecture by this, namely
      that a mouse is produced in the earth and feeds on the same produce of the
      earth as man, and a frog in the water, while a bird has great resemblance
      to a horse; <a href="#link4note-119" id="link4noteref-119" class="pginternal">119</a> and moreover that in giving the arrows they
      were delivering up their own might in battle. This was the opinion
      expressed by Dareios; but the opinion of Gobryas, one of the seven men who
      killed the Magian, was at variance with it, for he conjectured that the
      gifts expressed this: "Unless ye become birds and fly up into the heaven,
      O Persians, or become mice and sink down under the earth, or become frogs
      and leap into the lakes, ye shall not return back home, but shall be
      smitten by these arrows."
    </p>
<p>
      133. The Persians then, I say, were making conjecture of the gifts: and
      meanwhile the single division of the Scythians, that which had been
      appointed at first to keep guard along the Maiotian lake and then to go to
      the Ister and come to speech with the Ionians, when they arrived at the
      bridge spoke as follows: "Ionians, we have come bringing you freedom, if
      at least ye are willing to listen to us; for we are informed that Dareios
      gave you command to guard the bridge for sixty days only, and then, if he
      had not arrived within that time, to get you away to your own land. Now
      therefore, if ye do as we say, ye will be without blame from his part and
      without blame also from ours: stay the appointed days and then after that
      get you away." They then, when the Ionians had engaged themselves to do
      this, hastened back again by the quickest way:
    </p>
<p>
      134, and meanwhile, after the coming of the gifts to Dareios, the
      Scythians who were left had arrayed themselves against the Persians with
      both foot and horse, meaning to engage battle. Now when the Scythians had
      been placed in battle-array, a hare darted through them into the space
      between the two armies, and each company of them, as they saw the hare,
      began to run after it. When the Scythians were thus thrown into disorder
      and were raising loud cries, Dareios asked what was this clamour arising
      from the enemy; and hearing that they were running after the hare, he said
      to those men to whom he was wont to say things at other times: "These men
      have very slight regard for us, and I perceive now that Gobryas spoke
      rightly about the Scythian gifts. Seeing then that now I myself too think
      that things are so, we have need of good counsel, in order that our
      retreat homewards may be safely made." To this replied Gobryas and said:
      "O king, even by report I was almost assured of the difficulty of dealing
      with these men; and when I came I learnt it still more thoroughly, since I
      saw that they were mocking us. Now therefore my opinion is, that as soon
      as night comes on, we kindle the camp-fires as we are wont to do at other
      times also, and deceive with a false tale those of our men who are weakest
      to endure hardships, and tie up all the asses and get us away, before
      either the Scythians make for the Ister to destroy the bridge or something
      be resolved by the Ionians which may be our ruin."
    </p>
<p>
      135. Thus Gobryas advised; and after this, when night came on, Dareios
      acted on this opinion. Those of his men who were weakened by fatigue and
      whose loss was of least account, these he left behind in the camp, and the
      asses also tied up: and for the following reasons he left behind the asses
      and the weaker men of his army,—the asses in order that they might
      make a noise which should be heard, and the men really because of their
      weakness, but on a pretence stated openly that he was about to attack the
      Scythians with the effective part of the army, and that they meanwhile
      were to be defenders of the camp. Having thus instructed those who were
      left behind, and having kindled camp-fires, Dareios hastened by the
      quickest way towards the Ister: and the asses, having no longer about them
      the usual throng, <a href="#link4note-120" id="link4noteref-120" class="pginternal">120</a> very much more for that reason caused their
      voice to be heard; <a href="#link4note-121" id="link4noteref-121" class="pginternal">121</a> so the Scythians, hearing the asses,
      supposed surely that the Persians were remaining in their former place.
    </p>
<p>
      136. But when it was day, those who were left behind perceived that they
      had been betrayed by Dareios, and they held out their hands in submission
      to the Scythians, telling them what their case was; and the Scythians,
      when they heard this, joined together as quickly as possible, that is to
      say the two combined divisions of the Scythians and the single division,
      and also the Sauromatai, <a href="#link4note-122" id="link4noteref-122" class="pginternal">122</a> Budinoi, and Gelonians, and began to pursue
      the Persians, making straight for the Ister: but as the Persian army for
      the most part consisted of men on foot, and was not acquainted with the
      roads (the roads not being marked with tracks), while the Scythian army
      consisted of horsemen and was acquainted with the shortest cuts along the
      way, they missed one another and the Scythians arrived at the bridge much
      before the Persians. Then having learnt that the Persians had not yet
      arrived, they said to the Ionians who were in the ships: "Ionians, the
      days of your number are past, and ye are not acting uprightly in that ye
      yet remain waiting: but as ye stayed before from fear, so now break up the
      passage as quickly as ye may, and depart free and unhurt, <a href="#link4note-123" id="link4noteref-123" class="pginternal">123</a>
      feeling thankfulness both to the gods and to the Scythians: and him who
      was formerly your master we will so convince, that he shall never again
      march with an army upon any nation."
    </p>
<p>
      137. Upon this the Ionians took counsel together; and Miltiades the
      Athenian on the one hand, who was commander and despot of the men of the
      Chersonese in Hellespont, was of opinion that they should follow the
      advice of the Scythians and set Ionia free: but Histiaios the Milesian was
      of the opposite opinion to this; for he said that at the present time it
      was by means of Dareios that each one of them was ruling as despot over a
      city; and if the power of Dareios should be destroyed, neither he himself
      would be able to bear rule over the Milesians, nor would any other of them
      be able to bear rule over any other city; for each of the cities would
      choose to have popular rather than despotic rule. When Histiaios declared
      his opinion thus, forthwith all turned to this opinion, whereas at the
      first they were adopting that of Miltiades.
    </p>
<p>
      138. Now these were they who gave the vote between the two opinions, and
      were men of consequence in the eyes of the king, <a href="#link4note-124" id="link4noteref-124" class="pginternal">124</a>—first the
      despots of the Hellespontians, Daphnis of Abydos, Hippoclos of Lampsacos,
      Herophantos of Parion, Metrodoros of Proconnesos, Aristagoras of Kyzicos,
      and Ariston of Byzantion, these were those from the Hellespont; and from
      Ionia, Strattis of Chios, Aiakes of Samos, Laodamas of Phocaia, and
      Histiaios of Miletos, whose opinion had been proposed in opposition to
      that of Miltiades; and of the Aiolians the only man of consequence there
      present was Aristagoras of Kyme.
    </p>
<p>
      139. When these adopted the opinion of Histiaios, they resolved to add to
      it deeds and words as follows, namely to break up that part of the bridge
      which was on the side towards the Scythians, to break it up, I say, for a
      distance equal to the range of an arrow, both in order that they might be
      thought to be doing something, though in fact they were doing nothing, and
      for fear that the Scythians might make an attempt using force and desiring
      to cross the Ister by the bridge: and in breaking up that part of the
      bridge which was towards Scythia they resolved to say that they would do
      all that which the Scythians desired. This they added to the opinion
      proposed, and then Histiaios coming forth from among them made answer to
      the Scythians as follows: "Scythians, ye are come bringing good news, and
      it is a timely haste that ye make to bring it; and ye on your part give us
      good guidance, while we on ours render to you suitable service. For, as ye
      see, we are breaking up the passage, and we shall show all zeal in our
      desire to be free: and while we are breaking up the bridge, it is fitting
      that ye should be seeking for those of whom ye speak, and when ye have
      found them, that ye should take vengeance on them on behalf of us as well
      as of yourselves in such manner as they deserve."
    </p>
<p>
      140. The Scythians then, believing for the second time that the Ionians
      were speaking the truth, turned back to make search for the Persians, but
      they missed altogether their line of march through the land. Of this the
      Scythians themselves were the cause, since they had destroyed the pastures
      for horses in that region and had choked up with earth the springs of
      water; for if they had not done this, it would have been possible for them
      easily, if they desired it, to discover the Persians: but as it was, by
      those things wherein they thought they had taken their measures best, they
      failed of success. The Scythians then on their part were passing through
      those regions of their own land where there was grass for the horses and
      springs of water, and were seeking for the enemy there, thinking that they
      too were taking a course in their retreat through such country as this;
      while the Persians in fact marched keeping carefully to the track which
      they had made before, and so they found the passage of the river, though
      with difficulty: <a href="#link4note-125" id="link4noteref-125" class="pginternal">125</a> and as they arrived by night and found the
      bridge broken up, they were brought to the extreme of fear, lest the
      Ionians should have deserted them.
    </p>
<p>
      141. Now there was with Dareios an Egyptian who had a voice louder than
      that of any other man on earth, and this man Dareios ordered to take his
      stand upon the bank of the Ister and to call Histiaios of Miletos. He
      accordingly proceeded to do so; and Histiaios, hearing the first hail,
      produced all the ships to carry the army over and also put together the
      bridge.
    </p>
<p>
      142. Thus the Persians escaped, and the Scythians in their search missed
      the Persians the second time also: and their judgment of the Ionians is
      that on the one hand, if they be regarded as free men, they are the most
      worthless and cowardly of all men, but on the other hand, if regarded as
      slaves, they are the most attached to their master and the least disposed
      to run away of all slaves. This is the reproach which is cast against the
      Ionians by the Scythians.
    </p>
<p>
      143. Dareios then marching through Thrace arrived at Sestos in the
      Chersonese; and from that place, he passed over himself in his ships to
      Asia, but to command his army in Europe he left Megabazos a Persian, to
      whom Dareios once gave honour by uttering in the land of Persia <a href="#link4note-126" id="link4noteref-126" class="pginternal">126</a>
      this saying:—Dareios was beginning to eat pomegranates, and at once
      when he opened the first of them, Artabanos his brother asked him of what
      he would desire to have as many as there were seeds in the pomegranate:
      and Dareios said that he would desire to have men like Megabazos as many
      as that in number, rather than to have Hellas subject to him. In Persia, I
      say, he honoured him by saying these words, and at this time he left him
      in command with eight myriads <a href="#link4note-127" id="link4noteref-127" class="pginternal">127</a> of his army.
    </p>
<p>
      144. This Megabazos uttered one saying whereby he left of himself an
      imperishable memory with the peoples of Hellespont: for being once at
      Byzantion he heard that the men of Calchedon had settled in that region
      seventeen years before the Byzantians, and having heard it he said that
      those of Calchedon at that time chanced to be blind; for assuredly they
      would not have chosen the worse place, when they might have settled in
      that which was better, if they had not been blind. This Megabazos it was
      who was left in command at that time in the land of the Hellespontians,
      and he proceeded to subdue all who did not take the side of the Medes.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      145. He then was doing thus; and at this very same time a great expedition
      was being made also against Libya, on an occasion which I shall relate
      when I have first related this which follows.—The children's
      children of those who voyaged in the Argo, having been driven forth by
      those Pelasgians who carried away at Brauron the women of the Athenians,—having
      been driven forth I say by these from Lemnos, had departed and sailed to
      Lacedemon, and sitting down on Mount Taÿgetos they kindled a fire. The
      Lacedemonians seeing this sent a messenger to inquire who they were and
      from whence; and they answered the question of the messenger saying that
      they were Minyai and children of heroes who sailed in the Argo, for <a href="#link4note-128" id="link4noteref-128" class="pginternal">128</a>
      these, they said, had put in to Lemnos and propagated the race of which
      they sprang. The Lacedemonians having heard the story of the descent of
      the Minyai, sent a second time and asked for what purpose they had come
      into the country and were causing a fire to blaze. They said that they had
      been cast out by the Pelasgians, and were come now to the land of their
      fathers, <a href="#link4note-129" id="link4noteref-129" class="pginternal">129</a> for most just it was that this should so be
      done; and they said that their request was to be permitted to dwell with
      these, having a share of civil rights and a portion allotted to them of
      the land. And the Lacedemonians were content to receive the Minyai upon
      the terms which they themselves desired, being most of all impelled to do
      this by the fact that the sons of Tyndareus were voyagers in the Argo. So
      having received the Minyai they gave them a share of land and distributed
      them in the tribes; and they forthwith made marriages, and gave in
      marriage to others the women whom they brought with them from Lemnos.
    </p>
<p>
      146. However, when no very long time had passed, the Minyai forthwith
      broke out into insolence, asking for a share of the royal power and also
      doing other impious things: therefore the Lacedemonians resolved to put
      them to death; and having seized them they cast them into a prison. Now
      the Lacedemonians put to death by night all those whom they put to death,
      but no man by day. When therefore they were just about to kill them, the
      wives of the Minyai, being native Spartans and daughters of the first
      citizens of Sparta, entreated to be allowed to enter the prison and come
      to speech every one with her own husband: and they let them pass in, not
      supposing that any craft would be practised by them. They however, when
      they had entered, delivered to their husbands all the garments which they
      were wearing, and themselves received those of their husbands: thus the
      Minyai having put on the women's clothes went forth out of prison as
      women, and having escaped in this manner they went again to Taÿgetos and
      sat down there.
    </p>
<p>
      147. Now at this very same time Theras the son of Autesion, the son of
      Tisamenos, the son of Thersander, the son of Polyneikes, was preparing to
      set forth from Lacedemon to found a settlement. This Theras, who was of
      the race of Cadmos, was mother's brother to the sons of Aristodemos,
      Eurysthenes and Procles; and while these sons were yet children, Theras as
      their guardian held the royal power in Sparta. When however his nephews
      were grown and had taken the power into their hands, then Theras, being
      grieved that he should be ruled by others after he had tasted of rule
      himself, said that he would not remain in Lacedemon, but would sail away
      to his kinsmen. Now there were in the island which is now called Thera,
      but formerly was called Callista, descendants of Membliaros the son of
      Poikiles, a Phenician: for Cadmos the son of Agenor in his search for
      Europa put in to land at the island which is now called Thera; and,
      whether it was that the country pleased him when he had put to land, or
      whether he chose to do so for any other reason, he left in this island,
      besides other Phenicians, Membliaros also, of his own kinsmen. These
      occupied the island called Callista for eight generations of men, before
      Theras came from Lacedemon.
    </p>
<p>
      148. To these then, I say, Theras was preparing to set forth, taking with
      him people from the tribes, and intending to settle together with those
      who have been mentioned, not with any design to drive them out, but on the
      contrary claiming them very strongly as kinfolk. And when the Minyai after
      having escaped from the prison went and sat down on Taÿgetos, Theras
      entreated of the Lacedemonians, as they were proposing to put them to
      death, that no slaughter might take place, and at the same time he engaged
      himself to take them forth out of the land. The Lacedemonians having
      agreed to this proposal, he sailed away with three thirty-oared galleys to
      the descendants of Membliaros, not taking with him by any means all the
      Minyai, but a few only; for the greater number of them turned towards the
      land of the Paroreatai and Caucones, and having driven these out of their
      country, they parted themselves into six divisions and founded in their
      territory the following towns,—Lepreon, Makistos, Phrixai, Pyrgos,
      Epion, Nudion; of these the Eleians sacked the greater number within my
      own lifetime. The island meanwhile got its name of Thera after Theras <a href="#link4note-130" id="link4noteref-130" class="pginternal">130</a>
      who led the settlement.
    </p>
<p>
      149. And since his son said that he would not sail with him, therefore he
      said that he would leave him behind as a sheep among wolves; and in
      accordance with that saying this young man got the name of Oiolycos, <a href="#link4note-131" id="link4noteref-131" class="pginternal">131</a>
      and it chanced that this name prevailed over his former name: then from
      Oiolycos was begotten Aigeus, after whom are called the Aigeidai, a
      powerful clan <a href="#link4note-132" id="link4noteref-132" class="pginternal">132</a> in Sparta: and the men of this tribe, since
      their children did not live to grow up, established by the suggestion of
      an oracle a temple to the Avenging Deities <a href="#link4note-133" id="link4noteref-133" class="pginternal">133</a> of Laïos and
      OEdipus, and after this the same thing was continued <a href="#link4note-134" id="link4noteref-134" class="pginternal">134</a>
      in Thera by the descendants of these men.
    </p>
<p>
      150. Up to this point of the story the Lacedemonians agree in their report
      with the men of Thera; but in what is to come it is those of Thera alone
      who report that it happened as follows. Grinnos <a href="#link4note-135" id="link4noteref-135" class="pginternal">135</a> the son of Aisanios,
      a descendant of the Theras who has been mentioned, and king of the island
      of Thera, came to Delphi bringing the offering of a hecatomb from his
      State; and there were accompanying him, besides others of the citizens,
      also Battos the son of Polymnestos, who was by descent of the family of
      Euphemos <a href="#link4note-136" id="link4noteref-136" class="pginternal">136</a> of the race of the Minyai. Now when Grinnos
      the king of the Theraians was consulting the Oracle about other matters,
      the Pythian prophetess gave answer bidding him found a city in Libya; and
      he made reply saying: "Lord, <a href="#link4note-137" id="link4noteref-137" class="pginternal">137</a> I am by this time
      somewhat old and heavy to stir, but do thou bid some one of these younger
      ones do this." As he thus said he pointed towards Battos. So far at that
      time: but afterwards when he had come away they were in difficulty about
      the saying of the Oracle, neither having any knowledge of Libya, in what
      part of the earth it was, nor venturing to send a colony to the unknown.
    </p>
<p>
      151. Then after this for seven years there was no rain in Thera, and in
      these years all the trees in their island were withered up excepting one:
      and when the Theraians consulted the Oracle, the Pythian prophetess
      alleged this matter of colonising Libya to be the cause. As then they had
      no remedy for their evil, they sent messengers to Crete, to find out
      whether any of the Cretans or of the sojourners in Crete had ever come to
      Libya. These as they wandered round about the country came also the city
      of Itanos, and there they met with a fisher for purple named Corobios, who
      said that he had been carried away by winds and had come to Libya, and in
      Libya to the island of Platea. This man they persuaded by payment of money
      and took him to Thera, and from Thera there set sail men to explore, at
      first not many in number; and Corobios having guided them to this same
      island of Platea, they left Corobios there, leaving behind with him
      provisions for a certain number of months, and sailed themselves as
      quickly as possible to make report about the island to the men of Thera.
    </p>
<p>
      152. Since however these stayed away longer than the time appointed,
      Corobios found himself destitute; and after this a ship of Samos, of which
      the master was Colaios, while sailing to Egypt was carried out of its
      course and came to this island of Platea; and the Samians hearing from
      Corobios the whole story left him provisions for a year. They themselves
      then put out to sea from the island and sailed on, endeavouring to reach
      Egypt but carried away continually by the East Wind; and as the wind did
      not cease to blow, they passed through the Pillars of Heracles and came to
      Tartessos, guided by divine providence. Now this trading-place was at that
      time untouched by any, so that when these returned back home they made
      profit from their cargo greater than any other Hellenes of whom we have
      certain knowledge, with the exception at least of Sostratos the son of
      Laodamas the Eginetan, for with him it is not possible for any other man
      to contend. And the Samians set apart six talents, the tenth part of their
      gains, and had a bronze vessel made like an Argolic mixing-bowl with round
      it heads of griffins projecting in a row; and this they dedicated as an
      offering in the temple of Hera, setting as supports under it three
      colossal statues of bronze seven cubits in height, resting upon their
      knees. By reason first of this deed great friendship was formed by those
      of Kyrene and Thera with the Samians.
    </p>
<p>
      153. The Theraians meanwhile, when they arrived at Thera after having left
      Corobios in the island, reported that they had colonised an island on the
      coast of Libya: and the men of Thera resolved to send one of every two
      brothers selected by lot and men besides taken from all the regions of the
      island, which are seven in number; and further that Battos should be both
      their leader and their king. Thus then they sent forth two fifty-oared
      galleys to Platea.
    </p>
<p>
      154. This is the report of the Theraians; and for the remainder of the
      account from this point onwards the Theraians are in agreement with the
      men of Kyrene: from this point onwards, I say, since in what concerns
      Battos the Kyrenians tell by no means the same tale as those of Thera; for
      their account is this:—There is in Crete a city called Oäxos <a href="#link4note-138" id="link4noteref-138" class="pginternal">138</a>
      in which one Etearchos became king, who when he had a daughter, whose
      mother was dead, named Phronime, took to wife another woman
      notwithstanding. She having come in afterwards, thought fit to be a
      stepmother to Phronime in deed as well as in name, giving her evil
      treatment and devising everything possible to her hurt; and at last she
      brings against her a charge of lewdness and persuades her husband that the
      truth is so. He then being convinced by his wife, devised an unholy deed
      against the daughter: for there was in Oäxos one Themison, a merchant of
      Thera, whom Etearchos took to himself as a guest-friend and caused him to
      swear that he would surely serve him in whatsoever he should require: and
      when he had caused him to swear this, he brought and delivered to him his
      daughter and bade him take her away and cast her into the sea. Themison
      then was very greatly vexed at the deceit practised in the matter of the
      oath, and he dissolved his guest-friendship and did as follows, that is to
      say, he received the girl and sailed away, and when he got out into the
      open sea, to free himself from blame as regards the oath which Etearchos
      had made him swear, he tied her on each side with ropes and let her down
      into the sea, and then drew her up and came to Thera.
    </p>
<p>
      155. After that, Polymnestos, a man of repute among the Theraians,
      received Phronime from him and kept her as his concubine; and in course of
      time there was born to him from her a son with an impediment in his voice
      and lisping, to whom, as both Theraians and Kyrenians say, was given the
      name Battos, but I think that some other name was then given, <a href="#link4note-139" id="link4noteref-139" class="pginternal">139</a>
      and he was named Battos instead of this after he came to Libya, taking for
      himself this surname from the oracle which was given to him at Delphi and
      from the rank which he had obtained; for the Libyans call a king <i>battos</i>:
      and for this reason, I think, the Pythian prophetess in her prophesying
      called him so, using the Libyan tongue, because she knew that he would be
      a king in Libya. For when he had grown to be a man, he came to Delphi to
      inquire about his voice; and when he asked, the prophetess thus answered
      him:
    </p>
<pre>
 "For a voice thou camest, O Battos, but thee lord Phoebus Apollo
  Sendeth as settler forth to the Libyan land sheep-abounding,"
</pre>
<p>
      just as if she should say using the Hellenic tongue, "For a voice thou
      camest, O king." He thus made answer: "Lord, I came to thee to inquire
      concerning my voice, but thou answerest me other things which are not
      possible, bidding me go as a settler to Libya; but with what power, or
      with what force of men should I go?" Thus saying he did not at all
      persuade her to give him any other reply; and as she was prophesying to
      him again the same things as before, Battos departed while she was yet
      speaking, <a href="#link4note-140" id="link4noteref-140" class="pginternal">140</a> and went away to Thera.
    </p>
<p>
      156. After this there came evil fortune both to himself and to the other
      men of Thera; <a href="#link4note-141" id="link4noteref-141" class="pginternal">141</a> and the Theraians, not understanding that
      which befell them, sent to Delphi to inquire about the evils which they
      were suffering: and the Pythian prophetess gave them reply that if they
      joined with Battos in founding Kyrene in Libya, they would fare the
      better. After this the Theraians sent Battos with two fifty-oared galleys;
      and these sailed to Libya, and then came away back to Thera, for they did
      not know what else to do: and the Theraians pelted them with missiles when
      they endeavoured to land, and would not allow them to put to shore, but
      bade them sail back again. They accordingly being compelled sailed away
      back, and they made a settlement in an island lying near the coast of
      Libya, called, as was said before, Platea. This island is said to be of
      the same size as the now existing city of Kyrene.
    </p>
<p>
      157. In this they continued to dwell two years; but as they had no
      prosperity, they left one of their number behind and all the rest sailed
      away to Delphi, and having come to the Oracle they consulted it, saying
      that they were dwelling in Libya and that, though they were dwelling
      there, they fared none the better: and the Pythian prophetess made answer
      to them thus:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Better than I if thou knowest the Libyan land sheep-abounding,
  Not having been there than I who have been, at thy wisdom I wonder."
</pre>
<p>
      Having heard this Battos and his companions sailed away back again; for in
      fact the god would not let them off from the task of settlement till they
      had come to Libya itself: and having arrived at the island and taken up
      him whom they had left, they made a settlement in Libya itself at a spot
      opposite the island, called Aziris, which is enclosed by most fair woods
      on both sides and a river flows by it on one side.
    </p>
<p>
      158. In this spot they dwelt for six years; and in the seventh year the
      Libyans persuaded them to leave it, making request and saying that they
      would conduct them to a better region. So the Libyans led them from that
      place making them start towards evening; and in order that the Hellenes
      might not see the fairest of all the regions as they passed through it,
      they led them past it by night, having calculated the time of daylight:
      and this region is called Irasa. Then having conducted them to the
      so-called spring of Apollo, they said, "Hellenes, here is a fit place for
      you to dwell, for here the heaven is pierced with holes."
    </p>
<p>
      159. Now during the lifetime of the first settler Battos, who reigned
      forty years, and of his son Arkesilaos, who reigned sixteen years, the
      Kyrenians continued to dwell there with the same number as <a href="#link4note-142" id="link4noteref-142" class="pginternal">142</a>
      when they first set forth to the colony; but in the time of the third
      king, called Battos the Prosperous, the Pythian prophetess gave an oracle
      wherein she urged the Hellenes in general to sail and join with the
      Kyrenians in colonising Libya. For the Kyrenians invited them, giving
      promise of a division of land; and the oracle which she uttered was as
      follows:
    </p>
<pre>
 "Who to the land much desirèd, to Libya, afterwards cometh,
  After the land be divided, <a href="#link4note-143" id="link4noteref-143" class="pginternal">143</a> I say he shall some day repent it."
</pre>
<p>
      Then great numbers were gathered at Kyrene, and the Libyans who dwelt
      round had much land cut off from their possessions; therefore they with
      their king whose name was Adicran, as they were not only deprived of their
      country but also were dealt with very insolently by the Kyrenians, sent to
      Egypt and delivered themselves over to Apries king of Egypt. He then
      having gathered a great army of Egyptians, sent it against Kyrene; and the
      men of Kyrene marched out to the region of Irasa and to the spring Theste,
      <a href="#link4note-144" id="link4noteref-144" class="pginternal">144</a>
      and there both joined battle with the Egyptians and defeated them in the
      battle: for since the Egyptians had not before made trial of the Hellenes
      in fight and therefore despised them, they were so slaughtered that but
      few of them returned back to Egypt. In consequence of this and because
      they laid the blame of it upon Apries, the Egyptians revolted from him.
    </p>
<p>
      160. This Battos had a son called Arkesilaos, who first when he became
      king made a quarrel with his own brothers, until they finally departed to
      another region of Libya, and making the venture for themselves founded
      that city which was then and is now called Barca; and at the same time as
      they founded this, they induced the Libyans to revolt from the Kyrenians.
      After this, Arkesilaos made an expedition against those Libyans who had
      received them and who had also revolted from Kyrene, and the Libyans
      fearing him departed and fled towards the Eastern tribes of Libyans: and
      Arkesilaos followed after them as they fled, until he arrived in his
      pursuit at Leucon in Libya, and there the Libyans resolved to attack him.
      Accordingly they engaged battle and defeated the Kyrenians so utterly that
      seven thousand hoplites of the Kyrenians fell there. After this disaster
      Arkesilaos, being sick and having swallowed a potion, was strangled by his
      brother Haliarchos, <a href="#link4note-145" id="link4noteref-145" class="pginternal">145</a> and Haliarchos was killed treacherously by
      the wife of Arkesilaos, whose name was Eryxo.
    </p>
<p>
      161. Then Battos the son of Arkesilaos succeeded to the kingdom, who was
      lame and not sound in his feet: and the Kyrenians with a view to the
      misfortune which had befallen them sent men to Delphi to ask what form of
      rule they should adopt, in order to live in the best way possible; and the
      Pythian prophetess bade them take to themselves a reformer of their State
      from Mantineia of the Arcadians. The men of Kyrene accordingly made
      request, and those of Mantineia gave them the man of most repute among
      their citizens, whose name was Demonax. This man therefore having come to
      Kyrene and having ascertained all things exactly, <a href="#link4note-146" id="link4noteref-146" class="pginternal">146</a> in the first place
      caused them to have three tribes, distributing them thus:—one
      division he made of the Theraians and their dependants, <a href="#link4note-147" id="link4noteref-147" class="pginternal">147</a>
      another of the Peloponnesians and Cretans, and a third of all the
      islanders. <a href="#link4note-148" id="link4noteref-148" class="pginternal">148</a> Then secondly for the king Battos he set
      apart domains of land and priesthoods, but all the other powers which the
      kings used to possess before, he assigned as of public right to the
      people.
    </p>
<p>
      162. During the reign of this Battos things continued to be thus, but in
      the reign of his son Arkesilaos there arose much disturbance about the
      offices of the State: for Arkesilaos son of Battos the Lame and of
      Pheretime said that he would not suffer it to be according as the
      Mantineian Demonax had arranged, but asked to have back the royal rights
      of his forefathers. After this, stirring up strife he was worsted and went
      as an exile to Samos, and his mother to Salamis in Cyprus. Now at that
      time the ruler of Salamis was Euelthon, the same who dedicated as an
      offering the censer at Delphi, a work well worth seeing, which is placed
      in the treasury of the Corinthians. To him having come, Pheretime asked
      him for an army to restore herself and her son to Kyrene. Euelthon however
      was ready to give her anything else rather than that; and she when she
      received that which he gave her said that this too was a fair gift, but
      fairer still would be that other gift of an army for which she was asking.
      As she kept saying this to every thing which was given, at last Euelthon
      sent out to her a present of a golden spindle and distaff, with wool also
      upon it: and when Pheretime uttered again the same saying about this
      present, Euelthon said that such things as this were given as gifts to
      women and not an army.
    </p>
<p>
      163. Arkesilaos meanwhile, being in Samos, was gathering every one
      together by a promise of dividing land; and while a great host was being
      collected, Arkesilaos set out to Delphi to inquire of the Oracle about
      returning from exile: and the Pythian prophetess gave him this answer:
      "For four named Battos and four named Arkesilaos, eight generations of
      men, Loxias grants to you to be kings of Kyrene, but beyond this he
      counsels you not even to attempt it. Thou however must keep quiet when
      thou hast come back to thy land; and if thou findest the furnace full of
      jars, heat not the jars fiercely, but let them go with a fair wind: if
      however thou heat the furnace fiercely, enter not thou into the place
      flowed round by water; for if thou dost thou shalt die, both thou and the
      bull which is fairer than all the rest."
    </p>
<p>
      164. Thus the Pythian prophetess gave answer to Arkesilaos; and he, having
      taken to him those in Samos, made his return to Kyrene; and when he had
      got possession of the power, he did not remember the saying of the Oracle
      but endeavoured to exact penalties from those of the opposite faction for
      having driven him out. Of these some escaped out of the country
      altogether, but some Arkesilaos got into his power and sent them away to
      Cyprus to be put to death. These were driven out of their course to
      Cnidos, and the men of Cnidos rescued them and sent them away to Thera.
      Some others however of the Kyrenians fled to a great tower belonging to
      Aglomachos a private citizen, and Arkesilaos burnt them by piling up
      brushwood round. Then after he had done the deed he perceived that the
      Oracle meant this, in that the Pythian prophetess forbade him, if he found
      the jars in the furnace, to heat them fiercely; and he voluntarily kept
      away from the city of the Kyrenians, fearing the death which had been
      prophesied by the Oracle and supposing that Kyrene was flowed round by
      water. <a href="#link4note-149" id="link4noteref-149" class="pginternal">149</a> Now he had to wife a kinswoman of his own,
      the daughter of the king of Barca whose name was Alazeir: to him he came,
      and men of Barca together with certain of the exiles from Kyrene,
      perceiving him going about in the market-place, killed him, and also
      besides him his father-in-law Alazeir. Arkesilaos accordingly, having
      missed the meaning of the oracle, whether with his will or against his
      will, fulfilled his own destiny.
    </p>
<p>
      165. His mother Pheretime meanwhile, so long as Arkesilaos having worked
      evil for himself dwelt at Barca, herself held the royal power of her son
      at Kyrene, both exercising his other rights and also sitting in council:
      but when she heard that her son had been slain in Barca, she departed and
      fled to Egypt: for she had on her side services done for Cambyses the son
      of Cyrus by Arkesilaos, since this was the Arkesilaos who had given over
      Kyrene to Cambyses and had laid a tribute upon himself. Pheretime then
      having come to Egypt sat down as a suppliant of Aryandes, bidding him help
      her, and alleging as a reason that it was on account of his inclination to
      the side of the Medes that her son had been slain. 166. Now this Aryandes
      had been appointed ruler of the province of Egypt by Cambyses; and after
      the time of these events he lost his life because he would measure himself
      with Dareios. For having heard and seen that Dareios desired to leave
      behind him as a memorial of himself a thing which had not been made by any
      other king, he imitated him, until at last he received his reward: for
      whereas Dareios refined gold and made it as pure as possible, and of this
      caused coins to be struck, Aryandes, being ruler of Egypt, did the same
      thing with silver; and even now the purest silver is that which is called
      Aryandic. Dareios then having learnt that he was doing this put him to
      death, bringing against him another charge of attempting rebellion.
    </p>
<p>
      167. Now at the time of which I speak this Aryandes had compassion on
      Pheretime and gave her all the troops that were in Egypt, both the land
      and the sea forces, appointing Amasis a Maraphian to command the land-army
      and Badres, of the race of the Pasargadai, to command the fleet: but
      before he sent away the army, Aryandes despatched a herald to Barca and
      asked who it was who had killed Arkesilaos; and the men of Barca all took
      it upon themselves, for they said they suffered formerly many great evils
      at his hands. Having heard this, Aryandes at last sent away the army
      together with Pheretime. This charge then was the pretext alleged; but in
      fact the army was being sent out (as I believe) for the purpose of
      subduing Libya: for of the Libyans there are many nations of nations of
      various kinds, and but few of them are subject to the king, while the
      greater number paid no regard to Dareios.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      168. Now the Libyans have their dwelling as follows:—Beginning from
      Egypt, first of the Libyans are settled the Adyrmachidai, who practise for
      the most part the same customs as the Egyptians, but wear clothing similar
      to that of the other Libyans. Their women wear a bronze ring <a href="#link4note-150" id="link4noteref-150" class="pginternal">150</a>
      upon each leg, and they have long hair on their heads, and when they catch
      their lice, each one bites her own in retaliation and then throws them
      away. These are the only people of the Lybians who do this; and they alone
      display to the king their maidens when they are about to be married, and
      whosoever of them proves to be pleasing to the king is deflowered by him.
      These Adyrmachidai extend along the coast from Egypt as far as the port
      which is called Plynos.
    </p>
<p>
      169. Next after these come the Giligamai, <a href="#link4note-151" id="link4noteref-151" class="pginternal">151</a> occupying the
      country towards the West as far as the island of Aphrodisias. In the space
      within this limit lies off the coast the island of Platea, where the
      Kyrenians made their settlement; and on the coast of the mainland there is
      Port Menelaos, and Aziris, where the Kyrenians used to dwell. From this
      point begins the <i>silphion</i> <a href="#link4note-152" id="link4noteref-152" class="pginternal">152</a> and it extends along
      the coast from the island of Platea as far as the entrance of the Syrtis.
      This nation practises customs nearly resembling those of the rest.
    </p>
<p>
      170. Next to the Giligamai on the West are the Asbystai: <a href="#link4note-153" id="link4noteref-153" class="pginternal">153</a>
      these dwell above <a href="#link4note-154" id="link4noteref-154" class="pginternal">154</a> Kyrene, and the Asbystai do not reach down
      the sea, for the region along the sea is occupied by Kyrenians. These most
      of all the Libyans are drivers of four-horse chariots, and in the greater
      number of their customs they endeavour to imitate the Kyrenians.
    </p>
<p>
      171. Next after the Asbystai on the West come the Auchisai: these dwell
      above Barca and reach down to the sea by Euesperides: and in the middle of
      the country of the Auchisai dwell the Bacales, <a href="#link4note-155" id="link4noteref-155" class="pginternal">155</a> a small tribe, who
      reach down to the sea by the city of Taucheira in the territory of Barca:
      these practise the same customs as those above Kyrene.
    </p>
<p>
      172. Next after these Auschisai towards the West come the Nasamonians, a
      numerous race, who in the summer leave their flocks behind by the sea and
      go up to the region of Augila to gather the fruit of the date-palms, which
      grow in great numbers and very large and are all fruit-bearing: these hunt
      the wingless locusts, and they dry them in the sun and then pound them up,
      and after that they sprinkle them upon milk and drink them. Their custom
      is for each man to have many wives, and they make their intercourse with
      them common in nearly the same manner as the Massagetai, <a href="#link4note-156" id="link4noteref-156" class="pginternal">156</a>
      that is they set up a staff in front of the door and so have intercourse.
      When a Nasamonian man marries his first wife, the custom is for the bride
      on the first night to go through the whole number of the guests having
      intercourse with them, and each man when he has lain with her gives a
      gift, whatsoever he has brought with him from his house. The forms of oath
      and of divination which they use are as follows:—they swear by the
      men among themselves who are reported to have been the most righteous and
      brave, by these, I say, laying hands upon their tombs; and they divine by
      visiting the sepulchral mounds of their ancestors and lying down to sleep
      upon them after having prayed; and whatsoever thing the man sees in his
      dream, this he accepts. They practise also the exchange of pledges in the
      following manner, that is to say, one gives the other to drink from his
      hand, and drinks himself from the hand of the other; and if they have no
      liquid, they take of the dust from the ground and lick it.
    </p>
<p>
      173. Adjoining the Nasamonians is the country of the Psylloi. These have
      perished utterly in the following manner:—The South Wind blowing
      upon them dried up all their cisterns of water, and their land was
      waterless, lying all within the Syrtis. They then having taken a resolve
      by common consent, marched in arms against the South Wind (I report that
      which is reported by the Libyans), and when they had arrived at the sandy
      tract, the South Wind blew and buried them in the sand. These then having
      utterly perished, the Nasamonians from that time forward possess their
      land.
    </p>
<p>
      174. Above these towards the South Wind in the region of wild beasts dwell
      the Garamantians, <a href="#link4note-157" id="link4noteref-157" class="pginternal">157</a> who fly from every man and avoid the company
      of all; and they neither possess any weapon of war, nor know how to defend
      themselves against enemies.
    </p>
<p>
      175. These dwell above the Nasamonians; and next to the Nasamonians along
      the sea coast towards the West come the Macai, who shave their hair so as
      to leave tufts, letting the middle of their hair grow long, but round this
      on all sides shaving it close to the skin; and for fighting they carry
      shields made of ostrich skins. Through their land the river Kinyps runs
      out into the sea, flowing from a hill called the "Hill of the Charites."
      This Hill of the Charites is overgrown thickly with wood, while the rest
      of Libya which has been spoken of before is bare of trees; and the
      distance from the sea to this hill is two hundred furlongs.
    </p>
<p>
      176. Next to these Macai are the Gindanes, whose women wear each of them a
      number of anklets made of the skins of animals, for the following reason,
      as it is said:—for every man who has commerce with her she binds on
      an anklet, and the woman who has most is esteemed the best, since she has
      been loved by the greatest number of men.
    </p>
<p>
      177. In a peninsula which stands out into the sea from the land of these
      Gindanes dwell the Lotophagoi, who live by eating the fruit of the <i>lotos</i>
      only. Now the fruit of the lotos is in size like that of the mastich-tree,
      and in flavour <a href="#link4note-158" id="link4noteref-158" class="pginternal">158</a> it resembles that of the date-palm. Of this
      fruit the Lotophagoi even make for themselves wine.
    </p>
<p>
      178. Next after the Lotophagoi along the sea-coast are the Machlyans, who
      also make use of the lotos, but less than those above mentioned. These
      extend to a great river named the river Triton, and this runs out into a
      great lake called Tritonis, in which there is an island named Phla. About
      this island they say there was an oracle given to the Lacedemonians that
      they should make a settlement in it.
    </p>
<p>
      179. The following moreover is also told, namely that Jason, when the Argo
      had been completed by him under Mount Pelion, put into it a hecatomb and
      with it also <a href="#link4note-159" id="link4noteref-159" class="pginternal">159</a> a tripod of bronze, and sailed round
      Pelopponese, desiring to come to Delphi; and when in sailing he got near
      Malea, a North Wind seized his ship and carried it off to Libya, and
      before he caught sight of land he had come to be in the shoals of the lake
      Tritonis. Then as he was at a loss how he should bring his ship forth, the
      story goes that Triton appeared to him and bade Jason give him the tripod,
      saying that he would show them the right course and let them go away
      without hurt: and when Jason consented to it, then Triton showed them the
      passage out between the shoals and set the tripod in his own temple, after
      having first uttered a prophecy over the tripod <a href="#link4note-160" id="link4noteref-160" class="pginternal">160</a> and having declared
      to Jason and his company the whole matter, namely that whensoever one of
      the descendants of those who sailed with him in the Argo should carry away
      this tripod, then it was determined by fate that a hundred cities of
      Hellenes should be established about the lake Tritonis. Having heard this
      the native Libyans concealed the tripod.
    </p>
<p>
      180. Next to these Machlyans are the Auseans. These and the Machlyans
      dwell round the lake Tritonis, and the river Triton is the boundary
      between them: and while the Machlyans grow their hair long at the back of
      the head, the Auseans do so in front. At a yearly festival of Athene their
      maidens take their stand in two parties and fight against one another with
      stones and staves, and they say that in doing so they are fulfilling the
      rites handed down by their fathers for the divinity who was sprung from
      that land, whom we call Athene: and those of the maidens who die of the
      wounds received they call "false-maidens." But before they let them begin
      the fight they do this:—all join together and equip the maiden who
      is judged to be the fairest on each occasion, with a Corinthian helmet and
      with full Hellenic armour, and then causing her to go up into a chariot
      they conduct her round the lake. Now I cannot tell with what they equipped
      the maidens in old time, before the Hellenes were settled near them; but I
      suppose that they used to be equipped with Egyptian armour, for it is from
      Egypt that both the shield and the helmet have come to the Hellenes, as I
      affirm. They say moreover that Athene is the daughter of Poseidon and of
      the lake Tritonis, and that she had some cause of complaint against her
      father and therefore gave herself to Zeus, and Zeus made her his own
      daughter. Such is the story which these tell; and they have their
      intercourse with women in common, not marrying but having intercourse like
      cattle: and when the child of any woman has grown big, he is brought
      before a meeting of the men held within three months of that time, <a href="#link4note-161" id="link4noteref-161" class="pginternal">161</a>
      and whomsoever of the men the child resembles, his son he is accounted to
      be.
    </p>
<p>
      181. Thus then have been mentioned those nomad Libyans who live along the
      sea-coast: and above these inland is the region of Libya which has wild
      beasts; and above the wild-beast region there stretches a raised belt of
      sand, extending from Thebes of the Egyptians to the Pillars of Heracles.
      In this belt at intervals of about ten days' journey there are fragments
      of salt in great lumps forming hills, and at the top of each hill there
      shoots up from the middle of the salt a spring of water cold and sweet;
      and about the spring dwell men, at the furthest limit towards the desert,
      and above the wild-beast region. First, at a distance of ten days' journey
      from Thebes, are the Ammonians, whose temple is derived from that of the
      Theban Zeus, for the image of Zeus in Thebes also, as I have said before,
      <a href="#link4note-162" id="link4noteref-162" class="pginternal">162</a>
      has the head of a ram. These, as it chances, have also other water of a
      spring, which in the early morning is warm; at the time when the market
      fills, <a href="#link4note-163" id="link4noteref-163" class="pginternal">163</a> cooler; when midday comes, it is quite cold,
      and then they water their gardens; but as the day declines, it abates from
      its coldness, until at last, when the sun sets, the water is warm; and it
      continues to increase in heat still more until it reaches midnight, when
      it boils and throws up bubbles; and when midnight passes, it becomes
      cooler gradually till dawn of day. This spring is called the fountain of
      the Sun.
    </p>
<p>
      182. After the Ammonians, as you go on along the belt of sand, at an
      interval again of ten days' journey there is a hill of salt like that of
      the Ammonians, and a spring of water, with men dwelling about it; and the
      name of this place is Augila. To this the Nasamonians come year by year to
      gather the fruit of the date-palms.
    </p>
<p>
      183. From Augila at a distance again of ten days' journey there is another
      hill of salt and spring of water and a great number of fruit-bearing
      date-palms, as there are also in the other places: and men dwell here who
      are called the Garmantians, a very great nation, who carry earth to lay
      over the salt and then sow crops. From this point is the shortest way to
      the Lotophagoi, for from these it is a journey of thirty days to the
      country of the Garmantians. Among them also are produced the cattle which
      feed backwards; and they feed backwards for this reason, because they have
      their horns bent down forwards, and therefore they walk backwards as they
      feed; for forwards they cannot go, because the horns run into the ground
      in front of them; but in nothing else do they differ from other cattle
      except in this and in the thickness and firmness to the touch <a href="#link4note-164" id="link4noteref-164" class="pginternal">164</a>
      of their hide. These Garamantians of whom I speak hunt the "Cave-dwelling"
      <a href="#link4note-165" id="link4noteref-165" class="pginternal">165</a>
      Ethiopians with their four-horse chariots, for the Cave-dwelling
      Ethiopians are the swiftest of foot of all men about whom we hear report
      made: and the Cave-dwellers feed upon serpents and lizards and such
      creeping things, and they use a language which resembles no other, for in
      it they squeak just like bats.
    </p>
<p>
      184. From the Garmantians at a distance again of ten days' journey there
      is another hill of salt and spring of water, and men dwell round it called
      Atarantians, who alone of all men about whom we know are nameless; for
      while all taken together have the name Atarantians, each separate man of
      them has no name given to him. These utter curses against the Sun when he
      is at his height, <a href="#link4note-166" id="link4noteref-166" class="pginternal">166</a> and moreover revile him with all manner of
      foul terms, because he oppresses them by his burning heat, both themselves
      and their land. After this at a distance of ten days' journey there is
      another hill of salt and spring of water, and men dwell round it. Near
      this salt hill is a mountain named Atlas, which is small in circuit and
      rounded on every side; and so exceedingly lofty is it said to be, that it
      is not possible to see its summits, for clouds never leave them either in
      the summer or in the winter. This the natives say is the pillar of the
      heaven. After this mountain these men got their name, for they are called
      Atlantians; and it is said that they neither eat anything that has life
      nor have any dreams.
    </p>
<p>
      185. As far as these Atlantians I am able to mention in order the names of
      those who are settled in the belt of sand; but for the parts beyond these
      I can do so no more. However, the belt extends as far as the Pillars of
      Heracles and also in the parts outside them: and there is a mine of salt
      in it at a distance of ten days' journey from the Atlantians, and men
      dwelling there; and these all have their houses built of the lumps of
      salt, since these parts of Libya which we have now reached <a href="#link4note-167" id="link4noteref-167" class="pginternal">167</a>
      are without rain; for if it rained, the walls being made of salt would not
      be able to last: and the salt is dug up there both white and purple in
      colour. <a href="#link4note-168" id="link4noteref-168" class="pginternal">168</a> Above the sand-belt, in the parts which are
      in the direction of the South Wind and towards the interior of Libya, the
      country is uninhabited, without water and without wild beasts, rainless
      and treeless, and there is no trace of moisture in it.
    </p>
<p>
      186. I have said that from Egypt as far as the lake Tritonis Libyans dwell
      who are nomads, eating flesh and drinking milk; and these do not taste at
      all of the flesh of cows, for the same reason as the Egyptians also
      abstain from it, nor do they keep swine. Moreover the women of the
      Kyrenians too think it not right to eat cows' flesh, because of the
      Egyptian Isis, and they even keep fasts and celebrate festivals for her;
      and the women of Barca, in addition from cows' flesh, do not taste of
      swine either.
    </p>
<p>
      187. Thus it is with these matters: but in the region to the West of lake
      Tritonis the Libyans cease to be nomads, and they do not practise the same
      customs, nor do to their children anything like that which the nomads are
      wont to do; for the nomad Libyans, whether all of them I cannot say for
      certain, but many of them, do as follows:—when their children are
      four years old, they burn with a greasy piece of sheep's wool the veins in
      the crowns of their heads, and some of them burn the veins of the temples,
      so that for all their lives to come the cold humour may not run down from
      their heads and do them hurt: and for this reason it is (they say) that
      they are so healthy; for the Libyans are in truth the most healthy of all
      races concerning which we have knowledge, whether for this reason or not I
      cannot say for certain, but the most healthy they certainly are: and if,
      when they burn the children, a convulsion comes on, they have found out a
      remedy for this; for they pour upon them the water of a he-goat and so
      save them. I report that which is reported by the Libyans themselves.
    </p>
<p>
      188. The following is the manner of sacrifice which the nomads have:—they
      cut off a part of the animal's ear as a first offering and throw it over
      the house, <a href="#link4note-169" id="link4noteref-169" class="pginternal">169</a> and having done this they twist its neck.
      They sacrifice only to the Sun and the Moon; that is to say, to these all
      the Libyans sacrifice, but those who dwell round the lake Tritonis
      sacrifice most of all to Athene, and next to Triton and Poseidon.
    </p>
<p>
      189. It would appear also that the Hellenes made the dress and the <i>aigis</i>
      of the images of Athene after the model of the Libyan women; for except
      that the dress of the Libyan women is of leather, and the tassels which
      hang from their <i>aigis</i> are not formed of serpents but of leather
      thongs, in all other respects Athene is dressed like them. Moreover the
      name too declares that the dress of the figures of Pallas has come from
      Libya, for the Libyan women wear over their other garments bare goat-skins
      (<i>aigeas</i>) with tasselled fringes and coloured over with red madder,
      and from the name of these goat-skins the Hellenes formed the name <i>aigis</i>.
      I think also that in these regions first arose the practice of crying
      aloud during the performance of sacred rites, for the Libyan women do this
      very well. <a href="#link4note-170" id="link4noteref-170" class="pginternal">170</a> The Hellenes learnt from the Libyans also
      the yoking together of four horses.
    </p>
<p>
      190. The nomads bury those who die just in the same manner as the
      Hellenes, except only the Nasamonians: these bury bodies in a sitting
      posture, taking care at the moment when the man expires to place him
      sitting and not to let him die lying down on his back. They have dwellings
      composed of the stems of asphodel entwined with rushes, and so made that
      they can be carried about. Such are the customs followed by these tribes.
    </p>
<p>
      191. On the West of the river Triton next after the Auseans come Libyans
      who are tillers of the soil, and whose custom it is to possess fixed
      habitations; and they are called Maxyans. They grow their hair long on the
      right side of their heads and cut it short upon the left, and smear their
      bodies over with red ochre. These say that they are of the men who came
      from Troy.
    </p>
<p>
      This country and the rest of Libya which is towards the West is both much
      more frequented by wild beasts and much more thickly wooded than the
      country of the nomads: for whereas the part of Libya which is situated
      towards the East, where the nomads dwell, is low-lying and sandy up to the
      river Triton, that which succeeds it towards the West, the country of
      those who till the soil, is exceedingly mountainous and thickly-wooded and
      full of wild beasts: for in the land of these are found both the monstrous
      serpent and the lion and the elephant, and bears and venomous snakes and
      horned asses, besides the dog-headed men, and the headless men with their
      eyes set in their breasts (at least so say the Libyans about them), and
      the wild men and wild women, and a great multitude of other beasts which
      are not fabulous like these. <a href="#link4note-171" id="link4noteref-171" class="pginternal">171</a>
</p>
<p>
      192. In the land of the nomads however there exist none of these, but
      other animals as follows:—white-rump antelopes, gazelles, buffaloes,
      asses, not the horned kind but others which go without water (for in fact
      these never drink), oryes, <a href="#link4note-172" id="link4noteref-172" class="pginternal">172</a> whose horns are made into the sides of the
      Phenician lyre (this animal is in size about equal to an ox), small foxes,
      hyenas, porcupines, wild rams, wolves, <a href="#link4note-173" id="link4noteref-173" class="pginternal">173</a> jackals, panthers,
      boryes, land-crocodiles about three cubits in length and very much
      resembling lizards, ostriches, and small snakes, each with one horn: these
      wild animals there are in this country, as well as those which exist
      elsewhere, except the stag and the wild-boar; but Libya has no stags nor
      wild boars at all. Also there are in this country three kinds of mice, one
      is called the "two-legged" mouse, another the <i>zegeris</i> (a name which
      is Libyan and signifies in the Hellenic tongue a "hill"), and a third the
      "prickly" mouse. <a href="#link4note-174" id="link4noteref-174" class="pginternal">174</a> There are also weasels produced in the <i>silphion</i>,
      which are very like those of Tartessos. Such are the wild animals which
      the land of the Libyans possesses, so far as we were able to discover by
      inquiries extended as much as possible.
    </p>
<p>
      193. Next to the Maxyan Libyans are the Zauekes, <a href="#link4note-175" id="link4noteref-175" class="pginternal">175</a> whose women drive
      their chariots for them to war.
    </p>
<p>
      194. Next to these are the Gyzantes, <a href="#link4note-176" id="link4noteref-176" class="pginternal">176</a> among whom honey is
      made in great quantity by bees, but in much greater quantity still it is
      said to be made by men, who work at it as a trade. However that may be,
      these all smear themselves over with red ochre and eat monkeys, which are
      produced in very great numbers upon their mountains.
    </p>
<p>
      195. Opposite these, as the Carthaginians say, there lies an island called
      Kyrauis, two hundred furlongs in length but narrow, to which one may walk
      over from the mainland; and it is full of olives and vines. In it they say
      there is a pool, from which the native girls with birds' feathers smeared
      over with pitch bring up gold-dust out of the mud. Whether this is really
      so I do not know, but I write that which is reported; and nothing is
      impossible, <a href="#link4note-177" id="link4noteref-177" class="pginternal">177</a> for even in Zakynthos I saw myself pitch
      brought up out of a pool of water. There are there several pools, and the
      largest of them measures seventy feet each way and is two fathoms in
      depth. Into this they plunge a pole with a myrtle-branch bound to it, and
      then with the branch of the myrtle they bring up pitch, which has the
      smell of asphalt, but in other respects it is superior to the pitch of
      Pieria. This they pour into a pit dug near the pool; and when they have
      collected a large quantity, then they pour it into the jars from the pit:
      and whatever thing falls into the pool goes under ground and reappears in
      the sea, which is distant about four furlongs from the pool. Thus then the
      report about the island lying near the coast of Libya is also probably
      enough true.
    </p>
<p>
      196. The Carthaginians say also this, namely that there is a place in
      Libya and men dwelling there, outside the Pillars of Heracles, to whom
      when they have come and have taken the merchandise forth from their ships,
      they set it in order along the beach and embark again in their ships, and
      after that they raise a smoke; and the natives of the country seeing the
      smoke come to the sea, and then they lay down gold as an equivalent for
      the merchandise and retire to a distance away from the merchandise. The
      Carthaginians upon that disembark and examine it, and if the gold is in
      their opinion sufficient for the value of the merchandise, they take it up
      and go their way; but if not, they embark again in their ships and sit
      there; and the others approach and straightway add more gold to the
      former, until they satisfy them: and they say that neither party wrongs
      the other; for neither do the Carthaginians lay hands on the gold until it
      is made equal to the value of their merchandise, nor do the others lay
      hands on the merchandise until the Carthaginians have taken the gold.
    </p>
<p>
      197. These are the Libyan tribes whom we are able to name; and of these
      the greater number neither now pay any regard to the king of the Medes nor
      did they then. Thus much also I have to say about this land, namely that
      it is occupied by four races and no more, so far as we know; and of these
      races two are natives of the soil and the other two not so; for the
      Libyans and the Ethiopians are natives, the one race dwelling in the
      Northern parts of Libya and the other in the Southern, while the
      Phenicians and the Hellenes are strangers.
    </p>
<p>
      198. I think moreover that (besides other things) in goodness of soil
      Libya does not very greatly excel <a href="#link4note-178" id="link4noteref-178" class="pginternal">178</a> as compared with
      Asia or Europe, except only the region of Kinyps, for the same name is
      given to the land as to the river. This region is equal to the best of
      lands in bringing forth the fruit of Demeter, <a href="#link4note-179" id="link4noteref-179" class="pginternal">179</a> nor does it at all
      resemble the rest of Libya; for it has black soil and is watered by
      springs, and neither has it fear of drought nor is it hurt by drinking too
      abundantly of rain; for rain there is in this part of Libya. Of the
      produce of the crops the same measures hold good here as for the
      Babylonian land. And that is good land also which the Euesperites occupy,
      for when it bears best it produces a hundred-fold, but the land in the
      region of Kinyps produces sometimes as much as three-hundred-fold.
    </p>
<p>
      199. Moreover the land of Kyrene, which is the highest land of the part of
      Libya which is occupied by nomads, has within its confines three seasons
      of harvest, at which we may marvel: for the parts by the sea-coasts first
      have their fruits ripe for reaping and for gathering the vintage; and when
      these have been gathered in, the parts which lie above the sea-side
      places, those situated in the middle, which they call the hills, <a href="#link4note-180" id="link4noteref-180" class="pginternal">180</a>
      are ripe for the gathering in; and as soon as this middle crop has been
      gathered in, that in the highest part of the land comes to perfection and
      is ripe; so that by the time the first crop has been eaten and drunk up,
      the last is just coming in. Thus the harvest for the Kyrenians lasts eight
      months. Let so much as has been said suffice for these things.
    </p>
<hr>
<p>
      200. Now when the Persian helpers of Pheretime, <a href="#link4note-181" id="link4noteref-181" class="pginternal">181</a> having been sent
      from Egypt by Aryandes, had arrived at Barca, they laid siege to the city,
      proposing to the inhabitants that they should give up those who were
      guilty of the murder of Arkesilaos: but as all their people had taken a
      share in the guilt, they did not accept the proposals. Then they besieged
      Barca for nine months, both digging underground passages which led to the
      wall and making vigorous attacks upon it. Now the passages dug were
      discovered by a worker of bronze with a shield covered over with bronze,
      who had thought of a plan as follows:—carrying it round within the
      wall he applied it to the ground in the city, and whereas the other places
      to which he applied it were noiseless, at those places where digging was
      going on the bronze of the shield gave a sound; and the men of Barca would
      make a countermine there and slay the Persians who were digging mines.
      This then was discovered as I have said, and the attacks were repulsed by
      the men of Barca.
    </p>
<p>
      201. Then as they were suffering hardship for a long time and many were
      falling on both sides, and especially on that of the Persians, Amasis the
      commander of the land-army contrived as follows:—perceiving that the
      Barcaians were not to be conquered by force but might be conquered by
      guile, he dug by night a broad trench and over it he laid timber of no
      great strength, and brought earth and laid it above on the top of the
      timber, making it level with the rest of the ground: then at daybreak he
      invited the men of Barca to a parley; and they gladly consented, and at
      last they agreed to make a treaty: and the treaty they made with one
      another was taken over the hidden trench, namely that so long as this
      earth should continue to be as it was, so long the oath should remain
      firm, and that the men of Barca should promise to pay tribute of due
      amount to the king, and the Persians should do no further violence to the
      men of Barca. <a href="#link4note-182" id="link4noteref-182" class="pginternal">182</a> After the oath the men of Barca trusting to
      these engagements both went forth themselves from their city and let any
      who desired it of the enemy pass within their walls, having opened all the
      gates; but the Persians first broke down the concealed bridge and then
      began to run inside the city wall. And the reason why they broke down the
      bridge which they had made was that they might keep their oaths, since
      they had sworn to the men of Barca that the oath should remain firm continually
      for so long time as the earth should remain as it then was, but after that
      they had broken it down, the oath no longer remained firm.
    </p>
<p>
      202. Now the most guilty of the Barcaians, when they were delivered to her
      by the Persians, Pheretime impaled in a ring round about the wall; and she
      cut off the breasts of their wives and set the wall round with these also
      in order: but the rest of the men of Barca she bade the Persians carry off
      as spoil, except so many of them as were of the house of Battos and not
      sharers in the guilt of the murder; and to these Pheretime gave the city
      in charge.
    </p>
<p>
      203. So the Persians having made slaves of the rest of the Barcaians
      departed to go back: and when they appeared at the gates of the city of
      Kyrene, the Kyrenians let them go through their town in order to avoid
      neglect of some oracle. Then as the army was going through, Badres the
      commander of the fleet urged that they should capture the city, but Amasis
      the commander of the land-army would not consent to it; for he said that
      they had been sent against no other city of the Hellenes except Barca.
      When however they had passed through and were encamping on the hill of
      Zeus Lycaios, they repented of not having taken possession of Kyrene; and
      they endeavoured again to pass into it, but the men of Kyrene would not
      allow them. Then upon the Persians, although no one fought against them,
      there fell a sudden panic, and they ran away for about sixty furlongs and
      then encamped. And when the camp had been placed here, there came to it a
      messenger from Aryandes summoning them back; so the Persians asked the
      Kyrenians to give them provisions for their march and obtained their
      request; and having received these, they departed to go to Egypt. After
      this the Libyans took them up, <a href="#link4note-183" id="link4noteref-183" class="pginternal">183</a> and killed for the
      sake of their clothes and equipment those of them who at any time were
      left or straggled behind, until at last they came to Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      204. This army of the Persians reached Euesperides, and this was their
      furthest point in Libya: and those of the Barcaians whom they had reduced
      to slavery they removed again from Egypt and brought them to the king, and
      king Dareios gave them a village in the land of Bactria in which to make a
      settlement. To this village they gave the name of Barca, and it still
      continued to be inhabited by them even down to my own time, in the land of
      Bactria.
    </p>
<p>
      205. Pheretime however did not bring her life happily to an end any more
      than they: for as soon as she had returned from Libya to Egypt after
      having avenged herself on the Barcaians, she died an evil death, having
      become suddenly full of worms while yet alive: for, as it seems, too
      severe punishments inflicted by men prove displeasing <a href="#link4note-184" id="link4noteref-184" class="pginternal">184</a>
      to the gods. Such and so great was the punishment inflicted by Pheretime
      the wife of Battos on the men of Barca.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.
</div><div>
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2 id="pg-footer-heading">THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</h2>

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

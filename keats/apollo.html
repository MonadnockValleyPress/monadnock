<h1>Ode to Apollo</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<p>
In thy western halls of gold<br/>
When thou sittest in thy state,<br/>
Bards, that erst sublimely told<br/>
Heroic deeds, and sang of fate,<br/>
With fervour seize their adamantine lyres,<br/>
Whose chords are solid rays, and twinkle radiant fires.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here Homer with his nervous arms<br/>
Strikes the twanging harp of war,<br/>
And even the western splendour warms,<br/>
While the trumpets sound afar:<br/>
But, what creates the most intense surprise,<br/>
His soul looks out through renovated eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, through thy Temple wide, melodious swells<br/>
The sweet majestic tone of Maro's lyre:<br/>
The soul delighted on each accent dwells, &mdash;<br/>
Enraptur'd dwells, &mdash; not daring to respire,<br/>
The while he tells of grief around a funeral pyre.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Tis awful silence then again;<br/>
Expectant stand the spheres;<br/>
Breathless the laurell'd peers,<br/>
Nor move, till ends the lofty strain,<br/>
Nor move till Milton's tuneful thunders cease,<br/>
And leave once more the ravish'd heavens in peace.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thou biddest Shakspeare wave his hand,<br/>
And quickly forward spring<br/>
The Passions &mdash; a terrific band &mdash;<br/>
And each vibrates the string<br/>
That with its tyrant temper best accords,<br/>
While from their Master's lips pour forth the inspiring words.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A silver trumpet Spenser blows,<br/>
And, as its martial notes to silence flee,<br/>
From a virgin chorus flows<br/>
A hymn in praise of spotless Chastity.<br/>
'Tis still! Wild warblings from the Æolian lyre<br/>
Enchantment softly breathe, and tremblingly expire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next thy Tasso's ardent numbers<br/>
Float along the pleasèd air,<br/>
Calling youth from idle slumbers,<br/>
Rousing them from Pleasure's lair: &mdash;<br/>
Then o'er the strings his fingers gently move,<br/>
And melt the soul to pity and to love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But when <em>Thou</em> joinest with the Nine,<br/>
And all the powers of song combine,<br/>
We listen here on earth:<br/>
Thy dying tones that fill the air,<br/>
And charm the ear of evening fair,<br/>
From thee, great God of Bards, receive their heavenly birth.<br/>

<h1>Lamia</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<h2>Part I</h2>
<p>
Upon a time, before the faery broods<br/>
Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods,<br/>
Before King Oberon's bright diadem,<br/>
Sceptre, and mantle, clasp'd with dewy gem,<br/>
Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns<br/>
From rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns,<br/>
The ever-smitten Hermes empty left<br/>
His golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft:<br/>
From high Olympus had he stolen light,<br/>
On this side of Jove's clouds, to escape the sight<br/>
Of his great summoner, and made retreat<br/>
Into a forest on the shores of Crete.<br/>
For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt<br/>
A nymph, to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt;<br/>
At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured<br/>
Pearls, while on land they wither'd and adored.<br/>
Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont,<br/>
And in those meads where sometime she might haunt,<br/>
Were strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse,<br/>
Though Fancy's casket were unlock'd to choose.<br/>
Ah, what a world of love was at her feet!<br/>
So Hermes thought, and a celestial heat<br/>
Burnt from his winged heels to either ear,<br/>
That from a whiteness, as the lily clear,<br/>
Blush'd into roses 'mid his golden hair,<br/>
Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare.<br/>
From vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew,<br/>
Breathing upon the flowers his passion new,<br/>
And wound with many a river to its head,<br/>
To find where this sweet nymph prepar'd her secret bed:<br/>
In vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found,<br/>
And so he rested, on the lonely ground,<br/>
Pensive, and full of painful jealousies<br/>
Of the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees.<br/>
There as he stood, he heard a mournful voice,<br/>
Such as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys<br/>
All pain but pity: thus the lone voice spake:<br/>
"When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake!<br/>
When move in a sweet body fit for life,<br/>
And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife<br/>
Of hearts and lips! Ah, miserable me!"<br/>
The God, dove-footed, glided silently<br/>
Round bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed,<br/>
The taller grasses and full-flowering weed,<br/>
Until he found a palpitating snake,<br/>
Bright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue,<br/>
Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue;<br/>
Striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard,<br/>
Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr'd;<br/>
And full of silver moons, that, as she breathed,<br/>
Dissolv'd, or brighter shone, or interwreathed<br/>
Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries&mdash;<br/>
So rainbow-sided, touch'd with miseries,<br/>
She seem'd, at once, some penanced lady elf,<br/>
Some demon's mistress, or the demon's self.<br/>
Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire<br/>
Sprinkled with stars, like Ariadne's tiar:<br/>
Her head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet!<br/>
She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete:<br/>
And for her eyes: what could such eyes do there<br/>
But weep, and weep, that they were born so fair?<br/>
As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air.<br/>
Her throat was serpent, but the words she spake<br/>
Came, as through bubbling honey, for Love's sake,<br/>
And thus; while Hermes on his pinions lay,<br/>
Like a stoop'd falcon ere he takes his prey.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Fair Hermes, crown'd with feathers, fluttering light,<br/>
I had a splendid dream of thee last night:<br/>
I saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold,<br/>
Among the Gods, upon Olympus old,<br/>
The only sad one; for thou didst not hear<br/>
The soft, lute-finger'd Muses chaunting clear,<br/>
Nor even Apollo when he sang alone,<br/>
Deaf to his throbbing throat's long, long melodious moan.<br/>
I dreamt I saw thee, robed in purple flakes,<br/>
Break amorous through the clouds, as morning breaks,<br/>
And, swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart,<br/>
Strike for the Cretan isle; and here thou art!<br/>
Too gentle Hermes, hast thou found the maid?"<br/>
Whereat the star of Lethe not delay'd<br/>
His rosy eloquence, and thus inquired:<br/>
"Thou smooth-lipp'd serpent, surely high inspired!<br/>
Thou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes,<br/>
Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise,<br/>
Telling me only where my nymph is fled,&mdash;<br/>
Where she doth breathe!" "Bright planet, thou hast said,"<br/>
Return'd the snake, "but seal with oaths, fair God!"<br/>
"I swear," said Hermes, "by my serpent rod,<br/>
And by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown!"<br/>
Light flew his earnest words, among the blossoms blown.<br/>
Then thus again the brilliance feminine:<br/>
"Too frail of heart! for this lost nymph of thine,<br/>
Free as the air, invisibly, she strays<br/>
About these thornless wilds; her pleasant days<br/>
She tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet<br/>
Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet;<br/>
From weary tendrils, and bow'd branches green,<br/>
She plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen:<br/>
And by my power is her beauty veil'd<br/>
To keep it unaffronted, unassail'd<br/>
By the love-glances of unlovely eyes,<br/>
Of Satyrs, Fauns, and blear'd Silenus' sighs.<br/>
Pale grew her immortality, for woe<br/>
Of all these lovers, and she grieved so<br/>
I took compassion on her, bade her steep<br/>
Her hair in weird syrops, that would keep<br/>
Her loveliness invisible, yet free<br/>
To wander as she loves, in liberty.<br/>
Thou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone,<br/>
If thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon!"<br/>
Then, once again, the charmed God began<br/>
An oath, and through the serpent's ears it ran<br/>
Warm, tremulous, devout, psalterian.<br/>
Ravish'd, she lifted her Circean head,<br/>
Blush'd a live damask, and swift-lisping said,<br/>
"I was a woman, let me have once more<br/>
A woman's shape, and charming as before.<br/>
I love a youth of Corinth&mdash;O the bliss!<br/>
Give me my woman's form, and place me where he is.<br/>
Stoop, Hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow,<br/>
And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now."<br/>
The God on half-shut feathers sank serene,<br/>
She breath'd upon his eyes, and swift was seen<br/>
Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green.<br/>
It was no dream; or say a dream it was,<br/>
Real are the dreams of Gods, and smoothly pass<br/>
Their pleasures in a long immortal dream.<br/>
One warm, flush'd moment, hovering, it might seem<br/>
Dash'd by the wood-nymph's beauty, so he burn'd;<br/>
Then, lighting on the printless verdure, turn'd<br/>
To the swoon'd serpent, and with languid arm,<br/>
Delicate, put to proof the lythe Caducean charm.<br/>
So done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent,<br/>
Full of adoring tears and blandishment,<br/>
And towards her stept: she, like a moon in wane,<br/>
Faded before him, cower'd, nor could restrain<br/>
Her fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower<br/>
That faints into itself at evening hour:<br/>
But the God fostering her chilled hand,<br/>
She felt the warmth, her eyelids open'd bland,<br/>
And, like new flowers at morning song of bees,<br/>
Bloom'd, and gave up her honey to the lees.<br/>
Into the green-recessed woods they flew;<br/>
Nor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Left to herself, the serpent now began<br/>
To change; her elfin blood in madness ran,<br/>
Her mouth foam'd, and the grass, therewith besprent,<br/>
Wither'd at dew so sweet and virulent;<br/>
Her eyes in torture fix'd, and anguish drear,<br/>
Hot, glaz'd, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear,<br/>
Flash'd phosphor and sharp sparks, without one cooling tear.<br/>
The colours all inflam'd throughout her train,<br/>
She writh'd about, convuls'd with scarlet pain:<br/>
A deep volcanian yellow took the place<br/>
Of all her milder-mooned body's grace;<br/>
And, as the lava ravishes the mead,<br/>
Spoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede;<br/>
Made gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars,<br/>
Eclips'd her crescents, and lick'd up her stars:<br/>
So that, in moments few, she was undrest<br/>
Of all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst,<br/>
And rubious-argent: of all these bereft,<br/>
Nothing but pain and ugliness were left.<br/>
Still shone her crown; that vanish'd, also she<br/>
Melted and disappear'd as suddenly;<br/>
And in the air, her new voice luting soft,<br/>
Cried, "Lycius! gentle Lycius!"&mdash;Borne aloft<br/>
With the bright mists about the mountains hoar<br/>
These words dissolv'd: Crete's forests heard no more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Whither fled Lamia, now a lady bright,<br/>
A full-born beauty new and exquisite?<br/>
She fled into that valley they pass o'er<br/>
Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas' shore;<br/>
And rested at the foot of those wild hills,<br/>
The rugged founts of the Peraean rills,<br/>
And of that other ridge whose barren back<br/>
Stretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack,<br/>
South-westward to Cleone. There she stood<br/>
About a young bird's flutter from a wood,<br/>
Fair, on a sloping green of mossy tread,<br/>
By a clear pool, wherein she passioned<br/>
To see herself escap'd from so sore ills,<br/>
While her robes flaunted with the daffodils.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ah, happy Lycius!&mdash;for she was a maid<br/>
More beautiful than ever twisted braid,<br/>
Or sigh'd, or blush'd, or on spring-flowered lea<br/>
Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy:<br/>
A virgin purest lipp'd, yet in the lore<br/>
Of love deep learned to the red heart's core:<br/>
Not one hour old, yet of sciential brain<br/>
To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain;<br/>
Define their pettish limits, and estrange<br/>
Their points of contact, and swift counterchange;<br/>
Intrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart<br/>
Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art;<br/>
As though in Cupid's college she had spent<br/>
Sweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent,<br/>
And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Why this fair creature chose so fairily<br/>
By the wayside to linger, we shall see;<br/>
But first 'tis fit to tell how she could muse<br/>
And dream, when in the serpent prison-house,<br/>
Of all she list, strange or magnificent:<br/>
How, ever, where she will'd, her spirit went;<br/>
Whether to faint Elysium, or where<br/>
Down through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair<br/>
Wind into Thetis' bower by many a pearly stair;<br/>
Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine,<br/>
Stretch'd out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine;<br/>
Or where in Pluto's gardens palatine<br/>
Mulciber's columns gleam in far piazzian line.<br/>
And sometimes into cities she would send<br/>
Her dream, with feast and rioting to blend;<br/>
And once, while among mortals dreaming thus,<br/>
She saw the young Corinthian Lycius<br/>
Charioting foremost in the envious race,<br/>
Like a young Jove with calm uneager face,<br/>
And fell into a swooning love of him.<br/>
Now on the moth-time of that evening dim<br/>
He would return that way, as well she knew,<br/>
To Corinth from the shore; for freshly blew<br/>
The eastern soft wind, and his galley now<br/>
Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow<br/>
In port Cenchreas, from Egina isle<br/>
Fresh anchor'd; whither he had been awhile<br/>
To sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there<br/>
Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare.<br/>
Jove heard his vows, and better'd his desire;<br/>
For by some freakful chance he made retire<br/>
From his companions, and set forth to walk,<br/>
Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk:<br/>
Over the solitary hills he fared,<br/>
Thoughtless at first, but ere eve's star appeared<br/>
His phantasy was lost, where reason fades,<br/>
In the calm'd twilight of Platonic shades.<br/>
Lamia beheld him coming, near, more near&mdash;<br/>
Close to her passing, in indifference drear,<br/>
His silent sandals swept the mossy green;<br/>
So neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen<br/>
She stood: he pass'd, shut up in mysteries,<br/>
His mind wrapp'd like his mantle, while her eyes<br/>
Follow'd his steps, and her neck regal white<br/>
Turn'd&mdash;syllabling thus, "Ah, Lycius bright,<br/>
And will you leave me on the hills alone?<br/>
Lycius, look back! and be some pity shown."<br/>
He did; not with cold wonder fearingly,<br/>
But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice;<br/>
For so delicious were the words she sung,<br/>
It seem'd he had lov'd them a whole summer long:<br/>
And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up,<br/>
Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup,<br/>
And still the cup was full,&mdash;while he afraid<br/>
Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid<br/>
Due adoration, thus began to adore;<br/>
Her soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so sure:<br/>
"Leave thee alone! Look back! Ah, Goddess, see<br/>
Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee!<br/>
For pity do not this sad heart belie&mdash;<br/>
Even as thou vanishest so I shall die.<br/>
Stay! though a Naiad of the rivers, stay!<br/>
To thy far wishes will thy streams obey:<br/>
Stay! though the greenest woods be thy domain,<br/>
Alone they can drink up the morning rain:<br/>
Though a descended Pleiad, will not one<br/>
Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune<br/>
Thy spheres, and as thy silver proxy shine?<br/>
So sweetly to these ravish'd ears of mine<br/>
Came thy sweet greeting, that if thou shouldst fade<br/>
Thy memory will waste me to a shade&mdash;<br/>
For pity do not melt!"&mdash;"If I should stay,"<br/>
Said Lamia, "here, upon this floor of clay,<br/>
And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough,<br/>
What canst thou say or do of charm enough<br/>
To dull the nice remembrance of my home?<br/>
Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam<br/>
Over these hills and vales, where no joy is,&mdash;<br/>
Empty of immortality and bliss!<br/>
Thou art a scholar, Lycius, and must know<br/>
That finer spirits cannot breathe below<br/>
In human climes, and live: Alas! poor youth,<br/>
What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe<br/>
My essence? What serener palaces,<br/>
Where I may all my many senses please,<br/>
And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease?<br/>
It cannot be&mdash;Adieu!" So said, she rose<br/>
Tiptoe with white arms spread. He, sick to lose<br/>
The amorous promise of her lone complain,<br/>
Swoon'd, murmuring of love, and pale with pain.<br/>
The cruel lady, without any show<br/>
Of sorrow for her tender favourite's woe,<br/>
But rather, if her eyes could brighter be,<br/>
With brighter eyes and slow amenity,<br/>
Put her new lips to his, and gave afresh<br/>
The life she had so tangled in her mesh:<br/>
And as he from one trance was wakening<br/>
Into another, she began to sing,<br/>
Happy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing,<br/>
A song of love, too sweet for earthly lyres,<br/>
While, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting fires<br/>
And then she whisper'd in such trembling tone,<br/>
As those who, safe together met alone<br/>
For the first time through many anguish'd days,<br/>
Use other speech than looks; bidding him raise<br/>
His drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt,<br/>
For that she was a woman, and without<br/>
Any more subtle fluid in her veins<br/>
Than throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains<br/>
Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his.<br/>
And next she wonder'd how his eyes could miss<br/>
Her face so long in Corinth, where, she said,<br/>
She dwelt but half retir'd, and there had led<br/>
Days happy as the gold coin could invent<br/>
Without the aid of love; yet in content<br/>
Till she saw him, as once she pass'd him by,<br/>
Where 'gainst a column he leant thoughtfully<br/>
At Venus' temple porch, 'mid baskets heap'd<br/>
Of amorous herbs and flowers, newly reap'd<br/>
Late on that eve, as 'twas the night before<br/>
The Adonian feast; whereof she saw no more,<br/>
But wept alone those days, for why should she adore?<br/>
Lycius from death awoke into amaze,<br/>
To see her still, and singing so sweet lays;<br/>
Then from amaze into delight he fell<br/>
To hear her whisper woman's lore so well;<br/>
And every word she spake entic'd him on<br/>
To unperplex'd delight and pleasure known.<br/>
Let the mad poets say whate'er they please<br/>
Of the sweets of Fairies, Peris, Goddesses,<br/>
There is not such a treat among them all,<br/>
Haunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall,<br/>
As a real woman, lineal indeed<br/>
From Pyrrha's pebbles or old Adam's seed.<br/>
Thus gentle Lamia judg'd, and judg'd aright,<br/>
That Lycius could not love in half a fright,<br/>
So threw the goddess off, and won his heart<br/>
More pleasantly by playing woman's part,<br/>
With no more awe than what her beauty gave,<br/>
That, while it smote, still guaranteed to save.<br/>
Lycius to all made eloquent reply,<br/>
Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh;<br/>
And last, pointing to Corinth, ask'd her sweet,<br/>
If 'twas too far that night for her soft feet.<br/>
The way was short, for Lamia's eagerness<br/>
Made, by a spell, the triple league decrease<br/>
To a few paces; not at all surmised<br/>
By blinded Lycius, so in her comprized.<br/>
They pass'd the city gates, he knew not how<br/>
So noiseless, and he never thought to know.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As men talk in a dream, so Corinth all,<br/>
Throughout her palaces imperial,<br/>
And all her populous streets and temples lewd,<br/>
Mutter'd, like tempest in the distance brew'd,<br/>
To the wide-spreaded night above her towers.<br/>
Men, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours,<br/>
Shuffled their sandals o'er the pavement white,<br/>
Companion'd or alone; while many a light<br/>
Flared, here and there, from wealthy festivals,<br/>
And threw their moving shadows on the walls,<br/>
Or found them cluster'd in the corniced shade<br/>
Of some arch'd temple door, or dusky colonnade.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear,<br/>
Her fingers he press'd hard, as one came near<br/>
With curl'd gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald crown,<br/>
Slow-stepp'd, and robed in philosophic gown:<br/>
Lycius shrank closer, as they met and past,<br/>
Into his mantle, adding wings to haste,<br/>
While hurried Lamia trembled: "Ah," said he,<br/>
"Why do you shudder, love, so ruefully?<br/>
Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew?"&mdash;<br/>
"I'm wearied," said fair Lamia: "tell me who<br/>
Is that old man? I cannot bring to mind<br/>
His features&mdash;Lycius! wherefore did you blind<br/>
Yourself from his quick eyes?" Lycius replied,<br/>
'Tis Apollonius sage, my trusty guide<br/>
And good instructor; but to-night he seems<br/>
The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While yet he spake they had arrived before<br/>
A pillar'd porch, with lofty portal door,<br/>
Where hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow<br/>
Reflected in the slabbed steps below,<br/>
Mild as a star in water; for so new,<br/>
And so unsullied was the marble hue,<br/>
So through the crystal polish, liquid fine,<br/>
Ran the dark veins, that none but feet divine<br/>
Could e'er have touch'd there. Sounds Aeolian<br/>
Breath'd from the hinges, as the ample span<br/>
Of the wide doors disclos'd a place unknown<br/>
Some time to any, but those two alone,<br/>
And a few Persian mutes, who that same year<br/>
Were seen about the markets: none knew where<br/>
They could inhabit; the most curious<br/>
Were foil'd, who watch'd to trace them to their house:<br/>
And but the flitter-winged verse must tell,<br/>
For truth's sake, what woe afterwards befel,<br/>
'Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus,<br/>
Shut from the busy world of more incredulous.<br/>

<h1>Hyperion</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<h2>Book III</h2>
<p>
Thus in alternate uproar and sad peace,<br/>
Amazed were those Titans utterly.<br/>
O leave them, Muse! O leave them to their woes;<br/>
For thou art weak to sing such tumults dire:<br/>
A solitary sorrow best befits<br/>
Thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.<br/>
Leave them, O Muse! for thou anon wilt find<br/>
Many a fallen old Divinity<br/>
Wandering in vain about bewildered shores.<br/>
Meantime touch piously the Delphic harp,<br/>
And not a wind of heaven but will breathe<br/>
In aid soft warble from the Dorian flute;<br/>
For lo! 'tis for the Father of all verse.<br/>
Flush every thing that hath a vermeil hue,<br/>
Let the rose glow intense and warm the air,<br/>
And let the clouds of even and of morn<br/>
Float in voluptuous fleeces o'er the hills;<br/>
Let the red wine within the goblet boil,<br/>
Cold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp'd shells,<br/>
On sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn<br/>
Through all their labyrinths; and let the maid<br/>
Blush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris'd.<br/>
Chief isle of the embowered Cyclades,<br/>
Rejoice, O Delos, with thine olives green,<br/>
And poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech,<br/>
In which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song,<br/>
And hazels thick, dark-stemm'd beneath the shade:<br/>
Apollo is once more the golden theme!<br/>
Where was he, when the Giant of the Sun<br/>
Stood bright, amid the sorrow of his peers?<br/>
Together had he left his mother fair<br/>
And his twin-sister sleeping in their bower,<br/>
And in the morning twilight wandered forth<br/>
Beside the osiers of a rivulet,<br/>
Full ankle-deep in lilies of the vale.<br/>
The nightingale had ceas'd, and a few stars<br/>
Were lingering in the heavens, while the thrush<br/>
Began calm-throated. Throughout all the isle<br/>
There was no covert, no retired cave<br/>
Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves,<br/>
Though scarcely heard in many a green recess.<br/>
He listen'd, and he wept, and his bright tears<br/>
Went trickling down the golden bow he held.<br/>
Thus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood,<br/>
While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by<br/>
With solemn step an awful Goddess came,<br/>
And there was purport in her looks for him,<br/>
Which he with eager guess began to read<br/>
Perplex'd, the while melodiously he said:<br/>
"How cam'st thou over the unfooted sea?<br/>
Or hath that antique mien and robed form<br/>
Mov'd in these vales invisible till now?<br/>
Sure I have heard those vestments sweeping o'er<br/>
The fallen leaves, when I have sat alone<br/>
In cool mid-forest. Surely I have traced<br/>
The rustle of those ample skirts about<br/>
These grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers<br/>
Lift up their heads, as still the whisper pass'd.<br/>
Goddess! I have beheld those eyes before,<br/>
And their eternal calm, and all that face,<br/>
Or I have dream'd."&mdash;"Yes," said the supreme shape,<br/>
"Thou hast dream'd of me; and awaking up<br/>
Didst find a lyre all golden by thy side,<br/>
Whose strings touch'd by thy fingers, all the vast<br/>
Unwearied ear of the whole universe<br/>
Listen'd in pain and pleasure at the birth<br/>
Of such new tuneful wonder. Is't not strange<br/>
That thou shouldst weep, so gifted? Tell me, youth,<br/>
What sorrow thou canst feel; for I am sad<br/>
When thou dost shed a tear: explain thy griefs<br/>
To one who in this lonely isle hath been<br/>
The watcher of thy sleep and hours of life,<br/>
From the young day when first thy infant hand<br/>
Pluck'd witless the weak flowers, till thine arm<br/>
Could bend that bow heroic to all times.<br/>
Show thy heart's secret to an ancient Power<br/>
Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones<br/>
For prophecies of thee, and for the sake<br/>
Of loveliness new born."&mdash;Apollo then,<br/>
With sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes,<br/>
Thus answer'd, while his white melodious throat<br/>
Throbb'd with the syllables.&mdash;"Mnemosyne!<br/>
Thy name is on my tongue, I know not how;<br/>
Why should I tell thee what thou so well seest?<br/>
Why should I strive to show what from thy lips<br/>
Would come no mystery? For me, dark, dark,<br/>
And painful vile oblivion seals my eyes:<br/>
I strive to search wherefore I am so sad,<br/>
Until a melancholy numbs my limbs;<br/>
And then upon the grass I sit, and moan,<br/>
Like one who once had wings.&mdash;O why should I<br/>
Feel curs'd and thwarted, when the liegeless air<br/>
Yields to my step aspirant? why should I<br/>
Spurn the green turf as hateful to my feet?<br/>
Goddess benign, point forth some unknown thing:<br/>
Are there not other regions than this isle?<br/>
What are the stars? There is the sun, the sun!<br/>
And the most patient brilliance of the moon!<br/>
And stars by thousands! Point me out the way<br/>
To any one particular beauteous star,<br/>
And I will flit into it with my lyre,<br/>
And make its silvery splendour pant with bliss.<br/>
I have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?<br/>
Whose hand, whose essence, what divinity<br/>
Makes this alarum in the elements,<br/>
While I here idle listen on the shores<br/>
In fearless yet in aching ignorance?<br/>
O tell me, lonely Goddess, by thy harp,<br/>
That waileth every morn and eventide,<br/>
Tell me why thus I rave, about these groves!<br/>
Mute thou remainest&mdash;Mute! yet I can read<br/>
A wondrous lesson in thy silent face:<br/>
Knowledge enormous makes a God of me.<br/>
Names, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions,<br/>
Majesties, sovran voices, agonies,<br/>
Creations and destroyings, all at once<br/>
Pour into the wide hollows of my brain,<br/>
And deify me, as if some blithe wine<br/>
Or bright elixir peerless I had drunk,<br/>
And so become immortal."&mdash;Thus the God,<br/>
While his enkindled eyes, with level glance<br/>
Beneath his white soft temples, stedfast kept<br/>
Trembling with light upon Mnemosyne.<br/>
Soon wild commotions shook him, and made flush<br/>
All the immortal fairness of his limbs;<br/>
Most like the struggle at the gate of death;<br/>
Or liker still to one who should take leave<br/>
Of pale immortal death, and with a pang<br/>
As hot as death's is chill, with fierce convulse<br/>
Die into life: so young Apollo anguish'd:<br/>
His very hair, his golden tresses famed<br/>
Kept undulation round his eager neck.<br/>
During the pain Mnemosyne upheld<br/>
Her arms as one who prophesied.&mdash;At length<br/>
Apollo shriek'd;&mdash;and lo! from all his limbs<br/>

<h1>To Autumn</h1>
<h2>by John Keats (1820)</h2>
<p>
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;<br/>
Conspiring with him how to load and bless<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;<br/>
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,<br/>
And still more, later flowers for the bees,<br/>
Until they think warm days will never cease,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.
</p>
<p>
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find<br/>
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;<br/>
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:<br/>
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Steady thy laden head across a brook;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.
</p>
<p>
Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,&mdash;<br/>
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;<br/>
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the river sallows, borne aloft<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;<br/>
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

<h1>Hyperion</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<h2>Book I</h2>
<p>
Deep in the shady sadness of a vale<br/>
Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,<br/>
Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,<br/>
Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,<br/>
Still as the silence round about his lair;<br/>
Forest on forest hung about his head<br/>
Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,<br/>
Not so much life as on a summer's day<br/>
Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,<br/>
But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.<br/>
A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more<br/>
By reason of his fallen divinity<br/>
Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds<br/>
Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,<br/>
No further than to where his feet had stray'd,<br/>
And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground<br/>
His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,<br/>
Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;<br/>
While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth,<br/>
His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;<br/>
But there came one, who with a kindred hand<br/>
Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low<br/>
With reverence, though to one who knew it not.<br/>
She was a Goddess of the infant world;<br/>
By her in stature the tall Amazon<br/>
Had stood a pigmy's height: she would have ta'en<br/>
Achilles by the hair and bent his neck;<br/>
Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel.<br/>
Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,<br/>
Pedestal'd haply in a palace court,<br/>
When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore.<br/>
But oh! how unlike marble was that face:<br/>
How beautiful, if sorrow had not made<br/>
Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self.<br/>
There was a listening fear in her regard,<br/>
As if calamity had but begun;<br/>
As if the vanward clouds of evil days<br/>
Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear<br/>
Was with its stored thunder labouring up.<br/>
One hand she press'd upon that aching spot<br/>
Where beats the human heart, as if just there,<br/>
Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain:<br/>
The other upon Saturn's bended neck<br/>
She laid, and to the level of his ear<br/>
Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake<br/>
In solemn tenour and deep organ tone:<br/>
Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue<br/>
Would come in these like accents; O how frail<br/>
To that large utterance of the early Gods!<br/>
"Saturn, look up!&mdash;though wherefore, poor old King?<br/>
I have no comfort for thee, no not one:<br/>
I cannot say, 'O wherefore sleepest thou?'<br/>
For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth<br/>
Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God;<br/>
And ocean too, with all its solemn noise,<br/>
Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air<br/>
Is emptied of thine hoary majesty.<br/>
Thy thunder, conscious of the new command,<br/>
Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;<br/>
And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands<br/>
Scorches and burns our once serene domain.<br/>
O aching time! O moments big as years!<br/>
All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,<br/>
And press it so upon our weary griefs<br/>
That unbelief has not a space to breathe.<br/>
Saturn, sleep on:&mdash;O thoughtless, why did I<br/>
Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?<br/>
Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?<br/>
Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep."<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As when, upon a tranced summer-night,<br/>
Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,<br/>
Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,<br/>
Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,<br/>
Save from one gradual solitary gust<br/>
Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,<br/>
As if the ebbing air had but one wave;<br/>
So came these words and went; the while in tears<br/>
She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,<br/>
Just where her falling hair might be outspread<br/>
A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.<br/>
One moon, with alteration slow, had shed<br/>
Her silver seasons four upon the night,<br/>
And still these two were postured motionless,<br/>
Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;<br/>
The frozen God still couchant on the earth,<br/>
And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:<br/>
Until at length old Saturn lifted up<br/>
His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,<br/>
And all the gloom and sorrow of the place,<br/>
And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake,<br/>
As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard<br/>
Shook horrid with such aspen-malady:<br/>
"O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,<br/>
Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;<br/>
Look up, and let me see our doom in it;<br/>
Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape<br/>
Is Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice<br/>
Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,<br/>
Naked and bare of its great diadem,<br/>
Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power<br/>
To make me desolate? whence came the strength?<br/>
How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,<br/>
While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?<br/>
But it is so; and I am smother'd up,<br/>
And buried from all godlike exercise<br/>
Of influence benign on planets pale,<br/>
Of admonitions to the winds and seas,<br/>
Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting,<br/>
And all those acts which Deity supreme<br/>
Doth ease its heart of love in.&mdash;I am gone<br/>
Away from my own bosom: I have left<br/>
My strong identity, my real self,<br/>
Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit<br/>
Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!<br/>
Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round<br/>
Upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light;<br/>
Space region'd with life-air; and barren void;<br/>
Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.&mdash;<br/>
Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest<br/>
A certain shape or shadow, making way<br/>
With wings or chariot fierce to repossess<br/>
A heaven he lost erewhile: it must&mdash;it must<br/>
Be of ripe progress&mdash;Saturn must be King.<br/>
Yes, there must be a golden victory;<br/>
There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown<br/>
Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival<br/>
Upon the gold clouds metropolitan,<br/>
Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir<br/>
Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be<br/>
Beautiful things made new, for the surprise<br/>
Of the sky-children; I will give command:<br/>
Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This passion lifted him upon his feet,<br/>
And made his hands to struggle in the air,<br/>
His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,<br/>
His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.<br/>
He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep;<br/>
A little time, and then again he snatch'd<br/>
Utterance thus.&mdash;"But cannot I create?<br/>
Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth<br/>
Another world, another universe,<br/>
To overbear and crumble this to nought?<br/>
Where is another chaos? Where?"&mdash;That word<br/>
Found way unto Olympus, and made quake<br/>
The rebel three.&mdash;Thea was startled up,<br/>
And in her bearing was a sort of hope,<br/>
As thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,<br/>
O Saturn! come away, and give them heart;<br/>
I know the covert, for thence came I hither."<br/>
Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went<br/>
With backward footing through the shade a space:<br/>
He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way<br/>
Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist<br/>
Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,<br/>
More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,<br/>
Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:<br/>
The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,<br/>
Groan'd for the old allegiance once more,<br/>
And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.<br/>
But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept<br/>
His sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;&mdash;<br/>
Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire<br/>
Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up<br/>
From man to the sun's God; yet unsecure:<br/>
For as among us mortals omens drear<br/>
Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he&mdash;<br/>
Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,<br/>
Or the familiar visiting of one<br/>
Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,<br/>
Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;<br/>
But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,<br/>
Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright<br/>
Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,<br/>
And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,<br/>
Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,<br/>
Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;<br/>
And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds<br/>
Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's wings,<br/>
Unseen before by Gods or wondering men,<br/>
Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard,<br/>
Not heard before by Gods or wondering men.<br/>
Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths<br/>
Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,<br/>
Instead of sweets, his ample palate took<br/>
Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick:<br/>
And so, when harbour'd in the sleepy west,<br/>
After the full completion of fair day,&mdash;<br/>
For rest divine upon exalted couch<br/>
And slumber in the arms of melody,<br/>
He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease<br/>
With stride colossal, on from hall to hall;<br/>
While far within each aisle and deep recess,<br/>
His winged minions in close clusters stood,<br/>
Amaz'd and full of fear; like anxious men<br/>
Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,<br/>
When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.<br/>
Even now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,<br/>
Went step for step with Thea through the woods,<br/>
Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,<br/>
Came slope upon the threshold of the west;<br/>
Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope<br/>
In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,<br/>
Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet<br/>
And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;<br/>
And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,<br/>
In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,<br/>
That inlet to severe magnificence<br/>
Stood full blown, for the God to enter in.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;<br/>
His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,<br/>
And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,<br/>
That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours<br/>
And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared,<br/>
From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,<br/>
Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,<br/>
And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,<br/>
Until he reach'd the great main cupola;<br/>
There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,<br/>
And from the basements deep to the high towers<br/>
Jarr'd his own golden region; and before<br/>
The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,<br/>
His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,<br/>
To this result: "O dreams of day and night!<br/>
O monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!<br/>
O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!<br/>
O lank-eared Phantoms of black-weeded pools!<br/>
Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why<br/>
Is my eternal essence thus distraught<br/>
To see and to behold these horrors new?<br/>
Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall?<br/>
Am I to leave this haven of my rest,<br/>
This cradle of my glory, this soft clime,<br/>
This calm luxuriance of blissful light,<br/>
These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,<br/>
Of all my lucent empire? It is left<br/>
Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.<br/>
The blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,<br/>
I cannot see&mdash;but darkness, death and darkness.<br/>
Even here, into my centre of repose,<br/>
The shady visions come to domineer,<br/>
Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.&mdash;<br/>
Fall!&mdash;No, by Tellus and her briny robes!<br/>
Over the fiery frontier of my realms<br/>
I will advance a terrible right arm<br/>
Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,<br/>
And bid old Saturn take his throne again."&mdash;<br/>
He spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat<br/>
Held struggle with his throat but came not forth;<br/>
For as in theatres of crowded men<br/>
Hubbub increases more they call out "Hush!"<br/>
So at Hyperion's words the Phantoms pale<br/>
Bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold;<br/>
And from the mirror'd level where he stood<br/>
A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.<br/>
At this, through all his bulk an agony<br/>
Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,<br/>
Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular<br/>
Making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd<br/>
From over-strained might. Releas'd, he fled<br/>
To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours<br/>
Before the dawn in season due should blush,<br/>
He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals,<br/>
Clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide<br/>
Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.<br/>
The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode<br/>
Each day from east to west the heavens through,<br/>
Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds;<br/>
Not therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,<br/>
But ever and anon the glancing spheres,<br/>
Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,<br/>
Glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark<br/>
Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep<br/>
Up to the zenith,&mdash;hieroglyphics old,<br/>
Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers<br/>
Then living on the earth, with labouring thought<br/>
Won from the gaze of many centuries:<br/>
Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge<br/>
Of stone, or marble swart; their import gone,<br/>
Their wisdom long since fled.&mdash;Two wings this orb<br/>
Possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings,<br/>
Ever exalted at the God's approach:<br/>
And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense<br/>
Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;<br/>
While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse,<br/>
Awaiting for Hyperion's command.<br/>
Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne<br/>
And bid the day begin, if but for change.<br/>
He might not:&mdash;No, though a primeval God:<br/>
The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd.<br/>
Therefore the operations of the dawn<br/>
Stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told.<br/>
Those silver wings expanded sisterly,<br/>
Eager to sail their orb; the porches wide<br/>
Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night<br/>
And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,<br/>
Unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent<br/>
His spirit to the sorrow of the time;<br/>
And all along a dismal rack of clouds,<br/>
Upon the boundaries of day and night,<br/>
He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.<br/>
There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars<br/>
Look'd down on him with pity, and the voice<br/>
Of Cœlus, from the universal space,<br/>
Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear.<br/>
"O brightest of my children dear, earth-born<br/>
And sky-engendered, Son of Mysteries<br/>
All unrevealed even to the powers<br/>
Which met at thy creating; at whose joys<br/>
And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,<br/>
I, Cœlus, wonder, how they came and whence;<br/>
And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,<br/>
Distinct, and visible; symbols divine,<br/>
Manifestations of that beauteous life<br/>
Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space:<br/>
Of these new-form'd art thou, oh brightest child!<br/>
Of these, thy brethren and the Goddesses!<br/>
There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion<br/>
Of son against his sire. I saw him fall,<br/>
I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!<br/>
To me his arms were spread, to me his voice<br/>
Found way from forth the thunders round his head!<br/>
Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.<br/>
Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:<br/>
For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods.<br/>
Divine ye were created, and divine<br/>
In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd,<br/>
Unruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and ruled:<br/>
Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;<br/>
Actions of rage and passion; even as<br/>
I see them, on the mortal world beneath,<br/>
In men who die.&mdash;This is the grief, O Son!<br/>
Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!<br/>
Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,<br/>
As thou canst move about, an evident God;<br/>
And canst oppose to each malignant hour<br/>
Ethereal presence:&mdash;I am but a voice;<br/>
My life is but the life of winds and tides,<br/>
No more than winds and tides can I avail:&mdash;<br/>
But thou canst.&mdash;Be thou therefore in the van<br/>
Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb<br/>
Before the tense string murmur.&mdash;To the earth!<br/>
For there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes.<br/>
Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,<br/>
And of thy seasons be a careful nurse."&mdash;<br/>
Ere half this region-whisper had come down,<br/>
Hyperion arose, and on the stars<br/>
Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide<br/>
Until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide:<br/>
And still they were the same bright, patient stars.<br/>
Then with a slow incline of his broad breast,<br/>
Like to a diver in the pearly seas,<br/>
Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore,<br/>
And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night.<br/>

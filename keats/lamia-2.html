<h1>Lamia</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<h2>Part II</h2>
<p>
Love in a hut, with water and a crust,<br/>
Is&mdash;Love, forgive us!&mdash;cinders, ashes, dust;<br/>
Love in a palace is perhaps at last<br/>
More grievous torment than a hermit's fast&mdash;<br/>
That is a doubtful tale from faery land,<br/>
Hard for the non-elect to understand.<br/>
Had Lycius liv'd to hand his story down,<br/>
He might have given the moral a fresh frown,<br/>
Or clench'd it quite: but too short was their bliss<br/>
To breed distrust and hate, that make the soft voice hiss.<br/>
Besides, there, nightly, with terrific glare,<br/>
Love, jealous grown of so complete a pair,<br/>
Hover'd and buzz'd his wings, with fearful roar,<br/>
Above the lintel of their chamber door,<br/>
And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For all this came a ruin: side by side<br/>
They were enthroned, in the even tide,<br/>
Upon a couch, near to a curtaining<br/>
Whose airy texture, from a golden string,<br/>
Floated into the room, and let appear<br/>
Unveil'd the summer heaven, blue and clear,<br/>
Betwixt two marble shafts:&mdash;there they reposed,<br/>
Where use had made it sweet, with eyelids closed,<br/>
Saving a tythe which love still open kept,<br/>
That they might see each other while they almost slept;<br/>
When from the slope side of a suburb hill,<br/>
Deafening the swallow's twitter, came a thrill<br/>
Of trumpets&mdash;Lycius started&mdash;the sounds fled,<br/>
But left a thought, a buzzing in his head.<br/>
For the first time, since first he harbour'd in<br/>
That purple-lined palace of sweet sin,<br/>
His spirit pass'd beyond its golden bourn<br/>
Into the noisy world almost forsworn.<br/>
The lady, ever watchful, penetrant,<br/>
Saw this with pain, so arguing a want<br/>
Of something more, more than her empery<br/>
Of joys; and she began to moan and sigh<br/>
Because he mused beyond her, knowing well<br/>
That but a moment's thought is passion's passing bell.<br/>
"Why do you sigh, fair creature?" whisper'd he:<br/>
"Why do you think?" return'd she tenderly:<br/>
"You have deserted me&mdash;where am I now?<br/>
Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow:<br/>
No, no, you have dismiss'd me; and I go<br/>
From your breast houseless: ay, it must be so."<br/>
He answer'd, bending to her open eyes,<br/>
Where he was mirror'd small in paradise,<br/>
My silver planet, both of eve and morn!<br/>
Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn,<br/>
While I am striving how to fill my heart<br/>
With deeper crimson, and a double smart?<br/>
How to entangle, trammel up and snare<br/>
Your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there<br/>
Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose?<br/>
Ay, a sweet kiss&mdash;you see your mighty woes.<br/>
My thoughts! shall I unveil them? Listen then!<br/>
What mortal hath a prize, that other men<br/>
May be confounded and abash'd withal,<br/>
But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical,<br/>
And triumph, as in thee I should rejoice<br/>
Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth's voice.<br/>
"Let my foes choke, and my friends shout afar,<br/>
While through the thronged streets your bridal car<br/>
Wheels round its dazzling spokes." The lady's cheek<br/>
Trembled; she nothing said, but, pale and meek,<br/>
Arose and knelt before him, wept a rain<br/>
Of sorrows at his words; at last with pain<br/>
Beseeching him, the while his hand she wrung,<br/>
To change his purpose. He thereat was stung,<br/>
Perverse, with stronger fancy to reclaim<br/>
Her wild and timid nature to his aim:<br/>
Besides, for all his love, in self despite,<br/>
Against his better self, he took delight<br/>
Luxurious in her sorrows, soft and new.<br/>
His passion, cruel grown, took on a hue<br/>
Fierce and sanguineous as 'twas possible<br/>
In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell.<br/>
Fine was the mitigated fury, like<br/>
Apollo's presence when in act to strike<br/>
The serpent&mdash;Ha, the serpent! certes, she<br/>
Was none. She burnt, she lov'd the tyranny,<br/>
And, all subdued, consented to the hour<br/>
When to the bridal he should lead his paramour.<br/>
Whispering in midnight silence, said the youth,<br/>
"Sure some sweet name thou hast, though, by my truth,<br/>
I have not ask'd it, ever thinking thee<br/>
Not mortal, but of heavenly progeny,<br/>
As still I do. Hast any mortal name,<br/>
Fit appellation for this dazzling frame?<br/>
Or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth,<br/>
To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth?"<br/>
"I have no friends," said Lamia," no, not one;<br/>
My presence in wide Corinth hardly known:<br/>
My parents' bones are in their dusty urns<br/>
Sepulchred, where no kindled incense burns,<br/>
Seeing all their luckless race are dead, save me,<br/>
And I neglect the holy rite for thee.<br/>
Even as you list invite your many guests;<br/>
But if, as now it seems, your vision rests<br/>
With any pleasure on me, do not bid<br/>
Old Apollonius&mdash;from him keep me hid."<br/>
Lycius, perplex'd at words so blind and blank,<br/>
Made close inquiry; from whose touch she shrank,<br/>
Feigning a sleep; and he to the dull shade<br/>
Of deep sleep in a moment was betray'd<br/>
</p>
<p>
It was the custom then to bring away<br/>
The bride from home at blushing shut of day,<br/>
Veil'd, in a chariot, heralded along<br/>
By strewn flowers, torches, and a marriage song,<br/>
With other pageants: but this fair unknown<br/>
Had not a friend. So being left alone,<br/>
(Lycius was gone to summon all his kin)<br/>
And knowing surely she could never win<br/>
His foolish heart from its mad pompousness,<br/>
She set herself, high-thoughted, how to dress<br/>
The misery in fit magnificence.<br/>
She did so, but 'tis doubtful how and whence<br/>
Came, and who were her subtle servitors.<br/>
About the halls, and to and from the doors,<br/>
There was a noise of wings, till in short space<br/>
The glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace.<br/>
A haunting music, sole perhaps and lone<br/>
Supportress of the faery-roof, made moan<br/>
Throughout, as fearful the whole charm might fade.<br/>
Fresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade<br/>
Of palm and plantain, met from either side,<br/>
High in the midst, in honour of the bride:<br/>
Two palms and then two plantains, and so on,<br/>
From either side their stems branch'd one to one<br/>
All down the aisled place; and beneath all<br/>
There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall.<br/>
So canopied, lay an untasted feast<br/>
Teeming with odours. Lamia, regal drest,<br/>
Silently paced about, and as she went,<br/>
In pale contented sort of discontent,<br/>
Mission'd her viewless servants to enrich<br/>
The fretted splendour of each nook and niche.<br/>
Between the tree-stems, marbled plain at first,<br/>
Came jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst<br/>
Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees,<br/>
And with the larger wove in small intricacies.<br/>
Approving all, she faded at self-will,<br/>
And shut the chamber up, close, hush'd and still,<br/>
Complete and ready for the revels rude,<br/>
When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The day appear'd, and all the gossip rout.<br/>
O senseless Lycius! Madman! wherefore flout<br/>
The silent-blessing fate, warm cloister'd hours,<br/>
And show to common eyes these secret bowers?<br/>
The herd approach'd; each guest, with busy brain,<br/>
Arriving at the portal, gaz'd amain,<br/>
And enter'd marveling: for they knew the street,<br/>
Remember'd it from childhood all complete<br/>
Without a gap, yet ne'er before had seen<br/>
That royal porch, that high-built fair demesne;<br/>
So in they hurried all, maz'd, curious and keen:<br/>
Save one, who look'd thereon with eye severe,<br/>
And with calm-planted steps walk'd in austere;<br/>
'Twas Apollonius: something too he laugh'd,<br/>
As though some knotty problem, that had daft<br/>
His patient thought, had now begun to thaw,<br/>
And solve and melt&mdash;'twas just as he foresaw.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He met within the murmurous vestibule<br/>
His young disciple. "'Tis no common rule,<br/>
Lycius," said he, "for uninvited guest<br/>
To force himself upon you, and infest<br/>
With an unbidden presence the bright throng<br/>
Of younger friends; yet must I do this wrong,<br/>
And you forgive me." Lycius blush'd, and led<br/>
The old man through the inner doors broad-spread;<br/>
With reconciling words and courteous mien<br/>
Turning into sweet milk the sophist's spleen.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of wealthy lustre was the banquet-room,<br/>
Fill'd with pervading brilliance and perfume:<br/>
Before each lucid pannel fuming stood<br/>
A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood,<br/>
Each by a sacred tripod held aloft,<br/>
Whose slender feet wide-swerv'd upon the soft<br/>
Wool-woofed carpets: fifty wreaths of smoke<br/>
From fifty censers their light voyage took<br/>
To the high roof, still mimick'd as they rose<br/>
Along the mirror'd walls by twin-clouds odorous.<br/>
Twelve sphered tables, by silk seats insphered,<br/>
High as the level of a man's breast rear'd<br/>
On libbard's paws, upheld the heavy gold<br/>
Of cups and goblets, and the store thrice told<br/>
Of Ceres' horn, and, in huge vessels, wine<br/>
Come from the gloomy tun with merry shine.<br/>
Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood,<br/>
Each shrining in the midst the image of a God.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When in an antichamber every guest<br/>
Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press'd,<br/>
By minist'ring slaves, upon his hands and feet,<br/>
And fragrant oils with ceremony meet<br/>
Pour'd on his hair, they all mov'd to the feast<br/>
In white robes, and themselves in order placed<br/>
Around the silken couches, wondering<br/>
Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Soft went the music the soft air along,<br/>
While fluent Greek a vowel'd undersong<br/>
Kept up among the guests discoursing low<br/>
At first, for scarcely was the wine at flow;<br/>
But when the happy vintage touch'd their brains,<br/>
Louder they talk, and louder come the strains<br/>
Of powerful instruments&mdash;the gorgeous dyes,<br/>
The space, the splendour of the draperies,<br/>
The roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer,<br/>
Beautiful slaves, and Lamia's self, appear,<br/>
Now, when the wine has done its rosy deed,<br/>
And every soul from human trammels freed,<br/>
No more so strange; for merry wine, sweet wine,<br/>
Will make Elysian shades not too fair, too divine.<br/>
Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height;<br/>
Flush'd were their cheeks, and bright eyes double bright:<br/>
Garlands of every green, and every scent<br/>
From vales deflower'd, or forest-trees branch rent,<br/>
In baskets of bright osier'd gold were brought<br/>
High as the handles heap'd, to suit the thought<br/>
Of every guest; that each, as he did please,<br/>
Might fancy-fit his brows, silk-pillow'd at his ease.<br/>
</p>
<p>
What wreath for Lamia? What for Lycius?<br/>
What for the sage, old Apollonius?<br/>
Upon her aching forehead be there hung<br/>
The leaves of willow and of adder's tongue;<br/>
And for the youth, quick, let us strip for him<br/>
The thyrsus, that his watching eyes may swim<br/>
Into forgetfulness; and, for the sage,<br/>
Let spear-grass and the spiteful thistle wage<br/>
War on his temples. Do not all charms fly<br/>
At the mere touch of cold philosophy?<br/>
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:<br/>
We know her woof, her texture; she is given<br/>
In the dull catalogue of common things.<br/>
Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings,<br/>
Conquer all mysteries by rule and line,<br/>
Empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine&mdash;<br/>
Unweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made<br/>
The tender-person'd Lamia melt into a shade.<br/>
</p>
<p>
By her glad Lycius sitting, in chief place,<br/>
Scarce saw in all the room another face,<br/>
Till, checking his love trance, a cup he took<br/>
Full brimm'd, and opposite sent forth a look<br/>
'Cross the broad table, to beseech a glance<br/>
From his old teacher's wrinkled countenance,<br/>
And pledge him. The bald-head philosopher<br/>
Had fix'd his eye, without a twinkle or stir<br/>
Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride,<br/>
Brow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet pride.<br/>
Lycius then press'd her hand, with devout touch,<br/>
As pale it lay upon the rosy couch:<br/>
'Twas icy, and the cold ran through his veins;<br/>
Then sudden it grew hot, and all the pains<br/>
Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart.<br/>
"Lamia, what means this? Wherefore dost thou start?<br/>
Know'st thou that man?" Poor Lamia answer'd not.<br/>
He gaz'd into her eyes, and not a jot<br/>
Own'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal:<br/>
More, more he gaz'd: his human senses reel:<br/>
Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs;<br/>
There was no recognition in those orbs.<br/>
"Lamia!" he cried&mdash;and no soft-toned reply.<br/>
The many heard, and the loud revelry<br/>
Grew hush; the stately music no more breathes;<br/>
The myrtle sicken'd in a thousand wreaths.<br/>
By faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased;<br/>
A deadly silence step by step increased,<br/>
Until it seem'd a horrid presence there,<br/>
And not a man but felt the terror in his hair.<br/>
"Lamia!" he shriek'd; and nothing but the shriek<br/>
With its sad echo did the silence break.<br/>
"Begone, foul dream!" he cried, gazing again<br/>
In the bride's face, where now no azure vein<br/>
Wander'd on fair-spaced temples; no soft bloom<br/>
Misted the cheek; no passion to illume<br/>
The deep-recessed vision&mdash;all was blight;<br/>
Lamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white.<br/>
"Shut, shut those juggling eyes, thou ruthless man!<br/>
Turn them aside, wretch! or the righteous ban<br/>
Of all the Gods, whose dreadful images<br/>
Here represent their shadowy presences,<br/>
May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn<br/>
Of painful blindness; leaving thee forlorn,<br/>
In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright<br/>
Of conscience, for their long offended might,<br/>
For all thine impious proud-heart sophistries,<br/>
Unlawful magic, and enticing lies.<br/>
Corinthians! look upon that gray-beard wretch!<br/>
Mark how, possess'd, his lashless eyelids stretch<br/>
Around his demon eyes! Corinthians, see!<br/>
My sweet bride withers at their potency."<br/>
"Fool!" said the sophist, in an under-tone<br/>
Gruff with contempt; which a death-nighing moan<br/>
From Lycius answer'd, as heart-struck and lost,<br/>
He sank supine beside the aching ghost.<br/>
"Fool! Fool!" repeated he, while his eyes still<br/>
Relented not, nor mov'd; "from every ill<br/>
Of life have I preserv'd thee to this day,<br/>
And shall I see thee made a serpent's prey?"<br/>
Then Lamia breath'd death breath; the sophist's eye,<br/>
Like a sharp spear, went through her utterly,<br/>
Keen, cruel, perceant, stinging: she, as well<br/>
As her weak hand could any meaning tell,<br/>
Motion'd him to be silent; vainly so,<br/>
He look'd and look'd again a level&mdash;No!<br/>
"A Serpent!" echoed he; no sooner said,<br/>
Than with a frightful scream she vanished:<br/>
And Lycius' arms were empty of delight,<br/>
As were his limbs of life, from that same night.<br/>
On the high couch he lay!&mdash;his friends came round<br/>
Supported him&mdash;no pulse, or breath they found,<br/>
And, in its marriage robe, the heavy body wound.<br/>

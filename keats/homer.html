<h1>On First Looking into Chapman's Homer</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<p>
Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,<br/>
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;<br/>
Round many western islands have I been<br/>
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.<br/>
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told<br/>
That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;<br/>
Yet did I never breathe its pure serene<br/>
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:<br/>
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies<br/>
When a new planet swims into his ken;<br/>
Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes<br/>
He star'd at the Pacific&mdash;and all his men<br/>
Look'd at each other with a wild surmise&mdash;<br/>
Silent, upon a peak in Darien.

<h1>On the Grasshopper and Cricket</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<p>
The Poetry of earth is never dead:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run<br/>
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;<br/>
That is the Grasshopper's&mdash;he takes the lead<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In summer luxury,&mdash;he has never done<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his delights; for when tired out with fun<br/>
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.<br/>
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On a lone winter evening, when the frost<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills<br/>
The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.

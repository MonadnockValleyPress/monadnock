<h1>Ode ("Bards of Passion and of Mirth")</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<p>
Bards of Passion and of Mirth,<br/>
Ye have left your souls on earth!<br/>
Have ye souls in heaven too,<br/>
Doubled-lived in regions new?<br/>
Yes, and those of heaven commune<br/>
With the spheres of sun and moon;<br/>
With the noise of fountains wondrous,<br/>
And the parle of voices thund'rous;<br/>
With the whisper of heaven's trees<br/>
And one another, in soft ease<br/>
Seated on Elysian lawns<br/>
Browsed by none but Dian's fawns;<br/>
Underneath large blue-bells tented,<br/>
Where the daisies are rose-scented,<br/>
And the rose herself has got<br/>
Perfume which on earth is not;<br/>
Where the nightingale doth sing<br/>
Not a senseless, tranced thing,<br/>
But divine melodious truth;<br/>
Philosophic numbers smooth;<br/>
Tales and golden histories<br/>
Of heaven and its mysteries.
</p>
<p>
Thus ye live on high, and then<br/>
On the earth ye live again;<br/>
And the souls ye left behind you<br/>
Teach us, here, the way to find you,<br/>
Where your other souls are joying,<br/>
Never slumber'd, never cloying.<br/>
Here, your earth-born souls still speak<br/>
To mortals, of their little week;<br/>
Of their sorrows and delights;<br/>
Of their passions and their spites;<br/>
Of their glory and their shame;<br/>
What doth strengthen and what maim.<br/>
Thus ye teach us, every day,<br/>
Wisdom, though fled far away.
</p>
<p>
Bards of Passion and of Mirth,<br/>
Ye have left your souls on earth!<br/>
Ye have souls in heaven too,<br/>
Double-lived in regions new!

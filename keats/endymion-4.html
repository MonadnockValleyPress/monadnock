<h1>Endymion</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<h2>Book IV</h2>
<p>
Muse of my native land! loftiest Muse!<br/>
O first-born on the mountains! by the hues<br/>
Of heaven on the spiritual air begot:<br/>
Long didst thou sit alone in northern grot,<br/>
While yet our England was a wolfish den;<br/>
Before our forests heard the talk of men;<br/>
Before the first of Druids was a child;&mdash;<br/>
Long didst thou sit amid our regions wild<br/>
Rapt in a deep prophetic solitude.<br/>
There came an eastern voice of solemn mood:&mdash;<br/>
Yet wast thou patient. Then sang forth the Nine,<br/>
Apollo's garland:&mdash;yet didst thou divine<br/>
Such home-bred glory, that they cry'd in vain,<br/>
"Come hither, Sister of the Island!" Plain<br/>
Spake fair Ausonia; and once more she spake<br/>
A higher summons:&mdash;still didst thou betake<br/>
Thee to thy native hopes. O thou hast won<br/>
A full accomplishment! The thing is done,<br/>
Which undone, these our latter days had risen<br/>
On barren souls. Great Muse, thou know'st what prison,<br/>
Of flesh and bone, curbs, and confines, and frets<br/>
Our spirit's wings: despondency besets<br/>
Our pillows; and the fresh to-morrow morn<br/>
Seems to give forth its light in very scorn<br/>
Of our dull, uninspired, snail-paced lives.<br/>
Long have I said, how happy he who shrives<br/>
To thee! But then I thought on poets gone,<br/>
And could not pray:&mdash;nor can I now&mdash;so on<br/>
I move to the end in lowliness of heart.&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ah, woe is me! that I should fondly part<br/>
From my dear native land! Ah, foolish maid!<br/>
Glad was the hour, when, with thee, myriads bade<br/>
Adieu to Ganges and their pleasant fields!<br/>
To one so friendless the clear freshet yields<br/>
A bitter coolness; the ripe grape is sour:<br/>
Yet I would have, great gods! but one short hour<br/>
Of native air&mdash;let me but die at home."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Endymion to heaven's airy dome<br/>
Was offering up a hecatomb of vows,<br/>
When these words reach'd him. Whereupon he bows<br/>
His head through thorny-green entanglement<br/>
Of underwood, and to the sound is bent,<br/>
Anxious as hind towards her hidden fawn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Is no one near to help me? No fair dawn<br/>
Of life from charitable voice? No sweet saying<br/>
To set my dull and sadden'd spirit playing?<br/>
No hand to toy with mine? No lips so sweet<br/>
That I may worship them? No eyelids meet<br/>
To twinkle on my bosom? No one dies<br/>
Before me, till from these enslaving eyes<br/>
Redemption sparkles!&mdash;I am sad and lost."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thou, Carian lord, hadst better have been tost<br/>
Into a whirlpool. Vanish into air,<br/>
Warm mountaineer! for canst thou only bear<br/>
A woman's sigh alone and in distress?<br/>
See not her charms! Is Phœbe passionless?<br/>
Phœbe is fairer far&mdash;O gaze no more:&mdash;<br/>
Yet if thou wilt behold all beauty's store,<br/>
Behold her panting in the forest grass!<br/>
Do not those curls of glossy jet surpass<br/>
For tenderness the arms so idly lain<br/>
Amongst them? Feelest not a kindred pain,<br/>
To see such lovely eyes in swimming search<br/>
After some warm delight, that seems to perch<br/>
Dovelike in the dim cell lying beyond<br/>
Their upper lids?&mdash;Hist!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O for Hermes' wand,<br/>
To touch this flower into human shape!<br/>
That woodland Hyacinthus could escape<br/>
From his green prison, and here kneeling down<br/>
Call me his queen, his second life's fair crown!<br/>
Ah me, how I could love!&mdash;My soul doth melt<br/>
For the unhappy youth&mdash;Love! I have felt<br/>
So faint a kindness, such a meek surrender<br/>
To what my own full thoughts had made too tender,<br/>
That but for tears my life had fled away!&mdash;<br/>
Ye deaf and senseless minutes of the day,<br/>
And thou, old forest, hold ye this for true,<br/>
There is no lightning, no authentic dew<br/>
But in the eye of love: there's not a sound,<br/>
Melodious howsoever, can confound<br/>
The heavens and earth in one to such a death<br/>
As doth the voice of love: there's not a breath<br/>
Will mingle kindly with the meadow air,<br/>
Till it has panted round, and stolen a share<br/>
Of passion from the heart!"&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a bough<br/>
He leant, wretched. He surely cannot now<br/>
Thirst for another love: O impious,<br/>
That he can even dream upon it thus!&mdash;<br/>
Thought he, "Why am I not as are the dead,<br/>
Since to a woe like this I have been led<br/>
Through the dark earth, and through the wondrous sea?<br/>
Goddess! I love thee not the less: from thee<br/>
By Juno's smile I turn not&mdash;no, no, no&mdash;<br/>
While the great waters are at ebb and flow.&mdash;<br/>
I have a triple soul! O fond pretence&mdash;<br/>
For both, for both my love is so immense,<br/>
I feel my heart is cut in twain for them."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And so he groan'd, as one by beauty slain.<br/>
The lady's heart beat quick, and he could see<br/>
Her gentle bosom heave tumultuously.<br/>
He sprang from his green covert: there she lay,<br/>
Sweet as a muskrose upon new-made hay;<br/>
With all her limbs on tremble, and her eyes<br/>
Shut softly up alive. To speak he tries.<br/>
"Fair damsel, pity me! forgive that I<br/>
Thus violate thy bower's sanctity!<br/>
O pardon me, for I am full of grief&mdash;<br/>
Grief born of thee, young angel! fairest thief!<br/>
Who stolen hast away the wings wherewith<br/>
I was to top the heavens. Dear maid, sith<br/>
Thou art my executioner, and I feel<br/>
Loving and hatred, misery and weal,<br/>
Will in a few short hours be nothing to me,<br/>
And all my story that much passion slew me;<br/>
Do smile upon the evening of my days:<br/>
And, for my tortur'd brain begins to craze,<br/>
Be thou my nurse; and let me understand<br/>
How dying I shall kiss that lily hand.&mdash;<br/>
Dost weep for me? Then should I be content.<br/>
Scowl on, ye fates! until the firmament<br/>
Outblackens Erebus, and the full-cavern'd earth<br/>
Crumbles into itself. By the cloud girth<br/>
Of Jove, those tears have given me a thirst<br/>
To meet oblivion."&mdash;As her heart would burst<br/>
The maiden sobb'd awhile, and then replied:<br/>
"Why must such desolation betide<br/>
As that thou speakest of? Are not these green nooks<br/>
Empty of all misfortune? Do the brooks<br/>
Utter a gorgon voice? Does yonder thrush,<br/>
Schooling its half-fledg'd little ones to brush<br/>
About the dewy forest, whisper tales?&mdash;<br/>
Speak not of grief, young stranger, or cold snails<br/>
Will slime the rose to night. Though if thou wilt,<br/>
Methinks 'twould be a guilt&mdash;a very guilt&mdash;<br/>
Not to companion thee, and sigh away<br/>
The light&mdash;the dusk&mdash;the dark&mdash;till break of day!"<br/>
"Dear lady," said Endymion, "'tis past:<br/>
I love thee! and my days can never last.<br/>
That I may pass in patience still speak:<br/>
Let me have music dying, and I seek<br/>
No more delight&mdash;I bid adieu to all.<br/>
Didst thou not after other climates call,<br/>
And murmur about Indian streams?"&mdash;Then she,<br/>
Sitting beneath the midmost forest tree,<br/>
For pity sang this roundelay—<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O Sorrow,<br/>
Why dost borrow<br/>
The natural hue of health, from vermeil lips?&mdash;<br/>
To give maiden blushes<br/>
To the white rose bushes?<br/>
Or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O Sorrow,<br/>
Why dost borrow<br/>
The lustrous passion from a falcon-eye?&mdash;<br/>
To give the glow-worm light?<br/>
Or, on a moonless night,<br/>
To tinge, on syren shores, the salt sea-spry?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O Sorrow,<br/>
Why dost borrow<br/>
The mellow ditties from a mourning tongue?&mdash;<br/>
To give at evening pale<br/>
Unto the nightingale,<br/>
That thou mayst listen the cold dews among?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O Sorrow,<br/>
Why dost borrow<br/>
Heart's lightness from the merriment of May?&mdash;<br/>
A lover would not tread<br/>
A cowslip on the head,<br/>
Though he should dance from eve till peep of day&mdash;<br/>
Nor any drooping flower<br/>
Held sacred for thy bower,<br/>
Wherever he may sport himself and play.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"To Sorrow,<br/>
I bade good-morrow,<br/>
And thought to leave her far away behind;<br/>
But cheerly, cheerly,<br/>
She loves me dearly;<br/>
She is so constant to me, and so kind:<br/>
I would deceive her<br/>
And so leave her,<br/>
But ah! she is so constant and so kind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Beneath my palm trees, by the river side,<br/>
I sat a weeping: in the whole world wide<br/>
There was no one to ask me why I wept,&mdash;<br/>
And so I kept<br/>
Brimming the water-lily cups with tears<br/>
Cold as my fears.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Beneath my palm trees, by the river side,<br/>
I sat a weeping: what enamour'd bride,<br/>
Cheated by shadowy wooer from the clouds,<br/>
But hides and shrouds<br/>
Beneath dark palm trees by a river side?<br/>
"And as I sat, over the light blue hills<br/>
There came a noise of revellers: the rills<br/>
Into the wide stream came of purple hue&mdash;<br/>
'Twas Bacchus and his crew!<br/>
The earnest trumpet spake, and silver thrills<br/>
From kissing cymbals made a merry din&mdash;<br/>
'Twas Bacchus and his kin!<br/>
Like to a moving vintage down they came,<br/>
Crown'd with green leaves, and faces all on flame;<br/>
All madly dancing through the pleasant valley,<br/>
To scare thee, Melancholy!<br/>
O then, O then, thou wast a simple name!<br/>
And I forgot thee, as the berried holly<br/>
By shepherds is forgotten, when, in June,<br/>
Tall chesnuts keep away the sun and moon:&mdash;<br/>
I rush'd into the folly!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Within his car, aloft, young Bacchus stood,<br/>
Trifling his ivy-dart, in dancing mood,<br/>
With sidelong laughing;<br/>
And little rills of crimson wine imbrued<br/>
His plump white arms, and shoulders, enough white<br/>
For Venus' pearly bite:<br/>
And near him rode Silenus on his ass,<br/>
Pelted with flowers as he on did pass<br/>
Tipsily quaffing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Whence came ye, merry Damsels! whence came ye!<br/>
So many, and so many, and such glee?<br/>
Why have ye left your bowers desolate,<br/>
Your lutes, and gentler fate?&mdash;<br/>
'We follow Bacchus! Bacchus on the wing,<br/>
A conquering!<br/>
Bacchus, young Bacchus! good or ill betide,<br/>
We dance before him thorough kingdoms wide:&mdash;<br/>
Come hither, lady fair, and joined be<br/>
To our wild minstrelsy!'<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Whence came ye, jolly Satyrs! whence came ye!<br/>
So many, and so many, and such glee?<br/>
Why have ye left your forest haunts, why left<br/>
Your nuts in oak-tree cleft?&mdash;<br/>
'For wine, for wine we left our kernel tree;<br/>
For wine we left our heath, and yellow brooms,<br/>
And cold mushrooms;<br/>
For wine we follow Bacchus through the earth;<br/>
Great God of breathless cups and chirping mirth!&mdash;<br/>
Come hither, lady fair, and joined be<br/>
To our mad minstrelsy!'<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Over wide streams and mountains great we went,<br/>
And, save when Bacchus kept his ivy tent,<br/>
Onward the tiger and the leopard pants,<br/>
With Asian elephants:<br/>
Onward these myriads&mdash;with song and dance,<br/>
With zebras striped, and sleek Arabians' prance,<br/>
Web-footed alligators, crocodiles,<br/>
Bearing upon their scaly backs, in files,<br/>
Plump infant laughers mimicking the coil<br/>
Of seamen, and stout galley-rowers' toil:<br/>
With toying oars and silken sails they glide,<br/>
Nor care for wind and tide.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Mounted on panthers' furs and lions' manes,<br/>
From rear to van they scour about the plains;<br/>
A three days' journey in a moment done:<br/>
And always, at the rising of the sun,<br/>
About the wilds they hunt with spear and horn,<br/>
On spleenful unicorn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I saw Osirian Egypt kneel adown<br/>
Before the vine-wreath crown!<br/>
I saw parch'd Abyssinia rouse and sing<br/>
To the silver cymbals' ring!<br/>
I saw the whelming vintage hotly pierce<br/>
Old Tartary the fierce!<br/>
The kings of Inde their jewel-sceptres vail,<br/>
And from their treasures scatter pearled hail;<br/>
Great Brahma from his mystic heaven groans,<br/>
And all his priesthood moans;<br/>
Before young Bacchus' eye-wink turning pale.&mdash;<br/>
Into these regions came I following him,<br/>
Sick hearted, weary&mdash;so I took a whim<br/>
To stray away into these forests drear<br/>
Alone, without a peer:<br/>
And I have told thee all thou mayest hear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Young stranger!<br/>
I've been a ranger<br/>
In search of pleasure throughout every clime:<br/>
Alas, 'tis not for me!<br/>
Bewitch'd I sure must be,<br/>
To lose in grieving all my maiden prime.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Come then, Sorrow!<br/>
Sweetest Sorrow!<br/>
Like an own babe I nurse thee on my breast:<br/>
I thought to leave thee<br/>
And deceive thee,<br/>
But now of all the world I love thee best.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"There is not one,<br/>
No, no, not one<br/>
But thee to comfort a poor lonely maid;<br/>
Thou art her mother,<br/>
And her brother,<br/>
Her playmate, and her wooer in the shade."<br/>
</p>
<p>
O what a sigh she gave in finishing,<br/>
And look, quite dead to every worldly thing!<br/>
Endymion could not speak, but gazed on her;<br/>
And listened to the wind that now did stir<br/>
About the crisped oaks full drearily,<br/>
Yet with as sweet a softness as might be<br/>
Remember'd from its velvet summer song.<br/>
At last he said: "Poor lady, how thus long<br/>
Have I been able to endure that voice?<br/>
Fair Melody! kind Syren! I've no choice;<br/>
I must be thy sad servant evermore:<br/>
I cannot choose but kneel here and adore.<br/>
Alas, I must not think&mdash;by Phœbe, no!<br/>
Let me not think, soft Angel! shall it be so?<br/>
Say, beautifullest, shall I never think?<br/>
O thou could'st foster me beyond the brink<br/>
Of recollection! make my watchful care<br/>
Close up its bloodshot eyes, nor see despair!<br/>
Do gently murder half my soul, and I<br/>
Shall feel the other half so utterly!&mdash;<br/>
I'm giddy at that cheek so fair and smooth;<br/>
O let it blush so ever! let it soothe<br/>
My madness! let it mantle rosy-warm<br/>
With the tinge of love, panting in safe alarm.&mdash;<br/>
This cannot be thy hand, and yet it is;<br/>
And this is sure thine other softling&mdash;this<br/>
Thine own fair bosom, and I am so near!<br/>
Wilt fall asleep? O let me sip that tear!<br/>
And whisper one sweet word that I may know<br/>
This is this world&mdash;sweet dewy blossom!"&mdash;<i>Woe!<br/>
Woe! Woe to that Endymion! Where is he?</i>&mdash;<br/>
Even these words went echoing dismally<br/>
Through the wide forest&mdash;a most fearful tone,<br/>
Like one repenting in his latest moan;<br/>
And while it died away a shade pass'd by,<br/>
As of a thunder cloud. When arrows fly<br/>
Through the thick branches, poor ring-doves sleek forth<br/>
Their timid necks and tremble; so these both<br/>
Leant to each other trembling, and sat so<br/>
Waiting for some destruction&mdash;when lo,<br/>
Foot-feather'd Mercury appear'd sublime<br/>
Beyond the tall tree tops; and in less time<br/>
Than shoots the slanted hail-storm, down he dropt<br/>
Towards the ground; but rested not, nor stopt<br/>
One moment from his home: only the sward<br/>
He with his wand light touch'd, and heavenward<br/>
Swifter than sight was gone&mdash;even before<br/>
The teeming earth a sudden witness bore<br/>
Of his swift magic. Diving swans appear<br/>
Above the crystal circlings white and clear;<br/>
And catch the cheated eye in wild surprise,<br/>
How they can dive in sight and unseen rise&mdash;<br/>
So from the turf outsprang two steeds jet-black,<br/>
Each with large dark blue wings upon his back.<br/>
The youth of Caria plac'd the lovely dame<br/>
On one, and felt himself in spleen to tame<br/>
The other's fierceness. Through the air they flew,<br/>
High as the eagles. Like two drops of dew<br/>
Exhal'd to Phœbus' lips, away they are gone,<br/>
Far from the earth away&mdash;unseen, alone,<br/>
Among cool clouds and winds, but that the free,<br/>
The buoyant life of song can floating be<br/>
Above their heads, and follow them untir'd.&mdash;<br/>
Muse of my native land, am I inspir'd?<br/>
This is the giddy air, and I must spread<br/>
Wide pinions to keep here; nor do I dread<br/>
Or height, or depth, or width, or any chance<br/>
Precipitous: I have beneath my glance<br/>
Those towering horses and their mournful freight.<br/>
Could I thus sail, and see, and thus await<br/>
Fearless for power of thought, without thine aid?&mdash;<br/>
There is a sleepy dusk, an odorous shade<br/>
From some approaching wonder, and behold<br/>
Those winged steeds, with snorting nostrils bold<br/>
Snuff at its faint extreme, and seem to tire,<br/>
Dying to embers from their native fire!<br/>
</p>
<p>
There curl'd a purple mist around them; soon,<br/>
It seem'd as when around the pale new moon<br/>
Sad Zephyr droops the clouds like weeping willow:<br/>
'Twas Sleep slow journeying with head on pillow.<br/>
For the first time, since he came nigh dead born<br/>
From the old womb of night, his cave forlorn<br/>
Had he left more forlorn; for the first time,<br/>
He felt aloof the day and morning's prime&mdash;<br/>
Because into his depth Cimmerian<br/>
There came a dream, shewing how a young man,<br/>
Ere a lean bat could plump its wintery skin,<br/>
Would at high Jove's empyreal footstool win<br/>
An immortality, and how espouse<br/>
Jove's daughter, and be reckon'd of his house.<br/>
Now was he slumbering towards heaven's gate,<br/>
That he might at the threshold one hour wait<br/>
To hear the marriage melodies, and then<br/>
Sink downward to his dusky cave again.<br/>
His litter of smooth semilucent mist,<br/>
Diversely ting'd with rose and amethyst,<br/>
Puzzled those eyes that for the centre sought;<br/>
And scarcely for one moment could be caught<br/>
His sluggish form reposing motionless.<br/>
Those two on winged steeds, with all the stress<br/>
Of vision search'd for him, as one would look<br/>
Athwart the sallows of a river nook<br/>
To catch a glance at silver throated eels,&mdash;<br/>
Or from old Skiddaw's top, when fog conceals<br/>
His rugged forehead in a mantle pale,<br/>
With an eye-guess towards some pleasant vale<br/>
Descry a favourite hamlet faint and far.<br/>
</p>
<p>
These raven horses, though they foster'd are<br/>
Of earth's splenetic fire, dully drop<br/>
Their full-veined ears, nostrils blood wide, and stop;<br/>
Upon the spiritless mist have they outspread<br/>
Their ample feathers, are in slumber dead,&mdash;<br/>
And on those pinions, level in mid air,<br/>
Endymion sleepeth and the lady fair.<br/>
Slowly they sail, slowly as icy isle<br/>
Upon a calm sea drifting: and meanwhile<br/>
The mournful wanderer dreams. Behold! he walks<br/>
On heaven's pavement; brotherly he talks<br/>
To divine powers: from his hand full fain<br/>
Juno's proud birds are pecking pearly grain:<br/>
He tries the nerve of Phœbus' golden bow,<br/>
And asketh where the golden apples grow:<br/>
Upon his arm he braces Pallas' shield,<br/>
And strives in vain to unsettle and wield<br/>
A Jovian thunderbolt: arch Hebe brings<br/>
A full-brimm'd goblet, dances lightly, sings<br/>
And tantalizes long; at last he drinks,<br/>
And lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,<br/>
Touching with dazzled lips her starlight hand.<br/>
He blows a bugle,&mdash;an ethereal band<br/>
Are visible above: the Seasons four,&mdash;<br/>
Green-kyrtled Spring, flush Summer, golden store<br/>
In Autumn's sickle, Winter frosty hoar,<br/>
Join dance with shadowy Hours; while still the blast,<br/>
In swells unmitigated, still doth last<br/>
To sway their floating morris. "Whose is this?<br/>
Whose bugle?" he inquires: they smile&mdash;"O Dis!<br/>
Why is this mortal here? Dost thou not know<br/>
Its mistress' lips? Not thou?&mdash;'Tis Dian's: lo!<br/>
She rises crescented!" He looks, 'tis she,<br/>
His very goddess: good-bye earth, and sea,<br/>
And air, and pains, and care, and suffering;<br/>
Good-bye to all but love! Then doth he spring<br/>
Towards her, and awakes&mdash;and, strange, o'erhead,<br/>
Of those same fragrant exhalations bred,<br/>
Beheld awake his very dream: the gods<br/>
Stood smiling; merry Hebe laughs and nods;<br/>
And Phœbe bends towards him crescented.<br/>
O state perplexing! On the pinion bed,<br/>
Too well awake, he feels the panting side<br/>
Of his delicious lady. He who died<br/>
For soaring too audacious in the sun,<br/>
Where that same treacherous wax began to run,<br/>
Felt not more tongue-tied than Endymion.<br/>
His heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,<br/>
To that fair shadow'd passion puls'd its way&mdash;<br/>
Ah, what perplexity! Ah, well a day!<br/>
So fond, so beauteous was his bed-fellow,<br/>
He could not help but kiss her: then he grew<br/>
Awhile forgetful of all beauty save<br/>
Young Phœbe's, golden hair'd; and so 'gan crave<br/>
Forgiveness: yet he turn'd once more to look<br/>
At the sweet sleeper,&mdash;all his soul was shook,&mdash;<br/>
She press'd his hand in slumber; so once more<br/>
He could not help but kiss her and adore.<br/>
At this the shadow wept, melting away.<br/>
The Latmian started up: "Bright goddess, stay!<br/>
Search my most hidden breast! By truth's own tongue,<br/>
I have no dædale heart: why is it wrung<br/>
To desperation? Is there nought for me,<br/>
Upon the bourne of bliss, but misery?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
These words awoke the stranger of dark tresses:<br/>
Her dawning love-look rapt Endymion blesses<br/>
With 'haviour soft. Sleep yawned from underneath.<br/>
"Thou swan of Ganges, let us no more breathe<br/>
This murky phantasm! thou contented seem'st<br/>
Pillow'd in lovely idleness, nor dream'st<br/>
What horrors may discomfort thee and me.<br/>
Ah, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!&mdash;<br/>
Yet did she merely weep&mdash;her gentle soul<br/>
Hath no revenge in it: as it is whole<br/>
In tenderness, would I were whole in love!<br/>
Can I prize thee, fair maid, till price above,<br/>
Even when I feel as true as innocence?<br/>
I do, I do.&mdash;What is this soul then? Whence<br/>
Came it? It does not seem my own, and I<br/>
Have no self-passion or identity.<br/>
Some fearful end must be: where, where is it?<br/>
By Nemesis, I see my spirit flit<br/>
Alone about the dark&mdash;Forgive me, sweet:<br/>
Shall we away?" He rous'd the steeds: they beat<br/>
Their wings chivalrous into the clear air,<br/>
Leaving old Sleep within his vapoury lair.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The good-night blush of eve was waning slow,<br/>
And Vesper, risen star, began to throe<br/>
In the dusk heavens silvery, when they<br/>
Thus sprang direct towards the Galaxy.<br/>
Nor did speed hinder converse soft and strange&mdash;<br/>
Eternal oaths and vows they interchange,<br/>
In such wise, in such temper, so aloof<br/>
Up in the winds, beneath a starry roof,<br/>
So witless of their doom, that verily<br/>
'Tis well nigh past man's search their hearts to see;<br/>
Whether they wept, or laugh'd, or griev'd, or toy'd&mdash;<br/>
Most like with joy gone mad, with sorrow cloy'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fell facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,<br/>
The moon put forth a little diamond peak,<br/>
No bigger than an unobserved star,<br/>
Or tiny point of fairy scymetar;<br/>
Bright signal that she only stoop'd to tie<br/>
Her silver sandals, ere deliciously<br/>
She bow'd into the heavens her timid head.<br/>
Slowly she rose, as though she would have fled,<br/>
While to his lady meek the Carian turn'd,<br/>
To mark if her dark eyes had yet discern'd<br/>
This beauty in its birth&mdash;Despair! despair!<br/>
He saw her body fading gaunt and spare<br/>
In the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz'd her wrist;<br/>
It melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss'd,<br/>
And, horror! kiss'd his own&mdash;he was alone.<br/>
Her steed a little higher soar'd, and then<br/>
Dropt hawkwise to the earth.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There lies a den,<br/>
Beyond the seeming confines of the space<br/>
Made for the soul to wander in and trace<br/>
Its own existence, of remotest glooms.<br/>
Dark regions are around it, where the tombs<br/>
Of buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce<br/>
One hour doth linger weeping, for the pierce<br/>
Of new-born woe it feels more inly smart:<br/>
And in these regions many a venom'd dart<br/>
At random flies; they are the proper home<br/>
Of every ill: the man is yet to come<br/>
Who hath not journeyed in this native hell.<br/>
But few have ever felt how calm and well<br/>
Sleep may be had in that deep den of all.<br/>
There anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall:<br/>
Woe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,<br/>
Yet all is still within and desolate.<br/>
Beset with plainful gusts, within ye hear<br/>
No sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier<br/>
The death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none<br/>
Who strive therefore: on the sudden it is won.<br/>
Just when the sufferer begins to burn,<br/>
Then it is free to him; and from an urn,<br/>
Still fed by melting ice, he takes a draught&mdash;<br/>
Young Semele such richness never quaft<br/>
In her maternal longing. Happy gloom!<br/>
Dark Paradise! where pale becomes the bloom<br/>
Of health by due; where silence dreariest<br/>
Is most articulate; where hopes infest;<br/>
Where those eyes are the brightest far that keep<br/>
Their lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep.<br/>
O happy spirit-home! O wondrous soul!<br/>
Pregnant with such a den to save the whole<br/>
In thine own depth. Hail, gentle Carian!<br/>
For, never since thy griefs and woes began,<br/>
Hast thou felt so content: a grievous feud<br/>
Hath let thee to this Cave of Quietude.<br/>
Aye, his lull'd soul was there, although upborne<br/>
With dangerous speed: and so he did not mourn<br/>
Because he knew not whither he was going.<br/>
So happy was he, not the aerial blowing<br/>
Of trumpets at clear parley from the east<br/>
Could rouse from that fine relish, that high feast.<br/>
They stung the feather'd horse: with fierce alarm<br/>
He flapp'd towards the sound. Alas, no charm<br/>
Could lift Endymion's head, or he had view'd<br/>
A skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,&mdash;<br/>
And silvery was its passing: voices sweet<br/>
Warbling the while as if to lull and greet<br/>
The wanderer in his path. Thus warbled they,<br/>
While past the vision went in bright array.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Who, who from Dian's feast would be away?<br/>
For all the golden bowers of the day<br/>
Are empty left? Who, who away would be<br/>
From Cynthia's wedding and festivity?<br/>
Not Hesperus: lo! upon his silver wings<br/>
He leans away for highest heaven and sings,<br/>
Snapping his lucid fingers merrily!&mdash;<br/>
Ah, Zephyrus! art here, and Flora too!<br/>
Ye tender bibbers of the rain and dew,<br/>
Young playmates of the rose and daffodil,<br/>
Be careful, ere ye enter in, to fill<br/>
Your baskets high<br/>
With fennel green, and balm, and golden pines,<br/>
Savory, latter-mint, and columbines,<br/>
Cool parsley, basil sweet, and sunny thyme;<br/>
Yea, every flower and leaf of every clime,<br/>
All gather'd in the dewy morning: hie<br/>
Away! fly, fly!&mdash;<br/>
Crystalline brother of the belt of heaven,<br/>
Aquarius! to whom king Jove has given<br/>
Two liquid pulse streams 'stead of feather'd wings,<br/>
Two fan-like fountains,&mdash;thine illuminings<br/>
For Dian play:<br/>
Dissolve the frozen purity of air;<br/>
Let thy white shoulders silvery and bare<br/>
Shew cold through watery pinions; make more bright<br/>
The Star-Queen's crescent on her marriage night:<br/>
Haste, haste away!&mdash;<br/>
Castor has tamed the planet Lion, see!<br/>
And of the Bear has Pollux mastery:<br/>
A third is in the race! who is the third,<br/>
Speeding away swift as the eagle bird?<br/>
The ramping Centaur!<br/>
The Lion's mane's on end: the Bear how fierce!<br/>
The Centaur's arrow ready seems to pierce<br/>
Some enemy: far forth his bow is bent<br/>
Into the blue of heaven. He'll be shent,<br/>
Pale unrelentor,<br/>
When he shall hear the wedding lutes a playing.&mdash;<br/>
Andromeda! sweet woman! why delaying<br/>
So timidly among the stars: come hither!<br/>
Join this bright throng, and nimbly follow whither<br/>
They all are going.<br/>
Danae's Son, before Jove newly bow'd,<br/>
Has wept for thee, calling to Jove aloud.<br/>
Thee, gentle lady, did he disenthral:<br/>
Ye shall for ever live and love, for all<br/>
Thy tears are flowing.&mdash;<br/>
By Daphne's fright, behold Apollo!&mdash;"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More<br/>
Endymion heard not: down his steed him bore,<br/>
Prone to the green head of a misty hill.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His first touch of the earth went nigh to kill.<br/>
"Alas!" said he, "were I but always borne<br/>
Through dangerous winds, had but my footsteps worn<br/>
A path in hell, for ever would I bless<br/>
Horrors which nourish an uneasiness<br/>
For my own sullen conquering: to him<br/>
Who lives beyond earth's boundary, grief is dim,<br/>
Sorrow is but a shadow: now I see<br/>
The grass; I feel the solid ground&mdash;Ah, me!<br/>
It is thy voice&mdash;divinest! Where?&mdash;who? who<br/>
Left thee so quiet on this bed of dew?<br/>
Behold upon this happy earth we are;<br/>
Let us ay love each other; let us fare<br/>
On forest-fruits, and never, never go<br/>
Among the abodes of mortals here below,<br/>
Or be by phantoms duped. O destiny!<br/>
Into a labyrinth now my soul would fly,<br/>
But with thy beauty will I deaden it.<br/>
Where didst thou melt too? By thee will I sit<br/>
For ever: let our fate stop here&mdash;a kid<br/>
I on this spot will offer: Pan will bid<br/>
Us live in peace, in love and peace among<br/>
His forest wildernesses. I have clung<br/>
To nothing, lov'd a nothing, nothing seen<br/>
Or felt but a great dream! O I have been<br/>
Presumptuous against love, against the sky,<br/>
Against all elements, against the tie<br/>
Of mortals each to each, against the blooms<br/>
Of flowers, rush of rivers, and the tombs<br/>
Of heroes gone! Against his proper glory<br/>
Has my own soul conspired: so my story<br/>
Will I to children utter, and repent.<br/>
There never liv'd a mortal man, who bent<br/>
His appetite beyond his natural sphere,<br/>
But starv'd and died. My sweetest Indian, here,<br/>
Here will I kneel, for thou redeemed hast<br/>
My life from too thin breathing: gone and past<br/>
Are cloudy phantasms. Caverns lone, farewel!<br/>
And air of visions, and the monstrous swell<br/>
Of visionary seas! No, never more<br/>
Shall airy voices cheat me to the shore<br/>
Of tangled wonder, breathless and aghast.<br/>
Adieu, my daintiest Dream! although so vast<br/>
My love is still for thee. The hour may come<br/>
When we shall meet in pure elysium.<br/>
On earth I may not love thee; and therefore<br/>
Doves will I offer up, and sweetest store<br/>
All through the teeming year: so thou wilt shine<br/>
On me, and on this damsel fair of mine,<br/>
And bless our simple lives. My Indian bliss!<br/>
My river-lily bud! one human kiss!<br/>
One sigh of real breath&mdash;one gentle squeeze,<br/>
Warm as a dove's nest among summer trees,<br/>
And warm with dew at ooze from living blood!<br/>
Whither didst melt? Ah, what of that!&mdash;all good<br/>
We'll talk about&mdash;no more of dreaming.&mdash;Now,<br/>
Where shall our dwelling be? Under the brow<br/>
Of some steep mossy hill, where ivy dun<br/>
Would hide us up, although spring leaves were none;<br/>
And where dark yew trees, as we rustle through,<br/>
Will drop their scarlet berry cups of dew?<br/>
O thou wouldst joy to live in such a place;<br/>
Dusk for our loves, yet light enough to grace<br/>
Those gentle limbs on mossy bed reclin'd:<br/>
For by one step the blue sky shouldst thou find,<br/>
And by another, in deep dell below,<br/>
See, through the trees, a little river go<br/>
All in its mid-day gold and glimmering.<br/>
Honey from out the gnarled hive I'll bring,<br/>
And apples, wan with sweetness, gather thee,&mdash;<br/>
Cresses that grow where no man may them see,<br/>
And sorrel untorn by the dew-claw'd stag:<br/>
Pipes will I fashion of the syrinx flag,<br/>
That thou mayst always know whither I roam,<br/>
When it shall please thee in our quiet home<br/>
To listen and think of love. Still let me speak;<br/>
Still let me dive into the joy I seek,&mdash;<br/>
For yet the past doth prison me. The rill,<br/>
Thou haply mayst delight in, will I fill<br/>
With fairy fishes from the mountain tarn,<br/>
And thou shall feed them from the squirrel's barn.<br/>
Its bottom will I strew with amber shells,<br/>
And pebbles blue from deep enchanted wells.<br/>
Its sides I'll plant with dew-sweet eglantine,<br/>
And honeysuckles full of clear bee-wine.<br/>
I will entice this crystal rill to trace<br/>
Love's silver name upon the meadow's face.<br/>
I'll kneel to Vesta, for a flame of fire;<br/>
And to god Phœbus, for a golden lyre;<br/>
To Empress Dian, for a hunting spear;<br/>
To Vesper, for a taper silver-clear,<br/>
That I may see thy beauty through the night;<br/>
To Flora, and a nightingale shall light<br/>
Tame on thy finger; to the River-gods,<br/>
And they shall bring thee taper fishing-rods<br/>
Of gold, and lines of Naiads' long bright tress.<br/>
Heaven shield thee for thine utter loveliness!<br/>
Thy mossy footstool shall the altar be<br/>
'Fore which I'll bend, bending, dear love, to thee:<br/>
Those lips shall be my Delphos, and shall speak<br/>
Laws to my footsteps, colour to my cheek,<br/>
Trembling or stedfastness to this same voice,<br/>
And of three sweetest pleasurings the choice:<br/>
And that affectionate light, those diamond things,<br/>
Those eyes, those passions, those supreme pearl springs,<br/>
Shall be my grief, or twinkle me to pleasure.<br/>
Say, is not bliss within our perfect seisure?<br/>
O that I could not doubt?"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountaineer<br/>
Thus strove by fancies vain and crude to clear<br/>
His briar'd path to some tranquillity.<br/>
It gave bright gladness to his lady's eye,<br/>
And yet the tears she wept were tears of sorrow;<br/>
Answering thus, just as the golden morrow<br/>
Beam'd upward from the vallies of the east:<br/>
"O that the flutter of this heart had ceas'd,<br/>
Or the sweet name of love had pass'd away.<br/>
Young feathor'd tyrant! by a swift decay<br/>
Wilt thou devote this body to the earth:<br/>
And I do think that at my very birth<br/>
I lisp'd thy blooming titles inwardly;<br/>
For at the first, first dawn and thought of thee,<br/>
With uplift hands I blest the stars of heaven.<br/>
Art thou not cruel? Ever have I striven<br/>
To think thee kind, but ah, it will not do!<br/>
When yet a child, I heard that kisses drew<br/>
Favour from thee, and so I gave and gave<br/>
To the void air, bidding them find out love:<br/>
But when I came to feel how far above<br/>
All fancy, pride, and fickle maidenhood,<br/>
All earthly pleasure, all imagin'd good,<br/>
Was the warm tremble of a devout kiss,&mdash;<br/>
Even then, that moment, at the thought of this,<br/>
Fainting I fell into a bed of flowers,<br/>
And languish'd there three days. Ye milder powers,<br/>
Am I not cruelly wrong'd? Believe, believe<br/>
Me, dear Endymion, were I to weave<br/>
With my own fancies garlands of sweet life,<br/>
Thou shouldst be one of all. Ah, bitter strife!<br/>
I may not be thy love: I am forbidden&mdash;<br/>
Indeed I am&mdash;thwarted, affrighted, chidden,<br/>
By things I trembled at, and gorgon wrath.<br/>
Twice hast thou ask'd whither I went: henceforth<br/>
Ask me no more! I may not utter it,<br/>
Nor may I be thy love. We might commit<br/>
Ourselves at once to vengeance; we might die;<br/>
We might embrace and die: voluptuous thought!<br/>
Enlarge not to my hunger, or I'm caught<br/>
In trammels of perverse deliciousness.<br/>
No, no, that shall not be: thee will I bless,<br/>
And bid a long adieu."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Carian<br/>
No word return'd: both lovelorn, silent, wan,<br/>
Into the vallies green together went.<br/>
Far wandering, they were perforce content<br/>
To sit beneath a fair lone beechen tree;<br/>
Nor at each other gaz'd, but heavily<br/>
Por'd on its hazle cirque of shedded leaves.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Endymion! unhappy! it nigh grieves<br/>
Me to behold thee thus in last extreme:<br/>
Ensky'd ere this, but truly that I deem<br/>
Truth the best music in a first-born song.<br/>
Thy lute-voic'd brother will I sing ere long,<br/>
And thou shall aid&mdash;hast thou not aided me?<br/>
Yes, moonlight Emperor! felicity<br/>
Has been thy meed for many thousand years;<br/>
Yet often have I, on the brink of tears,<br/>
Mourn'd as if yet thou wert a forester;&mdash;<br/>
Forgetting the old tale.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not stir<br/>
His eyes from the dead leaves, or one small pulse<br/>
Of joy he might have felt. The spirit culls<br/>
Unfaded amaranth, when wild it strays<br/>
Through the old garden-ground of boyish days.<br/>
A little onward ran the very stream<br/>
By which he took his first soft poppy dream;<br/>
And on the very bark 'gainst which he leant<br/>
A crescent he had carv'd, and round it spent<br/>
His skill in little stars. The teeming tree<br/>
Had swollen and green'd the pious charactery,<br/>
But not ta'en out. Why, there was not a slope<br/>
Up which he had not fear'd the antelope;<br/>
And not a tree, beneath whose rooty shade<br/>
He had not with his tamed leopards play'd;<br/>
Nor could an arrow light, or javelin,<br/>
Fly in the air where his had never been&mdash;<br/>
And yet he knew it not.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O treachery!<br/>
Why does his lady smile, pleasing her eye<br/>
With all his sorrowing? He sees her not.<br/>
But who so stares on him? His sister sure!<br/>
Peona of the woods!&mdash;Can she endure&mdash;<br/>
Impossible&mdash;how dearly they embrace!<br/>
His lady smiles; delight is in her face;<br/>
It is no treachery.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear brother mine!<br/>
Endymion, weep not so! Why shouldst thou pine<br/>
When all great Latmos so exalt will be?<br/>
Thank the great gods, and look not bitterly;<br/>
And speak not one pale word, and sigh no more.<br/>
Sure I will not believe thou hast such store<br/>
Of grief, to last thee to my kiss again.<br/>
Thou surely canst not bear a mind in pain,<br/>
Come hand in hand with one so beautiful.<br/>
Be happy both of you! for I will pull<br/>
The flowers of autumn for your coronals.<br/>
Pan's holy priest for young Endymion calls;<br/>
And when he is restor'd, thou, fairest dame,<br/>
Shalt be our queen. Now, is it not a shame<br/>
To see ye thus,&mdash;not very, very sad?<br/>
Perhaps ye are too happy to be glad:<br/>
O feel as if it were a common day;<br/>
Free-voic'd as one who never was away.<br/>
No tongue shall ask, whence come ye? but ye shall<br/>
Be gods of your own rest imperial.<br/>
Not even I, for one whole month, will pry<br/>
Into the hours that have pass'd us by,<br/>
Since in my arbour I did sing to thee.<br/>
O Hermes! on this very night will be<br/>
A hymning up to Cynthia, queen of light;<br/>
For the soothsayers old saw yesternight<br/>
Good visions in the air,&mdash;whence will befal,<br/>
As say these sages, health perpetual<br/>
To shepherds and their flocks; and furthermore,<br/>
In Dian's face they read the gentle lore:<br/>
Therefore for her these vesper-carols are.<br/>
Our friends will all be there from nigh and far.<br/>
Many upon thy death have ditties made;<br/>
And many, even now, their foreheads shade<br/>
With cypress, on a day of sacrifice.<br/>
New singing for our maids shalt thou devise,<br/>
And pluck the sorrow from our huntsmen's brows.<br/>
Tell me, my lady-queen, how to espouse<br/>
This wayward brother to his rightful joys!<br/>
His eyes are on thee bent, as thou didst poise<br/>
His fate most goddess-like. Help me, I pray,<br/>
To lure&mdash;Endymion, dear brother, say<br/>
What ails thee?" He could bear no more, and so<br/>
Bent his soul fiercely like a spiritual bow,<br/>
And twang'd it inwardly, and calmly said:<br/>
"I would have thee my only friend, sweet maid!<br/>
My only visitor! not ignorant though,<br/>
That those deceptions which for pleasure go<br/>
'Mong men, are pleasures real as real may be:<br/>
But there are higher ones I may not see,<br/>
If impiously an earthly realm I take.<br/>
Since I saw thee, I have been wide awake<br/>
Night after night, and day by day, until<br/>
Of the empyrean I have drunk my fill.<br/>
Let it content thee, Sister, seeing me<br/>
More happy than betides mortality.<br/>
A hermit young, I'll live in mossy cave,<br/>
Where thou alone shalt come to me, and lave<br/>
Thy spirit in the wonders I shall tell.<br/>
Through me the shepherd realm shall prosper well;<br/>
For to thy tongue will I all health confide.<br/>
And, for my sake, let this young maid abide<br/>
With thee as a dear sister. Thou alone,<br/>
Peona, mayst return to me. I own<br/>
This may sound strangely: but when, dearest girl,<br/>
Thou seest it for my happiness, no pearl<br/>
Will trespass down those cheeks. Companion fair!<br/>
Wilt be content to dwell with her, to share<br/>
This sister's love with me?" Like one resign'd<br/>
And bent by circumstance, and thereby blind<br/>
In self-commitment, thus that meek unknown:<br/>
"Aye, but a buzzing by my ears has flown,<br/>
Of jubilee to Dian:&mdash;truth I heard!<br/>
Well then, I see there is no little bird,<br/>
Tender soever, but is Jove's own care.<br/>
Long have I sought for rest, and, unaware,<br/>
Behold I find it! so exalted too!<br/>
So after my own heart! I knew, I knew<br/>
There was a place untenanted in it:<br/>
In that same void white Chastity shall sit,<br/>
And monitor me nightly to lone slumber.<br/>
With sanest lips I vow me to the number<br/>
Of Dian's sisterhood; and, kind lady,<br/>
With thy good help, this very night shall see<br/>
My future days to her fane consecrate."<br/>
</p>
<p>
As feels a dreamer what doth most create<br/>
His own particular fright, so these three felt:<br/>
Or like one who, in after ages, knelt<br/>
To Lucifer or Baal, when he'd pine<br/>
After a little sleep: or when in mine<br/>
Far under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends<br/>
Who know him not. Each diligently bends<br/>
Towards common thoughts and things for very fear;<br/>
Striving their ghastly malady to cheer,<br/>
By thinking it a thing of yes and no,<br/>
That housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow<br/>
Was struck, and all were dreamers. At the last<br/>
Endymion said: "Are not our fates all cast?<br/>
Why stand we here? Adieu, ye tender pair!<br/>
Adieu!" Whereat those maidens, with wild stare,<br/>
Walk'd dizzily away. Pained and hot<br/>
His eyes went after them, until they got<br/>
Near to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw,<br/>
In one swift moment, would what then he saw<br/>
Engulph for ever. "Stay!" he cried, "ah, stay!<br/>
Turn, damsels! hist! one word I have to say.<br/>
Sweet Indian, I would see thee once again.<br/>
It is a thing I dote on: so I'd fain,<br/>
Peona, ye should hand in hand repair<br/>
Into those holy groves, that silent are<br/>
Behind great Dian's temple. I'll be yon,<br/>
At vesper's earliest twinkle&mdash;they are gone&mdash;<br/>
But once, once, once again&mdash;" At this he press'd<br/>
His hands against his face, and then did rest<br/>
His head upon a mossy hillock green,<br/>
And so remain'd as he a corpse had been<br/>
All the long day; save when he scantly lifted<br/>
His eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted<br/>
With the slow move of time,&mdash;sluggish and weary<br/>
Until the poplar tops, in journey dreary,<br/>
Had reach'd the river's brim. Then up he rose,<br/>
And, slowly as that very river flows,<br/>
Walk'd towards the temple grove with this lament:<br/>
"Why such a golden eve? The breeze is sent<br/>
Careful and soft, that not a leaf may fall<br/>
Before the serene father of them all<br/>
Bows down his summer head below the west.<br/>
Now am I of breath, speech, and speed possest,<br/>
But at the setting I must bid adieu<br/>
To her for the last time. Night will strew<br/>
On the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves,<br/>
And with them shall I die; nor much it grieves<br/>
To die, when summer dies on the cold sward.<br/>
Why, I have been a butterfly, a lord<br/>
Of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies,<br/>
Groves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses;<br/>
My kingdom's at its death, and just it is<br/>
That I should die with it: so in all this<br/>
We miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,<br/>
What is there to plain of? By Titan's foe<br/>
I am but rightly serv'd." So saying, he<br/>
Tripp'd lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;<br/>
Laughing at the clear stream and setting sun,<br/>
As though they jests had been: nor had he done<br/>
His laugh at nature's holy countenance,<br/>
Until that grove appear'd, as if perchance,<br/>
And then his tongue with sober seemlihed<br/>
Gave utterance as he entered: "Ha!" I said,<br/>
"King of the butterflies; but by this gloom,<br/>
And by old Rhadamanthus' tongue of doom,<br/>
This dusk religion, pomp of solitude,<br/>
And the Promethean clay by thief endued,<br/>
By old Saturnus' forelock, by his head<br/>
Shook with eternal palsy, I did wed<br/>
Myself to things of light from infancy;<br/>
And thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,<br/>
Is sure enough to make a mortal man<br/>
Grow impious." So he inwardly began<br/>
On things for which no wording can be found;<br/>
Deeper and deeper sinking, until drown'd<br/>
Beyond the reach of music: for the choir<br/>
Of Cynthia he heard not, though rough briar<br/>
Nor muffling thicket interpos'd to dull<br/>
The vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full,<br/>
Through the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles.<br/>
He saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles,<br/>
Wan as primroses gather'd at midnight<br/>
By chilly finger'd spring. "Unhappy wight!<br/>
Endymion!" said Peona, "we are here!<br/>
What wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?"<br/>
Then he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand<br/>
Press'd, saying: "Sister, I would have command,<br/>
If it were heaven's will, on our sad fate."<br/>
At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate<br/>
And said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,<br/>
To Endymion's amaze: "By Cupid's dove,<br/>
And so thou shalt! and by the lily truth<br/>
Of my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!"<br/>
And as she spake, into her face there came<br/>
Light, as reflected from a silver flame:<br/>
Her long black hair swell'd ampler, in display<br/>
Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day<br/>
Dawn'd blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld<br/>
Phœbe, his passion! joyous she upheld<br/>
Her lucid bow, continuing thus: "Drear, drear<br/>
Has our delaying been; but foolish fear<br/>
Withheld me first; and then decrees of fate;<br/>
And then 'twas fit that from this mortal state<br/>
Thou shouldst, my love, by some unlook'd for change<br/>
Be spiritualiz'd. Peona, we shall range<br/>
These forests, and to thee they safe shall be<br/>
As was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee<br/>
To meet us many a time." Next Cynthia bright<br/>
Peona kiss'd, and bless'd with fair good night:<br/>
Her brother kiss'd her too, and knelt adown<br/>
Before his goddess, in a blissful swoon.<br/>
She gave her fair hands to him, and behold,<br/>
Before three swiftest kisses he had told,<br/>
They vanish'd far away!&mdash;Peona went<br/>
Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment.<br/>

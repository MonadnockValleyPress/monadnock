<h1>The Fall of Hyperion</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<h2>Canto I</h2>
<p>
Fanatics have their dreams, wherewith they weave<br/>
A paradise for a sect; the savage too<br/>
From forth the loftiest fashion of his sleep<br/>
Guesses at Heaven; pity these have not<br/>
Trac'd upon vellum or wild Indian leaf<br/>
The shadows of melodious utterance.<br/>
But bare of laurel they live, dream, and die;<br/>
For Poesy alone can tell her dreams,<br/>
With the fine spell of words alone can save<br/>
Imagination from the sable charm<br/>
And dumb enchantment. Who alive can say,<br/>
'Thou art no Poet may'st not tell thy dreams?'<br/>
Since every man whose soul is not a clod<br/>
Hath visions, and would speak, if he had loved<br/>
And been well nurtured in his mother tongue.<br/>
Whether the dream now purpos'd to rehearse<br/>
Be poet's or fanatic's will be known<br/>
When this warm scribe my hand is in the grave.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Methought I stood where trees of every clime,<br/>
Palm, myrtle, oak, and sycamore, and beech,<br/>
With plantain, and spice blossoms, made a screen;<br/>
In neighbourhood of fountains, by the noise<br/>
Soft showering in my ears, and, by the touch<br/>
Of scent, not far from roses. Turning round<br/>
I saw an arbour with a drooping roof<br/>
Of trellis vines, and bells, and larger blooms,<br/>
Like floral censers swinging light in air;<br/>
Before its wreathed doorway, on a mound<br/>
Of moss, was spread a feast of summer fruits,<br/>
Which, nearer seen, seem'd refuse of a meal<br/>
By angel tasted or our Mother Eve;<br/>
For empty shells were scattered on the grass,<br/>
And grape stalks but half bare, and remnants more,<br/>
Sweet smelling, whose pure kinds I could not know.<br/>
Still was more plenty than the fabled horn<br/>
Thrice emptied could pour forth, at banqueting<br/>
For Proserpine return'd to her own fields,<br/>
Where the white heifers low. And appetite<br/>
More yearning than on earth I ever felt<br/>
Growing within, I ate deliciously;<br/>
And, after not long, thirsted, for thereby<br/>
Stood a cool vessel of transparent juice<br/>
Sipp'd by the wander'd bee, the which I took,<br/>
And, pledging all the mortals of the world,<br/>
And all the dead whose names are in our lips,<br/>
Drank. That full draught is parent of my theme.<br/>
No Asian poppy nor elixir fine<br/>
Of the soon fading jealous Caliphat,<br/>
No poison gender'd in close monkish cell<br/>
To thin the scarlet conclave of old men,<br/>
Could so have rapt unwilling life away.<br/>
Among the fragrant husks and berries crush'd,<br/>
Upon the grass I struggled hard against<br/>
The domineering potion; but in vain:<br/>
The cloudy swoon came on, and down I sunk<br/>
Like a Silenus on an antique vase.<br/>
How long I slumber'd 'tis a chance to guess.<br/>
When sense of life return'd, I started up<br/>
As if with wings; but the fair trees were gone,<br/>
The mossy mound and arbour were no more:<br/>
I look'd around upon the carved sides<br/>
Of an old sanctuary with roof august,<br/>
Builded so high, it seem'd that filmed clouds<br/>
Might spread beneath, as o'er the stars of heaven;<br/>
So old the place was, I remember'd none<br/>
The like upon the earth: what I had seen<br/>
Of grey cathedrals, buttress'd walls, rent towers,<br/>
The superannuations of sunk realms,<br/>
Or Nature's rocks toil'd hard in waves and winds,<br/>
Seem'd but the faulture of decrepit things<br/>
To that eternal domed monument.<br/>
Upon the marble at my feet there lay<br/>
Store of strange vessels and large draperies,<br/>
Which needs had been of dyed asbestos wove,<br/>
Or in that place the moth could not corrupt,<br/>
So white the linen, so, in some, distinct<br/>
Ran imageries from a sombre loom.<br/>
All in a mingled heap confus'd there lay<br/>
Robes, golden tongs, censer and chafing dish,<br/>
Girdles, and chains, and holy jewelries.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Turning from these with awe, once more I rais'd<br/>
My eyes to fathom the space every way;<br/>
The embossed roof, the silent massy range<br/>
Of columns north and south, ending in mist<br/>
Of nothing, then to eastward, where black gates<br/>
Were shut against the sunrise evermore.<br/>
Then to the west I look'd, and saw far off<br/>
An image, huge of feature as a cloud,<br/>
At level of whose feet an altar slept,<br/>
To be approach'd on either side by steps,<br/>
And marble balustrade, and patient travail<br/>
To count with toil the innumerable degrees.<br/>
Towards the altar sober paced I went,<br/>
Repressing haste, as too unholy there;<br/>
And, coming nearer, saw beside the shrine<br/>
One minist'ring; and there arose a flame.<br/>
When in mid May the sickening East wind<br/>
Shifts sudden to the south, the small warm rain<br/>
Melts out the frozen incense from all flowers,<br/>
And fills the air with so much pleasant health<br/>
That even the dying man forgets his shroud;<br/>
Even so that lofty sacrificial fire,<br/>
Sending forth Maian incense, spread around<br/>
Forgetfulness of everything but bliss,<br/>
And clouded all the altar with soft smoke,<br/>
From whose white fragrant curtains thus I heard<br/>
Language pronounc'd: 'If thou canst not ascend<br/>
'These steps, die on that marble where thou art.<br/>
'Thy flesh, near cousin to the common dust,<br/>
'Will parch for lack of nutriment thy bones<br/>
'Will wither in few years, and vanish so<br/>
'That not the quickest eye could find a grain<br/>
'Of what thou now art on that pavement cold.<br/>
'The sands of thy short life are spent this hour,<br/>
'And no hand in the universe can turn<br/>
'Thy hourglass, if these gummed leaves be burnt<br/>
'Ere thou canst mount up these immortal steps.'<br/>
I heard, I look'd: two senses both at once,<br/>
So fine, so subtle, felt the tyranny<br/>
Of that fierce threat and the hard task proposed.<br/>
Prodigious seem'd the toil, the leaves were yet<br/>
Burning when suddenly a palsied chill<br/>
Struck from the paved level up my limbs,<br/>
And was ascending quick to put cold grasp<br/>
Upon those streams that pulse beside the throat:<br/>
I shriek'd; and the sharp anguish of my shriek<br/>
Stung my own ears I strove hard to escape<br/>
The numbness; strove to gain the lowest step.<br/>
Slow, heavy, deadly was my pace: the cold<br/>
Grew stifling, suffocating, at the heart;<br/>
And when I clasp'd my hands I felt them not.<br/>
One minute before death, my iced foot touch'd<br/>
The lowest stair; and as it touch'd, life seem'd<br/>
To pour in at the toes: I mounted up,<br/>
As once fair angels on a ladder flew<br/>
From the green turf to Heaven. 'Holy Power,'<br/>
Cried I, approaching near the horned shrine,<br/>
'What am I that should so be saved from death?<br/>
'What am I that another death come not<br/>
'To choke my utterance sacrilegious here?'<br/>
Then said the veiled shadow 'Thou hast felt<br/>
'What 'tis to die and live again before<br/>
'Thy fated hour. That thou hadst power to do so<br/>
'Is thy own safety; thou hast dated on<br/>
'Thy doom.' 'High Prophetess,' said I, 'purge off,<br/>
'Benign, if so it please thee, my mind's film.'<br/>
'None can usurp this height,' return'd that shade,<br/>
'But those to whom the miseries of the world<br/>
'Are misery, and will not let them rest.<br/>
'All else who find a haven in the world,<br/>
'Where they may thoughtless sleep away their days,<br/>
'If by a chance into this fane they come,<br/>
'Rot on the pavement where thou rottedst half.'<br/>
'Are there not thousands in the world,' said I,<br/>
Encourag'd by the sooth voice of the shade,<br/>
'Who love their fellows even to the death;<br/>
'Who feel the giant agony of the world;<br/>
'And more, like slaves to poor humanity,<br/>
'Labour for mortal good? I sure should see<br/>
'Other men here; but I am here alone.'<br/>
'Those whom thou spak'st of are no vision'ries,'<br/>
Rejoin'd that voice; 'they are no dreamers weak;<br/>
'They seek no wonder but the human face,<br/>
'No music but a happy noted voice;<br/>
'They come not here, they have no thought to come;<br/>
'And thou art here, for thou art less than they:<br/>
'What benefit canst thou do, or all thy tribe,<br/>
'To the great world? Thou art a dreaming thing,<br/>
'A fever of thyself think of the Earth;<br/>
'What bliss even in hope is there for thee?<br/>
'What haven? every creature hath its home;<br/>
'Every sole man hath days of joy and pain,<br/>
'Whether his labours be sublime or low<br/>
'The pain alone; the joy alone; distinct:<br/>
'Only the dreamer venoms all his days,<br/>
'Bearing more woe than all his sins deserve.<br/>
'Therefore, that happiness be somewhat shar'd,<br/>
'Such things as thou art are admitted oft<br/>
'Into like gardens thou didst pass erewhile,<br/>
'And suffer'd in these temples: for that cause<br/>
'Thou standest safe beneath this statue's knees.'<br/>
'That I am favour'd for unworthiness,<br/>
'By such propitious parley medicin'd<br/>
'In sickness not ignoble, I rejoice,<br/>
'Aye, and could weep for love of such award.'<br/>
So answer'd I, continuing, 'If it please,<br/>
'Majestic shadow, tell me: sure not all<br/>
'Those melodies sung into the world's ear<br/>
'Are useless: sure a poet is a sage;<br/>
'A humanist, physician to all men.<br/>
'That I am none I feel, as vultures feel<br/>
'They are no birds when eagles are abroad.<br/>
'What am I then? Thou spakest of my tribe:<br/>
'What tribe?' The tall shade veil'd in drooping white<br/>
Then spake, so much more earnest, that the breath<br/>
Moved the thin linen folds that drooping hung<br/>
About a golden censer from the hand<br/>
Pendent. 'Art thou not of the dreamer tribe?<br/>
'The poet and the dreamer are distinct,<br/>
'Diverse, sheer opposite, antipodes.<br/>
'The one pours out a balm upon the world,<br/>
'The other vexes it.' Then shouted I<br/>
Spite of myself, and with a Pythia's spleen,<br/>
'Apollo! faded! O far flown Apollo!<br/>
'Where is thy misty pestilence to creep<br/>
'Into the dwellings, through the door crannies<br/>
'Of all mock lyrists, large self worshipers,<br/>
'And careless Hectorers in proud bad verse.<br/>
'Though I breathe death with them it will be life<br/>
'To see them sprawl before me into graves.<br/>
'Majestic shadow, tell me where I am,<br/>
'Whose altar this; for whom this incense curls;<br/>
'What image this whose face I cannot see,<br/>
'For the broad marble knees; and who thou art,<br/>
'Of accent feminine so courteous?'<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the tall shade, in drooping linens veil'd,<br/>
Spoke out, so much more earnest, that her breath<br/>
Stirr'd the thin folds of gauze that drooping hung<br/>
About a golden censer from her hand<br/>
Pendent; and by her voice I knew she shed<br/>
Long treasured tears. 'This temple, sad and lone,<br/>
'Is all spar'd from the thunder of a war<br/>
'Foughten long since by giant hierarchy<br/>
'Against rebellion: this old image here,<br/>
'Whose carved features wrinkled as he fell,<br/>
'Is Saturn's; I Moneta, left supreme<br/>
'Sole priestess of this desolation.'<br/>
I had no words to answer, for my tongue,<br/>
Useless, could find about its roofed home<br/>
No syllable of a fit majesty<br/>
To make rejoinder to Moneta's mourn.<br/>
There was a silence, while the altar's blaze<br/>
Was fainting for sweet food: I look'd thereon,<br/>
And on the paved floor, where nigh were piled<br/>
Faggots of cinnamon, and many heaps<br/>
Of other crisped spice wood then again<br/>
I look'd upon the altar, and its horns<br/>
Whiten'd with ashes, and its lang'rous flame,<br/>
And then upon the offerings again;<br/>
And so by turns till sad Moneta cried,<br/>
'The sacrifice is done, but not the less<br/>
'Will I be kind to thee for thy good will.<br/>
'My power, which to me is still a curse,<br/>
'Shall be to thee a wonder; for the scenes<br/>
'Still swooning vivid through my globed brain<br/>
'With an electral changing misery<br/>
'Thou shalt with those dull mortal eyes behold,<br/>
'Free from all pain, if wonder pain thee not.'<br/>
As near as an immortal's sphered words<br/>
Could to a mother's soften, were these last:<br/>
And yet I had a terror of her robes,<br/>
And chiefly of the veils, that from her brow<br/>
Hung pale, and curtain'd her in mysteries<br/>
That made my heart too small to hold its blood.<br/>
This saw that Goddess, and with sacred hand<br/>
Parted the veils. Then saw I a wan face,<br/>
Not pin'd by human sorrows, but bright blanch'd<br/>
By an immortal sickness which kills not;<br/>
It works a constant change, which happy death<br/>
Can put no end to; deathwards progressing<br/>
To no death was that visage; it had pass'd<br/>
The lily and the snow; and beyond these<br/>
I must not think now, though I saw that face<br/>
But for her eyes I should have fled away.<br/>
They held me back, with a benignant light<br/>
Soft mitigated by divinest lids<br/>
Half closed, and visionless entire they seem'd<br/>
Of all external things; they saw me not,<br/>
But in blank splendour beam'd like the mild moon,<br/>
Who comforts those she sees not, who knows not<br/>
What eyes are upward cast. As I had found<br/>
A grain of gold upon a mountain side,<br/>
And twing'd with avarice strain'd out my eyes<br/>
To search its sullen entrails rich with ore,<br/>
So at the view of sad Moneta's brow<br/>
I ach'd to see what things the hollow brain<br/>
Behind enwombed: what high tragedy<br/>
In the dark secret chambers of her skull<br/>
Was acting, that could give so dread a stress<br/>
To her cold lips, and fill with such a light<br/>
Her planetary eyes, and touch her voice<br/>
With such a sorrow 'Shade of Memory!'<br/>
Cried I, with act adorant at her feet,<br/>
'By all the gloom hung round thy fallen house,<br/>
'By this last temple, by the golden age,<br/>
'By great Apollo, thy dear Foster Child,<br/>
'And by thyself, forlorn divinity,<br/>
'The pale Omega of a withered race,<br/>
'Let me behold, according as thou saidst,<br/>
'What in thy brain so ferments to and fro!'<br/>
No sooner had this conjuration pass'd<br/>
My devout lips, than side by side we stood<br/>
(Like a stunt bramble by a solemn pine)<br/>
Deep in the shady sadness of a vale,<br/>
Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,<br/>
Far from the fiery noon and eve's one star.<br/>
Onward I look'd beneath the gloomy boughs,<br/>
And saw, what first I thought an image huge,<br/>
Like to the image pedestal'd so high<br/>
In Saturn's temple. Then Moneta's voice<br/>
Came brief upon mine ear 'So Saturn sat<br/>
When he had lost his realms ' whereon there grew<br/>
A power within me of enormous ken<br/>
To see as a god sees, and take the depth<br/>
Of things as nimbly as the outward eye<br/>
Can size and shape pervade. The lofty theme<br/>
At those few words hung vast before my mind,<br/>
With half unravel'd web. I set myself<br/>
Upon an eagle's watch, that I might see,<br/>
And seeing ne'er forget. No stir of life<br/>
Was in this shrouded vale, not so much air<br/>
As in the zoning of a summer's day<br/>
Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,<br/>
But where the dead leaf fell there did it rest.<br/>
A stream went voiceless by, still deaden'd more<br/>
By reason of the fallen divinity<br/>
Spreading more shade; the Naiad 'mid her reeds<br/>
Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.<br/>
Along the margin sand large footmarks went<br/>
No farther than to where old Saturn's feet<br/>
Had rested, and there slept, how long a sleep!<br/>
Degraded, cold, upon the sodden ground<br/>
His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,<br/>
Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were clos'd,<br/>
While his bow'd head seem'd listening to the Earth,<br/>
His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;<br/>
But there came one who with a kindred hand<br/>
Touch'd his wide shoulders after bending low<br/>
With reverence, though to one who knew it not.<br/>
Then came the griev'd voice of Mnemosyne,<br/>
And griev'd I hearken'd. 'That divinity<br/>
'Whom thou saw'st step from yon forlornest wood,<br/>
'And with slow pace approach our fallen King,<br/>
'Is Thea, softest natur'd of our brood.'<br/>
I mark'd the Goddess in fair statuary<br/>
Surpassing wan Moneta by the head,<br/>
And in her sorrow nearer woman's tears.<br/>
There was a listening fear in her regard,<br/>
As if calamity had but begun;<br/>
As if the vanward clouds of evil days<br/>
Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear<br/>
Was with its stored thunder labouring up.<br/>
One hand she press'd upon that aching spot<br/>
Where beats the human heart, as if just there,<br/>
Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain;<br/>
The other upon Saturn's bended neck<br/>
She laid, and to the level of his hollow ear<br/>
Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake<br/>
In solemn tenor and deep organ tune;<br/>
Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue<br/>
Would come in this like accenting; how frail<br/>
To that large utterance of the early Gods!<br/>
'Saturn! look up and for what, poor lost King?<br/>
'I have no comfort for thee; no not one;<br/>
'I cannot cry, Wherefore thus sleepest thou?<br/>
'For Heaven is parted from thee, and the Earth<br/>
'Knows thee not, so afflicted, for a God;<br/>
'And Ocean too, with all its solemn noise,<br/>
'Has from thy sceptre pass'd, and all the air<br/>
'Is emptied of thine hoary majesty:<br/>
'Thy thunder, captious at the new command,<br/>
'Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;<br/>
'And thy sharp lightning, in unpracticed hands,<br/>
'Scorches and burns our once serene domain.<br/>
'With such remorseless speed still come new woes,<br/>
'That unbelief has not a space to breathe.<br/>
'Saturn! sleep on: Me thoughtless, why should I<br/>
'Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?<br/>
'Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?<br/>
'Saturn, sleep on, while at thy feet I weep.'<br/>
</p>
<p>
As when upon a tranced summer night<br/>
Forests, branch charmed by the earnest stars,<br/>
Dream, and so dream all night without a noise,<br/>
Save from one gradual solitary gust,<br/>
Swelling upon the silence; dying off;<br/>
As if the ebbing air had but one wave;<br/>
So came these words, and went; the while in tears<br/>
She press'd her fair large forehead to the earth,<br/>
Just where her fallen hair might spread in curls<br/>
A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.<br/>
Long, long those two were postured motionless,<br/>
Like sculpture builded up upon the grave<br/>
Of their own power. A long awful time<br/>
I look'd upon them: still they were the same;<br/>
The frozen God still bending to the earth,<br/>
And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet,<br/>
Moneta silent. Without stay or prop<br/>
But my own weak mortality, I bore<br/>
The load of this eternal quietude,<br/>
The unchanging gloom, and the three fixed shapes<br/>
Ponderous upon my senses, a whole moon.<br/>
For by my burning brain I measured sure<br/>
Her silver seasons shedded on the night,<br/>
And ever day by day methought I grew<br/>
More gaunt and ghostly. Oftentimes I pray'd<br/>
Intense, that Death would take me from the vale<br/>
And all its burthens gasping with despair<br/>
Of change, hour after hour I curs'd myself;<br/>
Until old Saturn rais'd his faded eyes,<br/>
And look'd around and saw his kingdom gone,<br/>
And all the gloom and sorrow of the place,<br/>
And that fair kneeling Goddess at his feet.<br/>
As the moist scent of flowers, and grass, and leaves<br/>
Fills forest dells with a pervading air,<br/>
Known to the woodland nostril, so the words<br/>
Of Saturn fill'd the mossy glooms around,<br/>
Even to the hollows of time eaten oaks<br/>
And to the windings of the foxes' hole,<br/>
With sad low tones, while thus he spake, and sent<br/>
Strange musings to the solitary Pan.<br/>
'Moan, brethren, moan; for we are swallow'd up<br/>
'And buried from all Godlike exercise<br/>
'Of influence benign on planets pale,<br/>
'And peaceful sway above man's harvesting,<br/>
'And all those acts which Deity supreme<br/>
'Doth ease its heart of love in. Moan and wail,<br/>
'Moan, brethren, moan; for lo, the rebel spheres<br/>
'Spin round, the stars their ancient courses keep,<br/>
'Clouds still with shadowy moisture haunt the earth,<br/>
'Still suck their fill of light from sun and moon,<br/>
'Still buds the tree, and still the sea shores murmur;<br/>
'There is no death in all the Universe,<br/>
'No smell of death there shall be death Moan, moan,<br/>
'Moan, Cybele, moan; for thy pernicious babes<br/>
'Have changed a God into a shaking Palsy.<br/>
'Moan, brethren, moan, for I have no strength left,<br/>
'Weak as the reed weak feeble as my voice<br/>
'O, O, the pain, the pain of feebleness.<br/>
'Moan, moan, for still I thaw or give me help;<br/>
'Throw down those imps, and give me victory.<br/>
'Let me hear other groans, and trumpets blown<br/>
'Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival<br/>
'From the gold peaks of Heaven's high piled clouds;<br/>
'Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir<br/>
'Of strings in hollow shells; and let there be<br/>
'Beautiful things made new, for the surprise<br/>
'Of the sky children.' So he feebly ceas'd,<br/>
With such a poor and sickly sounding pause,<br/>
Methought I heard some old man of the earth<br/>
Bewailing earthly loss; nor could my eyes<br/>
And ears act with that pleasant unison of sense<br/>
Which marries sweet sound with the grace of form,<br/>
And dolorous accent from a tragic harp<br/>
With large limb'd visions. More I scrutinized:<br/>
Still fix'd he sat beneath the sable trees,<br/>
Whose arms spread straggling in wild serpent forms,<br/>
With leaves all hush'd; his awful presence there<br/>
(Now all was silent) gave a deadly lie<br/>
To what I erewhile heard only his lips<br/>
Trembled amid the white curls of his beard.<br/>
They told the truth, though, round, the snowy locks<br/>
Hung nobly, as upon the face of heaven<br/>
A mid day fleece of clouds. Thea arose,<br/>
And stretched her white arm through the hollow dark,<br/>
Pointing some whither: whereat he too rose<br/>
Like a vast giant, seen by men at sea<br/>
To grow pale from the waves at dull midnight.<br/>
They melted from my sight into the woods;<br/>
Ere I could turn, Moneta cried, 'These twain<br/>
'Are speeding to the families of grief,<br/>
'Where roof'd in by black rocks they waste, in pain<br/>
'And darkness, for no hope.' And she spake on,<br/>
As ye may read who can unwearied pass<br/>
Onward from the antechamber of this dream,<br/>
Where even at the open doors awhile<br/>
I must delay, and glean my memory<br/>
Of her high phrase: perhaps no further dare.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Canto II</h2>
<p>
'Mortal, that thou may'st understand aright,<br/>
'I humanize my sayings to thine ear,<br/>
'Making comparisons of earthly things;<br/>
'Or thou might'st better listen to the wind,<br/>
'Whose language is to thee a barren noise,<br/>
'Though it blows legend laden through the trees.<br/>
'In melancholy realms big tears are shed,<br/>
'More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,<br/>
'Too huge for mortal tongue, or pen of scribe.<br/>
'The Titans fierce, self hid or prison bound,<br/>
'Groan for the old allegiance once more,<br/>
'Listening in their doom for Saturn's voice.<br/>
'But one of our whole eagle brood still keeps<br/>
'His sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;<br/>
'Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire<br/>
'Still sits, still snuffs the incense teeming up<br/>
'From man to the sun's God: yet unsecure,<br/>
'For as upon the earth dire prodigies<br/>
'Fright and perplex, so also shudders he:<br/>
'Nor at dog's howl or gloom bird's Even screech,<br/>
'Or the familiar visitings of one<br/>
'Upon the first toll of his passing bell:<br/>
'But horrors, portioned to a giant nerve,<br/>
'Make great Hyperion ache. His palace bright,<br/>
'Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,<br/>
'And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,<br/>
'Glares a blood red through all the thousand courts,<br/>
'Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries:<br/>
'And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds<br/>
'Flush angerly; when he would taste the wreaths<br/>
'Of incense breath'd aloft from sacred hills,<br/>
'Instead of sweets his ample palate takes<br/>
'Savour of poisonous brass and metals sick.<br/>
'Wherefore when harbour'd in the sleepy West,<br/>
'After the full completion of fair day,<br/>
'For rest divine upon exalted couch<br/>
'And slumber in the arms of melody,<br/>
'He paces through the pleasant hours of ease<br/>
'With strides colossal, on from hall to hall;<br/>
'While far within each aisle and deep recess<br/>
'His winged minions in close clusters stand<br/>
'Amaz'd, and full of fear; like anxious men,<br/>
'Who on a wide plain gather in sad troops,<br/>
'When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.<br/>
'Even now, while Saturn, roused from icy trance,<br/>
'Goes step for step with Thea from yon woods,<br/>
'Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,<br/>
'Is sloping to the threshold of the West.<br/>
'Thither we tend.' Now in clear light I stood,<br/>
Reliev'd from the dusk vale. Mnemosyne<br/>
Was sitting on a square edg'd polish'd stone,<br/>
That in its lucid depth reflected pure<br/>
Her priestess garments. My quick eyes ran on<br/>
From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,<br/>
Through bow'rs of fragrant and enwreathed light<br/>
And diamond paved lustrous long arcades.<br/>
Anon rush'd by the bright Hyperion;<br/>
His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,<br/>
And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,<br/>
That scared away the meek ethereal hours<br/>

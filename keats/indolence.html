<h1>Ode on Indolence</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<blockquote>"They toil not, neither do they spin."</blockquote>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
One morn before me were three figures seen,<br/>
With bowed necks, and joined hands, side-faced;<br/>
And one behind the other stepp'd serene,<br/>
In placid sandals, and in white robes graced;<br/>
They pass'd, like figures on a marble urn,<br/>
When shifted round to see the other side;<br/>
They came again; as when the urn once more<br/>
Is shifted round, the first seen shades return;<br/>
And they were strange to me, as may betide<br/>
With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore.<br/>
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
How is it, Shadows! that I knew ye not?<br/>
How came ye muffled in so hush a mask?<br/>
Was it a silent deep-disguised plot<br/>
To steal away, and leave without a task<br/>
My idle days? Ripe was the drowsy hour;<br/>
The blissful cloud of summer-indolence<br/>
Benumb'd my eyes; my pulse grew less and less;<br/>
Pain had no sting, and pleasure's wreath no flower:<br/>
O, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense<br/>
Unhaunted quite of all but &mdash; nothingness?<br/>
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
A third time pass'd they by, and passing, turn'd<br/>
Each one the face a moment whiles to me;<br/>
Then faded, and to follow them I burn'd<br/>
And ach'd for wings because I knew the three;<br/>
The first was a fair Maid, and Love her name;<br/>
The second was Ambition, pale of Cheek,<br/>
And ever watchful with fatigued eye;<br/>
The last, whom I love more, the more of blame<br/>
Is heap'd upon her, maiden most unmeek, &mdash;<br/>
I knew to be my demon Poesy.<br/>
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
They faded, and, forsooth! I wanted wings:<br/>
O folly! What is love! and where is it?<br/>
And for that poor Ambition! it springs<br/>
From a man's little heart's short fever-fit;<br/>
For Poesy! &mdash; no, &mdash; she has not a joy, &mdash;<br/>
At least for me, &mdash; so sweet as drowsy noons,<br/>
And evenings steep'd in honied indolence;<br/>
O, for an age so shelter'd from annoy,<br/>
That I may never know how change the moons,<br/>
Or hear the voice of busy common-sense!<br/>
</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>
And once more came they by; &mdash; alas! wherefore?<br/>
My sleep had been embroider'd with dim dreams;<br/>
My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o'er<br/>
With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams:<br/>
The morn was clouded, but no shower fell,<br/>
Tho' in her lids hung the sweet tears of May;<br/>
The open casement press'd a new-leav'd vine,<br/>
Let in the budding warmth and throstle's lay;<br/>
O Shadows! 'twas a time to bid farewell!<br/>
Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine.<br/>
</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p>
So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise<br/>
My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass;<br/>
For I would not be dieted with praise,<br/>
A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce!<br/>
Fade softly from my eyes, and be once more<br/>
In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn;<br/>
Farewell! I yet have visions for the night,<br/>
And for the day faint visions there is store;<br/>
Vanish, ye Phantoms! from my idle spright,<br/>
Into the clouds, and never more return!<br/>

<h1>Hyperion</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<h2>Book II</h2>
<p>
Just at the self-same beat of Time's wide wings<br/>
Hyperion slid into the rustled air,<br/>
And Saturn gain'd with Thea that sad place<br/>
Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn'd.<br/>
It was a den where no insulting light<br/>
Could glimmer on their tears; where their own groans<br/>
They felt, but heard not, for the solid roar<br/>
Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,<br/>
Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.<br/>
Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd<br/>
Ever as if just rising from a sleep,<br/>
Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;<br/>
And thus in thousand hugest phantasies<br/>
Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.<br/>
Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,<br/>
Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge<br/>
Stubborn'd with iron. All were not assembled:<br/>
Some chain'd in torture, and some wandering.<br/>
Cœus, and Gyges, and Briareüs,<br/>
Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,<br/>
With many more, the brawniest in assault,<br/>
Were pent in regions of laborious breath;<br/>
Dungeon'd in opaque element, to keep<br/>
Their clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs<br/>
Lock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;<br/>
Without a motion, save of their big hearts<br/>
Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd<br/>
With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.<br/>
Mnemosyne was straying in the world;<br/>
Far from her moon had Phœbe wandered;<br/>
And many else were free to roam abroad,<br/>
But for the main, here found they covert drear.<br/>
Scarce images of life, one here, one there,<br/>
Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque<br/>
Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,<br/>
When the chill rain begins at shut of eve,<br/>
In dull November, and their chancel vault,<br/>
The Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.<br/>
Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave<br/>
Or word, or look, or action of despair.<br/>
Creüs was one; his ponderous iron mace<br/>
Lay by him, and a shatter'd rib of rock<br/>
Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.<br/>
Iäpetus another; in his grasp,<br/>
A serpent's plashy neck; its barbed tongue<br/>
Squeez'd from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length<br/>
Dead; and because the creature could not spit<br/>
Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.<br/>
Next Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,<br/>
As though in pain; for still upon the flint<br/>
He ground severe his skull, with open mouth<br/>
And eyes at horrid working. Nearest him<br/>
Asia, born of most enormous Caf,<br/>
Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,<br/>
Though feminine, than any of her sons:<br/>
More thought than woe was in her dusky face,<br/>
For she was prophesying of her glory;<br/>
And in her wide imagination stood<br/>
Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes,<br/>
By Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles.<br/>
Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,<br/>
So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk<br/>
Shed from the broadest of her elephants.<br/>
Above her, on a crag's uneasy shelve,<br/>
Upon his elbow rais'd, all prostrate else,<br/>
Shadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild<br/>
As grazing ox unworried in the meads;<br/>
Now tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth,<br/>
He meditated, plotted, and even now<br/>
Was hurling mountains in that second war,<br/>
Not long delay'd, that scar'd the younger Gods<br/>
To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.<br/>
Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone<br/>
Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbour'd close<br/>
Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap<br/>
Sobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair.<br/>
In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet<br/>
Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight;<br/>
No shape distinguishable, more than when<br/>
Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:<br/>
And many else whose names may not be told.<br/>
For when the Muse's wings are air-ward spread,<br/>
Who shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt<br/>
Of Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb'd<br/>
With damp and slippery footing from a depth<br/>
More horrid still. Above a sombre cliff<br/>
Their heads appear'd, and up their stature grew<br/>
Till on the level height their steps found ease:<br/>
Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms<br/>
Upon the precincts of this nest of pain,<br/>
And sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn's face:<br/>
There saw she direst strife; the supreme God<br/>
At war with all the frailty of grief,<br/>
Of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,<br/>
Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.<br/>
Against these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate<br/>
Had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head,<br/>
A disanointing poison: so that Thea,<br/>
Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass<br/>
First onwards in, among the fallen tribe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As with us mortal men, the laden heart<br/>
Is persecuted more, and fever'd more,<br/>
When it is nighing to the mournful house<br/>
Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise;<br/>
So Saturn, as he walk'd into the midst,<br/>
Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,<br/>
But that he met Enceladus's eye,<br/>
Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once<br/>
Came like an inspiration; and he shouted,<br/>
"Titans, behold your God!" at which some groan'd;<br/>
Some started on their feet; some also shouted;<br/>
Some wept, some wail'd, all bow'd with reverence;<br/>
And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,<br/>
Show'd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,<br/>
Her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.<br/>
There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines<br/>
When Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise<br/>
Among immortals when a God gives sign,<br/>
With hushing finger, how he means to load<br/>
His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought,<br/>
With thunder, and with music, and with pomp:<br/>
Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;<br/>
Which, when it ceases in this mountain'd world,<br/>
No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,<br/>
Among these fallen, Saturn's voice therefrom<br/>
Grew up like organ, that begins anew<br/>
Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,<br/>
Leave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly.<br/>
Thus grew it up&mdash;"Not in my own sad breast,<br/>
Which is its own great judge and searcher out,<br/>
Can I find reason why ye should be thus:<br/>
Not in the legends of the first of days,<br/>
Studied from that old spirit-leaved book<br/>
Which starry Uranus with finger bright<br/>
Sav'd from the shores of darkness, when the waves<br/>
Low-ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom;&mdash;<br/>
And the which book ye know I ever kept<br/>
For my firm-based footstool:&mdash;Ah, infirm!<br/>
Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent<br/>
Of element, earth, water, air, and fire,&mdash;<br/>
At war, at peace, or inter-quarreling<br/>
One against one, or two, or three, or all<br/>
Each several one against the other three,<br/>
As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods<br/>
Drown both, and press them both against earth's face,<br/>
Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath<br/>
Unhinges the poor world;&mdash;not in that strife,<br/>
Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,<br/>
Can I find reason why ye should be thus:<br/>
No, no-where can unriddle, though I search,<br/>
And pore on Nature's universal scroll<br/>
Even to swooning, why ye, Divinities,<br/>
The first-born of all shap'd and palpable Gods,<br/>
Should cower beneath what, in comparison,<br/>
Is untremendous might. Yet ye are here,<br/>
O'erwhelm'd, and spurn'd, and batter'd, ye are here!<br/>
O Titans, shall I say 'Arise!'&mdash;Ye groan:<br/>
Shall I say 'Crouch!'&mdash;Ye groan. What can I then?<br/>
O Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!<br/>
What can I? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods,<br/>
How we can war, how engine our great wrath!<br/>
O speak your counsel now, for Saturn's ear<br/>
Is all a-hunger'd. Thou, Oceanus,<br/>
Ponderest high and deep; and in thy face<br/>
I see, astonied, that severe content<br/>
Which comes of thought and musing: give us help!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So ended Saturn; and the God of the Sea,<br/>
Sophist and sage, from no Athenian grove,<br/>
But cogitation in his watery shades,<br/>
Arose, with locks not oozy, and began,<br/>
In murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue<br/>
Caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands.<br/>
"O ye, whom wrath consumes! who, passion-stung,<br/>
Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!<br/>
Shut up your senses, stifle up your ears,<br/>
My voice is not a bellows unto ire.<br/>
Yet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof<br/>
How ye, perforce, must be content to stoop:<br/>
And in the proof much comfort will I give,<br/>
If ye will take that comfort in its truth.<br/>
We fall by course of Nature's law, not force<br/>
Of thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou<br/>
Hast sifted well the atom-universe;<br/>
But for this reason, that thou art the King,<br/>
And only blind from sheer supremacy,<br/>
One avenue was shaded from thine eyes,<br/>
Through which I wandered to eternal truth.<br/>
And first, as thou wast not the first of powers,<br/>
So art thou not the last; it cannot be:<br/>
Thou art not the beginning nor the end.<br/>
From chaos and parental darkness came<br/>
Light, the first fruits of that intestine broil,<br/>
That sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends<br/>
Was ripening in itself. The ripe hour came,<br/>
And with it light, and light, engendering<br/>
Upon its own producer, forthwith touch'd<br/>
The whole enormous matter into life.<br/>
Upon that very hour, our parentage,<br/>
The Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:<br/>
Then thou first-born, and we the giant-race,<br/>
Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.<br/>
Now comes the pain of truth, to whom 'tis pain;<br/>
O folly! for to bear all naked truths,<br/>
And to envisage circumstance, all calm,<br/>
That is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!<br/>
As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far<br/>
Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;<br/>
And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth<br/>
In form and shape compact and beautiful,<br/>
In will, in action free, companionship,<br/>
And thousand other signs of purer life;<br/>
So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,<br/>
A power more strong in beauty, born of us<br/>
And fated to excel us, as we pass<br/>
In glory that old Darkness: nor are we<br/>
Thereby more conquer'd, than by us the rule<br/>
Of shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil<br/>
Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,<br/>
And feedeth still, more comely than itself?<br/>
Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves?<br/>
Or shall the tree be envious of the dove<br/>
Because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings<br/>
To wander wherewithal and find its joys?<br/>
We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs<br/>
Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves,<br/>
But eagles golden-feather'd, who do tower<br/>
Above us in their beauty, and must reign<br/>
In right thereof; for 'tis the eternal law<br/>
That first in beauty should be first in might:<br/>
Yea, by that law, another race may drive<br/>
Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.<br/>
Have ye beheld the young God of the Seas,<br/>
My dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?<br/>
Have ye beheld his chariot, foam'd along<br/>
By noble winged creatures he hath made?<br/>
I saw him on the calmed waters scud,<br/>
With such a glow of beauty in his eyes,<br/>
That it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell<br/>
To all my empire: farewell sad I took,<br/>
And hither came, to see how dolorous fate<br/>
Had wrought upon ye; and how I might best<br/>
Give consolation in this woe extreme.<br/>
Receive the truth, and let it be your balm."<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether through poz'd conviction, or disdain,<br/>
They guarded silence, when Oceanus<br/>
Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?<br/>
But so it was, none answer'd for a space,<br/>
Save one whom none regarded, Clymene;<br/>
And yet she answer'd not, only complain'd,<br/>
With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,<br/>
Thus wording timidly among the fierce:<br/>
"O Father, I am here the simplest voice,<br/>
And all my knowledge is that joy is gone,<br/>
And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,<br/>
There to remain for ever, as I fear:<br/>
I would not bode of evil, if I thought<br/>
So weak a creature could turn off the help<br/>
Which by just right should come of mighty Gods;<br/>
Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell<br/>
Of what I heard, and how it made me weep,<br/>
And know that we had parted from all hope.<br/>
I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,<br/>
Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land<br/>
Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.<br/>
Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;<br/>
Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth;<br/>
So that I felt a movement in my heart<br/>
To chide, and to reproach that solitude<br/>
With songs of misery, music of our woes;<br/>
And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell<br/>
And murmur'd into it, and made melody&mdash;<br/>
O melody no more! for while I sang,<br/>
And with poor skill let pass into the breeze<br/>
The dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand<br/>
Just opposite, an island of the sea,<br/>
There came enchantment with the shifting wind,<br/>
That did both drown and keep alive my ears.<br/>
I threw my shell away upon the sand,<br/>
And a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill'd<br/>
With that new blissful golden melody.<br/>
A living death was in each gush of sounds,<br/>
Each family of rapturous hurried notes,<br/>
That fell, one after one, yet all at once,<br/>
Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:<br/>
And then another, then another strain,<br/>
Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,<br/>
With music wing'd instead of silent plumes,<br/>
To hover round my head, and make me sick<br/>
Of joy and grief at once. Grief overcame,<br/>
And I was stopping up my frantic ears,<br/>
When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,<br/>
A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,<br/>
And still it cried, 'Apollo! young Apollo!<br/>
The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!'<br/>
I fled, it follow'd me, and cried 'Apollo!'<br/>
O Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt<br/>
Those pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt,<br/>
Ye would not call this too indulged tongue<br/>
Presumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard."<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So far her voice flow'd on, like timorous brook<br/>
That, lingering along a pebbled coast,<br/>
Doth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met,<br/>
And shudder'd; for the overwhelming voice<br/>
Of huge Enceladus swallow'd it in wrath:<br/>
The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves<br/>
In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,<br/>
Came booming thus, while still upon his arm<br/>
He lean'd; not rising, from supreme contempt.<br/>
"Or shall we listen to the over-wise,<br/>
Or to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods?<br/>
Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all<br/>
That rebel Jove's whole armoury were spent,<br/>
Not world on world upon these shoulders piled,<br/>
Could agonize me more than baby-words<br/>
In midst of this dethronement horrible.<br/>
Speak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.<br/>
Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?<br/>
Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm?<br/>
Dost thou forget, sham Monarch of the Waves,<br/>
Thy scalding in the seas? What, have I rous'd<br/>
Your spleens with so few simple words as these?<br/>
O joy! for now I see ye are not lost:<br/>
O joy! for now I see a thousand eyes<br/>
Wide glaring for revenge!"&mdash;As this he said,<br/>
He lifted up his stature vast, and stood,<br/>
Still without intermission speaking thus:<br/>
"Now ye are flames, I'll tell you how to burn,<br/>
And purge the ether of our enemies;<br/>
How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,<br/>
And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove,<br/>
Stifling that puny essence in its tent.<br/>
O let him feel the evil he hath done;<br/>
For though I scorn Oceanus's lore,<br/>
Much pain have I for more than loss of realms:<br/>
The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled;<br/>
Those days, all innocent of scathing war,<br/>
When all the fair Existences of heaven<br/>
Came open-eyed to guess what we would speak:&mdash;<br/>
That was before our brows were taught to frown,<br/>
Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds;<br/>
That was before we knew the winged thing,<br/>
Victory, might be lost, or might be won.<br/>
And be ye mindful that Hyperion,<br/>
Our brightest brother, still is undisgraced&mdash;<br/>
Hyperion, lo! his radiance is here!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes were on Enceladus's face,<br/>
And they beheld, while still Hyperion's name<br/>
Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,<br/>
A pallid gleam across his features stern:<br/>
Not savage, for he saw full many a God<br/>
Wroth as himself. He look'd upon them all,<br/>
And in each face he saw a gleam of light,<br/>
But splendider in Saturn's, whose hoar locks<br/>
Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel<br/>
When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.<br/>
In pale and silver silence they remain'd,<br/>
Till suddenly a splendour, like the morn,<br/>
Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps,<br/>
All the sad spaces of oblivion,<br/>
And every gulf, and every chasm old,<br/>
And every height, and every sullen depth,<br/>
Voiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams:<br/>
And all the everlasting cataracts,<br/>
And all the headlong torrents far and near,<br/>
Mantled before in darkness and huge shade,<br/>
Now saw the light and made it terrible.<br/>
It was Hyperion:&mdash;a granite peak<br/>
His bright feet touch'd, and there he stay'd to view<br/>
The misery his brilliance had betray'd<br/>
To the most hateful seeing of itself.<br/>
Golden his hair of short Numidian curl,<br/>
Regal his shape majestic, a vast shade<br/>
In midst of his own brightness, like the bulk<br/>
Of Memnon's image at the set of sun<br/>
To one who travels from the dusking East:<br/>
Sighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon's harp<br/>
He utter'd, while his hands contemplative<br/>
He press'd together, and in silence stood.<br/>
Despondence seiz'd again the fallen Gods<br/>
At sight of the dejected King of Day,<br/>
And many hid their faces from the light:<br/>
But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes<br/>
Among the brotherhood; and, at their glare,<br/>
Uprose Iäpetus, and Creüs too,<br/>
And Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode<br/>
To where he towered on his eminence.<br/>
There those four shouted forth old Saturn's name;<br/>
Hyperion from the peak loud answered, "Saturn!"<br/>
Saturn sat near the Mother of the Gods,<br/>
In whose face was no joy, though all the Gods<br/>
Gave from their hollow throats the name of "Saturn!"<br/>

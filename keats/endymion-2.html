<h1>Endymion</h1>
<h2>by John Keats</h2>
<h2>Book II</h2>
<p>
O sovereign power of love! O grief! O balm!<br/>
All records, saving thine, come cool, and calm,<br/>
And shadowy, through the mist of passed years:<br/>
For others, good or bad, hatred and tears<br/>
Have become indolent; but touching thine,<br/>
One sigh doth echo, one poor sob doth pine,<br/>
One kiss brings honey-dew from buried days.<br/>
The woes of Troy, towers smothering o'er their blaze,<br/>
Stiff-holden shields, far-piercing spears, keen blades,<br/>
Struggling, and blood, and shrieks&mdash;all dimly fades<br/>
Into some backward corner of the brain;<br/>
Yet, in our very souls, we feel amain<br/>
The close of Troilus and Cressid sweet.<br/>
Hence, pageant history! hence, gilded cheat!<br/>
Swart planet in the universe of deeds!<br/>
Wide sea, that one continuous murmur breeds<br/>
Along the pebbled shore of memory!<br/>
Many old rotten-timber'd boats there be<br/>
Upon thy vaporous bosom, magnified<br/>
To goodly vessels; many a sail of pride,<br/>
And golden keel'd, is left unlaunch'd and dry.<br/>
But wherefore this? What care, though owl did fly<br/>
About the great Athenian admiral's mast?<br/>
What care, though striding Alexander past<br/>
The Indus with his Macedonian numbers?<br/>
Though old Ulysses tortured from his slumbers<br/>
The glutted Cyclops, what care?&mdash;Juliet leaning<br/>
Amid her window-flowers,&mdash;sighing,&mdash;weaning<br/>
Tenderly her fancy from its maiden snow,<br/>
Doth more avail than these: the silver flow<br/>
Of Hero's tears, the swoon of Imogen,<br/>
Fair Pastorella in the bandit's den,<br/>
Are things to brood on with more ardency<br/>
Than the death-day of empires. Fearfully<br/>
Must such conviction come upon his head,<br/>
Who, thus far, discontent, has dared to tread,<br/>
Without one muse's smile, or kind behest,<br/>
The path of love and poesy. But rest,<br/>
In chaffing restlessness, is yet more drear<br/>
Than to be crush'd, in striving to uprear<br/>
Love's standard on the battlements of song.<br/>
So once more days and nights aid me along,<br/>
Like legion'd soldiers.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brain-sick shepherd prince,<br/>
What promise hast thou faithful guarded since<br/>
The day of sacrifice? Or, have new sorrows<br/>
Come with the constant dawn upon thy morrows?<br/>
Alas! 'tis his old grief. For many days,<br/>
Has he been wandering in uncertain ways:<br/>
Through wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;<br/>
Counting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes<br/>
Of the lone woodcutter; and listening still,<br/>
Hour after hour, to each lush-leav'd rill.<br/>
Now he is sitting by a shady spring,<br/>
And elbow-deep with feverous fingering<br/>
Stems the upbursting cold: a wild rose tree<br/>
Pavilions him in bloom, and he doth see<br/>
A bud which snares his fancy: lo! but now<br/>
He plucks it, dips its stalk in the water: how!<br/>
It swells, it buds, it flowers beneath his sight;<br/>
And, in the middle, there is softly pight<br/>
A golden butterfly; upon whose wings<br/>
There must be surely character'd strange things,<br/>
For with wide eye he wonders, and smiles oft.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Lightly this little herald flew aloft,<br/>
Follow'd by glad Endymion's clasped hands:<br/>
Onward it flies. From languor's sullen bands<br/>
His limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies<br/>
Dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies.<br/>
It seem'd he flew, the way so easy was;<br/>
And like a new-born spirit did he pass<br/>
Through the green evening quiet in the sun,<br/>
O'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,<br/>
Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams<br/>
The summer time away. One track unseams<br/>
A wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue<br/>
Of ocean fades upon him; then, anew,<br/>
He sinks adown a solitary glen,<br/>
Where there was never sound of mortal men,<br/>
Saving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences<br/>
Melting to silence, when upon the breeze<br/>
Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,<br/>
To cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet<br/>
Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide,<br/>
Until it reached a splashing fountain's side<br/>
That, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd<br/>
Unto the temperate air: then high it soar'd,<br/>
And, downward, suddenly began to dip,<br/>
As if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip<br/>
The crystal spout-head: so it did, with touch<br/>
Most delicate, as though afraid to smutch<br/>
Even with mealy gold the waters clear.<br/>
But, at that very touch, to disappear<br/>
So fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,<br/>
Endymion sought around, and shook each bed<br/>
Of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung<br/>
Himself along the grass. What gentle tongue,<br/>
What whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest?<br/>
It was a nymph uprisen to the breast<br/>
In the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood<br/>
'Mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood.<br/>
To him her dripping hand she softly kist,<br/>
And anxiously began to plait and twist<br/>
Her ringlets round her fingers, saying: "Youth!<br/>
Too long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth,<br/>
The bitterness of love: too long indeed,<br/>
Seeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed<br/>
Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer<br/>
All the bright riches of my crystal coffer<br/>
To Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,<br/>
Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,<br/>
Vermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze;<br/>
Yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws<br/>
A virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands<br/>
Tawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands<br/>
By my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,<br/>
My charming rod, my potent river spells;<br/>
Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup<br/>
Meander gave me,&mdash;for I bubbled up<br/>
To fainting creatures in a desert wild.<br/>
But woe is me, I am but as a child<br/>
To gladden thee; and all I dare to say,<br/>
Is, that I pity thee; that on this day<br/>
I've been thy guide; that thou must wander far<br/>
In other regions, past the scanty bar<br/>
To mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en<br/>
From every wasting sigh, from every pain,<br/>
Into the gentle bosom of thy love.<br/>
Why it is thus, one knows in heaven above:<br/>
But, a poor Naiad, I guess not. Farewel!<br/>
I have a ditty for my hollow cell."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hereat, she vanished from Endymion's gaze,<br/>
Who brooded o'er the water in amaze:<br/>
The dashing fount pour'd on, and where its pool<br/>
Lay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,<br/>
Quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,<br/>
And fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill<br/>
Had fallen out that hour. The wanderer,<br/>
Holding his forehead, to keep off the burr<br/>
Of smothering fancies, patiently sat down;<br/>
And, while beneath the evening's sleepy frown<br/>
Glow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,<br/>
Thus breath'd he to himself: "Whoso encamps<br/>
To take a fancied city of delight,<br/>
O what a wretch is he! and when 'tis his,<br/>
After long toil and travelling, to miss<br/>
The kernel of his hopes, how more than vile:<br/>
Yet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;<br/>
Another city doth he set about,<br/>
Free from the smallest pebble-head of doubt<br/>
That he will seize on trickling honey-combs:<br/>
Alas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,<br/>
And onward to another city speeds.<br/>
But this is human life: the war, the deeds,<br/>
The disappointment, the anxiety,<br/>
Imagination's struggles, far and nigh,<br/>
All human; bearing in themselves this good,<br/>
That they are still the air, the subtle food,<br/>
To make us feel existence, and to shew<br/>
How quiet death is. Where soil is men grow,<br/>
Whether to weeds or flowers; but for me,<br/>
There is no depth to strike in: I can see<br/>
Nought earthly worth my compassing; so stand<br/>
Upon a misty, jutting head of land&mdash;<br/>
Alone? No, no; and by the Orphean lute,<br/>
When mad Eurydice is listening to't;<br/>
I'd rather stand upon this misty peak,<br/>
With not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,<br/>
But the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,<br/>
Than be&mdash;I care not what. O meekest dove<br/>
Of heaven! O Cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!<br/>
From thy blue throne, now filling all the air,<br/>
Glance but one little beam of temper'd light<br/>
Into my bosom, that the dreadful might<br/>
And tyranny of love be somewhat scar'd!<br/>
Yet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar'd,<br/>
Would give a pang to jealous misery,<br/>
Worse than the torment's self: but rather tie<br/>
Large wings upon my shoulders, and point out<br/>
My love's far dwelling. Though the playful rout<br/>
Of Cupids shun thee, too divine art thou,<br/>
Too keen in beauty, for thy silver prow<br/>
Not to have dipp'd in love's most gentle stream.<br/>
O be propitious, nor severely deem<br/>
My madness impious; for, by all the stars<br/>
That tend thy bidding, I do think the bars<br/>
That kept my spirit in are burst&mdash;that I<br/>
Am sailing with thee through the dizzy sky!<br/>
How beautiful thou art! The world how deep!<br/>
How tremulous-dazzlingly the wheels sweep<br/>
Around their axle! Then these gleaming reins,<br/>
How lithe! When this thy chariot attains<br/>
Its airy goal, haply some bower veils<br/>
Those twilight eyes?&mdash;Those eyes!&mdash;my spirit fails&mdash;<br/>
Dear goddess, help! or the wide-gaping air<br/>
Will gulph me&mdash;help!"&mdash;At this with madden'd stare,<br/>
And lifted hands, and trembling lips he stood;<br/>
Like old Deucalion mountain'd o'er the flood,<br/>
Or blind Orion hungry for the morn.<br/>
And, but from the deep cavern there was borne<br/>
A voice, he had been froze to senseless stone;<br/>
Nor sigh of his, nor plaint, nor passion'd moan<br/>
Had more been heard. Thus swell'd it forth: "Descend,<br/>
Young mountaineer! descend where alleys bend<br/>
Into the sparry hollows of the world!<br/>
Oft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl'd<br/>
As from thy threshold; day by day hast been<br/>
A little lower than the chilly sheen<br/>
Of icy pinnacles, and dipp'dst thine arms<br/>
Into the deadening ether that still charms<br/>
Their marble being: now, as deep profound<br/>
As those are high, descend! He ne'er is crown'd<br/>
With immortality, who fears to follow<br/>
Where airy voices lead: so through the hollow,<br/>
The silent mysteries of earth, descend!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He heard but the last words, nor could contend<br/>
One moment in reflection: for he fled<br/>
Into the fearful deep, to hide his head<br/>
From the clear moon, the trees, and coming madness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Twas far too strange, and wonderful for sadness;<br/>
Sharpening, by degrees, his appetite<br/>
To dive into the deepest. Dark, nor light,<br/>
The region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly,<br/>
But mingled up; a gleaming melancholy;<br/>
A dusky empire and its diadems;<br/>
One faint eternal eventide of gems.<br/>
Aye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,<br/>
Along whose track the prince quick footsteps told,<br/>
With all its lines abrupt and angular:<br/>
Out-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,<br/>
Through a vast antre; then the metal woof,<br/>
Like Vulcan's rainbow, with some monstrous roof<br/>
Curves hugely: now, far in the deep abyss,<br/>
It seems an angry lightning, and doth hiss<br/>
Fancy into belief: anon it leads<br/>
Through winding passages, where sameness breeds<br/>
Vexing conceptions of some sudden change;<br/>
Whether to silver grots, or giant range<br/>
Of sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge<br/>
Athwart a flood of crystal. On a ridge<br/>
Now fareth he, that o'er the vast beneath<br/>
Towers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth<br/>
A hundred waterfalls, whose voices come<br/>
But as the murmuring surge. Chilly and numb<br/>
His bosom grew, when first he, far away,<br/>
Descried an orbed diamond, set to fray<br/>
Old darkness from his throne: 'twas like the sun<br/>
Uprisen o'er chaos: and with such a stun<br/>
Came the amazement, that, absorb'd in it,<br/>
He saw not fiercer wonders&mdash;past the wit<br/>
Of any spirit to tell, but one of those<br/>
Who, when this planet's sphering time doth close,<br/>
Will be its high remembrancers: who they?<br/>
The mighty ones who have made eternal day<br/>
For Greece and England. While astonishment<br/>
With deep-drawn sighs was quieting, he went<br/>
Into a marble gallery, passing through<br/>
A mimic temple, so complete and true<br/>
In sacred custom, that he well nigh fear'd<br/>
To search it inwards; whence far off appear'd,<br/>
Through a long pillar'd vista, a fair shrine,<br/>
And, just beyond, on light tiptoe divine,<br/>
A quiver'd Dian. Stepping awfully,<br/>
The youth approach'd; oft turning his veil'd eye<br/>
Down sidelong aisles, and into niches old.<br/>
And when, more near against the marble cold<br/>
He had touch'd his forehead, he began to thread<br/>
All courts and passages, where silence dead<br/>
Rous'd by his whispering footsteps murmured faint:<br/>
And long he travers'd to and fro, to acquaint<br/>
Himself with every mystery, and awe;<br/>
Till, weary, he sat down before the maw<br/>
Of a wide outlet, fathomless and dim<br/>
To wild uncertainty and shadows grim.<br/>
There, when new wonders ceas'd to float before,<br/>
And thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore<br/>
The journey homeward to habitual self!<br/>
A mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,<br/>
Whose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,<br/>
Cheats us into a swamp, into a fire,<br/>
Into the bosom of a hated thing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
What misery most drowningly doth sing<br/>
In lone Endymion's ear, now he has caught<br/>
The goal of consciousness? Ah, 'tis the thought,<br/>
The deadly feel of solitude: for lo!<br/>
He cannot see the heavens, nor the flow<br/>
Of rivers, nor hill-flowers running wild<br/>
In pink and purple chequer, nor, up-pil'd,<br/>
The cloudy rack slow journeying in the west,<br/>
Like herded elephants; nor felt, nor prest<br/>
Cool grass, nor tasted the fresh slumberous air;<br/>
But far from such companionship to wear<br/>
An unknown time, surcharg'd with grief, away,<br/>
Was now his lot. And must he patient stay,<br/>
Tracing fantastic figures with his spear?<br/>
"No!" exclaimed he, "why should I tarry here?"<br/>
No! loudly echoed times innumerable.<br/>
At which he straightway started, and 'gan tell<br/>
His paces back into the temple's chief;<br/>
Warming and growing strong in the belief<br/>
Of help from Dian: so that when again<br/>
He caught her airy form, thus did he plain,<br/>
Moving more near the while. "O Haunter chaste<br/>
Of river sides, and woods, and heathy waste,<br/>
Where with thy silver bow and arrows keen<br/>
Art thou now forested? O woodland Queen,<br/>
What smoothest air thy smoother forehead woos?<br/>
Where dost thou listen to the wide halloos<br/>
Of thy disparted nymphs? Through what dark tree<br/>
Glimmers thy crescent? Wheresoe'er it be,<br/>
'Tis in the breath of heaven: thou dost taste<br/>
Freedom as none can taste it, nor dost waste<br/>
Thy loveliness in dismal elements;<br/>
But, finding in our green earth sweet contents,<br/>
There livest blissfully. Ah, if to thee<br/>
It feels Elysian, how rich to me,<br/>
An exil'd mortal, sounds its pleasant name!<br/>
Within my breast there lives a choking flame&mdash;<br/>
O let me cool it among the zephyr-boughs!<br/>
A homeward fever parches up my tongue&mdash;<br/>
O let me slake it at the running springs!<br/>
Upon my car a noisy nothing rings&mdash;<br/>
O let me once more hear the linnet's note!<br/>
Before mine eyes thick films and shadows float&mdash;<br/>
O let me 'noint them with the heaven's light!<br/>
Dost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?<br/>
O think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!<br/>
Dost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?<br/>
O think how this dry palate would rejoice!<br/>
If in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,<br/>
O think how I should love a bed of flowers!&mdash;<br/>
Young goddess! let me see my native bowers!<br/>
Deliver me from this rapacious deep!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus ending loudly, as he would o'erleap<br/>
His destiny, alert he stood: but when<br/>
Obstinate silence came heavily again,<br/>
Feeling about for its old couch of space<br/>
And airy cradle, lowly bow'd his face<br/>
Desponding, o'er the marble floor's cold thrill.<br/>
But 'twas not long; for, sweeter than the rill<br/>
To its old channel, or a swollen tide<br/>
To margin sallows, were the leaves he spied,<br/>
And flowers, and wreaths, and ready myrtle crowns<br/>
Up heaping through the slab: refreshment drowns<br/>
Itself, and strives its own delights to hide&mdash;<br/>
Nor in one spot alone; the floral pride<br/>
In a long whispering birth enchanted grew<br/>
Before his footsteps; as when heav'd anew<br/>
Old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,<br/>
Down whose green back the short-liv'd foam, all hoar,<br/>
Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Increasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,<br/>
Upon his fairy journey on he hastes;<br/>
So anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes<br/>
One moment with his hand among the sweets:<br/>
Onward he goes&mdash;he stops&mdash;his bosom beats<br/>
As plainly in his ear, as the faint charm<br/>
Of which the throbs were born. This still alarm,<br/>
This sleepy music, forc'd him walk tiptoe:<br/>
For it came more softly than the east could blow<br/>
Arion's magic to the Atlantic isles;<br/>
Or than the west, made jealous by the smiles<br/>
Of thron'd Apollo, could breathe back the lyre<br/>
To seas Ionian and Tyrian.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O did he ever live, that lonely man,<br/>
Who lov'd&mdash;and music slew not? 'Tis the pest<br/>
Of love, that fairest joys give most unrest;<br/>
That things of delicate and tenderest worth<br/>
Are swallow'd all, and made a seared dearth,<br/>
By one consuming flame: it doth immerse<br/>
And suffocate true blessings in a curse.<br/>
Half-happy, by comparison of bliss,<br/>
Is miserable. 'Twas even so with this<br/>
Dew-dropping melody, in the Carian's ear;<br/>
First heaven, then hell, and then forgotten clear,<br/>
Vanish'd in elemental passion.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And down some swart abysm he had gone,<br/>
Had not a heavenly guide benignant led<br/>
To where thick myrtle branches, 'gainst his head<br/>
Brushing, awakened: then the sounds again<br/>
Went noiseless as a passing noontide rain<br/>
Over a bower, where little space he stood;<br/>
For as the sunset peeps into a wood<br/>
So saw he panting light, and towards it went<br/>
Through winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!<br/>
Upon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,<br/>
Cupids a slumbering on their pinions fair.<br/>
</p>
<p>
After a thousand mazes overgone,<br/>
At last, with sudden step, he came upon<br/>
A chamber, myrtle wall'd, embowered high,<br/>
Full of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,<br/>
And more of beautiful and strange beside:<br/>
For on a silken couch of rosy pride,<br/>
In midst of all, there lay a sleeping youth<br/>
Of fondest beauty; fonder, in fair sooth,<br/>
Than sighs could fathom, or contentment reach:<br/>
And coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,<br/>
Or ripe October's faded marigolds,<br/>
Fell sleek about him in a thousand folds&mdash;<br/>
Not hiding up an Apollonian curve<br/>
Of neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve<br/>
Of knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;<br/>
But rather, giving them to the filled sight<br/>
Officiously. Sideway his face repos'd<br/>
On one white arm, and tenderly unclos'd,<br/>
By tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth<br/>
To slumbery pout; just as the morning south<br/>
Disparts a dew-lipp'd rose. Above his head,<br/>
Four lily stalks did their white honours wed<br/>
To make a coronal; and round him grew<br/>
All tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,<br/>
Together intertwin'd and trammel'd fresh:<br/>
The vine of glossy sprout; the ivy mesh,<br/>
Shading its Ethiop berries; and woodbine,<br/>
Of velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine;<br/>
Convolvulus in streaked vases flush;<br/>
The creeper, mellowing for an autumn blush;<br/>
And virgin's bower, trailing airily;<br/>
With others of the sisterhood. Hard by,<br/>
Stood serene Cupids watching silently.<br/>
One, kneeling to a lyre, touch'd the strings,<br/>
Muffling to death the pathos with his wings;<br/>
And, ever and anon, uprose to look<br/>
At the youth's slumber; while another took<br/>
A willow-bough, distilling odorous dew,<br/>
And shook it on his hair; another flew<br/>
In through the woven roof, and fluttering-wise<br/>
Rain'd violets upon his sleeping eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
At these enchantments, and yet many more,<br/>
The breathless Latmian wonder'd o'er and o'er;<br/>
Until, impatient in embarrassment,<br/>
He forthright pass'd, and lightly treading went<br/>
To that same feather'd lyrist, who straightway,<br/>
Smiling, thus whisper'd: "Though from upper day<br/>
Thou art a wanderer, and thy presence here<br/>
Might seem unholy, be of happy cheer!<br/>
For 'tis the nicest touch of human honour,<br/>
When some ethereal and high-favouring donor<br/>
Presents immortal bowers to mortal sense;<br/>
As now 'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence<br/>
Was I in no wise startled. So recline<br/>
Upon these living flowers. Here is wine,<br/>
Alive with sparkles&mdash;never, I aver,<br/>
Since Ariadne was a vintager,<br/>
So cool a purple: taste these juicy pears,<br/>
Sent me by sad Vertumnus, when his fears<br/>
Were high about Pomona: here is cream,<br/>
Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam;<br/>
Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm'd<br/>
For the boy Jupiter: and here, undimm'd<br/>
By any touch, a bunch of blooming plums<br/>
Ready to melt between an infant's gums:<br/>
And here is manna pick'd from Syrian trees,<br/>
In starlight, by the three Hesperides.<br/>
Feast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know<br/>
Of all these things around us." He did so,<br/>
Still brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre;<br/>
And thus: "I need not any hearing tire<br/>
By telling how the sea-born goddess pin'd<br/>
For a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind<br/>
Him all in all unto her doting self.<br/>
Who would not be so prison'd? but, fond elf,<br/>
He was content to let her amorous plea<br/>
Faint through his careless arms; content to see<br/>
An unseiz'd heaven dying at his feet;<br/>
Content, O fool! to make a cold retreat,<br/>
When on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn,<br/>
Lay sorrowing; when every tear was born<br/>
Of diverse passion; when her lips and eyes<br/>
Were clos'd in sullen moisture, and quick sighs<br/>
Came vex'd and pettish through her nostrils small.<br/>
Hush! no exclaim&mdash;yet, justly mightst thou call<br/>
Curses upon his head.&mdash;I was half glad,<br/>
But my poor mistress went distract and mad,<br/>
When the boar tusk'd him: so away she flew<br/>
To Jove's high throne, and by her plainings drew<br/>
Immortal tear-drops down the thunderer's beard;<br/>
Whereon, it was decreed he should be rear'd<br/>
Each summer time to life. Lo! this is he,<br/>
That same Adonis, safe in the privacy<br/>
Of this still region all his winter-sleep.<br/>
Aye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep<br/>
Over his waned corse, the tremulous shower<br/>
Heal'd up the wound, and, with a balmy power,<br/>
Medicined death to a lengthened drowsiness:<br/>
The which she fills with visions, and doth dress<br/>
In all this quiet luxury; and hath set<br/>
Us young immortals, without any let,<br/>
To watch his slumber through. 'Tis well nigh pass'd,<br/>
Even to a moment's filling up, and fast<br/>
She scuds with summer breezes, to pant through<br/>
The first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew<br/>
Embower'd sports in Cytherea's isle.<br/>
Look! how those winged listeners all this while<br/>
Stand anxious: see! behold!"&mdash;This clamant word<br/>
Broke through the careful silence; for they heard<br/>
A rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter'd<br/>
Pigeons and doves: Adonis something mutter'd,<br/>
The while one hand, that erst upon his thigh<br/>
Lay dormant, mov'd convuls'd and gradually<br/>
Up to his forehead. Then there was a hum<br/>
Of sudden voices, echoing, "Come! come!<br/>
Arise! awake! Clear summer has forth walk'd<br/>
Unto the clover-sward, and she has talk'd<br/>
Full soothingly to every nested finch:<br/>
Rise, Cupids! or we'll give the blue-bell pinch<br/>
To your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!"<br/>
At this, from every side they hurried in,<br/>
Rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,<br/>
And doubling over head their little fists<br/>
In backward yawns. But all were soon alive:<br/>
For as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive<br/>
In nectar'd clouds and curls through water fair,<br/>
So from the arbour roof down swell'd an air<br/>
Odorous and enlivening; making all<br/>
To laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call<br/>
For their sweet queen: when lo! the wreathed green<br/>
Disparted, and far upward could be seen<br/>
Blue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,<br/>
Whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,<br/>
Spun off a drizzling dew,&mdash;which falling chill<br/>
On soft Adonis' shoulders, made him still<br/>
Nestle and turn uneasily about.<br/>
Soon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch'd out,<br/>
And silken traces lighten'd in descent;<br/>
And soon, returning from love's banishment,<br/>
Queen Venus leaning downward open arm'd:<br/>
Her shadow fell upon his breast, and charm'd<br/>
A tumult to his heart, and a new life<br/>
Into his eyes. Ah, miserable strife,<br/>
But for her comforting! unhappy sight,<br/>
But meeting her blue orbs! Who, who can write<br/>
Of these first minutes? The unchariest muse<br/>
To embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O it has ruffled every spirit there,<br/>
Saving love's self, who stands superb to share<br/>
The general gladness: awfully he stands;<br/>
A sovereign quell is in his waving hands;<br/>
No sight can bear the lightning of his bow;<br/>
His quiver is mysterious, none can know<br/>
What themselves think of it; from forth his eyes<br/>
There darts strange light of varied hues and dyes:<br/>
A scowl is sometimes on his brow, but who<br/>
Look full upon it feel anon the blue<br/>
Of his fair eyes run liquid through their souls.<br/>
Endymion feels it, and no more controls<br/>
The burning prayer within him; so, bent low,<br/>
He had begun a plaining of his woe.<br/>
But Venus, bending forward, said: "My child,<br/>
Favour this gentle youth; his days are wild<br/>
With love&mdash;he&mdash;but alas! too well I see<br/>
Thou know'st the deepness of his misery.<br/>
Ah, smile not so, my son: I tell thee true,<br/>
That when through heavy hours I used to rue<br/>
The endless sleep of this new-born Adon',<br/>
This stranger ay I pitied. For upon<br/>
A dreary morning once I fled away<br/>
Into the breezy clouds, to weep and pray<br/>
For this my love: for vexing Mars had teaz'd<br/>
Me even to tears: thence, when a little eas'd,<br/>
Down-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,<br/>
I saw this youth as he despairing stood:<br/>
Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind;<br/>
Those same full fringed lids a constant blind<br/>
Over his sullen eyes: I saw him throw<br/>
Himself on wither'd leaves, even as though<br/>
Death had come sudden; for no jot he mov'd,<br/>
Yet mutter'd wildly. I could hear he lov'd<br/>
Some fair immortal, and that his embrace<br/>
Had zoned her through the night. There is no trace<br/>
Of this in heaven: I have mark'd each cheek,<br/>
And find it is the vainest thing to seek;<br/>
And that of all things 'tis kept secretest.<br/>
Endymion! one day thou wilt be blest:<br/>
So still obey the guiding hand that fends<br/>
Thee safely through these wonders for sweet ends.<br/>
'Tis a concealment needful in extreme;<br/>
And if I guess'd not so, the sunny beam<br/>
Thou shouldst mount up to with me. Now adieu!<br/>
Here must we leave thee."&mdash;At these words up flew<br/>
The impatient doves, up rose the floating car,<br/>
Up went the hum celestial. High afar<br/>
The Latmian saw them minish into nought;<br/>
And, when all were clear vanish'd, still he caught<br/>
A vivid lightning from that dreadful bow.<br/>
When all was darkened, with Etnean throe<br/>
The earth clos'd&mdash;gave a solitary moan&mdash;<br/>
And left him once again in twilight lone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He did not rave, he did not stare aghast,<br/>
For all those visions were o'ergone, and past,<br/>
And he in loneliness: he felt assur'd<br/>
Of happy times, when all he had endur'd<br/>
Would seem a feather to the mighty prize.<br/>
So, with unusual gladness, on he hies<br/>
Through caves, and palaces of mottled ore,<br/>
Gold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,<br/>
Black polish'd porticos of awful shade,<br/>
And, at the last, a diamond balustrade,<br/>
Leading afar past wild magnificence,<br/>
Spiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence<br/>
Stretching across a void, then guiding o'er<br/>
Enormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,<br/>
Streams subterranean tease their granite beds;<br/>
Then heighten'd just above the silvery heads<br/>
Of a thousand fountains, so that he could dash<br/>
The waters with his spear; but at the splash,<br/>
Done heedlessly, those spouting columns rose<br/>
Sudden a poplar's height, and 'gan to enclose<br/>
His diamond path with fretwork, streaming round<br/>
Alive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,<br/>
Haply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells<br/>
Welcome the float of Thetis. Long he dwells<br/>
On this delight; for, every minute's space,<br/>
The streams with changed magic interlace:<br/>
Sometimes like delicatest lattices,<br/>
Cover'd with crystal vines; then weeping trees,<br/>
Moving about as in a gentle wind,<br/>
Which, in a wink, to watery gauze refin'd,<br/>
Pour'd into shapes of curtain'd canopies,<br/>
Spangled, and rich with liquid broideries<br/>
Of flowers, peacocks, swans, and naiads fair.<br/>
Swifter than lightning went these wonders rare;<br/>
And then the water, into stubborn streams<br/>
Collecting, mimick'd the wrought oaken beams,<br/>
Pillars, and frieze, and high fantastic roof,<br/>
Of those dusk places in times far aloof<br/>
Cathedrals call'd. He bade a loth farewel<br/>
To these founts Protean, passing gulph, and dell,<br/>
And torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,<br/>
Half seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,<br/>
Blackening on every side, and overhead<br/>
A vaulted dome like Heaven's, far bespread<br/>
With starlight gems: aye, all so huge and strange,<br/>
The solitary felt a hurried change<br/>
Working within him into something dreary,&mdash;<br/>
Vex'd like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,<br/>
And purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds.<br/>
But he revives at once: for who beholds<br/>
New sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?<br/>
Forth from a rugged arch, in the dusk below,<br/>
Came mother Cybele! alone&mdash;alone&mdash;<br/>
In sombre chariot; dark foldings thrown<br/>
About her majesty, and front death-pale,<br/>
With turrets crown'd. Four maned lions hale<br/>
The sluggish wheels; solemn their toothed maws,<br/>
Their surly eyes brow-hidden, heavy paws<br/>
Uplifted drowsily, and nervy tails<br/>
Cowering their tawny brushes. Silent sails<br/>
This shadowy queen athwart, and faints away<br/>
In another gloomy arch.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore delay,<br/>
Young traveller, in such a mournful place?<br/>
Art thou wayworn, or canst not further trace<br/>
The diamond path? And does it indeed end<br/>
Abrupt in middle air? Yet earthward bend<br/>
Thy forehead, and to Jupiter cloud-borne<br/>
Call ardently! He was indeed wayworn;<br/>
Abrupt, in middle air, his way was lost;<br/>
To cloud-borne Jove he bowed, and there crost<br/>
Towards him a large eagle, 'twixt whose wings,<br/>
Without one impious word, himself he flings,<br/>
Committed to the darkness and the gloom:<br/>
Down, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,<br/>
Swift as a fathoming plummet down he fell<br/>
Through unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,<br/>
And rose, with spicy fannings interbreath'd,<br/>
Came swelling forth where little caves were wreath'd<br/>
So thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem'd<br/>
Large honey-combs of green, and freshly teem'd<br/>
With airs delicious. In the greenest nook<br/>
The eagle landed him, and farewel took.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It was a jasmine bower, all bestrown<br/>
With golden moss. His every sense had grown<br/>
Ethereal for pleasure; 'bove his head<br/>
Flew a delight half-graspable; his tread<br/>
Was Hesperean; to his capable ears<br/>
Silence was music from the holy spheres;<br/>
A dewy luxury was in his eyes;<br/>
The little flowers felt his pleasant sighs<br/>
And stirr'd them faintly. Verdant cave and cell<br/>
He wander'd through, oft wondering at such swell<br/>
Of sudden exaltation: but, "Alas!<br/>
Said he, "will all this gush of feeling pass<br/>
Away in solitude? And must they wane,<br/>
Like melodies upon a sandy plain,<br/>
Without an echo? Then shall I be left<br/>
So sad, so melancholy, so bereft!<br/>
Yet still I feel immortal! O my love,<br/>
My breath of life, where art thou? High above,<br/>
Dancing before the morning gates of heaven?<br/>
Or keeping watch among those starry seven,<br/>
Old Atlas' children? Art a maid of the waters,<br/>
One of shell-winding Triton's bright-hair'd daughters?<br/>
Or art, impossible! a nymph of Dian's,<br/>
Weaving a coronal of tender scions<br/>
For very idleness? Where'er thou art,<br/>
Methinks it now is at my will to start<br/>
Into thine arms; to scare Aurora's train,<br/>
And snatch thee from the morning; o'er the main<br/>
To scud like a wild bird, and take thee off<br/>
From thy sea-foamy cradle; or to doff<br/>
Thy shepherd vest, and woo thee mid fresh leaves.<br/>
No, no, too eagerly my soul deceives<br/>
Its powerless self: I know this cannot be.<br/>
O let me then by some sweet dreaming flee<br/>
To her entrancements: hither sleep awhile!<br/>
Hither most gentle sleep! and soothing foil<br/>
For some few hours the coming solitude."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus spake he, and that moment felt endued<br/>
With power to dream deliciously; so wound<br/>
Through a dim passage, searching till he found<br/>
The smoothest mossy bed and deepest, where<br/>
He threw himself, and just into the air<br/>
Stretching his indolent arms, he took, O bliss!<br/>
A naked waist: "Fair Cupid, whence is this?"<br/>
A well-known voice sigh'd, "Sweetest, here am I!"<br/>
At which soft ravishment, with doating cry<br/>
They trembled to each other.&mdash;Helicon!<br/>
O fountain'd hill! Old Homer's Helicon!<br/>
That thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o'er<br/>
These sorry pages; then the verse would soar<br/>
And sing above this gentle pair, like lark<br/>
Over his nested young: but all is dark<br/>
Around thine aged top, and thy clear fount<br/>
Exhales in mists to heaven. Aye, the count<br/>
Of mighty Poets is made up; the scroll<br/>
Is folded by the Muses; the bright roll<br/>
Is in Apollo's hand: our dazed eyes<br/>
Have seen a new tinge in the western skies:<br/>
The world has done its duty. Yet, oh yet,<br/>
Although the sun of poesy is set,<br/>
These lovers did embrace, and we must weep<br/>
That there is no old power left to steep<br/>
A quill immortal in their joyous tears.<br/>
Long time in silence did their anxious fears<br/>
Question that thus it was; long time they lay<br/>
Fondling and kissing every doubt away;<br/>
Long time ere soft caressing sobs began<br/>
To mellow into words, and then there ran<br/>
Two bubbling springs of talk from their sweet lips.<br/>
"O known Unknown! from whom my being sips<br/>
Such darling essence, wherefore may I not<br/>
Be ever in these arms? in this sweet spot<br/>
Pillow my chin for ever? ever press<br/>
These toying hands and kiss their smooth excess?<br/>
Why not for ever and for ever feel<br/>
That breath about my eyes? Ah, thou wilt steal<br/>
Away from me again, indeed, indeed&mdash;<br/>
Thou wilt be gone away, and wilt not heed<br/>
My lonely madness. Speak, my kindest fair!<br/>
Is&mdash;is it to be so? No! Who will dare<br/>
To pluck thee from me? And, of thine own will,<br/>
Full well I feel thou wouldst not leave me. Still<br/>
Let me entwine thee surer, surer&mdash;now<br/>
How can we part? Elysium! who art thou?<br/>
Who, that thou canst not be for ever here,<br/>
Or lift me with thee to some starry sphere?<br/>
Enchantress! tell me by this soft embrace,<br/>
By the most soft completion of thy face,<br/>
Those lips, O slippery blisses, twinkling eyes,<br/>
And by these tenderest, milky sovereignties&mdash;<br/>
These tenderest, and by the nectar-wine,<br/>
The passion"—"O lov'd Ida the divine!<br/>
Endymion! dearest! Ah, unhappy me!<br/>
His soul will 'scape us&mdash;O felicity!<br/>
How he does love me! His poor temples beat<br/>
To the very tune of love&mdash;how sweet, sweet, sweet.<br/>
Revive, dear youth, or I shall faint and die;<br/>
Revive, or these soft hours will hurry by<br/>
In tranced dulness; speak, and let that spell<br/>
Affright this lethargy! I cannot quell<br/>
Its heavy pressure, and will press at least<br/>
My lips to thine, that they may richly feast<br/>
Until we taste the life of love again.<br/>
What! dost thou move? dost kiss? O bliss! O pain!<br/>
I love thee, youth, more than I can conceive;<br/>
And so long absence from thee doth bereave<br/>
My soul of any rest: yet must I hence:<br/>
Yet, can I not to starry eminence<br/>
Uplift thee; nor for very shame can own<br/>
Myself to thee. Ah, dearest, do not groan<br/>
Or thou wilt force me from this secrecy,<br/>
And I must blush in heaven. O that I<br/>
Had done it already; that the dreadful smiles<br/>
At my lost brightness, my impassion'd wiles,<br/>
Had waned from Olympus' solemn height,<br/>
And from all serious Gods; that our delight<br/>
Was quite forgotten, save of us alone!<br/>
And wherefore so ashamed? 'Tis but to atone<br/>
For endless pleasure, by some coward blushes:<br/>
Yet must I be a coward!&mdash;Honour rushes<br/>
Too palpable before me&mdash;the sad look<br/>
Of Jove&mdash;Minerva's start&mdash;no bosom shook<br/>
With awe of purity&mdash;no Cupid pinion<br/>
In reverence veiled&mdash;my <a id="tn1"></a>crystalline dominion<br/>
Half lost, and all old hymns made nullity!<br/>
But what is this to love? O I could fly<br/>
With thee into the ken of heavenly powers,<br/>
So thou wouldst thus, for many sequent hours,<br/>
Press me so sweetly. Now I swear at once<br/>
That I am wise, that Pallas is a dunce&mdash;<br/>
Perhaps her love like mine is but unknown&mdash;<br/>
O I do think that I have been alone<br/>
In chastity: yes, Pallas has been sighing,<br/>
While every eye saw me my hair uptying<br/>
With fingers cool as aspen leaves. Sweet love,<br/>
I was as vague as solitary dove,<br/>
Nor knew that nests were built. Now a soft kiss&mdash;<br/>
Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss,<br/>
An immortality of passion's thine:<br/>
Ere long I will exalt thee to the shine<br/>
Of heaven ambrosial; and we will shade<br/>
Ourselves whole summers by a river glade;<br/>
And I will tell thee stories of the sky,<br/>
And breathe thee whispers of its minstrelsy.<br/>
My happy love will overwing all bounds!<br/>
O let me melt into thee; let the sounds<br/>
Of our close voices marry at their birth;<br/>
Let us entwine hoveringly&mdash;O dearth<br/>
Of human words! roughness of mortal speech!<br/>
Lispings empyrean will I sometime teach<br/>
Thine honied tongue&mdash;lute-breathings, which I gasp<br/>
To have thee understand, now while I clasp<br/>
Thee thus, and weep for fondness&mdash;I am pain'd,<br/>
Endymion: woe! woe! is grief contain'd<br/>
In the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?"&mdash;<br/>
Hereat, with many sobs, her gentle strife<br/>
Melted into a languor. He return'd<br/>
Entranced vows and tears.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who have yearn'd<br/>
With too much passion, will here stay and pity,<br/>
For the mere sake of truth; as 'tis a ditty<br/>
Not of these days, but long ago 'twas told<br/>
By a cavern wind unto a forest old;<br/>
And then the forest told it in a dream<br/>
To a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam<br/>
A poet caught as he was journeying<br/>
To Phœbus' shrine; and in it he did fling<br/>
His weary limbs, bathing an hour's space,<br/>
And after, straight in that inspired place<br/>
He sang the story up into the air,<br/>
Giving it universal freedom. There<br/>
Has it been ever sounding for those ears<br/>
Whose tips are glowing hot. The legend cheers<br/>
Yon centinel stars; and he who listens to it<br/>
Must surely be self-doomed or he will rue it:<br/>
For quenchless burnings come upon the heart,<br/>
Made fiercer by a fear lest any part<br/>
Should be engulphed in the eddying wind.<br/>
As much as here is penn'd doth always find<br/>
A resting place, thus much comes clear and plain;<br/>
Anon the strange voice is upon the wane&mdash;<br/>
And 'tis but echo'd from departing sound,<br/>
That the fair visitant at last unwound<br/>
Her gentle limbs, and left the youth asleep.&mdash;<br/>
Thus the tradition of the gusty deep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now turn we to our former chroniclers.&mdash;<br/>
Endymion awoke, that grief of hers<br/>
Sweet paining on his ear: he sickly guess'd<br/>
How lone he was once more, and sadly press'd<br/>
His empty arms together, hung his head,<br/>
And most forlorn upon that widow'd bed<br/>
Sat silently. Love's madness he had known:<br/>
Often with more than tortured lion's groan<br/>
Moanings had burst from him; but now that rage<br/>
Had pass'd away: no longer did he wage<br/>
A rough-voic'd war against the dooming stars.<br/>
No, he had felt too much for such harsh jars:<br/>
The lyre of his soul Eolian tun'd<br/>
Forgot all violence, and but commun'd<br/>
With melancholy thought: O he had swoon'd<br/>
Drunken from pleasure's nipple; and his love<br/>
Henceforth was dove-like.&mdash;Loth was he to move<br/>
From the imprinted couch, and when he did,<br/>
'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid<br/>
In muffling hands. So temper'd, out he stray'd<br/>
Half seeing visions that might have dismay'd<br/>
Alecto's serpents; ravishments more keen<br/>
Than Hermes' pipe, when anxious he did lean<br/>
Over eclipsing eyes: and at the last<br/>
It was a sounding grotto, vaulted, vast,<br/>
O'er studded with a thousand, thousand pearls,<br/>
And crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,<br/>
Of every shape and size, even to the bulk<br/>
In which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk<br/>
Against an endless storm. Moreover too,<br/>
Fish-semblances, of green and azure hue,<br/>
Ready to snort their streams. In this cool wonder<br/>
Endymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder<br/>
On all his life: his youth, up to the day<br/>
When 'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,<br/>
He stept upon his shepherd throne: the look<br/>
Of his white palace in wild forest nook,<br/>
And all the revels he had lorded there:<br/>
Each tender maiden whom he once thought fair,<br/>
With every friend and fellow-woodlander&mdash;<br/>
Pass'd like a dream before him. Then the spur<br/>
Of the old bards to mighty deeds: his plans<br/>
To nurse the golden age 'mong shepherd clans:<br/>
That wondrous night: the great Pan-festival:<br/>
His sister's sorrow; and his wanderings all,<br/>
Until into the earth's deep maw he rush'd:<br/>
Then all its buried magic, till it flush'd<br/>
High with excessive love. "And now," thought he,<br/>
"How long must I remain in jeopardy<br/>
Of blank amazements that amaze no more?<br/>
Now I have tasted her sweet soul to the core<br/>
All other depths are shallow: essences,<br/>
Once spiritual, are like muddy lees,<br/>
Meant but to fertilize my earthly root,<br/>
And make my branches lift a golden fruit<br/>
Into the bloom of heaven: other light,<br/>
Though it be quick and sharp enough to blight<br/>
The Olympian eagle's vision, is dark,<br/>
Dark as the parentage of chaos. Hark!<br/>
My silent thoughts are echoing from these shells;<br/>
Or they are but the ghosts, the dying swells<br/>
Of noises far away?&mdash;list!"&mdash;Hereupon<br/>
He kept an anxious ear. The humming tone<br/>
Came louder, and behold, there as he lay,<br/>
On either side outgush'd, with misty spray,<br/>
A copious spring; and both together dash'd<br/>
Swift, mad, fantastic round the rocks, and lash'd<br/>
Among the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,<br/>
Leaving a trickling dew. At last they shot<br/>
Down from the ceiling's height, pouring a noise<br/>
As of some breathless racers whose hopes poize<br/>
Upon the last few steps, and with spent force<br/>
Along the ground they took a winding course.<br/>
Endymion follow'd&mdash;for it seem'd that one<br/>
Ever pursued, the other strove to shun&mdash;<br/>
Follow'd their languid mazes, till well nigh<br/>
He had left thinking of the mystery,&mdash;<br/>
And was now rapt in tender hoverings<br/>
Over the vanish'd bliss. Ah! what is it sings<br/>
His dream away? What melodies are these?<br/>
They sound as through the whispering of trees,<br/>
Not native in such barren vaults. Give ear!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O Arethusa, peerless nymph! why fear<br/>
Such tenderness as mine? Great Dian, why,<br/>
Why didst thou hear her prayer? O that I<br/>
Were rippling round her dainty fairness now,<br/>
Circling about her waist, and striving how<br/>
To entice her to a dive! then stealing in<br/>
Between her luscious lips and eyelids thin.<br/>
O that her shining hair was in the sun,<br/>
And I distilling from it thence to run<br/>
In amorous rillets down her shrinking form!<br/>
To linger on her lily shoulders, warm<br/>
Between her kissing breasts, and every charm<br/>
Touch raptur'd!&mdash;See how painfully I flow:<br/>
Fair maid, be pitiful to my great woe.<br/>
Stay, stay thy weary course, and let me lead,<br/>
A happy wooer, to the flowery mead<br/>
Where all that beauty snar'd me."&mdash;"Cruel god,<br/>
Desist! or my offended mistress' nod<br/>
Will stagnate all thy fountains:&mdash;tease me not<br/>
With syren words&mdash;Ah, have I really got<br/>
Such power to madden thee? And is it true&mdash;<br/>
Away, away, or I shall dearly rue<br/>
My very thoughts: in mercy then away,<br/>
Kindest Alpheus, for should I obey<br/>
My own dear will, 'twould be a deadly bane."&mdash;<br/>
"O, Oread-Queen! would that thou hadst a pain<br/>
Like this of mine, then would I fearless turn<br/>
And be a criminal."&mdash;"Alas, I burn,<br/>
I shudder&mdash;gentle river, get thee hence.<br/>
Alpheus! thou enchanter! every sense<br/>
Of mine was once made perfect in these woods.<br/>
Fresh breezes, bowery lawns, and innocent floods,<br/>
Ripe fruits, and lonely couch, contentment gave;<br/>
But ever since I heedlessly did lave<br/>
In thy deceitful stream, a panting glow<br/>
Grew strong within me: wherefore serve me so,<br/>
And call it love? Alas, 'twas cruelty.<br/>
Not once more did I close my happy eyes<br/>
Amid the thrush's song. Away! Avaunt!<br/>
O 'twas a cruel thing."&mdash;"Now thou dost taunt<br/>
So softly, Arethusa, that I think<br/>
If thou wast playing on my shady brink,<br/>
Thou wouldst bathe once again. Innocent maid!<br/>
Stifle thine heart no more:&mdash;nor be afraid<br/>
Of angry powers: there are deities<br/>
Will shade us with their wings. Those fitful sighs<br/>
'Tis almost death to hear: O let me pour<br/>
A dewy balm upon them!&mdash;fear no more,<br/>
Sweet Arethusa! Dian's self must feel<br/>
Sometimes these very pangs. Dear maiden, steal<br/>
Blushing into my soul, and let us fly<br/>
These dreary caverns for the open sky.<br/>
I will delight thee all my winding course,<br/>
From the green sea up to my hidden source<br/>
About Arcadian forests; and will shew<br/>
The channels where my coolest waters flow<br/>
Through mossy rocks; where, 'mid exuberant green,<br/>
I roam in pleasant darkness, more unseen<br/>
Than Saturn in his exile; where I brim<br/>
Round flowery islands, and take thence a skim<br/>
Of mealy sweets, which myriads of bees<br/>
Buzz from their honied wings: and thou shouldst please<br/>
Thyself to choose the richest, where we might<br/>
Be incense-pillow'd every summer night.<br/>
Doff all sad fears, thou white deliciousness,<br/>
And let us be thus comforted; unless<br/>
Thou couldst rejoice to see my hopeless stream<br/>
Hurry distracted from Sol's temperate beam,<br/>
And pour to death along some hungry sands."&mdash;<br/>
"What can I do, Alpheus? Dian stands<br/>
Severe before me: persecuting fate!<br/>
Unhappy Arethusa! thou wast late<br/>
A huntress free in"&mdash;At this, sudden fell<br/>
Those two sad streams adown a fearful dell.<br/>
The Latmian listen'd, but he heard no more,<br/>
Save echo, faint repeating o'er and o'er<br/>
The name of Arethusa. On the verge<br/>
Of that dark gulph he wept, and said: "I urge<br/>
Thee, gentle Goddess of my pilgrimage,<br/>
By our eternal hopes, to soothe, to assuage,<br/>
If thou art powerful, these lovers pains;<br/>
And make them happy in some happy plains.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He turn'd&mdash;there was a whelming sound&mdash;he stept,<br/>
There was a cooler light; and so he kept<br/>
Towards it by a sandy path, and lo!<br/>
More suddenly than doth a moment go,<br/>
The visions of the earth were gone and fled&mdash;<br/>
He saw the giant sea above his head.<br/>

<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Tenth</h2>
<h3>Residence in France, continued...</h3>
<p>
It was a beautiful and silent day<br/>
That overspread the countenance of earth,<br/>
Then fading with unusual quietness,&mdash;<br/>
A day as beautiful as e'er was given<br/>
To soothe regret, though deepening what it soothed,<br/>
When by the gliding Loire I paused, and cast<br/>
Upon his rich domains, vineyard and tilth,<br/>
Green meadow-ground, and many-coloured woods,<br/>
Again, and yet again, a farewell look;<br/>
Then from the quiet of that scene passed on,<br/>
Bound to the fierce Metropolis. From his throne<br/>
The King had fallen, and that invading host&mdash;<br/>
Presumptuous cloud, on whose black front was written<br/>
The tender mercies of the dismal wind<br/>
That bore it&mdash;on the plains of Liberty<br/>
Had burst innocuous. Say in bolder words,<br/>
They&mdash;who had come elate as eastern hunters<br/>
Banded beneath the Great Mogul, when he<br/>
Erewhile went forth from Agra or Lahore,<br/>
Rajahs and Omrahs in his train, intent<br/>
To drive their prey enclosed within a ring<br/>
Wide as a province, but, the signal given,<br/>
Before the point of the life-threatening spear<br/>
Narrowing itself by moments&mdash;they, rash men,<br/>
Had seen the anticipated quarry turned<br/>
Into avengers, from whose wrath they fled<br/>
In terror. Disappointment and dismay<br/>
Remained for all whose fancies had run wild<br/>
With evil expectations; confidence<br/>
And perfect triumph for the better cause.
</p>
<p>
The State, as if to stamp the final seal<br/>
On her security, and to the world<br/>
Show what she was, a high and fearless soul,<br/>
Exulting in defiance, or heart-stung<br/>
By sharp resentment, or belike to taunt<br/>
With spiteful gratitude the baffled League,<br/>
That had stirred up her slackening faculties<br/>
To a new transition, when the King was crushed,<br/>
Spared not the empty throne, and in proud haste<br/>
Assumed the body and venerable name<br/>
Of a Republic. Lamentable crimes,<br/>
'Tis true, had gone before this hour, dire work<br/>
Of massacre, in which the senseless sword<br/>
Was prayed to as a judge; but these were past,<br/>
Earth free from them for ever, as was thought,&mdash;<br/>
Ephemeral monsters, to be seen but once!<br/>
Things that could only show themselves and die.
</p>
<p>
Cheered with this hope, to Paris I returned,<br/>
And ranged, with ardour heretofore unfelt,<br/>
The spacious city, and in progress passed<br/>
The prison where the unhappy Monarch lay,<br/>
Associate with his children and his wife<br/>
In bondage; and the palace, lately stormed<br/>
With roar of cannon by a furious host.<br/>
I crossed the square (an empty area then!)<br/>
Of the Carrousel, where so late had lain<br/>
The dead, upon the dying heaped, and gazed<br/>
On this and other spots, as doth a man<br/>
Upon a volume whose contents he knows<br/>
Are memorable, but from him locked up,<br/>
Being written in a tongue he cannot read,<br/>
So that he questions the mute leaves with pain,<br/>
And half upbraids their silence. But that night<br/>
I felt most deeply in what world I was,<br/>
What ground I trod on, and what air I breathed.<br/>
High was my room and lonely, near the roof<br/>
Of a large mansion or hotel, a lodge<br/>
That would have pleased me in more quiet times;<br/>
Nor was it wholly without pleasure then.<br/>
With unextinguished taper I kept watch,<br/>
Reading at intervals; the fear gone by<br/>
Pressed on me almost like a fear to come.<br/>
I thought of those September massacres,<br/>
Divided from me by one little month, <br/>
Saw them and touched: the rest was conjured up<br/>
From tragic fictions or true history,<br/>
Remembrances and dim admonishments.<br/>
The horse is taught his manage, and no star<br/>
Of wildest course but treads back his own steps;<br/>
For the spent hurricane the air provides<br/>
As fierce a successor; the tide retreats<br/>
But to return out of its hiding-place<br/>
In the great deep; all things have second-birth;<br/>
The earthquake is not satisfied at once;<br/>
And in this way I wrought upon myself,<br/>
Until I seemed to hear a voice that cried,<br/>
To the whole city, "Sleep no more." The trance<br/>
Fled with the voice to which it had given birth;<br/>
But vainly comments of a calmer mind<br/>
Promised soft peace and sweet forgetfulness.<br/>
The place, all hushed and silent as it was,<br/>
Appeared unfit for the repose of night,<br/>
Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With early morning towards the Palace-walk<br/>
Of Orl√©ans eagerly I turned; as yet<br/>
The streets were still; not so those long Arcades;<br/>
There, 'mid a peal of ill-matched sounds and cries,<br/>
That greeted me on entering, I could hear<br/>
Shrill voices from the hawkers in the throng,<br/>
Bawling, "Denunciation of the Crimes<br/>
Of Maximilian Robespierre;" the hand,<br/>
Prompt as the voice, held forth a printed speech,<br/>
The same that had been recently pronounced,<br/>
When Robespierre, not ignorant for what mark<br/>
Some words of indirect reproof had been<br/>
Intended, rose in hardihood, and dared<br/>
The man who had an ill surmise of him<br/>
To bring his charge in openness; whereat,<br/>
When a dead pause ensued, and no one stirred,<br/>
In silence of all present, from his seat<br/>
Louvet walked single through the avenue,<br/>
And took his station in the Tribune, saying,<br/>
"I, Robespierre, accuse thee!" Well is known<br/>
The inglorious issue of that charge, and how<br/>
He, who had launched the startling thunderbolt,<br/>
The one bold man, whose voice the attack had sounded,<br/>
Was left without a follower to discharge<br/>
His perilous duty, and retire lamenting<br/>
That Heaven's best aid is wasted upon men<br/>
Who to themselves are false.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are things<br/>
Of which I speak, only as they were storm<br/>
Or sunshine to my individual mind,<br/>
No further. Let me then relate that now&mdash;<br/>
In some sort seeing with my proper eyes<br/>
That Liberty, and Life, and Death would soon<br/>
To the remotest corners of the land<br/>
Lie in the arbitrement of those who ruled<br/>
The capital City; what was struggled for,<br/>
And by what combatants victory must be won;<br/>
The indecision on their part whose aim<br/>
Seemed best, and the straightforward path of those<br/>
Who in attack or in defence were strong<br/>
Through their impiety&mdash;my inmost soul<br/>
Was agitated; yea, I could almost<br/>
Have prayed that throughout earth upon all men,<br/>
By patient exercise of reason made<br/>
Worthy of liberty, all spirits filled<br/>
With zeal expanding in Truth's holy light,<br/>
The gift of tongues might fall, and power arrive<br/>
From the four quarters of the winds to do<br/>
For France, what without help she could not do,<br/>
A work of honour; think not that to this<br/>
I added, work of safety: from all doubt<br/>
Or trepidation for the end of things<br/>
Far was I, far as angels are from guilt.
</p>
<p>
Yet did I grieve, nor only grieved, but thought<br/>
Of opposition and of remedies:<br/>
An insignificant stranger and obscure,<br/>
And one, moreover, little graced with power<br/>
Of eloquence even in my native speech,<br/>
And all unfit for tumult or intrigue,<br/>
Yet would I at this time with willing heart<br/>
Have undertaken for a cause so great<br/>
Service however dangerous. I revolved,<br/>
How much the destiny of Man had still<br/>
Hung upon single persons; that there was,<br/>
Transcendent to all local patrimony,<br/>
One nature, as there is one sun in heaven;<br/>
That objects, even as they are great, thereby<br/>
Do come within the reach of humblest eyes;<br/>
That Man is only weak through his mistrust<br/>
And want of hope where evidence divine<br/>
Proclaims to him that hope should be most sure;<br/>
Nor did the inexperience of my youth<br/>
Preclude conviction, that a spirit strong,<br/>
In hope, and trained to noble aspirations,<br/>
A spirit thoroughly faithful to itself,<br/>
Is for Society's unreasoning herd<br/>
A domineering instinct, serves at once<br/>
For way and guide, a fluent receptacle<br/>
That gathers up each petty straggling rill<br/>
And vein of water, glad to be rolled on<br/>
In safe obedience; that a mind, whose rest<br/>
Is where it ought to be, in self-restraint,<br/>
In circumspection and simplicity,<br/>
Falls rarely in entire discomfiture<br/>
Below its aim, or meets with, from without,<br/>
A treachery that foils it or defeats;<br/>
And, lastly, if the means on human will,<br/>
Frail human will, dependent should betray<br/>
Him who too boldly trusted them, I felt<br/>
That 'mid the loud distractions of the world<br/>
A sovereign voice subsists within the soul,<br/>
Arbiter undisturbed of right and wrong,<br/>
Of life and death, in majesty severe<br/>
Enjoining, as may best promote the aims<br/>
Of truth and justice, either sacrifice,<br/>
From whatsoever region of our cares<br/>
Or our infirm affections Nature pleads,<br/>
Earnest and blind, against the stern decree.
</p>
<p>
On the other side, I called to mind those truths<br/>
That are the common-places of the schools&mdash;<br/>
(A theme for boys, too hackneyed for their sires,)<br/>
Yet, with a revelation's liveliness,<br/>
In all their comprehensive bearings known<br/>
And visible to philosophers of old,<br/>
Men who, to business of the world untrained,<br/>
Lived in the shade; and to Harmodius known<br/>
And his compeer Aristogiton, known<br/>
To Brutus&mdash;that tyrannic power is weak,<br/>
Hath neither gratitude, nor faith, nor love,<br/>
Nor the support of good or evil men<br/>
To trust in; that the godhead which is ours<br/>
Can never utterly be charmed or stilled;<br/>
That nothing hath a natural right to last<br/>
But equity and reason; that all else<br/>
Meets foes irreconcilable, and at best<br/>
Lives only by variety of disease.</p>
<p>
Well might my wishes be intense, my thoughts<br/>
Strong and perturbed, not doubting at that time<br/>
But that the virtue of one paramount mind<br/>
Would have abashed those impious crests&mdash;have quelled<br/>
Outrage and bloody power, and, in despite<br/>
Of what the People long had been and were<br/>
Through ignorance and false teaching, sadder proof<br/>
Of immaturity, and in the teeth<br/>
Of desperate opposition from without&mdash;<br/>
Have cleared a passage for just government,<br/>
And left a solid birthright to the State,<br/>
Redeemed, according to example given<br/>
By ancient lawgivers.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this frame of mind,<br/>
Dragged by a chain of harsh necessity,<br/>
So seemed it,&mdash;now I thankfully acknowledge,<br/>
Forced by the gracious providence of Heaven,&mdash;<br/>
To England I returned, else (though assured<br/>
That I both was and must be of small weight,<br/>
No better than a landsman on the deck<br/>
Of a ship struggling with a hideous storm)<br/>
Doubtless, I should have then made common cause<br/>
With some who perished; haply perished too,<br/>
A poor mistaken and bewildered offering,&mdash;<br/>
Should to the breast of Nature have gone back,<br/>
With all my resolutions, all my hopes,<br/>
A Poet only to myself, to men<br/>
Useless, and even, beloved Friend! a soul<br/>
To thee unknown!
</p>
<p>
Twice had the trees let fall<br/>
Their leaves, as often Winter had put on<br/>
His hoary crown, since I had seen the surge<br/>
Beat against Albion's shore, since ear of mine<br/>
Had caught the accents of my native speech<br/>
Upon our native country's sacred ground.<br/>
A patriot of the world, how could I glide<br/>
Into communion with her sylvan shades,<br/>
Erewhile my tuneful haunt? It pleased me more<br/>
To abide in the great City, where I found<br/>
The general air still busy with the stir<br/>
Of that first memorable onset made<br/>
By a strong levy of humanity<br/>
Upon the traffickers in Negro blood;<br/>
Effort which, though defeated, had recalled<br/>
To notice old forgotten principles,<br/>
And through the nation spread a novel heat<br/>
Of virtuous feeling. For myself, I own<br/>
That this particular strife had wanted power<br/>
To rivet my affections; nor did now<br/>
Its unsuccessful issue much excite<br/>
My sorrow; for I brought with me the faith<br/>
That, if France prospered, good men would not long<br/>
Pay fruitless worship to humanity,<br/>
And this most rotten branch of human shame,<br/>
Object, so seemed it, of superfluous pains,<br/>
Would fall together with its parent tree.<br/>
What, then, were my emotions, when in arms<br/>
Britain put forth her free-born strength in league,<br/>
Oh, pity and shame! with those confederate Powers!<br/>
Not in my single self alone I found,<br/>
But in the minds of all ingenuous youth,<br/>
Change and subversion from that hour. No shock<br/>
Given to my moral nature had I known<br/>
Down to that very moment; neither lapse<br/>
Nor turn of sentiment that might be named<br/>
A revolution, save at this one time;<br/>
All else was progress on the self-same path<br/>
On which, with a diversity of pace,<br/>
I had been travelling: this a stride at once<br/>
Into another region. As a light<br/>
And pliant harebell, swinging in the breeze<br/>
On some grey rock&mdash;its birth-place&mdash;so had I<br/>
Wantoned, fast rooted on the ancient tower<br/>
Of my beloved country, wishing not<br/>
A happier fortune than to wither there:<br/>
Now was I from that pleasant station torn<br/>
And tossed about in whirlwind. I rejoiced,<br/>
Yea, afterwards&mdash;truth most painful to record!&mdash;<br/>
Exulted, in the triumph of my soul,<br/>
When Englishmen by thousands were o'erthrown,<br/>
Left without glory on the field, or driven,<br/>
Brave hearts! to shameful flight. It was a grief,&mdash;<br/>
Grief call it not, 'twas anything but that,&mdash;<br/>
A conflict of sensations without name,<br/>
Of which <em>he</em> only, who may love the sight<br/>
Of a village steeple, as I do, can judge,<br/>
When, in the congregation bending all<br/>
To their great Father, prayers were offered up,<br/>
Or praises for our country's victories;<br/>
And, 'mid the simple worshippers, perchance<br/>
I only, like an uninvited guest<br/>
Whom no one owned, sate silent; shall I add,<br/>
Fed on the day of vengeance yet to come.
</p>
<p>
Oh! much have they to account for, who could tear,<br/>
By violence, at one decisive rent,<br/>
From the best youth in England their dear pride,<br/>
Their joy, in England; this, too, at a time<br/>
In which worst losses easily might wean<br/>
The best of names, when patriotic love<br/>
Did of itself in modesty give way,<br/>
Like the Precursor when the Deity<br/>
Is come Whose harbinger he was; a time<br/>
In which apostasy from ancient faith<br/>
Seemed but conversion to a higher creed;<br/>
Withal a season dangerous and wild,<br/>
A time when sage Experience would have snatched<br/>
Flowers out of any hedge-row to compose<br/>
A chaplet in contempt of his grey locks.
</p>
<p>
When the proud fleet that bears the red-cross flag<br/>
In that unworthy service was prepared<br/>
To mingle, I beheld the vessels lie,<br/>
A brood of gallant creatures, on the deep;<br/>
I saw them in their rest, a sojourner<br/>
Through a whole month of calm and glassy days<br/>
In that delightful island which protects<br/>
Their place of convocation&mdash;there I heard,<br/>
Each evening, pacing by the still sea-shore,<br/>
A monitory sound that never failed,&mdash;<br/>
The sunset cannon. While the orb went down<br/>
In the tranquillity of nature, came<br/>
That voice, ill requiem! seldom heard by me<br/>
Without a spirit overcast by dark<br/>
Imaginations, sense of woes to come,<br/>
Sorrow for human kind, and pain of heart.
</p>
<p>
In France, the men, who, for their desperate ends,<br/>
Had plucked up mercy by the roots, were glad<br/>
Of this new enemy. Tyrants, strong before<br/>
In wicked pleas, were strong as demons now;<br/>
And thus, on every side beset with foes,<br/>
The goaded land waxed mad; the crimes of few<br/>
Spread into madness of the many; blasts<br/>
From hell came sanctified like airs from heaven.<br/>
The sternness of the just, the faith of those<br/>
Who doubted not that Providence had times<br/>
Of vengeful retribution, theirs who throned<br/>
The human Understanding paramount<br/>
And made of that their God, the hopes of men<br/>
Who were content to barter short-lived pangs<br/>
For a paradise of ages, the blind rage<br/>
Of insolent tempers, the light vanity<br/>
Of intermeddlers, steady purposes<br/>
Of the suspicious, slips of the indiscreet,<br/>
And all the accidents of life were pressed<br/>
Into one service, busy with one work.<br/>
The Senate stood aghast, her prudence quenched,<br/>
Her wisdom stifled, and her justice scared,<br/>
Her frenzy only active to extol<br/>
Past outrages, and shape the way for new,<br/>
Which no one dared to oppose or mitigate.
</p>
<p>
Domestic carnage now filled the whole year<br/>
With feast-days; old men from the chimney-nook,<br/>
The maiden from the bosom of her love,<br/>
The mother from the cradle of her babe,<br/>
The warrior from the field&mdash;all perished, all&mdash;<br/>
Friends, enemies, of all parties, ages, ranks,<br/>
Head after head, and never heads enough<br/>
For those that bade them fall. They found their joy,<br/>
They made it proudly, eager as a child,<br/>
(If like desires of innocent little ones<br/>
May with such heinous appetites be compared,)<br/>
Pleased in some open field to exercise<br/>
A toy that mimics with revolving wings<br/>
The motion of a wind-mill; though the air<br/>
Do of itself blow fresh, and make the vanes<br/>
Spin in his eyesight, <em>that</em> contents him not,<br/>
But, with the plaything at arm's length, he sets<br/>
His front against the blast, and runs amain,<br/>
That it may whirl the faster.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the depth<br/>
Of those enormities, even thinking minds<br/>
Forgot, at seasons, whence they had their being;<br/>
Forgot that such a sound was ever heard<br/>
As Liberty upon earth: yet all beneath<br/>
Her innocent authority was wrought,<br/>
Nor could have been, without her blessed name.<br/>
The illustrious wife of Roland, in the hour<br/>
Of her composure, felt that agony,<br/>
And gave it vent in her last words. O Friend!<br/>
It was a lamentable time for man,<br/>
Whether a hope had e'er been his or not;<br/>
A woful time for them whose hopes survived<br/>
The shock; most woful for those few who still<br/>
Were flattered, and had trust in human kind:<br/>
They had the deepest feeling of the grief.<br/>
Meanwhile the Invaders fared as they deserved:<br/>
The Herculean Commonwealth had put forth her arms,<br/>
And throttled with an infant godhead's might<br/>
The snakes about her cradle; that was well,<br/>
And as it should be; yet no cure for them<br/>
Whose souls were sick with pain of what would be<br/>
Hereafter brought in charge against mankind.<br/>
Most melancholy at that time, O Friend!<br/>
Were my day-thoughts,&mdash;my nights were miserable;<br/>
Through months, through years, long after the last beat<br/>
Of those atrocities, the hour of sleep<br/>
To me came rarely charged with natural gifts,<br/>
Such ghastly visions had I of despair<br/>
And tyranny, and implements of death;<br/>
And innocent victims sinking under fear,<br/>
And momentary hope, and worn-out prayer,<br/>
Each in his separate cell, or penned in crowds<br/>
For sacrifice, and struggling with fond mirth<br/>
And levity in dungeons, where the dust<br/>
Was laid with tears. Then suddenly the scene<br/>
Changed, and the unbroken dream entangled me<br/>
In long orations, which I strove to plead<br/>
Before unjust tribunals,&mdash;with a voice<br/>
Labouring, a brain confounded, and a sense,<br/>
Death-like, of treacherous desertion, felt<br/>
In the last place of refuge&mdash;my own soul.
</p>
<p>
When I began in youth's delightful prime<br/>
To yield myself to Nature, when that strong<br/>
And holy passion overcame me first,<br/>
Nor day nor night, evening or morn, was free<br/>
From its oppression. But, O Power Supreme!<br/>
Without Whose call this world would cease to breathe,<br/>
Who from the fountain of Thy grace dost fill<br/>
The veins that branch through every frame of life,<br/>
Making man what he is, creature divine,<br/>
In single or in social eminence,<br/>
Above the rest raised infinite ascents<br/>
When reason that enables him to be<br/>
Is not sequestered&mdash;what a change is here!<br/>
How different ritual for this after-worship,<br/>
What countenance to promote this second love!<br/>
The first was service paid to things which lie<br/>
Guarded within the bosom of Thy will.<br/>
Therefore to serve was high beatitude;<br/>
Tumult was therefore gladness, and the fear<br/>
Ennobling, venerable; sleep secure,<br/>
And waking thoughts more rich than happiest dreams.
</p>
<p>
But as the ancient Prophets, borne aloft<br/>
In vision, yet constrained by natural laws<br/>
With them to take a troubled human heart,<br/>
Wanted not consolations, nor a creed<br/>
Of reconcilement, then when they denounced,<br/>
On towns and cities, wallowing in the abyss<br/>
Of their offences, punishment to come;<br/>
Or saw, like other men, with bodily eyes,<br/>
Before them, in some desolated place,<br/>
The wrath consummate and the threat fulfilled;<br/>
So, with devout humility be it said,<br/>
So, did a portion of that spirit fall<br/>
On me uplifted from the vantage-ground<br/>
Of pity and sorrow to a state of being<br/>
That through the time's exceeding fierceness saw<br/>
Glimpses of retribution, terrible,<br/>
And in the order of sublime behests:<br/>
But, even if that were not, amid the awe<br/>
Of unintelligible chastisement,<br/>
Not only acquiescences of faith<br/>
Survived, but daring sympathies with power,<br/>
Motions not treacherous or profane, else why<br/>
Within the folds of no ungentle breast<br/>
Their dread vibration to this hour prolonged?<br/>
Wild blasts of music thus could find their way<br/>
Into the midst of turbulent events;<br/>
So that worst tempests might be listened to.<br/>
Then was the truth received into my heart,<br/>
That, under heaviest sorrow earth can bring,<br/>
If from the affliction somewhere do not grow<br/>
Honour which could not else have been, a faith,<br/>
An elevation and a sanctity,<br/>
If new strength be not given nor old restored,<br/>
The blame is ours, not Nature's. When a taunt<br/>
Was taken up by scoffers in their pride,<br/>
Saying, "Behold the harvest that we reap<br/>
From popular government and equality,"<br/>
I clearly saw that neither these nor aught<br/>
Of wild belief engrafted on their names<br/>
By false philosophy had caused the woe,<br/>
But a terrific reservoir of guilt<br/>
And ignorance rilled up from age to age,<br/>
That could no longer hold its loathsome charge,<br/>
But burst and spread in deluge through the land.
</p>
<p>
And as the desert hath green spots, the sea<br/>
Small islands scattered amid stormy waves,<br/>
So that disastrous period did not want<br/>
Bright sprinklings of all human excellence,<br/>
To which the silver wands of saints in Heaven<br/>
Might point with rapturous joy. Yet not the less,<br/>
For those examples in no age surpassed<br/>
Of fortitude and energy and love,<br/>
And human nature faithful to herself<br/>
Under worst trials, was I driven to think<br/>
Of the glad times when first I traversed France<br/>
A youthful pilgrim; above all reviewed<br/>
That eventide, when under windows bright<br/>
With happy faces and with garlands hung,<br/>
And through a rainbow-arch that spanned the street,<br/>
Triumphal pomp for liberty confirmed,<br/>
I paced, a dear companion at my side,<br/>
The town of Arras, whence with promise high<br/>
Issued, on delegation to sustain<br/>
Humanity and right, <em>that</em> Robespierre,<br/>
He who thereafter, and in how short time!<br/>
Wielded the sceptre of the Atheist crew.<br/>
When the calamity spread far and wide&mdash;<br/>
And this same city, that did then appear<br/>
To outrun the rest in exultation, groaned<br/>
Under the vengeance of her cruel son,<br/>
As Lear reproached the winds&mdash;I could almost<br/>
Have quarrelled with that blameless spectacle<br/>
For lingering yet an image in my mind<br/>
To mock me under such a strange reverse.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O Friend! few happier moments have been mine<br/>
Than that which told the downfall of this Tribe<br/>
So dreaded, so abhorred. The day deserves<br/>
A separate record. Over the smooth sands<br/>
Of Leven's ample estuary lay<br/>
My journey, and beneath a genial sun,<br/>
With distant prospect among gleams of sky<br/>
And clouds, and intermingling mountain tops,<br/>
In one inseparable glory clad,<br/>
Creatures of one ethereal substance met<br/>
In consistory, like a diadem<br/>
Or crown of burning seraphs as they sit<br/>
In the empyrean. Underneath that pomp<br/>
Celestial, lay unseen the pastoral vales<br/>
Among whose happy fields I had grown up<br/>
From childhood. On the fulgent spectacle,<br/>
That neither passed away nor changed, I gazed<br/>
Enrapt; but brightest things are wont to draw<br/>
Sad opposites out of the inner heart,<br/>
As even their pensive influence drew from mine.<br/>
How could it otherwise? for not in vain<br/>
That very morning had I turned aside<br/>
To seek the ground where, 'mid a throng of graves,<br/>
An honoured teacher of my youth was laid,<br/>
And on the stone were graven by his desire<br/>
Lines from the churchyard elegy of Gray.<br/>
This faithful guide, speaking from his death-bed,<br/>
Added no farewell to his parting counsel,<br/>
But said to me, "My head will soon lie low;"<br/>
And when I saw the turf that covered him,<br/>
After the lapse of full eight years, those words,<br/>
With sound of voice and countenance of the Man,<br/>
Came back upon me, so that some few tears<br/>
Fell from me in my own despite. But now<br/>
I thought, still traversing that widespread plain,<br/>
With tender pleasure of the verses graven<br/>
Upon his tombstone, whispering to myself:<br/>
He loved the Poets, and, if now alive,<br/>
Would have loved me, as one not destitute<br/>
Of promise, nor belying the kind hope<br/>
That he had formed, when I, at his command,<br/>
Began to spin, with toil, my earliest songs.
</p>
<p>
As I advanced, all that I saw or felt<br/>
Was gentleness and peace. Upon a small<br/>
And rocky island near, a fragment stood<br/>
(Itself like a sea rock) the low remains<br/>
(With shells encrusted, dark with briny weeds)<br/>
Of a dilapidated structure, once<br/>
A Romish chapel, where the vested priest<br/>
Said matins at the hour that suited those<br/>
Who crossed the sands with ebb of morning tide.<br/>
Not far from that still ruin all the plain<br/>
Lay spotted with a variegated crowd<br/>
Of vehicles and travellers, horse and foot,<br/>
Wading beneath the conduct of their guide<br/>
In loose procession through the shallow stream<br/>
Of inland waters; the great sea meanwhile<br/>
Heaved at safe distance, far retired. I paused,<br/>
Longing for skill to paint a scene so bright<br/>
And cheerful, but the foremost of the band<br/>
As he approached, no salutation given<br/>
In the familiar language of the day,<br/>
Cried, "Robespierre is dead!"&mdash;nor was a doubt,<br/>
After strict question, left within my mind<br/>
That he and his supporters all were fallen.
</p>
<p>
Great was my transport, deep my gratitude<br/>
To everlasting Justice, by this fiat<br/>
Made manifest. "Come now, ye golden times,"<br/>
Said I forth-pouring on those open sands<br/>
A hymn of triumph: "as the morning comes<br/>
From out the bosom of the night, come ye:<br/>
Thus far our trust is verified; behold!<br/>
They who with clumsy desperation brought<br/>
A river of Blood, and preached that nothing else<br/>
Could cleanse the Augean stable, by the might<br/>
Of their own helper have been swept away;<br/>
Their madness stands declared and visible;<br/>
Elsewhere will safety now be sought, and earth<br/>
March firmly towards righteousness and peace."&mdash;<br/>
Then schemes I framed more calmly, when and how<br/>
The madding factions might be tranquillised,<br/>
And how through hardships manifold and long<br/>
The glorious renovation would proceed.<br/>
Thus interrupted by uneasy bursts<br/>
Of exultation, I pursued my way<br/>
Along that very shore which I had skimmed<br/>
In former days, when&mdash;spurring from the Vale<br/>
Of Nightshade, and St. Mary's mouldering fane,<br/>
And the stone abbot, after circuit made<br/>
In wantonness of heart, a joyous band<br/>
Of school-boys hastening to their distant home<br/>
Along the margin of the moonlight sea&mdash;<br/>
We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.

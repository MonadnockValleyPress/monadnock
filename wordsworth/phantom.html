<h1>She was a Phantom of delight</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth (1804)</h2>
<p>
She was a Phantom of delight<br/>
When first she gleamed upon my sight;<br/>
A lovely Apparition, sent<br/>
To be a moment's ornament;<br/>
Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair;<br/>
Like Twilight's, too, her dusky hair;<br/>
But all things else about her drawn<br/>
From May-time and the cheerful Dawn;<br/>
A dancing Shape, an Image gay,<br/>
To haunt, to startle, and way-lay.
</p>
<p>
I saw her upon nearer view,<br/>
A Spirit, yet a Woman too!<br/>
Her household motions light and free,<br/>
And steps of virgin-liberty;<br/>
A countenance in which did meet<br/>
Sweet records, promises as sweet;<br/>
A Creature not too bright or good<br/>
For human nature's daily food;<br/>
For transient sorrows, simple wiles,<br/>
Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.
</p>
<p>
And now I see with eye serene<br/>
The very pulse of the machine;<br/>
A Being breathing thoughtful breath,<br/>
A Traveller between life and death;<br/>
The reason firm, the temperate will,<br/>
Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;<br/>
A perfect Woman, nobly planned,<br/>
To warn, to comfort, and command;<br/>
And yet a Spirit still, and bright<br/>
With something of angelic light.

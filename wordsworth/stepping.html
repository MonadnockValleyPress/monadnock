<h1>Stepping Westward</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth (1803)</h2>
<p>
<em>"What, you are stepping westward?"</em>&mdash;<em>"Yea."</em><br/>
'Twould be a <em>wildish</em> destiny,<br/>
If we, who thus together roam<br/>
In a strange Land, and far from home,<br/>
Were in this place the guests of Chance:<br/>
Yet who would stop, or fear to advance,<br/>
Though home or shelter he had none,<br/>
With such a sky to lead him on?
</p>
<p>
The dewy ground was dark and cold;<br/>
Behind, all gloomy to behold;<br/>
And stepping westward seemed to be<br/>
A kind of <em>heavenly</em> destiny:<br/>
I liked the greeting; 'twas a sound<br/>
Of something without place or bound;<br/>
And seemed to give me spiritual right<br/>
To travel through that region bright.
</p>
<p>
The voice was soft, and she who spake<br/>
Was walking by her native lake:<br/>
The salutation had to me<br/>
The very sound of courtesy:<br/>
Its power was felt; and while my eye<br/>
Was fixed upon the glowing Sky,<br/>
The echo of the voice enwrought<br/>
A human sweetness with the thought<br/>
Of travelling through the world that lay<br/>
Before me in my endless way.

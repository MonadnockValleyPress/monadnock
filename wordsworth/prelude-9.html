<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Ninth</h2>
<h3>Residence in France</h3>
<p>
Even as a river,&mdash;partly (it might seem)<br/>
Yielding to old remembrances, and swayed<br/>
In part by fear to shape a way direct,<br/>
That would engulph him soon in the ravenous sea&mdash;<br/>
Turns, and will measure back his course, far back,<br/>
Seeking the very regions which he crossed<br/>
In his first outset; so have we, my Friend!<br/>
Turned and returned with intricate delay.<br/>
Or as a traveller, who has gained the brow<br/>
Of some aerial Down, while there he halts<br/>
For breathing-time, is tempted to review<br/>
The region left behind him; and, if aught<br/>
Deserving notice have escaped regard,<br/>
Or been regarded with too careless eye,<br/>
Strives, from that height, with one and yet one more<br/>
Last look, to make the best amends he may:<br/>
So have we lingered. Now we start afresh<br/>
With courage, and new hope risen on our toil<br/>
Fair greetings to this shapeless eagerness,<br/>
Whene'er it comes! needful in work so long,<br/>
Thrice needful to the argument which now<br/>
Awaits us! Oh, how much unlike the past!
</p>
<p>
Free as a colt at pasture on the hill,<br/>
I ranged at large, through London's wide domain,<br/>
Month after month. Obscurely did I live,<br/>
Not seeking frequent intercourse with men,<br/>
By literature, or elegance, or rank,<br/>
Distinguished. Scarcely was a year thus spent<br/>
Ere I forsook the crowded solitude,<br/>
With less regret for its luxurious pomp,<br/>
And all the nicely-guarded shows of art,<br/>
Than for the humble book-stalls in the streets,<br/>
Exposed to eye and hand where'er I turned.
</p>
<p>
France lured me forth; the realm that I had crossed<br/>
So lately, journeying toward the snow-clad Alps.<br/>
But now, relinquishing the scrip and staff,<br/>
And all enjoyment which the summer sun<br/>
Sheds round the steps of those who meet the day<br/>
With motion constant as his own, I went<br/>
Prepared to sojourn in a pleasant town,<br/>
Washed by the current of the stately Loire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through Paris lay my readiest course, and there<br/>
Sojourning a few days, I visited,<br/>
In haste, each spot of old or recent fame,<br/>
The latter chiefly; from the field of Mars<br/>
Down to the suburbs of St. Antony,<br/>
And from Mont Martyr southward to the Dome<br/>
Of Geneviève. In both her clamorous Halls,<br/>
The National Synod and the Jacobins,<br/>
I saw the Revolutionary Power<br/>
Toss like a ship at anchor, rocked by storms;<br/>
The Arcades I traversed, in the Palace huge<br/>
Of Orléans; coasted round and round the line<br/>
Of Tavern, Brothel, Gaming-house, and Shop,<br/>
Great rendezvous of worst and best, the walk<br/>
Of all who had a purpose, or had not;<br/>
I stared and listened, with a stranger's ears,<br/>
To Hawkers and Haranguers, hubbub wild!<br/>
And hissing Factionists with ardent eyes,<br/>
In knots, or pairs, or single. Not a look<br/>
Hope takes, or Doubt or Fear is forced to wear,<br/>
But seemed there present; and I scanned them all,<br/>
Watched every gesture uncontrollable,<br/>
Of anger, and vexation, and despite,<br/>
All side by side, and struggling face to face,<br/>
With gaiety and dissolute idleness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Where silent zephyrs sported with the dust<br/>
Of the Bastille, I sate in the open sun,<br/>
And from the rubbish gathered up a stone,<br/>
And pocketed the relic, in the guise<br/>
Of an enthusiast; yet, in honest truth,<br/>
I looked for something that I could not find,<br/>
Affecting more emotion than I felt;<br/>
For 'tis most certain, that these various sights,<br/>
However potent their first shock, with me<br/>
Appeared to recompense the traveller's pains<br/>
Less than the painted Magdalene of Le Brun,<br/>
A beauty exquisitely wrought, with hair<br/>
Dishevelled, gleaming eyes, and rueful cheek<br/>
Pale and bedropped with everflowing tears.
</p>
<p>
But hence to my more permanent abode<br/>
I hasten; there, by novelties in speech,<br/>
Domestic manners, customs, gestures, looks,<br/>
And all the attire of ordinary life,<br/>
Attention was engrossed; and, thus amused,<br/>
I stood, 'mid those concussions, unconcerned,<br/>
Tranquil almost, and careless as a flower<br/>
Glassed in a green-house, or a parlour shrub<br/>
That spreads its leaves in unmolested peace,<br/>
While every bush and tree, the country through,<br/>
Is shaking to the roots: indifference this<br/>
Which may seem strange: but I was unprepared<br/>
With needful knowledge, had abruptly passed<br/>
Into a theatre, whose stage was filled<br/>
And busy with an action far advanced.<br/>
Like others, I had skimmed, and sometimes read<br/>
With care, the master pamphlets of the day;<br/>
Nor wanted such half-insight as grew wild<br/>
Upon that meagre soil, helped out by talk<br/>
And public news; but having never seen<br/>
A chronicle that might suffice to show<br/>
Whence the main organs of the public power<br/>
Had sprung, their transmigrations, when and how<br/>
Accomplished, giving thus unto events<br/>
A form and body; all things were to me<br/>
Loose and disjointed, and the affections left<br/>
Without a vital interest. At that time,<br/>
Moreover, the first storm was overblown,<br/>
And the strong hand of outward violence<br/>
Locked up in quiet. For myself, I fear<br/>
Now in connection with so great a theme<br/>
To speak (as I must be compelled to do)<br/>
Of one so unimportant; night by night<br/>
Did I frequent the formal haunts of men,<br/>
Whom, in the city, privilege of birth<br/>
Sequestered from the rest, societies<br/>
Polished in arts, and in punctilio versed;<br/>
Whence, and from deeper causes, all discourse<br/>
Of good and evil of the time was shunned<br/>
With scrupulous care; but these restrictions soon<br/>
Proved tedious, and I gradually withdrew<br/>
Into a noisier world, and thus ere long<br/>
Became a patriot; and my heart was all<br/>
Given to the people, and my love was theirs.
</p>
<p>
A band of military Officers,<br/>
Then stationed in the city, were the chief<br/>
Of my associates: some of these wore swords<br/>
That had been seasoned in the wars, and all<br/>
Were men well-born; the chivalry of France.<br/>
In age and temper differing, they had yet<br/>
One spirit ruling in each heart; alike<br/>
(Save only one, hereafter to be named)<br/>
Were bent upon undoing what was done:<br/>
This was their rest and only hope; therewith<br/>
No fear had they of bad becoming worse,<br/>
For worst to them was come; nor would have stirred,<br/>
Or deemed it worth a moment's thought to stir,<br/>
In any thing, save only as the act<br/>
Looked thitherward. One, reckoning by years,<br/>
Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile<br/>
He had sate lord in many tender hearts;<br/>
Though heedless of such honours now, and changed:<br/>
His temper was quite mastered by the times,<br/>
And they had blighted him, had eaten away<br/>
The beauty of his person, doing wrong<br/>
Alike to body and to mind: his port,<br/>
Which once had been erect and open, now<br/>
Was stooping and contracted, and a face,<br/>
Endowed by Nature with her fairest gifts<br/>
Of symmetry and light and bloom, expressed,<br/>
As much as any that was ever seen,<br/>
A ravage out of season, made by thoughts<br/>
Unhealthy and vexatious. With the hour,<br/>
That from the press of Paris duly brought<br/>
Its freight of public news, the fever came,<br/>
A punctual visitant, to shake this man,<br/>
Disarmed his voice and fanned his yellow cheek<br/>
Into a thousand colours; while he read,<br/>
Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touch<br/>
Continually, like an uneasy place<br/>
In his own body. 'Twas in truth an hour<br/>
Of universal ferment; mildest men<br/>
Were agitated; and commotions, strife<br/>
Of passion and opinion, filled the walls<br/>
Of peaceful houses with unquiet sounds.<br/>
The soil of common life, was, at that time,<br/>
Too hot to tread upon. Oft said I then,<br/>
And not then only, "What a mockery this<br/>
Of history, the past and that to come!<br/>
Now do I feel how all men are deceived,<br/>
Reading of nations and their works, in faith,<br/>
Faith given to vanity and emptiness;<br/>
Oh! laughter for the page that would reflect<br/>
To future times the face of what now is!"<br/>
The land all swarmed with passion, like a plain<br/>
Devoured by locusts,&mdash;Carra, Gorsas,&mdash;add<br/>
A hundred other names, forgotten now,<br/>
Nor to be heard of more; yet, they were powers,<br/>
Like earthquakes, shocks repeated day by day,<br/>
And felt through every nook of town and field.
</p>
<p>
Such was the state of things. Meanwhile the chief<br/>
Of my associates stood prepared for flight<br/>
To augment the band of emigrants in arms<br/>
Upon the borders of the Rhine, and leagued<br/>
With foreign foes mustered for instant war.<br/>
This was their undisguised intent, and they<br/>
Were waiting with the whole of their desires<br/>
The moment to depart.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Englishman,<br/>
Born in a land whose very name appeared<br/>
To license some unruliness of mind;<br/>
A stranger, with youth's further privilege,<br/>
And the indulgence that a half-learnt speech<br/>
Wins from the courteous; I, who had been else<br/>
Shunned and not tolerated, freely lived<br/>
With these defenders of the Crown, and talked,<br/>
And heard their notions; nor did they disdain<br/>
The wish to bring me over to their cause.
</p>
<p>
But though untaught by thinking or by books<br/>
To reason well of polity or law,<br/>
And nice distinctions, then on every tongue,<br/>
Of natural rights and civil; and to acts<br/>
Of nations and their passing interests,<br/>
(If with unworldly ends and aims compared)<br/>
Almost indifferent, even the historian's tale<br/>
Prizing but little otherwise than I prized<br/>
Tales of the poets, as it made the heart<br/>
Beat high, and filled the fancy with fair forms,<br/>
Old heroes and their sufferings and their deeds;<br/>
Yet in the regal sceptre, and the pomp<br/>
Of orders and degrees, I nothing found<br/>
Then, or had ever, even in crudest youth,<br/>
That dazzled me, but rather what I mourned<br/>
And ill could brook, beholding that the best<br/>
Ruled not, and feeling that they ought to rule.
</p>
<p>
For, born in a poor district, and which yet<br/>
Retaineth more of ancient homeliness,<br/>
Than any other nook of English ground,<br/>
It was my fortune scarcely to have seen,<br/>
Through the whole tenor of my school-day time,<br/>
The face of one, who, whether boy or man,<br/>
Was vested with attention or respect<br/>
Through claims of wealth or blood; nor was it least<br/>
Of many benefits, in later years<br/>
Derived from academic institutes<br/>
And rules, that they held something up to view<br/>
Of a Republic, where all stood thus far<br/>
Upon equal ground; that we were brothers all<br/>
In honour, as in one community,<br/>
Scholars and gentlemen; where, furthermore,<br/>
Distinction open lay to all that came,<br/>
And wealth and titles were in less esteem<br/>
Than talents, worth, and prosperous industry.<br/>
Add unto this, subservience from the first<br/>
To presences of God's mysterious power<br/>
Made manifest in Nature's sovereignty,<br/>
And fellowship with venerable books,<br/>
To sanction the proud workings of the soul,<br/>
And mountain liberty. It could not be<br/>
But that one tutored thus should look with awe<br/>
Upon the faculties of man, receive<br/>
Gladly the highest promises, and hail,<br/>
As best, the government of equal rights<br/>
And individual worth. And hence, O Friend!<br/>
If at the first great outbreak I rejoiced<br/>
Less than might well befit my youth, the cause<br/>
In part lay here, that unto me the events<br/>
Seemed nothing out of nature's certain course,<br/>
A gift that was come rather late than soon.<br/>
No wonder, then, if advocates like these,<br/>
Inflamed by passion, blind with prejudice,<br/>
And stung with injury, at this riper day,<br/>
Were impotent to make my hopes put on<br/>
The shape of theirs, my understanding bend<br/>
In honour to their honour: zeal, which yet<br/>
Had slumbered, now in opposition burst<br/>
Forth like a Polar summer: every word<br/>
They uttered was a dart, by counter-winds<br/>
Blown back upon themselves; their reason seemed<br/>
Confusion-stricken by a higher power<br/>
Than human understanding, their discourse<br/>
Maimed, spiritless; and, in their weakness strong,<br/>
I triumphed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime, day by day, the roads<br/>
Were crowded with the bravest youth of France,<br/>
And all the promptest of her spirits, linked<br/>
In gallant soldiership, and posting on<br/>
To meet the war upon her frontier bounds.<br/>
Yet at this very moment do tears start<br/>
Into mine eyes: I do not say I weep&mdash;<br/>
I wept not then,&mdash;but tears have dimmed my sight,<br/>
In memory of the farewells of that time,<br/>
Domestic severings, female fortitude<br/>
At dearest separation, patriot love<br/>
And self-devotion, and terrestrial hope,<br/>
Encouraged with a martyr's confidence;<br/>
Even files of strangers merely seen but once,<br/>
And for a moment, men from far with sound<br/>
Of music, martial tunes, and banners spread,<br/>
Entering the city, here and there a face,<br/>
Or person singled out among the rest,<br/>
Yet still a stranger and beloved as such;<br/>
Even by these passing spectacles my heart<br/>
Was oftentimes uplifted, and they seemed<br/>
Arguments sent from Heaven to prove the cause<br/>
Good, pure, which no one could stand up against,<br/>
Who was not lost, abandoned, selfish, proud,<br/>
Mean, miserable, wilfully depraved,<br/>
Hater perverse of equity and truth.
</p>
<p>
Among that band of Officers was one,<br/>
Already hinted at, of other mould&mdash;<br/>
A patriot, thence rejected by the rest,<br/>
And with an oriental loathing spurned,<br/>
As of a different caste. A meeker man<br/>
Than this lived never, nor a more benign,<br/>
Meek though enthusiastic. Injuries<br/>
Made <em>him</em> more gracious, and his nature then<br/>
Did breathe its sweetness out most sensibly,<br/>
As aromatic flowers on Alpine turf,<br/>
When foot hath crushed them. He through the events<br/>
Of that great change wandered in perfect faith,<br/>
As through a book, an old romance, or tale<br/>
Of Fairy, or some dream of actions wrought<br/>
Behind the summer clouds. By birth he ranked<br/>
With the most noble, but unto the poor<br/>
Among mankind he was in service bound,<br/>
As by some tie invisible, oaths professed<br/>
To a religious order. Man he loved<br/>
As man; and, to the mean and the obscure,<br/>
And all the homely in their homely works,<br/>
Transferred a courtesy which had no air<br/>
Of condescension; but did rather seem<br/>
A passion and a gallantry, like that<br/>
Which he, a soldier, in his idler day<br/>
Had paid to woman: somewhat vain he was,<br/>
Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity,<br/>
But fondness, and a kind of radiant joy<br/>
Diffused around him, while he was intent<br/>
On works of love or freedom, or revolved<br/>
Complacently the progress of a cause,<br/>
Whereof he was a part: yet this was meek<br/>
And placid, and took nothing from the man<br/>
That was delightful. Oft in solitude<br/>
With him did I discourse about the end<br/>
Of civil government, and its wisest forms;<br/>
Of ancient loyalty, and chartered rights,<br/>
Custom and habit, novelty and change;<br/>
Of self-respect, and virtue in the few<br/>
For patrimonial honour set apart,<br/>
And ignorance in the labouring multitude.<br/>
For he, to all intolerance indisposed,<br/>
Balanced these contemplations in his mind;<br/>
And I, who at that time was scarcely dipped<br/>
Into the turmoil, bore a sounder judgment<br/>
Than later days allowed; carried about me,<br/>
With less alloy to its integrity,<br/>
The experience of past ages, as, through help<br/>
Of books and common life, it makes sure way<br/>
To youthful minds, by objects over near<br/>
Not pressed upon, nor dazzled or misled<br/>
By struggling with the crowd for present ends.
</p>
<p>
But though not deaf, nor obstinate to find<br/>
Error without excuse upon the side<br/>
Of them who strove against us, more delight<br/>
We took, and let this freely be confessed,<br/>
In painting to ourselves the miseries<br/>
Of royal courts, and that voluptuous life<br/>
Unfeeling, where the man who is of soul<br/>
The meanest thrives the most; where dignity,<br/>
True personal dignity, abideth not;<br/>
A light, a cruel, and vain world cut off<br/>
From the natural inlets of just sentiment,<br/>
From lowly sympathy and chastening truth;<br/>
Where good and evil interchange their names,<br/>
And thirst for bloody spoils abroad is paired<br/>
With vice at home. We added dearest themes&mdash;<br/>
Man and his noble nature, as it is<br/>
The gift which God has placed within his power,<br/>
His blind desires and steady faculties<br/>
Capable of clear truth, the one to break<br/>
Bondage, the other to build liberty<br/>
On firm foundations, making social life,<br/>
Through knowledge spreading and imperishable,<br/>
As just in regulation, and as pure<br/>
As individual in the wise and good.
</p>
<p>
We summoned up the honourable deeds<br/>
Of ancient Story, thought of each bright spot,<br/>
That would be found in all recorded time,<br/>
Of truth preserved and error passed away;<br/>
Of single spirits that catch the flame from Heaven,<br/>
And how the multitudes of men will feed<br/>
And fan each other; thought of sects, how keen<br/>
They are to put the appropriate nature on,<br/>
Triumphant over every obstacle<br/>
Of custom, language, country, love, or hate,<br/>
And what they do and suffer for their creed;<br/>
How far they travel, and how long endure;<br/>
How quickly mighty Nations have been formed,<br/>
From least beginnings; how, together locked<br/>
By new opinions, scattered tribes have made<br/>
One body, spreading wide as clouds in heaven.<br/>
To aspirations then of our own minds<br/>
Did we appeal; and, finally, beheld<br/>
A living confirmation of the whole<br/>
Before us, in a people from the depth<br/>
Of shameful imbecility uprisen,<br/>
Fresh as the morning star. Elate we looked<br/>
Upon their virtues; saw, in rudest men,<br/>
Self-sacrifice the firmest; generous love,<br/>
And continence of mind, and sense of right,<br/>
Uppermost in the midst of fiercest strife.
</p>
<p>
Oh, sweet it is, in academic groves,<br/>
Or such retirement, Friend! as we have known<br/>
In the green dales beside our Rotha's stream,<br/>
Greta, or Derwent, or some nameless rill,<br/>
To ruminate, with interchange of talk,<br/>
On rational liberty, and hope in man,<br/>
Justice and peace. But far more sweet such toil&mdash;<br/>
Toil, say I, for it leads to thoughts abstruse&mdash;<br/>
If nature then be standing on the brink<br/>
Of some great trial, and we hear the voice<br/>
Of one devoted, one whom circumstance<br/>
Hath called upon to embody his deep sense<br/>
In action, give it outwardly a shape,<br/>
And that of benediction, to the world.<br/>
Then doubt is not, and truth is more than truth,&mdash;<br/>
A hope it is, and a desire; a creed<br/>
Of zeal, by an authority Divine<br/>
Sanctioned, of danger, difficulty, or death.<br/>
Such conversation, under Attic shades,<br/>
Did Dion hold with Plato; ripened thus<br/>
For a Deliverer's glorious task,&mdash;and such<br/>
He, on that ministry already bound,<br/>
Held with Eudemus and Timonides,<br/>
Surrounded by adventurers in arms,<br/>
When those two vessels with their daring freight,<br/>
For the Sicilian Tyrant's overthrow,<br/>
Sailed from Zacynthus,&mdash;philosophic war,<br/>
Led by Philosophers. With harder fate,<br/>
Though like ambition, such was he, O Friend!<br/>
Of whom I speak. So Beaupuis (let the name<br/>
Stand near the worthiest of Antiquity)<br/>
Fashioned his life; and many a long discourse,<br/>
With like persuasion honoured, we maintained:<br/>
He, on his part, accoutred for the worst.<br/>
He perished fighting, in supreme command,<br/>
Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire,<br/>
For liberty, against deluded men,<br/>
His fellow country-men; and yet most blessed<br/>
In this, that he the fate of later times<br/>
Lived not to see, nor what we now behold,<br/>
Who have as ardent hearts as he had then.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Along that very Loire, with festal mirth<br/>
Resounding at all hours, and innocent yet<br/>
Of civil slaughter, was our frequent walk;<br/>
Or in wide forests of continuous shade,<br/>
Lofty and over-arched, with open space<br/>
Beneath the trees, clear footing many a mile&mdash;<br/>
A solemn region. Oft amid those haunts,<br/>
From earnest dialogues I slipped in thought,<br/>
And let remembrance steal to other times,<br/>
When, o'er those interwoven roots, moss-clad,<br/>
And smooth as marble or a waveless sea,<br/>
Some Hermit, from his cell forth-strayed, might pace<br/>
In sylvan meditation undisturbed;<br/>
As on the pavement of a Gothic church<br/>
Walks a lone Monk, when service hath expired,<br/>
In peace and silence. But if e'er was heard,&mdash;<br/>
Heard, though unseen,&mdash;a devious traveller,<br/>
Retiring or approaching from afar<br/>
With speed and echoes loud of trampling hoofs<br/>
From the hard floor reverberated, then<br/>
It was Angelica thundering through the woods<br/>
Upon her palfrey, or that gentle maid<br/>
Erminia, fugitive as fair as she.<br/>
Sometimes methought I saw a pair of knights<br/>
Joust underneath the trees, that as in storm<br/>
Rocked high above their heads; anon, the din<br/>
Of boisterous merriment, and music's roar,<br/>
In sudden proclamation, burst from haunt<br/>
Of Satyrs in some viewless glade, with dance<br/>
Rejoicing o'er a female in the midst,<br/>
A mortal beauty, their unhappy thrall.<br/>
The width of those huge forests, unto me<br/>
A novel scene, did often in this way<br/>
Master my fancy while I wandered on<br/>
With that revered companion. And sometimes&mdash;<br/>
When to a convent in a meadow green,<br/>
By a brook-side, we came, a roofless pile,<br/>
And not by reverential touch of Time<br/>
Dismantled, but by violence abrupt&mdash;<br/>
In spite of those heart-bracing colloquies,<br/>
In spite of real fervour, and of that<br/>
Less genuine and wrought up within myself&mdash;<br/>
I could not but bewail a wrong so harsh,<br/>
And for the Matin-bell to sound no more<br/>
Grieved, and the twilight taper, and the cross<br/>
High on the topmost pinnacle, a sign<br/>
(How welcome to the weary traveller's eyes!)<br/>
Of hospitality and peaceful rest.<br/>
And when the partner of those varied walks<br/>
Pointed upon occasion to the site<br/>
Of Romorentin, home of ancient kings,<br/>
To the imperial edifice of Blois,<br/>
Or to that rural castle, name now slipped<br/>
From my remembrance, where a lady lodged,<br/>
By the first Francis wooed, and bound to him<br/>
In chains of mutual passion, from the tower,<br/>
As a tradition of the country tells,<br/>
Practised to commune with her royal knight<br/>
By cressets and love-beacons, intercourse<br/>
'Twixt her high-seated residence and his<br/>
Far off at Chambord on the plain beneath;<br/>
Even here, though less than with the peaceful house<br/>
Religious, 'mid those frequent monuments<br/>
Of Kings, their vices and their better deeds,<br/>
Imagination, potent to inflame<br/>
At times with virtuous wrath and noble scorn,<br/>
Did also often mitigate the force<br/>
Of civic prejudice, the bigotry,<br/>
So call it, of a youthful patriot's mind;<br/>
And on these spots with many gleams I looked<br/>
Of chivalrous delight. Yet not the less,<br/>
Hatred of absolute rule, where will of one<br/>
Is law for all, and of that barren pride<br/>
In them who, by immunities unjust,<br/>
Between the sovereign and the people stand,<br/>
His helper and not theirs, laid stronger hold<br/>
Daily upon me, mixed with pity too<br/>
And love; for where hope is, there love will be<br/>
For the abject multitude. And when we chanced<br/>
One day to meet a hunger-bitten girl,<br/>
Who crept along fitting her languid gait<br/>
Unto a heifer's motion, by a cord<br/>
Tied to her arm, and picking thus from the lane<br/>
Its sustenance, while the girl with pallid hands<br/>
Was busy knitting in a heartless mood<br/>
Of solitude, and at the sight my friend<br/>
In agitation said, "'Tis against 'that'<br/>
That we are fighting," I with him believed<br/>
That a benignant spirit was abroad<br/>
Which might not be withstood, that poverty<br/>
Abject as this would in a little time<br/>
Be found no more, that we should see the earth<br/>
Unthwarted in her wish to recompense<br/>
The meek, the lowly, patient child of toil,<br/>
All institutes for ever blotted out<br/>
That legalised exclusion, empty pomp<br/>
Abolished, sensual state and cruel power,<br/>
Whether by edict of the one or few;<br/>
And finally, as sum and crown of all,<br/>
Should see the people having a strong hand<br/>
In framing their own laws; whence better days<br/>
To all mankind. But, these things set apart,<br/>
Was not this single confidence enough<br/>
To animate the mind that ever turned<br/>
A thought to human welfare? That henceforth<br/>
Captivity by mandate without law<br/>
Should cease; and open accusation lead<br/>
To sentence in the hearing of the world,<br/>
And open punishment, if not the air<br/>
Be free to breathe in, and the heart of man<br/>
Dread nothing. From this height I shall not stoop<br/>
To humbler matter that detained us oft<br/>
In thought or conversation, public acts,<br/>
And public persons, and emotions wrought<br/>
Within the breast, as ever-varying winds<br/>
Of record or report swept over us;<br/>
But I might here, instead, repeat a tale,<br/>
Told by my Patriot friend, of sad events,<br/>
That prove to what low depth had struck the roots,<br/>
How widely spread the boughs, of that old tree<br/>
Which, as a deadly mischief, and a foul<br/>
And black dishonour, France was weary of.
</p>
<p>
Oh, happy time of youthful lovers, (thus<br/>
The story might begin). Oh, balmy time,<br/>
In which a love-knot, on a lady's brow,<br/>
Is fairer than the fairest star in Heaven!<br/>
So might&mdash;and with that prelude <em>did</em> begin<br/>
The record; and, in faithful verse, was given<br/>
The doleful sequel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our little bark<br/>
On a strong river boldly hath been launched;<br/>
And from the driving current should we turn<br/>
To loiter wilfully within a creek,<br/>
Howe'er attractive, Fellow voyager!<br/>
Would'st thou not chide? Yet deem not my pains lost:<br/>
For Vaudracour and Julia (so were named<br/>
The ill-fated pair) in that plain tale will draw<br/>
Tears from the hearts of others, when their own<br/>
Shall beat no more. Thou, also, there may'st read,<br/>
At leisure, how the enamoured youth was driven,<br/>
By public power abased, to fatal crime,<br/>
Nature's rebellion against monstrous law;<br/>
How, between heart and heart, oppression thrust<br/>
Her mandates, severing whom true love had joined,<br/>
Harassing both; until he sank and pressed<br/>
The couch his fate had made for him; supine,<br/>
Save when the stings of viperous remorse,<br/>
Trying their strength, enforced him to start up,<br/>
Aghast and prayerless. Into a deep wood<br/>
He fled, to shun the haunts of human kind;<br/>
There dwelt, weakened in spirit more and more;<br/>
Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through France<br/>
Full speedily resounded, public hope,<br/>
Or personal memory of his own worst wrongs,<br/>
Rouse him; but, hidden in those gloomy shades,<br/>
His days he wasted,&mdash;an imbecile mind.

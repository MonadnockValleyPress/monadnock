<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Third</h2>
<h3>Residence at Cambridge</h3>
<p>
It was a dreary morning when the wheels<br/>
Rolled over a wide plain o'erhung with clouds,<br/>
And nothing cheered our way till first we saw<br/>
The long-roofed chapel of King's College lift<br/>
Turrets and pinnacles in answering files,<br/>
Extended high above a dusky grove, <br/>
</p>
<p>
Advancing, we espied upon the road<br/>
A student clothed in gown and tasselled cap,<br/>
Striding along as if o'ertasked by Time,<br/>
Or covetous of exercise and air;<br/>
He passed&mdash;nor was I master of my eyes<br/>
Till he was left an arrow's flight behind.<br/>
As near and nearer to the spot we drew,<br/>
It seemed to suck us in with an eddy's force.<br/>
Onward we drove beneath the Castle; caught,<br/>
While crossing Magdalene Bridge, a glimpse of Cam;<br/>
And at the <em>Hoop</em> alighted, famous Inn. <br/>
</p>
<p>
My spirit was up, my thoughts were full of hope;<br/>
Some friends I had, acquaintances who there<br/>
Seemed friends, poor simple school-boys, now hung round<br/>
With honour and importance: in a world<br/>
Of welcome faces up and down I roved;<br/>
Questions, directions, warnings and advice,<br/>
Flowed in upon me, from all sides; fresh day<br/>
Of pride and pleasure! to myself I seemed<br/>
A man of business and expense, and went<br/>
From shop to shop about my own affairs,<br/>
To Tutor or to Tailor, as befel,<br/>
From street to street with loose and careless mind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I was the Dreamer, they the Dream; I roamed<br/>
Delighted through the motley spectacle;<br/>
Gowns, grave, or gaudy, doctors, students, streets,<br/>
Courts, cloisters, flocks of churches, gateways, towers:<br/>
Migration strange for a stripling of the hills,<br/>
A northern villager.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the change<br/>
Had waited on some Fairy's wand, at once<br/>
Behold me rich in monies, and attired<br/>
In splendid garb, with hose of silk, and hair<br/>
Powdered like rimy trees, when frost is keen.<br/>
My lordly dressing-gown, I pass it by,<br/>
With other signs of manhood that supplied<br/>
The lack of beard.&mdash;The weeks went roundly on,<br/>
With invitations, suppers, wine and fruit,<br/>
Smooth housekeeping within, and all without<br/>
Liberal, and suiting gentleman's array.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Evangelist St. John my patron was:<br/>
Three Gothic courts are his, and in the first<br/>
Was my abiding-place, a nook obscure; <br/>
Right underneath, the College kitchens made<br/>
A humming sound, less tuneable than bees,<br/>
But hardly less industrious; with shrill notes<br/>
Of sharp command and scolding intermixed.<br/>
Near me hung Trinity's loquacious clock,<br/>
Who never let the quarters, night or day,<br/>
Slip by him unproclaimed, and told the hours<br/>
Twice over with a male and female voice.<br/>
Her pealing organ was my neighbour too;<br/>
And from my pillow, looking forth by light<br/>
Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold<br/>
The antechapel where the statue stood<br/>
Of Newton with his prism and silent face,<br/>
The marble index of a mind for ever<br/>
Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of College labours, of the Lecturer's room<br/>
All studded round, as thick as chairs could stand,<br/>
With loyal students faithful to their books,<br/>
Half-and-half idlers, hardy recusants,<br/>
And honest dunces&mdash;of important days,<br/>
Examinations, when the man was weighed<br/>
As in a balance! of excessive hopes,<br/>
Tremblings withal and commendable fears,<br/>
Small jealousies, and triumphs good or bad,<br/>
Let others that know more speak as they know.<br/>
Such glory was but little sought by me,<br/>
And little won. Yet from the first crude days<br/>
Of settling time in this untried abode,<br/>
I was disturbed at times by prudent thoughts,<br/>
Wishing to hope without a hope, some fears<br/>
About my future worldly maintenance,<br/>
And, more than all, a strangeness in the mind,<br/>
A feeling that I was not for that hour,<br/>
Nor for that place. But wherefore be cast down?<br/>
For (not to speak of Reason and her pure<br/>
Reflective acts to fix the moral law<br/>
Deep in the conscience, nor of Christian Hope,<br/>
Bowing her head before her sister Faith<br/>
As one far mightier), hither I had come,<br/>
Bear witness Truth, endowed with holy powers<br/>
And faculties, whether to work or feel.<br/>
Oft when the dazzling show no longer new<br/>
Had ceased to dazzle, ofttimes did I quit<br/>
My comrades, leave the crowd, buildings and groves,<br/>
And as I paced alone the level fields<br/>
Far from those lovely sights and sounds sublime<br/>
With which I had been conversant, the mind<br/>
Drooped not; but there into herself returning,<br/>
With prompt rebound seemed fresh as heretofore.<br/>
At least I more distinctly recognised<br/>
Her native instincts: let me dare to speak<br/>
A higher language, say that now I felt<br/>
What independent solaces were mine,<br/>
To mitigate the injurious sway of place<br/>
Or circumstance, how far soever changed<br/>
In youth, or to be changed in manhood's prime;<br/>
Or for the few who shall be called to look<br/>
On the long shadows in our evening years,<br/>
Ordained precursors to the night of death.<br/>
As if awakened, summoned, roused, constrained,<br/>
I looked for universal things; perused<br/>
The common countenance of earth and sky:<br/>
Earth, nowhere unembellished by some trace<br/>
Of that first Paradise whence man was driven;<br/>
And sky, whose beauty and bounty are expressed<br/>
By the proud name she bears&mdash;the name of Heaven.<br/>
I called on both to teach me what they might;<br/>
Or turning the mind in upon herself<br/>
Pored, watched, expected, listened, spread my thoughts<br/>
And spread them with a wider creeping; felt<br/>
Incumbencies more awful, visitings<br/>
Of the Upholder of the tranquil soul,<br/>
That tolerates the indignities of Time,<br/>
And, from the centre of Eternity<br/>
All finite motions overruling, lives<br/>
In glory immutable. But peace! enough<br/>
Here to record that I was mounting now<br/>
To such community with highest truth&mdash;<br/>
A track pursuing, not untrod before,<br/>
From strict analogies by thought supplied<br/>
Or consciousnesses not to be subdued.<br/>
To every natural form, rock, fruit or flower,<br/>
Even the loose stones that cover the high-way,<br/>
I gave a moral life: I saw them feel,<br/>
Or linked them to some feeling: the great mass<br/>
Lay bedded in a quickening soul, and all<br/>
That I beheld respired with inward meaning.<br/>
Add that whate'er of Terror or of Love<br/>
Or Beauty, Nature's daily face put on<br/>
From transitory passion, unto this<br/>
I was as sensitive as waters are<br/>
To the sky's influence in a kindred mood<br/>
Of passion; was obedient as a lute<br/>
That waits upon the touches of the wind.<br/>
Unknown, unthought of, yet I was most rich&mdash;<br/>
I had a world about me&mdash;'twas my own;<br/>
I made it, for it only lived to me,<br/>
And to the God who sees into the heart.<br/>
Such sympathies, though rarely, were betrayed<br/>
By outward gestures and by visible looks:<br/>
Some called it madness&mdash;so indeed it was,<br/>
If child-like fruitfulness in passing joy,<br/>
If steady moods of thoughtfulness matured<br/>
To inspiration, sort with such a name;<br/>
If prophecy be madness; if things viewed<br/>
By poets in old time, and higher up<br/>
By the first men, earth's first inhabitants,<br/>
May in these tutored days no more be seen<br/>
With undisordered sight. But leaving this,<br/>
It was no madness, for the bodily eye<br/>
Amid my strongest workings evermore<br/>
Was searching out the lines of difference<br/>
As they lie hid in all external forms,<br/>
Near or remote, minute or vast, an eye<br/>
Which from a tree, a stone, a withered leaf,<br/>
To the broad ocean and the azure heavens<br/>
Spangled with kindred multitudes of stars,<br/>
Could find no surface where its power might sleep;<br/>
Which spake perpetual logic to my soul,<br/>
And by an unrelenting agency<br/>
Did bind my feelings even as in a chain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And here, O Friend! have I retraced my life<br/>
Up to an eminence, and told a tale<br/>
Of matters which not falsely may be called<br/>
The glory of my youth. Of genius, power,<br/>
Creation and divinity itself<br/>
I have been speaking, for my theme has been<br/>
What passed within me. Not of outward things<br/>
Done visibly for other minds, words, signs,<br/>
Symbols or actions, but of my own heart<br/>
Have I been speaking, and my youthful mind.<br/>
O Heavens! how awful is the might of souls,<br/>
And what they do within themselves while yet<br/>
The yoke of earth is new to them, the world<br/>
Nothing but a wild field where they were sown.<br/>
This is, in truth, heroic argument,<br/>
This genuine prowess, which I wished to touch<br/>
With hand however weak, but in the main<br/>
It lies far hidden from the reach of words.<br/>
Points have we all of us within our souls<br/>
Where all stand single; this I feel, and make<br/>
Breathings for incommunicable powers;<br/>
But is not each a memory to himself?<br/>
And, therefore, now that we must quit this theme,<br/>
I am not heartless, for there's not a man<br/>
That lives who hath not known his god-like hours,<br/>
And feels not what an empire we inherit<br/>
As natural beings in the strength of Nature.<br/>
</p>
<p>
No more: for now into a populous plain<br/>
We must descend. A Traveller I am,<br/>
Whose tale is only of himself; even so,<br/>
So be it, if the pure of heart be prompt<br/>
To follow, and if thou, my honoured Friend!<br/>
Who in these thoughts art ever at my side,<br/>
Support, as heretofore, my fainting steps.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It hath been told, that when the first delight<br/>
That flashed upon me from this novel show<br/>
Had failed, the mind returned into herself;<br/>
Yet true it is, that I had made a change<br/>
In climate, and my nature's outward coat<br/>
Changed also slowly and insensibly.<br/>
Full oft the quiet and exalted thoughts<br/>
Of loneliness gave way to empty noise<br/>
And superficial pastimes; now and then<br/>
Forced labour, and more frequently forced hopes;<br/>
And, worst of all, a treasonable growth<br/>
Of indecisive judgments, that impaired<br/>
And shook the mind's simplicity.&mdash;And yet<br/>
This was a gladsome time. Could I behold&mdash;<br/>
Who, less insensible than sodden clay<br/>
In a sea-river's bed at ebb of tide,<br/>
Could have beheld,&mdash;with undelighted heart,<br/>
So many happy youths, so wide and fair<br/>
A congregation in its budding-time<br/>
Of health, and hope, and beauty, all at once<br/>
So many divers samples from the growth<br/>
Of life's sweet season&mdash;could have seen unmoved<br/>
That miscellaneous garland of wild flowers<br/>
Decking the matron temples of a place<br/>
So famous through the world? To me, at least,<br/>
It was a goodly prospect: for, in sooth,<br/>
Though I had learnt betimes to stand unpropped,<br/>
And independent musings pleased me so<br/>
That spells seemed on me when I was alone,<br/>
Yet could I only cleave to solitude<br/>
In lonely places; if a throng was near<br/>
That way I leaned by nature; for my heart<br/>
Was social, and loved idleness and joy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Not seeking those who might participate<br/>
My deeper pleasures (nay, I had not once,<br/>
Though not unused to mutter lonesome songs,<br/>
Even with myself divided such delight,<br/>
Or looked that way for aught that might be clothed<br/>
In human language), easily I passed<br/>
From the remembrances of better things,<br/>
And slipped into the ordinary works<br/>
Of careless youth, unburthened, unalarmed.<br/>
<em>Caverns</em> there were within my mind which sun<br/>
Could never penetrate, yet did there not<br/>
Want store of leafy <em>arbours</em> where the light<br/>
Might enter in at will. Companionships,<br/>
Friendships, acquaintances, were welcome all.<br/>
We sauntered, played, or rioted; we talked<br/>
Unprofitable talk at morning hours;<br/>
Drifted about along the streets and walks,<br/>
Read lazily in trivial books, went forth<br/>
To gallop through the country in blind zeal<br/>
Of senseless horsemanship, or on the breast<br/>
Of Cam sailed boisterously, and let the stars<br/>
Come forth, perhaps without one quiet thought.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Such was the tenor of the second act<br/>
In this new life. Imagination slept,<br/>
And yet not utterly. I could not print<br/>
Ground where the grass had yielded to the steps<br/>
Of generations of illustrious men,<br/>
Unmoved. I could not always lightly pass<br/>
Through the same gateways, sleep where they had slept,<br/>
Wake where they waked, range that inclosure old,<br/>
That garden of great intellects, undisturbed.<br/>
Place also by the side of this dark sense<br/>
Of noble feeling, that those spiritual men,<br/>
Even the great Newton's own ethereal self,<br/>
Seemed humbled in these precincts thence to be<br/>
The more endeared. Their several memories here<br/>
(Even like their persons in their portraits clothed<br/>
With the accustomed garb of daily life)<br/>
Put on a lowly and a touching grace<br/>
Of more distinct humanity, that left<br/>
All genuine admiration unimpaired.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Beside the pleasant Mill of Trompington <br/>
I laughed with Chaucer in the hawthorn shade;<br/>
Heard him, while birds were warbling, tell his tales<br/>
Of amorous passion. And that gentle Bard,<br/>
Chosen by the Muses for their Page of State&mdash;<br/>
Sweet Spenser, moving through his clouded heaven<br/>
With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace,<br/>
I called him Brother, Englishman, and Friend!<br/>
Yea, our blind Poet, who, in his later day,<br/>
Stood almost single; uttering odious truth&mdash;<br/>
Darkness before, and danger's voice behind,<br/>
Soul awful&mdash;if the earth has ever lodged<br/>
An awful soul&mdash;I seemed to see him here<br/>
Familiarly, and in his scholar's dress<br/>
Bounding before me, yet a stripling youth&mdash;<br/>
A boy, no better, with his rosy cheeks<br/>
Angelical, keen eye, courageous look,<br/>
And conscious step of purity and pride.<br/>
Among the band of my compeers was one<br/>
Whom chance had stationed in the very room<br/>
Honoured by Milton's name. O temperate Bard!<br/>
Be it confest that, for the first time, seated<br/>
Within thy innocent lodge and oratory,<br/>
One of a festive circle, I poured out<br/>
Libations, to thy memory drank, till pride<br/>
And gratitude grew dizzy in a brain<br/>
Never excited by the fumes of wine<br/>
Before that hour, or since. Then, forth I ran<br/>
From the assembly; through a length of streets,<br/>
Ran, ostrich-like, to reach our chapel door<br/>
In not a desperate or opprobrious time,<br/>
Albeit long after the importunate bell<br/>
Had stopped, with wearisome Cassandra voice<br/>
No longer haunting the dark winter night.<br/>
Call back, O Friend!  a moment to thy mind,<br/>
The place itself and fashion of the rites.<br/>
With careless ostentation shouldering up<br/>
My surplice,  through the inferior throng I clove<br/>
Of the plain Burghers, who in audience stood<br/>
On the last skirts of their permitted ground,<br/>
Under the pealing organ. Empty thoughts!<br/>
I am ashamed of them: and that great Bard,<br/>
And thou, O Friend! who in thy ample mind<br/>
Hast placed me high above my best deserts,<br/>
Ye will forgive the weakness of that hour,<br/>
In some of its unworthy vanities,<br/>
Brother to many more.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this mixed sort<br/>
The months passed on, remissly, not given up<br/>
To wilful alienation from the right,<br/>
Or walks of open scandal, but in vague<br/>
And loose indifference, easy likings, aims<br/>
Of a low pitch&mdash;duty and zeal dismissed,<br/>
Yet Nature, or a happy course of things<br/>
Not doing in their stead the needful work.<br/>
The memory languidly revolved, the heart<br/>
Reposed in noontide rest, the inner pulse<br/>
Of contemplation almost failed to beat.<br/>
Such life might not inaptly be compared<br/>
To a floating island, an amphibious spot<br/>
Unsound, of spongy texture, yet withal<br/>
Not wanting a fair face of water weeds<br/>
And pleasant flowers.  The thirst of living praise,<br/>
Fit reverence for the glorious Dead, the sight<br/>
Of those long vistas, sacred catacombs,<br/>
Where mighty minds lie visibly entombed,<br/>
Have often stirred the heart of youth, and bred<br/>
A fervent love of rigorous discipline.&mdash;<br/>
Alas! such high emotion touched not me.<br/>
Look was there none within these walls to shame<br/>
My easy spirits, and discountenance<br/>
Their light composure, far less to instil<br/>
A calm resolve of mind, firmly addressed<br/>
To puissant efforts. Nor was this the blame<br/>
Of others, but my own; I should, in truth,<br/>
As far as doth concern my single self,<br/>
Misdeem most widely, lodging it elsewhere:<br/>
For I, bred up 'mid Nature's luxuries,<br/>
Was a spoiled child, and rambling like the wind,<br/>
As I had done in daily intercourse<br/>
With those crystalline rivers, solemn heights,<br/>
And mountains, ranging like a fowl of the air,<br/>
I was ill-tutored for captivity;<br/>
To quit my pleasure, and, from month to month,<br/>
Take up a station calmly on the perch<br/>
Of sedentary peace. Those lovely forms<br/>
Had also left less space within my mind,<br/>
Which, wrought upon instinctively, had found<br/>
A freshness in those objects of her love,<br/>
A winning power, beyond all other power.<br/>
Not that I slighted books, &mdash;that were to lack<br/>
All sense,&mdash;but other passions in me ruled,<br/>
Passions more fervent, making me less prompt<br/>
To in-door study than was wise or well,<br/>
Or suited to those years. Yet I, though used<br/>
In magisterial liberty to rove,<br/>
Culling such flowers of learning as might tempt<br/>
A random choice, could shadow forth a place<br/>
(If now I yield not to a flattering dream)<br/>
Whose studious aspect should have bent me down<br/>
To instantaneous service; should at once<br/>
Have made me pay to science and to arts<br/>
And written lore, acknowledged my liege lord,<br/>
A homage frankly offered up, like that<br/>
Which I had paid to Nature. Toil and pains<br/>
In this recess, by thoughtful Fancy built,<br/>
Should spread from heart to heart; and stately groves,<br/>
Majestic edifices, should not want<br/>
A corresponding dignity within.<br/>
The congregating temper that pervades<br/>
Our unripe years, not wasted, should be taught<br/>
To minister to works of high attempt&mdash;<br/>
Works which the enthusiast would perform with love.<br/>
Youth should be awed, religiously possessed<br/>
With a conviction of the power that waits<br/>
On knowledge, when sincerely sought and prized<br/>
For its own sake, on glory and on praise<br/>
If but by labour won, and fit to endure<br/>
The passing day; should learn to put aside<br/>
Her trappings here, should strip them off abashed<br/>
Before antiquity and stedfast truth<br/>
And strong book-mindedness; and over all<br/>
A healthy sound simplicity should reign,<br/>
A seemly plainness, name it what you will,<br/>
Republican or pious.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these thoughts<br/>
Are a gratuitous emblazonry<br/>
That mocks the recreant age <em>we</em> live in, then<br/>
Be Folly and False-seeming free to affect<br/>
Whatever formal gait of discipline<br/>
Shall raise them highest in their own esteem&mdash;<br/>
Let them parade among the Schools at will,<br/>
But spare the House of God. Was ever known<br/>
The witless shepherd who persists to drive<br/>
A flock that thirsts not to a pool disliked?<br/>
A weight must surely hang on days begun<br/>
And ended with such mockery. Be wise,<br/>
Ye Presidents and Deans, and, till the spirit<br/>
Of ancient times revive, and youth be trained<br/>
At home in pious service, to your bells<br/>
Give seasonable rest, for 'tis a sound<br/>
Hollow as ever vexed the tranquil air;<br/>
And your officious doings bring disgrace<br/>
On the plain steeples of our English Church,<br/>
Whose worship, 'mid remotest village trees,<br/>
Suffers for this. Even Science, too, at hand<br/>
In daily sight of this irreverence,<br/>
Is smitten thence with an unnatural taint,<br/>
Loses her just authority, falls beneath<br/>
Collateral suspicion, else unknown.<br/>
This truth escaped me not, and I confess,<br/>
That having 'mid my native hills given loose<br/>
To a schoolboy's vision, I had raised a pile<br/>
Upon the basis of the coming time,<br/>
That fell in ruins round me. Oh, what joy<br/>
To see a sanctuary for our country's youth<br/>
Informed with such a spirit as might be<br/>
Its own protection; a primeval grove,<br/>
Where, though the shades with cheerfulness were filled,<br/>
Nor indigent of songs warbled from crowds<br/>
In under-coverts, yet the countenance<br/>
Of the whole place should bear a stamp of awe;<br/>
A habitation sober and demure<br/>
For ruminating creatures; a domain<br/>
For quiet things to wander in; a haunt<br/>
In which the heron should delight to feed<br/>
By the shy rivers, and the pelican<br/>
Upon the cypress spire in lonely thought<br/>
Might sit and sun himself.&mdash;Alas! Alas!<br/>
In vain for such solemnity I looked;<br/>
Mine eyes were crossed by butterflies, ears vexed<br/>
By chattering popinjays; the inner heart<br/>
Seemed trivial, and the impresses without<br/>
Of a too gaudy region.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different sight<br/>
Those venerable Doctors saw of old,<br/>
When all who dwelt within these famous walls<br/>
Led in abstemiousness a studious life;<br/>
When, in forlorn and naked chambers cooped<br/>
And crowded, o'er the ponderous books they hung<br/>
Like caterpillars eating out their way<br/>
In silence, or with keen devouring noise<br/>
Not to be tracked or fathered. Princes then<br/>
At matins froze, and couched at curfew-time,<br/>
Trained up through piety and zeal to prize<br/>
Spare diet, patient labour, and plain weeds.<br/>
O seat of Arts! renowned throughout the world!<br/>
Far different service in those homely days<br/>
The Muses' modest nurslings underwent<br/>
From their first childhood: in that glorious time<br/>
When Learning, like a stranger come from far,<br/>
Sounding through Christian lands her trumpet, roused<br/>
Peasant and king; when boys and youths, the growth<br/>
Of ragged villages and crazy huts,<br/>
Forsook their homes, and, errant in the quest<br/>
Of Patron, famous school or friendly nook,<br/>
Where, pensioned, they in shelter might sit down,<br/>
From town to town and through wide scattered realms<br/>
Journeyed with ponderous folios in their hands;<br/>
And often, starting from some covert place,<br/>
Saluted the chance comer on the road,<br/>
Crying, "An obolus, a penny give<br/>
To a poor scholar!" &mdash;when illustrious men,<br/>
Lovers of truth, by penury constrained,<br/>
Bucer, Erasmus, or Melancthon, read<br/>
Before the doors or windows of their cells<br/>
By moonshine through mere lack of taper light.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But peace to vain regrets! We see but darkly<br/>
Even when we look behind us, and best things<br/>
Are not so pure by nature that they needs<br/>
Must keep to all, as fondly all believe,<br/>
Their highest promise. If the mariner,<br/>
When at reluctant distance he hath passed<br/>
Some tempting island, could but know the ills<br/>
That must have fallen upon him had he brought<br/>
His bark to land upon the wished-for shore,<br/>
Good cause would oft be his to thank the surf<br/>
Whose white belt scared him thence, or wind that blew<br/>
Inexorably adverse: for myself<br/>
I grieve not; happy is the gownèd youth,<br/>
Who only misses what I missed, who falls<br/>
No lower than I fell.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not love,<br/>
Judging not ill perhaps, the timid course<br/>
Of our scholastic studies; could have wished<br/>
To see the river flow with ampler range<br/>
And freer pace; but more, far more, I grieved<br/>
To see displayed among an eager few,<br/>
Who in the field of contest persevered,<br/>
Passions unworthy of youth's generous heart<br/>
And mounting spirit, pitiably repaid,<br/>
When so disturbed, whatever palms are won.<br/>
From these I turned to travel with the shoal<br/>
Of more unthinking natures, easy minds<br/>
And pillowy; yet not wanting love that makes<br/>
The day pass lightly on, when foresight sleeps,<br/>
And wisdom and the pledges interchanged<br/>
With our own inner being are forgot.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet was this deep vacation not given up<br/>
To utter waste. Hitherto I had stood<br/>
In my own mind remote from social life,<br/>
(At least from what we commonly so name,)<br/>
Like a lone shepherd on a promontory<br/>
Who lacking occupation looks far forth<br/>
Into the boundless sea, and rather makes<br/>
Than finds what he beholds. And sure it is,<br/>
That this first transit from the smooth delights<br/>
And wild outlandish walks of simple youth<br/>
To something that resembles an approach<br/>
Towards human business, to a privileged world<br/>
Within a world, a midway residence<br/>
With all its intervenient imagery,<br/>
Did better suit my visionary mind,<br/>
Far better, than to have been bolted forth;<br/>
Thrust out abruptly into Fortune's way<br/>
Among the conflicts of substantial life;<br/>
By a more just gradation did lead on<br/>
To higher things; more naturally matured,<br/>
For permanent possession, better fruits,<br/>
Whether of truth or virtue, to ensue.<br/>
In serious mood, but oftener, I confess,<br/>
With playful zest of fancy did we note<br/>
(How could we less?) the manners and the ways<br/>
Of those who lived distinguished by the badge<br/>
Of good or ill report; or those with whom<br/>
By frame of Academic discipline<br/>
We were perforce connected, men whose sway<br/>
And known authority of office served<br/>
To set our minds on edge, and did no more.<br/>
Nor wanted we rich pastime of this kind,<br/>
Found everywhere, but chiefly in the ring<br/>
Of the grave Elders, men unsecured, grotesque<br/>
In character, tricked out like aged trees<br/>
Which through the lapse of their infirmity<br/>
Give ready place to any random seed<br/>
That chooses to be reared upon their trunks.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here on my view, confronting vividly<br/>
Those shepherd swains whom I had lately left,<br/>
Appeared a different aspect of old age;<br/>
How different! yet both distinctly marked,<br/>
Objects embossed to catch the general eye,<br/>
Or portraitures for special use designed,<br/>
As some might seem, so aptly do they serve<br/>
To illustrate Nature's book of rudiments&mdash;<br/>
That book upheld as with maternal care<br/>
When she would enter on her tender scheme<br/>
Of teaching comprehension with delight,<br/>
And mingling playful with pathetic thoughts.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The surfaces of artificial life<br/>
And manners finely wrought, the delicate race<br/>
Of colours, lurking, gleaming up and down<br/>
Through that state arras woven with silk and gold;<br/>
This wily interchange of snaky hues,<br/>
Willingly or unwillingly revealed,<br/>
I neither knew nor cared for; and as such<br/>
Were wanting here, I took what might be found<br/>
Of less elaborate fabric. At this day<br/>
I smile, in many a mountain solitude<br/>
Conjuring up scenes as obsolete in freaks<br/>
Of character, in points of wit as broad,<br/>
As aught by wooden images performed<br/>
For entertainment of the gaping crowd<br/>
At wake or fair. And oftentimes do flit<br/>
Remembrances before me of old men&mdash;<br/>
Old humourists, who have been long in their graves,<br/>
And having almost in my mind put off<br/>
Their human names, have into phantoms passed<br/>
Of texture midway between life and books.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I play the loiterer: 'tis enough to note<br/>
That here in dwarf proportions were expressed<br/>
The limbs of the great world; its eager strifes<br/>
Collaterally pourtrayed, as in mock fight,<br/>
A tournament of blows, some hardly dealt<br/>
Though short of mortal combat; and whate'er<br/>
Might in this pageant be supposed to hit<br/>
An artless rustic's notice, this way less,<br/>
More that way, was not wasted upon me&mdash;<br/>
And yet the spectacle may well demand<br/>
A more substantial name, no mimic show,<br/>
Itself a living part of a live whole,<br/>
A creek in the vast sea; for, all degrees<br/>
And shapes of spurious fame and short-lived praise<br/>
Here sate in state, and fed with daily alms<br/>
Retainers won away from solid good;<br/>
And here was Labour, his own bond-slave; Hope,<br/>
That never set the pains against the prize;<br/>
Idleness halting with his weary clog,<br/>
And poor misguided Shame, and witless Fear,<br/>
And simple Pleasure foraging for Death;<br/>
Honour misplaced, and Dignity astray;<br/>
Feuds, factions, flatteries, enmity, and guile<br/>
Murmuring submission, and bald government,<br/>
(The idol weak as the idolater),<br/>
And Decency and Custom starving Truth,<br/>
And blind Authority beating with his staff<br/>
The child that might have led him; Emptiness<br/>
Followed as of good omen, and meek Worth<br/>
Left to herself unheard of and unknown.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of these and other kindred notices<br/>
I cannot say what portion is in truth<br/>
The naked recollection of that time,<br/>
And what may rather have been called to life<br/>
By after-meditation. But delight<br/>
That, in an easy temper lulled asleep,<br/>
Is still with Innocence its own reward,<br/>
This was not wanting. Carelessly I roamed<br/>
As through a wide museum from whose stores<br/>
A casual rarity is singled out<br/>
And has its brief perusal, then gives way<br/>
To others, all supplanted in their turn;<br/>
Till 'mid this crowded neighbourhood of things<br/>
That are by nature most unneighbourly,<br/>
The head turns round and cannot right itself;<br/>
And though an aching and a barren sense<br/>
Of gay confusion still be uppermost,<br/>
With few wise longings and but little love,<br/>
Yet to the memory something cleaves at last,<br/>
Whence profit may be drawn in times to come.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus in submissive idleness, my Friend!<br/>
The labouring time of autumn, winter, spring,<br/>
Eight months! rolled pleasingly away; the ninth<br/>
Came and returned me to my native hills.

<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Twelfth</h2>
<h3>Imagination and Taste, How Repaired and Restored</h3>
<p>
Long time have human ignorance and guilt<br/>
Detained us, on what spectacles of woe<br/>
Compelled to look, and inwardly oppressed<br/>
With sorrow, disappointment, vexing thoughts,<br/>
Confusion of the judgment, zeal decayed,<br/>
And, lastly, utter loss of hope itself<br/>
And things to hope for! Not with these began<br/>
Our song, and not with these our song must end.&mdash;<br/>
Ye motions of delight, that haunt the sides<br/>
Of the green hills; ye breezes and soft airs,<br/>
Whose subtle intercourse with breathing flowers,<br/>
Feelingly watched, might teach Man's haughty race<br/>
How without injury to take, to give<br/>
Without offence; ye who, as if to show<br/>
The wondrous influence of power gently used,<br/>
Bend the complying heads of lordly pines,<br/>
And, with a touch, shift the stupendous clouds<br/>
Through the whole compass of the sky; ye brooks,<br/>
Muttering along the stones, a busy noise<br/>
By day, a quiet sound in silent night;<br/>
Ye waves, that out of the great deep steal forth<br/>
In a calm hour to kiss the pebbly shore,<br/>
Not mute, and then retire, fearing no storm;<br/>
And you, ye groves, whose ministry it is<br/>
To interpose the covert of your shades,<br/>
Even as a sleep, between the heart of man<br/>
And outward troubles, between man himself,<br/>
Not seldom, and his own uneasy heart:<br/>
Oh! that I had a music and a voice<br/>
Harmonious as your own, that I might tell<br/>
What ye have done for me. The morning shines,<br/>
Nor heedeth Man's perverseness; Spring returns,&mdash;<br/>
I saw the Spring return, and could rejoice,<br/>
In common with the children of her love,<br/>
Piping on boughs, or sporting on fresh fields,<br/>
Or boldly seeking pleasure nearer heaven<br/>
On wings that navigate cerulean skies.<br/>
So neither were complacency, nor peace,<br/>
Nor tender yearnings, wanting for my good<br/>
Through these distracted times; in Nature still<br/>
Glorying, I found a counterpoise in her,<br/>
Which, when the spirit of evil reached its height.<br/>
Maintained for me a secret happiness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This narrative, my Friend! hath chiefly told<br/>
Of intellectual power, fostering love,<br/>
Dispensing truth, and, over men and things,<br/>
Where reason yet might hesitate, diffusing<br/>
Prophetic sympathies of genial faith:<br/>
So was I favoured&mdash;such my happy lot&mdash;<br/>
Until that natural graciousness of mind<br/>
Gave way to overpressure from the times<br/>
And their disastrous issues. What availed,<br/>
When spells forbade the voyager to land,<br/>
That fragrant notice of a pleasant shore<br/>
Wafted, at intervals, from many a bower<br/>
Of blissful gratitude and fearless love?<br/>
Dare I avow that wish was mine to see,<br/>
And hope that future times <em>would</em> surely see,<br/>
The man to come, parted, as by a gulph,<br/>
From him who had been; that I could no more<br/>
Trust the elevation which had made me one<br/>
With the great family that still survives<br/>
To illuminate the abyss of ages past,<br/>
Sage, warrior, patriot, hero; for it seemed<br/>
That their best virtues were not free from taint<br/>
Of something false and weak, that could not stand<br/>
The open eye of Reason. Then I said,<br/>
"Go to the Poets, they will speak to thee<br/>
More perfectly of purer creatures;&mdash;yet<br/>
If reason be nobility in man,<br/>
Can aught be more ignoble than the man<br/>
Whom they delight in, blinded as he is<br/>
By prejudice, the miserable slave<br/>
Of low ambition or distempered love?"
</p>
<p>
In such strange passion, if I may once more<br/>
Review the past, I warred against myself&mdash;<br/>
A bigot to a new idolatry&mdash;<br/>
Like a cowled monk who hath forsworn the world,<br/>
Zealously laboured to cut off my heart<br/>
From all the sources of her former strength;<br/>
And as, by simple waving of a wand,<br/>
The wizard instantaneously dissolves<br/>
Palace or grove, even so could I unsoul<br/>
As readily by syllogistic words<br/>
Those mysteries of being which have made,<br/>
And shall continue evermore to make,<br/>
Of the whole human race one brotherhood.
</p>
<p>
What wonder, then, if, to a mind so far<br/>
Perverted, even the visible Universe<br/>
Fell under the dominion of a taste<br/>
Less spiritual, with microscopic view<br/>
Was scanned, as I had scanned the moral world?
</p>
<p>
O Soul of Nature! excellent and fair!<br/>
That didst rejoice with me, with whom I, too,<br/>
Rejoiced through early youth, before the winds<br/>
And roaring waters, and in lights and shades<br/>
That marched and countermarched about the hills<br/>
In glorious apparition, Powers on whom<br/>
I daily waited, now all eye and now<br/>
All ear; but never long without the heart<br/>
Employed, and man's unfolding intellect:<br/>
O Soul of Nature! that, by laws divine<br/>
Sustained and governed, still dost overflow<br/>
With an impassioned life, what feeble ones<br/>
Walk on this earth! how feeble have I been<br/>
When thou wert in thy strength! Nor this through stroke<br/>
Of human suffering, such as justifies<br/>
Remissness and inaptitude of mind,<br/>
But through presumption; even in pleasure pleased<br/>
Unworthily, disliking here, and there<br/>
Liking; by rules of mimic art transferred<br/>
To things above all art; but more,&mdash;for this,<br/>
Although a strong infection of the age,<br/>
Was never much my habit&mdash;giving way<br/>
To a comparison of scene with scene,<br/>
Bent overmuch on superficial things,<br/>
Pampering myself with meagre novelties<br/>
Of colour and proportion; to the moods<br/>
Of time and season, to the moral power,<br/>
The affections and the spirit of the place,<br/>
Insensible. Nor only did the love<br/>
Of sitting thus in judgment interrupt<br/>
My deeper feelings, but another cause,<br/>
More subtle and less easily explained,<br/>
That almost seems inherent in the creature,<br/>
A twofold frame of body and of mind.<br/>
I speak in recollection of a time<br/>
When the bodily eye, in every stage of life<br/>
The most despotic of our senses, gained<br/>
Such strength in <em>me</em> as often held my mind<br/>
In absolute dominion. Gladly here,<br/>
Entering upon abstruser argument,<br/>
Could I endeavour to unfold the means<br/>
Which Nature studiously employs to thwart<br/>
This tyranny, summons all the senses each<br/>
To counteract the other, and themselves,<br/>
And makes them all, and the objects with which all<br/>
Are conversant, subservient in their turn<br/>
To the great ends of Liberty and Power.<br/>
But leave we this: enough that my delights<br/>
(Such as they were) were sought insatiably.<br/>
Vivid the transport, vivid though not profound;<br/>
I roamed from hill to hill, from rock to rock,<br/>
Still craving combinations of new forms,<br/>
New pleasure, wider empire for the sight,<br/>
Proud of her own endowments, and rejoiced<br/>
To lay the inner faculties asleep.<br/>
Amid the turns and counterturns, the strife<br/>
And various trials of our complex being,<br/>
As we grow up, such thraldom of that sense<br/>
Seems hard to shun. And yet I knew a maid,<br/>
A young enthusiast, who escaped these bonds;<br/>
Her eye was not the mistress of her heart;<br/>
Far less did rules prescribed by passive taste,<br/>
Or barren intermeddling subtleties,<br/>
Perplex her mind; but, wise as women are<br/>
When genial circumstance hath favoured them,<br/>
She welcomed what was given, and craved no more;<br/>
Whate'er the scene presented to her view,<br/>
That was the best, to that she was attuned<br/>
By her benign simplicity of life,<br/>
And through a perfect happiness of soul,<br/>
Whose variegated feelings were in this<br/>
Sisters, that they were each some new delight.<br/>
Birds in the bower, and lambs in the green field,<br/>
Could they have known her, would have loved; methought<br/>
Her very presence such a sweetness breathed,<br/>
That flowers, and trees, and even the silent hills,<br/>
And every thing she looked on, should have had<br/>
An intimation how she bore herself<br/>
Towards them and to all creatures. God delights<br/>
In such a being; for her common thoughts<br/>
Are piety, her life is gratitude.
</p>
<p>
Even like this maid, before I was called forth<br/>
From the retirement of my native hills,<br/>
I loved whate'er I saw: nor lightly loved,<br/>
But most intensely; never dreamt of aught<br/>
More grand, more fair, more exquisitely framed<br/>
Than those few nooks to which my happy feet<br/>
Were limited. I had not at that time<br/>
Lived long enough, nor in the least survived<br/>
The first diviner influence of this world,<br/>
As it appears to unaccustomed eyes.<br/>
Worshipping then among the depth of things,<br/>
As piety ordained; could I submit<br/>
To measured admiration, or to aught<br/>
That should preclude humility and love?<br/>
I felt, observed, and pondered; did not judge,<br/>
Yea, never thought of judging; with the gift<br/>
Of all this glory filled and satisfied.<br/>
And afterwards, when through the gorgeous Alps<br/>
Roaming, I carried with me the same heart:<br/>
In truth, the degradation&mdash;howsoe'er<br/>
Induced, effect, in whatsoe'er degree,<br/>
Of custom that prepares a partial scale<br/>
In which the little oft outweighs the great;<br/>
Or any other cause that hath been named;<br/>
Or lastly, aggravated by the times<br/>
And their impassioned sounds, which well might make<br/>
The milder minstrelsies of rural scenes<br/>
Inaudible&mdash;was transient; I had known<br/>
Too forcibly, too early in my life,<br/>
Visitings of imaginative power<br/>
For this to last: I shook the habit off<br/>
Entirely and for ever, and again<br/>
In Nature's presence stood, as now I stand,<br/>
A sensitive being, a <em>creative</em> soul.
</p>
<p>
There are in our existence spots of time,<br/>
That with distinct pre-eminence retain<br/>
A renovating virtue, whence, depressed<br/>
By false opinion and contentious thought,<br/>
Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight,<br/>
In trivial occupations, and the round<br/>
Of ordinary intercourse, our minds<br/>
Are nourished and invisibly repaired;<br/>
A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,<br/>
That penetrates, enables us to mount,<br/>
When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen.<br/>
This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks<br/>
Among those passages of life that give<br/>
Profoundest knowledge to what point, and how,<br/>
The mind is lord and master&mdash;outward sense<br/>
The obedient servant of her will. Such moments<br/>
Are scattered everywhere, taking their date<br/>
From our first childhood. I remember well,<br/>
That once, while yet my inexperienced hand<br/>
Could scarcely hold a bridle, with proud hopes<br/>
I mounted, and we journeyed towards the hills:<br/>
An ancient servant of my father's house<br/>
Was with me, my encourager and guide:<br/>
We had not travelled long, ere some mischance<br/>
Disjoined me from my comrade; and, through fear<br/>
Dismounting, down the rough and stony moor<br/>
I led my horse, and, stumbling on, at length<br/>
Came to a bottom, where in former times<br/>
A murderer had been hung in iron chains.<br/>
The gibbet-mast had mouldered down, the bones<br/>
And iron case were gone; but on the turf,<br/>
Hard by, soon after that fell deed was wrought,<br/>
Some unknown hand had carved the murderer's name.<br/>
The monumental letters were inscribed<br/>
In times long past; but still, from year to year,<br/>
By superstition of the neighbourhood,<br/>
The grass is cleared away, and to this hour<br/>
The characters are fresh and visible:<br/>
A casual glance had shown them, and I fled,<br/>
Faltering and faint, and ignorant of the road:<br/>
Then, reascending the bare common, saw<br/>
A naked pool that lay beneath the hills,<br/>
The beacon on the summit, and, more near,<br/>
A girl, who bore a pitcher on her head,<br/>
And seemed with difficult steps to force her way<br/>
Against the blowing wind. It was, in truth,<br/>
An ordinary sight; but I should need<br/>
Colours and words that are unknown to man,<br/>
To paint the visionary dreariness<br/>
Which, while I looked all round for my lost guide,<br/>
Invested moorland waste, and naked pool,<br/>
The beacon crowning the lone eminence,<br/>
The female and her garments vexed and tossed<br/>
By the strong wind. When, in the blessed hours<br/>
Of early love, the loved one at my side,<br/>
I roamed, in daily presence of this scene,<br/>
Upon the naked pool and dreary crags,<br/>
And on the melancholy beacon, fell<br/>
A spirit of pleasure and youth's golden gleam;<br/>
And think ye not with radiance more sublime<br/>
For these remembrances, and for the power<br/>
They had left behind? So feeling comes in aid<br/>
Of feeling, and diversity of strength<br/>
Attends us, if but once we have been strong.<br/>
Oh! mystery of man, from what a depth<br/>
Proceed thy honours. I am lost, but see<br/>
In simple childhood something of the base<br/>
On which thy greatness stands; but this I feel,<br/>
That from thyself it comes, that thou must give,<br/>
Else never canst receive. The days gone by<br/>
Return upon me almost from the dawn<br/>
Of life: the hiding-places of man's power<br/>
Open; I would approach them, but they close.<br/>
I see by glimpses now; when age comes on,<br/>
May scarcely see at all; and I would give,<br/>
While yet we may, as far as words can give,<br/>
Substance and life to what I feel, enshrining,<br/>
Such is my hope, the spirit of the Past<br/>
For future restoration.&mdash;Yet another<br/>
Of these memorials;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Christmas-time,<br/>
On the glad eve of its dear holidays,<br/>
Feverish, and tired, and restless, I went forth<br/>
Into the fields, impatient for the sight<br/>
Of those led palfreys that should bear us home;<br/>
My brothers and myself. There rose a crag,<br/>
That, from the meeting-point of two highways<br/>
Ascending, overlooked them both, far stretched;<br/>
Thither, uncertain on which road to fix<br/>
My expectation, thither I repaired,<br/>
Scout-like, and gained the summit; 'twas a day<br/>
Tempestuous, dark, and wild, and on the grass<br/>
I sate half-sheltered by a naked wall;<br/>
Upon my right hand couched a single sheep,<br/>
Upon my left a blasted hawthorn stood;<br/>
With those companions at my side, I watched,<br/>
Straining my eyes intensely, as the mist<br/>
Gave intermitting prospect of the copse<br/>
And plain beneath. Ere we to school returned,&mdash;<br/>
That dreary time,&mdash;ere we had been ten days<br/>
Sojourners in my father's house, he died,<br/>
And I and my three brothers, orphans then,<br/>
Followed his body to the grave. The event,<br/>
With all the sorrow that it brought, appeared<br/>
A chastisement; and when I called to mind<br/>
That day so lately past, when from the crag<br/>
I looked in such anxiety of hope;<br/>
With trite reflections of morality,<br/>
Yet in the deepest passion, I bowed low<br/>
To God, Who thus corrected my desires;<br/>
And, afterwards, the wind and sleety rain,<br/>
And all the business of the elements,<br/>
The single sheep, and the one blasted tree,<br/>
And the bleak music from that old stone wall,<br/>
The noise of wood and water, and the mist<br/>
That on the line of each of those two roads<br/>
Advanced in such indisputable shapes;<br/>
All these were kindred spectacles and sounds<br/>
To which I oft repaired, and thence would drink,<br/>
As at a fountain; and on winter nights,<br/>
Down to this very time, when storm and rain<br/>
Beat on my roof, or, haply, at noon-day,<br/>
While in a grove I walk, whose lofty trees,<br/>
Laden with summer's thickest foliage, rock<br/>
In a strong wind, some working of the spirit,<br/>
Some inward agitations thence are brought,<br/>
Whate'er their office, whether to beguile<br/>
Thoughts over busy in the course they took,<br/>
Or animate an hour of vacant ease.

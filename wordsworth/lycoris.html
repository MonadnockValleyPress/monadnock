<h1>Ode to Lycoris</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
Enough of climbing toil! &mdash; Ambition treads<br/>
Here, as 'mid busier scenes, ground steep and rough,<br/>
Or slippery even to peril! and each step,<br/>
As we for most uncertain recompence<br/>
Mount toward the empire of the fickle clouds,<br/>
Each weary step, dwarfing the world below,<br/>
Induces, for its old familiar sights,<br/>
Unacceptable feelings of contempt,<br/>
With wonder mixed &mdash; that Man could e'er be tied,<br/>
In anxious bondage, to such nice array<br/>
And formal fellowship of petty things!<br/>
&mdash; Oh! 'tis the heart that magnifies this life,<br/>
Making a truth and beauty of her own;<br/>
And moss-grown alleys, circumscribing shades,<br/>
And gurgling rills, assist her in the work<br/>
More efficaciously than realms outspread,<br/>
As in a map, before the adventurer's gaze &mdash;<br/>
Ocean and Earth contending for regard.
</p>
<p>
The umbrageous woods are left &mdash; how far beneath!<br/>
But lo! where darkness seems to guard the mouth<br/>
Of yon wild cave, whose jagged brows are fringed<br/>
With flaccid threads of ivy, in the still<br/>
And sultry air, depending motionless.<br/>
Yet cool the space within, and not uncheered<br/>
(As whoso enters shall ere long perceive)<br/>
By stealthy influx of the timid day<br/>
Mingling with night, such twilight to compose<br/>
As Numa loved; when, in the Egerian grot,<br/>
From the sage Nymph appearing at his wish,<br/>
He gained whate'er a regal mind might ask,<br/>
Or need, of counsel breathed through lips divine.
</p>
<p>
Long as the heat shall rage, let that dim cave<br/>
Protect us, there deciphering as we may<br/>
Diluvian records; or the sighs of Earth<br/>
Interpreting; or counting for old Time<br/>
His minutes, by reiterated drops,<br/>
Audible tears, from some invisible source<br/>
That deepens upon fancy &mdash; more and more<br/>
Drawn toward the centre whence those sighs creep forth<br/>
To awe the lightness of humanity.<br/>
Or, shutting up thyself within thyself,<br/>
There let me see thee sink into a mood<br/>
Of gentler thought, protracted till thine eye<br/>
Be calm as water when the winds are gone,<br/>
And no one can tell whither. Dearest Friend!<br/>
We two have known such happy hours together<br/>
That, were power granted to replace them (fetched<br/>
From out the pensive shadows where they lie)<br/>
In the first warmth of their original sunshine,<br/>
Loth should I be to use it: passing sweet<br/>
Are the domains of tender memory!

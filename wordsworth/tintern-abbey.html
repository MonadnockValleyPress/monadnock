<h1>Lines written above Tintern Abbey</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
Five years have past; five summers, with the length<br/>
Of five long winters! and again I hear<br/>
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs<br/>
With a soft inland murmur.&mdash;Once again<br/>
Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,<br/>
That on a wild secluded scene impress<br/>
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect<br/>
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.<br/>
The day is come when I again repose<br/>
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view<br/>
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,<br/>
Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,<br/>
Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves<br/>
'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see<br/>
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines<br/>
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,<br/>
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke<br/>
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!<br/>
With some uncertain notice, as might seem<br/>
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,<br/>
Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire<br/>
The Hermit sits alone.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These beauteous forms,<br/>
Through a long absence, have not been to me<br/>
As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:<br/>
But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din<br/>
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,<br/>
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,<br/>
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;<br/>
And passing even into my purer mind,<br/>
With tranquil restoration:&mdash;feelings too<br/>
Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,<br/>
As have no slight or trivial influence<br/>
On that best portion of a good man's life,<br/>
His little, nameless, unremembered, acts<br/>
Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,<br/>
To them I may have owed another gift,<br/>
Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,<br/>
In which the burthen of the mystery,<br/>
In which the heavy and the weary weight<br/>
Of all this unintelligible world,<br/>
Is lightened:&mdash;that serene and blessed mood,<br/>
In which the affections gently lead us on,&mdash;<br/>
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame<br/>
And even the motion of our human blood<br/>
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep<br/>
In body, and become a living soul:<br/>
While with an eye made quiet by the power<br/>
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,<br/>
We see into the life of things.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If this<br/>
Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft&mdash;<br/>
In darkness and amid the many shapes<br/>
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir<br/>
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,<br/>
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart&mdash;<br/>
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,<br/>
O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,<br/>
How often has my spirit turned to thee!<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,<br/>
With many recognitions dim and faint,<br/>
And somewhat of a sad perplexity,<br/>
The picture of the mind revives again:<br/>
While here I stand, not only with the sense<br/>
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts<br/>
That in this moment there is life and food<br/>
For future years. And so I dare to hope,<br/>
Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first<br/>
I came among these hills; when like a roe<br/>
I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides<br/>
Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,<br/>
Wherever nature led: more like a man<br/>
Flying from something that he dreads, than one<br/>
Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then<br/>
(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,<br/>
And their glad animal movements all gone by)<br/>
To me was all in all.&mdash;I cannot paint<br/>
What then I was. The sounding cataract<br/>
Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,<br/>
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,<br/>
Their colours and their forms, were then to me<br/>
An appetite; a feeling and a love,<br/>
That had no need of a remoter charm,<br/>
By thought supplied, nor any interest<br/>
Unborrowed from the eye.&mdash;That time is past,<br/>
And all its aching joys are now no more,<br/>
And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this<br/>
Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts<br/>
Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,<br/>
Abundant recompence. For I have learned<br/>
To look on nature, not as in the hour<br/>
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes<br/>
The still, sad music of humanity,<br/>
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power<br/>
To chasten and subdue. And I have felt<br/>
A presence that disturbs me with the joy<br/>
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime<br/>
Of something far more deeply interfused,<br/>
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,<br/>
And the round ocean and the living air,<br/>
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:<br/>
A motion and a spirit, that impels<br/>
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,<br/>
And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still<br/>
A lover of the meadows and the woods,<br/>
And mountains; and of all that we behold<br/>
From this green earth; of all the mighty world<br/>
Of eye, and ear,&mdash;both what they half create,<br/>
And what perceive; well pleased to recognise<br/>
In nature and the language of the sense,<br/>
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,<br/>
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul<br/>
Of all my moral being.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor perchance,<br/>
If I were not thus taught, should I the more<br/>
Suffer my genial spirits to decay:<br/>
For thou art with me here upon the banks<br/>
Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,<br/>
My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch<br/>
The language of my former heart, and read<br/>
My former pleasures in the shooting lights<br/>
Of thy wild eyes, Oh! yet a little while<br/>
May I behold in thee what I was once,<br/>
My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,<br/>
Knowing that Nature never did betray<br/>
The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,<br/>
Through all the years of this our life, to lead<br/>
From joy to joy: for she can so inform<br/>
The mind that is within us, so impress<br/>
With quietness and beauty, and so feed<br/>
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,<br/>
Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,<br/>
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all<br/>
The dreary intercourse of daily life,<br/>
Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb<br/>
Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold<br/>
Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon<br/>
Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;<br/>
And let the misty mountain-winds be free<br/>
To blow against thee: and, in after years,<br/>
When these wild ecstasies shall be matured<br/>
Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind<br/>
Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,<br/>
Thy memory be as a dwelling-place<br/>
For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,<br/>
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,<br/>
Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts<br/>
Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,<br/>
And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance&mdash;<br/>
If I should be where I no more can hear<br/>
Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams<br/>
Of past existence&mdash;wilt thou then forget<br/>
That on the banks of this delightful stream<br/>
We stood together; and that I, so long<br/>
A worshipper of Nature, hither came<br/>
Unwearied in that service: rather say<br/>
With warmer love&mdash;oh! with far deeper zeal<br/>
Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,<br/>
That after many wanderings, many years<br/>
Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,<br/>
And this green pastoral landscape, were to me<br/>
More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!

<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Eighth</h2>
<h3>Retrospect&mdash;Love of Nature Leading to Love of Man</h3>
<p>
What sounds are those, Helvellyn, that are heard<br/>
Up to thy summit, through the depth of air<br/>
Ascending, as if distance had the power<br/>
To make the sounds more audible? What crowd<br/>
Covers, or sprinkles o'er, yon village green?<br/>
Crowd seems it, solitary hill! to thee,<br/>
Though but a little family of men,<br/>
Shepherds and tillers of the ground&mdash;betimes<br/>
Assembled with their children and their wives,<br/>
And here and there a stranger interspersed.<br/>
They hold a rustic fair&mdash;a festival,<br/>
Such as, on this side now, and now on that,<br/>
Repeated through his tributary vales,<br/>
Helvellyn, in the silence of his rest,<br/>
Sees annually, if clouds towards either ocean<br/>
Blown from their favourite resting-place, or mists<br/>
Dissolved, have left him an unshrouded head.<br/>
Delightful day it is for all who dwell<br/>
In this secluded glen, and eagerly<br/>
They give it welcome. Long ere heat of noon,<br/>
From byre or field the kine were brought; the sheep<br/>
Are penned in cotes; the chaffering is begun.<br/>
The heifer lows, uneasy at the voice<br/>
Of a new master; bleat the flocks aloud.<br/>
Booths are there none; a stall or two is here;<br/>
A lame man or a blind, the one to beg,<br/>
The other to make music; hither, too,<br/>
From far, with basket, slung upon her arm,<br/>
Of hawker's wares&mdash;books, pictures, combs, and pins&mdash;<br/>
Some aged woman finds her way again,<br/>
Year after year, a punctual visitant!<br/>
There also stands a speech-maker by rote,<br/>
Pulling the strings of his boxed raree-show;<br/>
And in the lapse of many years may come<br/>
Prouder itinerant, mountebank, or he<br/>
Whose wonders in a covered wain lie hid.<br/>
But one there is, the loveliest of them all,<br/>
Some sweet lass of the valley, looking out<br/>
For gains, and who that sees her would not buy?<br/>
Fruits of her father's orchard, are her wares,<br/>
And with the ruddy produce, she walks round<br/>
Among the crowd, half pleased with, half ashamed<br/>
Of her new office, blushing restlessly.<br/>
The children now are rich, for the old to-day<br/>
Are generous as the young; and, if content<br/>
With looking on, some ancient wedded pair<br/>
Sit in the shade together, while they gaze,<br/>
"A cheerful smile unbends the wrinkled brow,<br/>
The days departed start again to life,<br/>
And all the scenes of childhood reappear,<br/>
Faint, but more tranquil, like the changing sun<br/>
To him who slept at noon and wakes at eve."<br/>
Thus gaiety and cheerfulness prevail,<br/>
Spreading from young to old, from old to young,<br/>
And no one seems to want his share.&mdash;Immense<br/>
Is the recess, the circumambient world<br/>
Magnificent, by which they are embraced:<br/>
They move about upon the soft green turf:<br/>
How little they, they and their doings, seem,<br/>
And all that they can further or obstruct!<br/>
Through utter weakness pitiably dear,<br/>
As tender infants are: and yet how great!<br/>
For all things serve them: them the morning light<br/>
Loves, as it glistens on the silent rocks;<br/>
And them the silent rocks, which now from high<br/>
Look down upon them; the reposing clouds;<br/>
The wild brooks prattling from invisible haunts;<br/>
And old Helvellyn, conscious of the stir<br/>
Which animates this day their calm abode.
</p>
<p>
With deep devotion, Nature, did I feel,<br/>
In that enormous City's turbulent world<br/>
Of men and things, what benefit I owed<br/>
To thee, and those domains of rural peace,<br/>
Where to the sense of beauty first my heart<br/>
Was opened; tract more exquisitely fair<br/>
Than that famed paradise often thousand trees,<br/>
Or Gehol's matchless gardens, for delight<br/>
Of the Tartarian dynasty composed<br/>
(Beyond that mighty wall, not fabulous,<br/>
China's stupendous mound) by patient toil<br/>
Of myriads and boon nature's lavish help;<br/>
There, in a clime from widest empire chosen,<br/>
Fulfilling (could enchantment have done more?)<br/>
A sumptuous dream of flowery lawns, with domes<br/>
Of pleasure sprinkled over, shady dells<br/>
For eastern monasteries, sunny mounts<br/>
With temples crested, bridges, gondolas,<br/>
Rocks, dens, and groves of foliage taught to melt<br/>
Into each other their obsequious hues,<br/>
Vanished and vanishing in subtle chase,<br/>
Too fine to be pursued; or standing forth<br/>
In no discordant opposition, strong<br/>
And gorgeous as the colours side by side<br/>
Bedded among rich plumes of tropic birds;<br/>
And mountains over all, embracing all;<br/>
And all the landscape, endlessly enriched<br/>
With waters running, falling, or asleep.
</p>
<p>
But lovelier far than this, the paradise<br/>
Where I was reared; in Nature's primitive gifts<br/>
Favoured no less, and more to every sense<br/>
Delicious, seeing that the sun and sky,<br/>
The elements, and seasons as they change,<br/>
Do find a worthy fellow-labourer there&mdash;<br/>
Man free, man working for himself, with choice<br/>
Of time, and place, and object; by his wants,<br/>
His comforts, native occupations, cares,<br/>
Cheerfully led to individual ends<br/>
Or social, and still followed by a train<br/>
Unwooed, unthought-of even&mdash;simplicity,<br/>
And beauty, and inevitable grace.
</p>
<p>
Yea, when a glimpse of those imperial bowers<br/>
Would to a child be transport over-great,<br/>
When but a half-hour's roam through such a place<br/>
Would leave behind a dance of images,<br/>
That shall break in upon his sleep for weeks;<br/>
Even then the common haunts of the green earth,<br/>
And ordinary interests of man,<br/>
Which they embosom, all without regard<br/>
As both may seem, are fastening on the heart<br/>
Insensibly, each with the other's help.<br/>
For me, when my affections first were led<br/>
From kindred, friends, and playmates, to partake<br/>
Love for the human creature's absolute self,<br/>
That noticeable kindliness of heart<br/>
Sprang out of fountains, there abounding most<br/>
Where sovereign Nature dictated the tasks<br/>
And occupations which her beauty adorned,<br/>
And Shepherds were the men that pleased me first;<br/>
Not such as Saturn ruled 'mid Latian wilds,<br/>
With arts and laws so tempered, that their lives<br/>
Left, even to us toiling in this late day,<br/>
A bright tradition of the golden age;<br/>
Not such as, 'mid Arcadian fastnesses<br/>
Sequestered, handed down among themselves<br/>
Felicity, in Grecian song renowned;<br/>
Nor such as&mdash;when an adverse fate had driven,<br/>
From house and home, the courtly band whose fortunes<br/>
Entered, with Shakespeare's genius, the wild woods<br/>
Of Arden&mdash;amid sunshine or in shade,<br/>
Culled the best fruits of Time's uncounted hours,<br/>
Ere Phoebe sighed for the false Ganymede;<br/>
Or there where Perdita and Florizel<br/>
Together danced, Queen of the feast, and King;<br/>
Nor such as Spenser fabled. True it is,<br/>
That I had heard (what he perhaps had seen)<br/>
Of maids at sunrise bringing in from far<br/>
Their May-bush, and along the streets in flocks<br/>
Parading with a song of taunting rhymes,<br/>
Aimed at the laggards slumbering within doors;<br/>
Had also heard, from those who yet remembered,<br/>
Tales of the May-pole dance, and wreaths that decked<br/>
Porch, door-way, or kirk-pillar; and of youths,<br/>
Each with his maid, before the sun was up,<br/>
By annual custom, issuing forth in troops,<br/>
To drink the waters of some sainted well,<br/>
And hang it round with garlands. Love survives;<br/>
But, for such purpose, flowers no longer grow:<br/>
The times, too sage, perhaps too proud, have dropped<br/>
These lighter graces; and the rural ways<br/>
And manners which my childhood looked upon<br/>
Were the unluxuriant produce of a life<br/>
Intent on little but substantial needs,<br/>
Yet rich in beauty, beauty that was felt.<br/>
But images of danger and distress,<br/>
Man suffering among awful Powers and Forms;<br/>
Of this I heard, and saw enough to make<br/>
Imagination restless; nor was free<br/>
Myself from frequent perils; nor were tales<br/>
Wanting,&mdash;the tragedies of former times,<br/>
Hazards and strange escapes, of which the rocks<br/>
Immutable and overflowing streams,<br/>
Where'er I roamed, were speaking monuments.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Smooth life had flock and shepherd in old time,<br/>
Long springs and tepid winters, on the banks<br/>
Of delicate Galesus; and no less<br/>
Those scattered along Adria's myrtle shores:<br/>
Smooth life had herdsman, and his snow-white herd<br/>
To triumphs and to sacrificial rites<br/>
Devoted, on the inviolable stream<br/>
Of rich Clitumnus; and the goat-herd lived<br/>
As calmly, underneath the pleasant brows<br/>
Of cool Lucretilis, where the pipe was heard<br/>
Of Pan, Invisible God, thrilling the rocks<br/>
With tutelary music, from all harm<br/>
The fold protecting. I myself, mature<br/>
In manhood then, have seen a pastoral tract<br/>
Like one of these, where Fancy might run wild,<br/>
Though under skies less generous, less serene:<br/>
There, for her own delight had Nature framed<br/>
A pleasure-ground, diffused a fair expanse<br/>
Of level pasture, islanded with groves<br/>
And banked with woody risings; but the Plain<br/>
Endless, here opening widely out, and there<br/>
Shut up in lesser lakes or beds of lawn<br/>
And intricate recesses, creek or bay<br/>
Sheltered within a shelter, where at large<br/>
The shepherd strays, a rolling hut his home.<br/>
Thither he comes with spring-time, there abides<br/>
All summer, and at sunrise ye may hear<br/>
His flageolet to liquid notes of love<br/>
Attuned, or sprightly fife resounding far.<br/>
Nook is there none, nor tract of that vast space<br/>
Where passage opens, but the same shall have<br/>
In turn its visitant, telling there his hours<br/>
In unlaborious pleasure, with no task<br/>
More toilsome than to carve a beechen bowl<br/>
For spring or fountain, which the traveller finds,<br/>
When through the region he pursues at will<br/>
His devious course. A glimpse of such sweet life<br/>
I saw when, from the melancholy walls<br/>
Of Goslar, once imperial, I renewed<br/>
My daily walk along that wide champaign,<br/>
That, reaching to her gates, spreads east and west,<br/>
And northwards, from beneath the mountainous verge<br/>
Of the Hercynian forest, Yet, hail to you<br/>
Moors, mountains, headlands, and ye hollow vales,<br/>
Ye long deep channels for the Atlantic's voice,<br/>
Powers of my native region! Ye that seize<br/>
The heart with firmer grasp! Your snows and streams<br/>
Ungovernable, and your terrifying winds,<br/>
That howl so dismally for him who treads<br/>
Companionless your awful solitudes!<br/>
There, 'tis the shepherd's task the winter long<br/>
To wait upon the storms: of their approach<br/>
Sagacious, into sheltering coves he drives<br/>
His flock, and thither from the homestead bears<br/>
A toilsome burden up the craggy ways,<br/>
And deals it out, their regular nourishment<br/>
Strewn on the frozen snow. And when the spring<br/>
Looks out, and all the pastures dance with lambs,<br/>
And when the flock, with warmer weather, climbs<br/>
Higher and higher, him his office leads<br/>
To watch their goings, whatsoever track<br/>
The wanderers choose. For this he quits his home<br/>
At day-spring, and no sooner doth the sun<br/>
Begin to strike him with a fire-like heat,<br/>
Than he lies down upon some shining rock,<br/>
And breakfasts with his dog. When they have stolen,<br/>
As is their wont, a pittance from strict time,<br/>
For rest not needed or exchange of love,<br/>
Then from his couch he starts; and now his feet<br/>
Crush out a livelier fragrance from the flowers<br/>
Of lowly thyme, by Nature's skill enwrought<br/>
In the wild turf: the lingering dews of morn<br/>
Smoke round him, as from hill to hill he hies,<br/>
His staff protending like a hunter's spear,<br/>
Or by its aid leaping from crag to crag,<br/>
And o'er the brawling beds of unbridged streams.<br/>
Philosophy, methinks, at Fancy's call,<br/>
Might deign to follow him through what he does<br/>
Or sees in his day's march; himself he feels,<br/>
In those vast regions where his service lies,<br/>
A freeman, wedded to his life of hope<br/>
And hazard, and hard labour interchanged<br/>
With that majestic indolence so dear<br/>
To native man. A rambling school-boy, thus<br/>
I felt his presence in his own domain,<br/>
As of a lord and master, or a power,<br/>
Or genius, under Nature, under God,<br/>
Presiding; and severest solitude<br/>
Had more commanding looks when he was there.<br/>
When up the lonely brooks on rainy days<br/>
Angling I went, or trod the trackless hills<br/>
By mists bewildered, suddenly mine eyes<br/>
Have glanced upon him distant a few steps,<br/>
In size a giant, stalking through thick fog,<br/>
His sheep like Greenland bears; or, as he stepped<br/>
Beyond the boundary line of some hill-shadow,<br/>
His form hath flashed upon me, glorified<br/>
By the deep radiance of the setting sun:<br/>
Or him have I descried in distant sky,<br/>
A solitary object and sublime,<br/>
Above all height! like an aerial cross<br/>
Stationed alone upon a spiry rock<br/>
Of the Chartreuse, for worship. Thus was man<br/>
Ennobled outwardly before my sight,<br/>
And thus my heart was early introduced<br/>
To an unconscious love and reverence<br/>
Of human nature; hence the human form<br/>
To me became an index of delight,<br/>
Of grace and honour, power and worthiness.<br/>
Meanwhile this creature&mdash;spiritual almost<br/>
As those of books, but more exalted far;<br/>
Far more of an imaginative form<br/>
Than the gay Corin of the groves, who lives<br/>
For his own fancies, or to dance by the hour,<br/>
In coronal, with Phyllis in the midst&mdash;<br/>
Was, for the purposes of kind, a man<br/>
With the most common; husband, father; learned,<br/>
Could teach, admonish; suffered with the rest<br/>
From vice and folly, wretchedness and fear;<br/>
Of this I little saw, cared less for it,<br/>
But something must have felt.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call ye these appearances<br/>
Which I beheld of shepherds in my youth,<br/>
This sanctity of Nature given to man,<br/>
A shadow, a delusion? ye who pore<br/>
On the dead letter, miss the spirit of things;<br/>
Whose truth is not a motion or a shape<br/>
Instinct with vital functions, but a block<br/>
Or waxen image which yourselves have made,<br/>
And ye adore! But blessed be the God<br/>
Of Nature and of Man that this was so;<br/>
That men before my inexperienced eyes<br/>
Did first present themselves thus purified,<br/>
Removed, and to a distance that was fit:<br/>
And so we all of us in some degree<br/>
Are led to knowledge, wheresoever led,<br/>
And howsoever; were it otherwise,<br/>
And we found evil fast as we find good<br/>
In our first years, or think that it is found,<br/>
How could the innocent heart bear up and live!<br/>
But doubly fortunate my lot; not here<br/>
Alone, that something of a better life<br/>
Perhaps was round me than it is the privilege<br/>
Of most to move in, but that first I looked<br/>
At Man through objects that were great or fair;<br/>
First communed with him by their help. And thus<br/>
Was founded a sure safeguard and defence<br/>
Against the weight of meanness, selfish cares,<br/>
Coarse manners, vulgar passions, that beat in<br/>
On all sides from the ordinary world<br/>
In which we traffic. Starting from this point<br/>
I had my face turned toward the truth, began<br/>
With an advantage furnished by that kind<br/>
Of prepossession, without which the soul<br/>
Receives no knowledge that can bring forth good,<br/>
No genuine insight ever comes to her.<br/>
From the restraint of over-watchful eyes<br/>
Preserved, I moved about, year after year,<br/>
Happy, and now most thankful that my walk<br/>
Was guarded from too early intercourse<br/>
With the deformities of crowded life,<br/>
And those ensuing laughters and contempts,<br/>
Self-pleasing, which, if we would wish to think<br/>
With a due reverence on earth's rightful lord,<br/>
Here placed to be the inheritor of heaven,<br/>
Will not permit us; but pursue the mind,<br/>
That to devotion willingly would rise,<br/>
Into the temple and the temple's heart.
</p>
<p>
Yet deem not, Friend! that human kind with me<br/>
Thus early took a place pre-eminent;<br/>
Nature herself was, at this unripe time,<br/>
But secondary to my own pursuits<br/>
And animal activities, and all<br/>
Their trivial pleasures; and when these had drooped<br/>
And gradually expired, and Nature, prized<br/>
For her own sake, became my joy, even then&mdash;<br/>
And upwards through late youth, until not less<br/>
Than two-and-twenty summers had been told&mdash;<br/>
Was Man in my affections and regards<br/>
Subordinate to her, her visible forms<br/>
And viewless agencies: a passion, she,<br/>
A rapture often, and immediate love<br/>
Ever at hand; he, only a delight<br/>
Occasional, an accidental grace,<br/>
His hour being not yet come. Far less had then<br/>
The inferior creatures, beast or bird, attuned<br/>
My spirit to that gentleness of love<br/>
(Though they had long been carefully observed),<br/>
Won from me those minute obeisances<br/>
Of tenderness, which I may number now<br/>
With my first blessings. Nevertheless, on these<br/>
The light of beauty did not fall in vain,<br/>
Or grandeur circumfuse them to no end.
</p>
<p>
But when that first poetic faculty<br/>
Of plain Imagination and severe,<br/>
No longer a mute influence of the soul,<br/>
Ventured, at some rash Muse's earnest call,<br/>
To try her strength among harmonious words;<br/>
And to book-notions and the rules of art<br/>
Did knowingly conform itself; there came<br/>
Among the simple shapes of human life<br/>
A wilfulness of fancy and conceit;<br/>
And Nature and her objects beautified<br/>
These fictions, as in some sort, in their turn,<br/>
They burnished her. From touch of this new power<br/>
Nothing was safe: the elder-tree that grew<br/>
Beside the well-known charnel-house had then<br/>
A dismal look: the yew-tree had its ghost,<br/>
That took his station there for ornament:<br/>
The dignities of plain occurrence then<br/>
Were tasteless, and truth's golden mean, a point<br/>
Where no sufficient pleasure could be found.<br/>
Then, if a widow, staggering with the blow<br/>
Of her distress, was known to have turned her steps<br/>
To the cold grave in which her husband slept,<br/>
One night, or haply more than one, through pain<br/>
Or half-insensate impotence of mind,<br/>
The fact was caught at greedily, and there<br/>
She must be visitant the whole year through,<br/>
Wetting the turf with never-ending tears.
</p>
<p>
Through quaint obliquities I might pursue<br/>
These cravings; when the fox-glove, one by one,<br/>
Upwards through every stage of the tall stem,<br/>
Had shed beside the public way its bells,<br/>
And stood of all dismantled, save the last<br/>
Left at the tapering ladder's top, that seemed<br/>
To bend as doth a slender blade of grass<br/>
Tipped with a rain-drop, Fancy loved to seat,<br/>
Beneath the plant despoiled, but crested still<br/>
With this last relic, soon itself to fall,<br/>
Some vagrant mother, whose arch little ones,<br/>
All unconcerned by her dejected plight,<br/>
Laughed as with rival eagerness their hands<br/>
Gathered the purple cups that round them lay,<br/>
Strewing the turf's green slope.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A diamond light<br/>
(Whene'er the summer sun, declining, smote<br/>
A smooth rock wet with constant springs) was seen<br/>
Sparkling from out a copse-clad bank that rose<br/>
Fronting our cottage. Oft beside the hearth<br/>
Seated, with open door, often and long<br/>
Upon this restless lustre have I gazed,<br/>
That made my fancy restless as itself.<br/>
'Twas now for me a burnished silver shield<br/>
Suspended over a knight's tomb, who lay<br/>
Inglorious, buried in the dusky wood:<br/>
An entrance now into some magic cave<br/>
Or palace built by fairies of the rock;<br/>
Nor could I have been bribed to disenchant<br/>
The spectacle, by visiting the spot.<br/>
Thus wilful Fancy, in no hurtful mood,<br/>
Engrafted far-fetched shapes on feelings bred<br/>
By pure Imagination: busy Power<br/>
She was, and with her ready pupil turned<br/>
Instinctively to human passions, then<br/>
Least understood. Yet, 'mid the fervent swarm<br/>
Of these vagaries, with an eye so rich<br/>
As mine was through the bounty of a grand<br/>
And lovely region, I had forms distinct<br/>
To steady me: each airy thought revolved<br/>
Round a substantial centre, which at once<br/>
Incited it to motion, and controlled.<br/>
I did not pine like one in cities bred,<br/>
As was thy melancholy lot, dear Friend!<br/>
Great Spirit as thou art, in endless dreams<br/>
Of sickliness, disjoining, joining, things<br/>
Without the light of knowledge. Where the harm,<br/>
If, when the woodman languished with disease<br/>
Induced by sleeping nightly on the ground<br/>
Within his sod-built cabin, Indian-wise,<br/>
I called the pangs of disappointed love,<br/>
And all the sad etcetera of the wrong,<br/>
To help him to his grave? Meanwhile the man,<br/>
If not already from the woods retired<br/>
To die at home, was haply as I knew,<br/>
Withering by slow degrees, 'mid gentle airs,<br/>
Birds, running streams, and hills so beautiful<br/>
On golden evenings, while the charcoal pile<br/>
Breathed up its smoke, an image of his ghost<br/>
Or spirit that full soon must take her flight.<br/>
Nor shall we not be tending towards that point<br/>
Of sound humanity to which our Tale<br/>
Leads, though by sinuous ways, if here I shew<br/>
How Fancy, in a season when she wove<br/>
Those slender cords, to guide the unconscious Boy<br/>
For the Man's sake, could feed at Nature's call<br/>
Some pensive musings which might well beseem<br/>
Maturer years.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grove there is whose boughs<br/>
Stretch from the western marge of Thurston-mere,<br/>
With length of shade so thick, that whoso glides<br/>
Along the line of low-roofed water, moves<br/>
As in a cloister. Once&mdash;while, in that shade<br/>
Loitering, I watched the golden beams of light<br/>
Flung from the setting sun, as they reposed<br/>
In silent beauty on the naked ridge<br/>
Of a high eastern hill&mdash;thus flowed my thoughts<br/>
In a pure stream of words fresh from the heart:<br/>
Dear native Regions, wheresoe'er shall close<br/>
My mortal course, there will I think on you;<br/>
Dying, will cast on you a backward look;<br/>
Even as this setting sun (albeit the Vale<br/>
Is no where touched by one memorial gleam)<br/>
Doth with the fond remains of his last power<br/>
Still linger, and a farewell lustre sheds<br/>
On the dear mountain-tops where first he rose.
</p>
<p>
Enough of humble arguments; recal,<br/>
My Song! those high emotions which thy voice<br/>
Has heretofore made known; that bursting forth<br/>
Of sympathy, inspiring and inspired,<br/>
When everywhere a vital pulse was felt,<br/>
And all the several frames of things, like stars,<br/>
Through every magnitude distinguishable,<br/>
Shone mutually indebted, or half lost<br/>
Each in the other's blaze, a galaxy<br/>
Of life and glory. In the midst stood Man,<br/>
Outwardly, inwardly contemplated,<br/>
As, of all visible natures, crown, though born<br/>
Of dust, and kindred to the worm; a Being,<br/>
Both in perception and discernment, first<br/>
In every capability of rapture,<br/>
Through the divine effect of power and love;<br/>
As, more than anything we know, instinct<br/>
With godhead, and, by reason and by will,<br/>
Acknowledging dependency sublime.
</p>
<p>
Ere long, the lonely mountains left, I moved,<br/>
Begirt, from day to day, with temporal shapes<br/>
Of vice and folly thrust upon my view,<br/>
Objects of sport, and ridicule, and scorn,<br/>
Manners and characters discriminate,<br/>
And little bustling passions that eclipse,<br/>
As well they might, the impersonated thought,<br/>
The idea, or abstraction of the kind.
</p>
<p>
An idler among academic bowers,<br/>
Such was my new condition, as at large<br/>
Has been set forth; yet here the vulgar light<br/>
Of present, actual, superficial life,<br/>
Gleaming through colouring of other times,<br/>
Old usages and local privilege,<br/>
Was welcome, softened, if not solemnised.
</p>
<p>
This notwithstanding, being brought more near<br/>
To vice and guilt, forerunning wretchedness<br/>
I trembled,&mdash;thought, at times, of human life<br/>
With an indefinite terror and dismay,<br/>
Such as the storms and angry elements<br/>
Had bred in me; but gloomier far, a dim<br/>
Analogy to uproar and misrule,<br/>
Disquiet, danger, and obscurity.
</p>
<p>
It might be told (but wherefore speak of things<br/>
Common to all?) that, seeing, I was led<br/>
Gravely to ponder&mdash;judging between good<br/>
And evil, not as for the mind's delight<br/>
But for her guidance&mdash;one who was to <em>act</em>,<br/>
As sometimes to the best of feeble means<br/>
I did, by human sympathy impelled:<br/>
And, through dislike and most offensive pain,<br/>
Was to the truth conducted; of this faith<br/>
Never forsaken, that, by acting well,<br/>
And understanding, I should learn to love<br/>
The end of life, and every thing we know.
</p>
<p>
Grave Teacher, stern Preceptress! for at times<br/>
Thou canst put on an aspect most severe;<br/>
London, to thee I willingly return.<br/>
Erewhile my verse played idly with the flowers<br/>
Enwrought upon thy mantle; satisfied<br/>
With that amusement, and a simple look<br/>
Of child-like inquisition now and then<br/>
Cast upwards on thy countenance, to detect<br/>
Some inner meanings which might harbour there.<br/>
But how could I in mood so light indulge,<br/>
Keeping such fresh remembrance of the day,<br/>
When, having thridded the long labyrinth<br/>
Of the suburban villages, I first<br/>
Entered thy vast dominion? On the roof<br/>
Of an itinerant vehicle I sate,<br/>
With vulgar men about me, trivial forms<br/>
Of houses, pavement, streets, of men and things,&mdash;<br/>
Mean shapes on every side: but, at the instant,<br/>
When to myself it fairly might be said,<br/>
The threshold now is overpast, (how strange<br/>
That aught external to the living mind<br/>
Should have such mighty sway! yet so it was),<br/>
A weight of ages did at once descend<br/>
Upon my heart; no thought embodied, no<br/>
Distinct remembrances, but weight and power,&mdash;<br/>
Power growing under weight: alas! I feel<br/>
That I am trifling: 'twas a moment's pause,&mdash;<br/>
All that took place within me came and went<br/>
As in a moment; yet with Time it dwells,<br/>
And grateful memory, as a thing divine.
</p>
<p>
The curious traveller, who, from open day,<br/>
Hath passed with torches into some huge cave,<br/>
The Grotto of Antiparos, or the Den<br/>
In old time haunted by that Danish Witch,<br/>
Yordas; he looks around and sees the vault<br/>
Widening on all sides; sees, or thinks he sees,<br/>
Erelong, the massy roof above his head,<br/>
That instantly unsettles and recedes,&mdash;<br/>
Substance and shadow, light and darkness, all<br/>
Commingled, making up a canopy<br/>
Of shapes and forms and tendencies to shape<br/>
That shift and vanish, change and interchange<br/>
Like spectres,&mdash;ferment silent and sublime!<br/>
That after a short space works less and less,<br/>
Till, every effort, every motion gone,<br/>
The scene before him stands in perfect view<br/>
Exposed, and lifeless as a written book!&mdash;<br/>
But let him pause awhile, and look again,<br/>
And a new quickening shall succeed, at first<br/>
Beginning timidly, then creeping fast,<br/>
Till the whole cave, so late a senseless mass,<br/>
Busies the eye with images and forms<br/>
Boldly assembled,&mdash;here is shadowed forth<br/>
From the projections, wrinkles, cavities,<br/>
A variegated landscape,&mdash;there the shape<br/>
Of some gigantic warrior clad in mail,<br/>
The ghostly semblance of a hooded monk.<br/>
Veiled nun, or pilgrim resting on his staff:<br/>
Strange congregation! yet not slow to meet<br/>
Eyes that perceive through minds that can inspire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Even in such sort had I at first been moved,<br/>
Nor otherwise continued to be moved,<br/>
As I explored the vast metropolis,<br/>
Fount of my country's destiny and the world's;<br/>
That great emporium, chronicle at once<br/>
And burial-place of passions, and their home<br/>
Imperial, their chief living residence.
</p>
<p>
With strong sensations teeming as it did<br/>
Of past and present, such a place must needs<br/>
Have pleased me, seeking knowledge at that time<br/>
Far less than craving power; yet knowledge came,<br/>
Sought or unsought, and influxes of power<br/>
Came, of themselves, or at her call derived<br/>
In fits of kindliest apprehensiveness,<br/>
From all sides, when whate'er was in itself<br/>
Capacious found, or seemed to find, in me<br/>
A correspondent amplitude of mind;<br/>
Such is the strength and glory of our youth!<br/>
The human nature unto which I felt<br/>
That I belonged, and reverenced with love,<br/>
Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit<br/>
Diffused through time and space, with aid derived<br/>
Of evidence from monuments, erect,<br/>
Prostrate, or leaning towards their common rest<br/>
In earth, the widely scattered wreck sublime<br/>
Of vanished nations, or more clearly drawn<br/>
From books and what they picture and record.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Tis true, the history of our native land,<br/>
With those of Greece compared and popular Rome,<br/>
And in our high-wrought modern narratives<br/>
Stript of their harmonising soul, the life<br/>
Of manners and familiar incidents,<br/>
Had never much delighted me. And less<br/>
Than other intellects had mine been used<br/>
To lean upon extrinsic circumstance<br/>
Of record or tradition; but a sense<br/>
Of what in the Great City had been done<br/>
And suffered, and was doing, suffering, still,<br/>
Weighed with me, could support the test of thought;<br/>
And, in despite of all that had gone by,<br/>
Or was departing never to return,<br/>
There I conversed with majesty and power<br/>
Like independent natures. Hence the place<br/>
Was thronged with impregnations like the Wilds<br/>
In which my early feelings had been nursed&mdash;<br/>
Bare hills and valleys, full of caverns, rocks,<br/>
And audible seclusions, dashing lakes,<br/>
Echoes and waterfalls, and pointed crags<br/>
That into music touch the passing wind.<br/>
Here then my young imagination found<br/>
No uncongenial element; could here<br/>
Among new objects serve or give command,<br/>
Even as the heart's occasions might require,<br/>
To forward reason's else too scrupulous march.<br/>
The effect was, still more elevated views<br/>
Of human nature. Neither vice nor guilt,<br/>
Debasement undergone by body or mind,<br/>
Nor all the misery forced upon my sight,<br/>
Misery not lightly passed, but sometimes scanned<br/>
Most feelingly, could overthrow my trust<br/>
In what we <em>may</em> become; induce belief<br/>
That I was ignorant, had been falsely taught,<br/>
A solitary, who with vain conceits<br/>
Had been inspired, and walked about in dreams.<br/>
From those sad scenes when meditation turned,<br/>
Lo! every thing that was indeed divine<br/>
Retained its purity inviolate,<br/>
Nay brighter shone, by this portentous gloom<br/>
Set off; such opposition as aroused<br/>
The mind of Adam, yet in Paradise<br/>
Though fallen from bliss, when in the East he saw<br/>
Darkness ere day's mid course, and morning light<br/>
More orient in the western cloud, that drew<br/>
O'er the blue firmament a radiant white,<br/>
Descending slow with something heavenly fraught.<br/>
Add also, that among the multitudes<br/>
Of that huge city, oftentimes was seen<br/>
Affectingly set forth, more than elsewhere<br/>
Is possible, the unity of man,<br/>
One spirit over ignorance and vice<br/>
Predominant, in good and evil hearts;<br/>
One sense for moral judgments, as one eye<br/>
For the sun's light. The soul when smitten thus<br/>
By a sublime <em>idea</em>, whencesoe'er<br/>
Vouchsafed for union or communion, feeds<br/>
On the pure bliss, and takes her rest with God.<br/>
Thus from a very early age, O Friend!<br/>
My thoughts by slow gradations had been drawn<br/>
To human-kind, and to the good and ill<br/>
Of human life: Nature had led me on;<br/>
And oft amid the "busy hum" I seemed<br/>
To travel independent of her help,<br/>
As if I had forgotten her; but no,<br/>
The world of human-kind outweighed not hers<br/>
In my habitual thoughts; the scale of love,<br/>
Though filling daily, still was light, compared<br/>
With that in which <em>her</em> mighty objects lay.

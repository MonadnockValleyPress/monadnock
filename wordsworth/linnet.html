<h1>The Green Linnet</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed<br/>
Their snow white blossoms on my head,<br/>
With brightest sunshine round me spread<br/>
Of spring's unclouded weather,<br/>
In this sequestered nook how sweet<br/>
To sit upon my orchard-seat!<br/>
And birds and flowers once more to greet,<br/>
My last year's friends together.
</p>
<p>
One have I marked, the happiest guest<br/>
In all this covert of the blest:<br/>
Hail to Thee, far above the rest<br/>
In joy of voice and pinion!<br/>
Thou, Linnet! in thy green array,<br/>
Presiding Spirit here to-day,<br/>
Dost lead the revels of the May;<br/>
And this is thy dominion.
</p>
<p>
While birds, and butterflies, and flowers,<br/>
Make all one band of paramours,<br/>
Thou, ranging up and down the bowers,<br/>
Art sole in thy employment:<br/>
A Life, a Presence like the Air,<br/>
Scattering thy gladness without care,<br/>
Too blest with any one to pair;<br/>
Thyself thy own enjoyment.
</p>
<p>
Amid yon tuft of hazel trees,<br/>
That twinkle to the gusty breeze,<br/>
Behold him perched in ecstacies,<br/>
Yet seeming still to hover;<br/>
There! where the flutter of his wings<br/>
Upon his back and body flings<br/>
Shadows and sunny glimmerings,<br/>
That cover him all over.
</p>
<p>
My dazzled sight he oft deceives,<br/>
A Brother of the dancing leaves;<br/>
Then flits, and from the cottage-eaves<br/>
Pours forth his song in gushes;<br/>
As if by that exulting strain<br/>
He mocked and treated with disdain<br/>
The voiceless Form he chose to feign,<br/>
While fluttering in the bushes.

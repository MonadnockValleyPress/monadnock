<h1>To the Daisy</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
With little here to do or see<br/>
Of things that in the great world be,<br/>
Daisy! again I talk to thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thou art worthy,<br/>
Thou unassuming Common-place<br/>
Of Nature, with that homely face,<br/>
And yet with something of a grace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Love makes for thee!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oft on the dappled turf at ease<br/>
I sit, and play with similes,<br/>
Loose types of things through all degrees,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts of thy raising:<br/>
And many a fond and idle name<br/>
I give to thee, for praise or blame,<br/>
As is the humour of the game,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am gazing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A nun demure of lowly port;<br/>
Or sprightly maiden, of Love's court,<br/>
In thy simplicity the sport<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all temptations;<br/>
A queen in crown of rubies drest;<br/>
A starveling in a scanty vest;<br/>
Are all, as seems to suit thee best,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy appellations.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A little Cyclops with one eye<br/>
Staring to threaten and defy,<br/>
That thought comes next &mdash; and instantly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freak is over,<br/>
The shape will vanish &mdash; and behold<br/>
A silver shield with boss of gold,<br/>
That spreads itself, some faery bold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fight to cover!<br/>
</p>
<p>
I see thee glittering from afar &mdash;<br/>
And then thou art a pretty star;<br/>
Not quite so fair as many are<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In heaven above thee!<br/>
Yet like a star, with glittering crest,<br/>
Self-poised in air thou seem'st to rest; &mdash;<br/>
May peace come never to his nest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall reprove thee!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Bright Flower ! for by that name at last,<br/>
When all my reveries are past,<br/>
I call thee, and to that cleave fast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet silent creature!<br/>
That breath'st with me in sun and air,<br/>
Do thou, as thou art wont, repair<br/>
My heart with gladness, and a share<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy meek nature!<br/>

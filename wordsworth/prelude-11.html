<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Eleventh</h2>
<h3>France&mdash;concluded.</h3>
<p>
From that time forth, Authority in France<br/>
Put on a milder face; Terror had ceased,<br/>
Yet every thing was wanting that might give<br/>
Courage to them who looked for good by light<br/>
Of rational Experience, for the shoots<br/>
And hopeful blossoms of a second spring:<br/>
Yet, in me, confidence was unimpaired;<br/>
The Senate's language, and the public acts<br/>
And measures of the Government, though both<br/>
Weak, and of heartless omen, had not power<br/>
To daunt me; in the People was my trust,<br/>
And, in the virtues which mine eyes had seen.<br/>
I knew that wound external could not take<br/>
Life from the young Republic; that new foes<br/>
Would only follow, in the path of shame,<br/>
Their brethren, and her triumphs be in the end<br/>
Great, universal, irresistible.<br/>
This intuition led me to confound<br/>
One victory with another, higher far,&mdash;<br/>
Triumphs of unambitious peace at home,<br/>
And noiseless fortitude. Beholding still<br/>
Resistance strong as heretofore, I thought<br/>
That what was in degree the same was likewise<br/>
The same in quality,&mdash;that, as the worse<br/>
Of the two spirits then at strife remained<br/>
Untired, the better, surely, would preserve<br/>
The heart that first had roused him. Youth maintains,<br/>
In all conditions of society,<br/>
Communion more direct and intimate<br/>
With Nature,&mdash;hence, ofttimes, with reason too&mdash;<br/>
Than age or manhood, even. To Nature, then,<br/>
Power had reverted: habit, custom, law,<br/>
Had left an interregnum's open space<br/>
For <em>her</em> to move about in, uncontrolled.<br/>
Hence could I see how Babel-like their task,<br/>
Who, by the recent deluge stupified,<br/>
With their whole souls went culling from the day<br/>
Its petty promises, to build a tower<br/>
For their own safety; laughed with my compeers<br/>
At gravest heads, by enmity to France<br/>
Distempered, till they found, in every blast<br/>
Forced from the street-disturbing newsman's horn,<br/>
For her great cause record or prophecy<br/>
Of utter ruin. How might we believe<br/>
That wisdom could, in any shape, come near<br/>
Men clinging to delusions so insane?<br/>
And thus, experience proving that no few<br/>
Of our opinions had been just, we took<br/>
Like credit to ourselves where less was due,<br/>
And thought that other notions were as sound,<br/>
Yea, could not but be right, because we saw<br/>
That foolish men opposed them.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a strain<br/>
More animated I might here give way,<br/>
And tell, since juvenile errors are my theme,<br/>
What in those days, through Britain, was performed<br/>
To turn <em>all</em> judgments out of their right course;<br/>
But this is passion over-near ourselves,<br/>
Reality too close and too intense,<br/>
And intermixed with something, in my mind,<br/>
Of scorn and condemnation personal,<br/>
That would profane the sanctity of verse.<br/>
Our Shepherds, this say merely, at that time<br/>
Acted, or seemed at least to act, like men<br/>
Thirsting to make the guardian crook of law<br/>
A tool of murder; they who ruled the State,<br/>
Though with such awful proof before their eyes<br/>
That he, who would sow death, reaps death, or worse,<br/>
And can reap nothing better, child-like longed<br/>
To imitate, not wise enough to avoid;<br/>
Or left (by mere timidity betrayed)<br/>
The plain straight road, for one no better chosen<br/>
Than if their wish had been to undermine<br/>
Justice, and make an end of Liberty.
</p>
<p>
But from these bitter truths I must return<br/>
To my own history. It hath been told<br/>
That I was led to take an eager part<br/>
In arguments of civil polity,<br/>
Abruptly, and indeed before my time:<br/>
I had approached, like other youths, the shield<br/>
Of human nature from the golden side,<br/>
And would have fought, even to the death, to attest<br/>
The quality of the metal which I saw.<br/>
What there is best in individual man,<br/>
Of wise in passion, and sublime in power,<br/>
Benevolent in small societies,<br/>
And great in large ones, I had oft revolved,<br/>
Felt deeply, but not thoroughly understood<br/>
By reason: nay, far from it; they were yet,<br/>
As cause was given me afterwards to learn,<br/>
Not proof against the injuries of the day;<br/>
Lodged only at the sanctuary's door,<br/>
Not safe within its bosom. Thus prepared,<br/>
And with such general insight into evil,<br/>
And of the bounds which sever it from good,<br/>
As books and common intercourse with life<br/>
Must needs have given&mdash;to the inexperienced mind,<br/>
When the world travels in a beaten road,<br/>
Guide faithful as is needed&mdash;I began<br/>
To meditate with ardour on the rule<br/>
And management of nations; what it is<br/>
And ought to be; and strove to learn how far<br/>
Their power or weakness, wealth or poverty,<br/>
Their happiness or misery, depends<br/>
Upon their laws, and fashion of the State.
</p>
<p>
O pleasant exercise of hope and joy!<br/>
For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood<br/>
Upon our side, us who were strong in love!<br/>
Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,<br/>
But to be young was very Heaven! O times,<br/>
In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways<br/>
Of custom, law, and statute, took at once<br/>
The attraction of a country in romance!<br/>
When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights<br/>
When most intent on making of herself<br/>
A prime enchantress&mdash;to assist the work,<br/>
Which then was going forward in her name!<br/>
Not favoured spots alone, but the whole Earth,<br/>
The beauty wore of promise&mdash;that which sets<br/>
(As at some moments might not be unfelt<br/>
Among the bowers of Paradise itself)<br/>
The budding rose above the rose full blown.<br/>
What temper at the prospect did not wake<br/>
To happiness unthought of? The inert<br/>
Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!<br/>
They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,<br/>
The play-fellows of fancy, who had made<br/>
All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength<br/>
Their ministers,&mdash;who in lordly wise had stirred<br/>
Among the grandest objects of the sense,<br/>
And dealt with whatsoever they found there<br/>
As if they had within some lurking right<br/>
To wield it;&mdash;they, too, who of gentle mood<br/>
Had watched all gentle motions, and to these<br/>
Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,<br/>
And in the region of their peaceful selves;&mdash;<br/>
Now was it that <em>both</em> found, the meek and lofty<br/>
Did both find helpers to their hearts' desire,<br/>
And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish,&mdash;<br/>
Were called upon to exercise their skill,<br/>
Not in Utopia,&mdash;subterranean fields,&mdash;<br/>
Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!<br/>
But in the very world, which is the world<br/>
Of all of us,&mdash;the place where, in the end,<br/>
We find our happiness, or not at all!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Why should I not confess that Earth was then<br/>
To me, what an inheritance, new-fallen,<br/>
Seems, when the first time visited, to one<br/>
Who thither comes to find in it his home?<br/>
He walks about and looks upon the spot<br/>
With cordial transport, moulds it and remoulds,<br/>
And is half pleased with things that are amiss,<br/>
'Twill be such joy to see them disappear.
</p>
<p>
An active partisan, I thus convoked<br/>
From every object pleasant circumstance<br/>
To suit my ends; I moved among mankind<br/>
With genial feelings still predominant;<br/>
When erring, erring on the better part,<br/>
And in the kinder spirit; placable,<br/>
Indulgent, as not uninformed that men<br/>
See as they have been taught&mdash;Antiquity<br/>
Gives rights to error; and aware, no less,<br/>
That throwing off oppression must be work<br/>
As well of License as of Liberty;<br/>
And above all&mdash;for this was more than all&mdash;<br/>
Not caring if the wind did now and then<br/>
Blow keen upon an eminence that gave<br/>
Prospect so large into futurity;<br/>
In brief, a child of Nature, as at first,<br/>
Diffusing only those affections wider<br/>
That from the cradle had grown up with me,<br/>
And losing, in no other way than light<br/>
Is lost in light, the weak in the more strong.
</p>
<p>
In the main outline, such it might be said<br/>
Was my condition, till with open war<br/>
Britain opposed the liberties of France.<br/>
This threw me first out of the pale of love;<br/>
Soured and corrupted, upwards to the source,<br/>
My sentiments; was not, as hitherto,<br/>
A swallowing up of lesser things in great,<br/>
But change of them into their contraries;<br/>
And thus a way was opened for mistakes<br/>
And false conclusions, in degree as gross,<br/>
In kind more dangerous. What had been a pride,<br/>
Was now a shame; my likings and my loves<br/>
Ran in new channels, leaving old ones dry;<br/>
And hence a blow that, in maturer age,<br/>
Would but have touched the judgment, struck more deep<br/>
Into sensations near the heart: meantime,<br/>
As from the first, wild theories were afloat,<br/>
To whose pretensions, sedulously urged,<br/>
I had but lent a careless ear, assured<br/>
That time was ready to set all things right,<br/>
And that the multitude, so long oppressed,<br/>
Would be oppressed no more.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when events<br/>
Brought less encouragement, and unto these<br/>
The immediate proof of principles no more<br/>
Could be entrusted, while the events themselves,<br/>
Worn out in greatness, stripped of novelty,<br/>
Less occupied the mind, and sentiments<br/>
Could through my understanding's natural growth<br/>
No longer keep their ground, by faith maintained<br/>
Of inward consciousness, and hope that laid<br/>
Her hand upon her object&mdash;evidence<br/>
Safer, of universal application, such<br/>
As could not be impeached, was sought elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
But now, become oppressors in their turn,<br/>
Frenchmen had changed a war of self-defence<br/>
For one of conquest, losing sight of all<br/>
Which they had struggled for: now mounted up,<br/>
Openly in the eye of earth and heaven,<br/>
The scale of liberty. I read her doom,<br/>
With anger vexed, with disappointment sore,<br/>
But not dismayed, nor taking to the shame<br/>
Of a false prophet. While resentment rose<br/>
Striving to hide, what nought could heal, the wounds<br/>
Of mortified presumption, I adhered<br/>
More firmly to old tenets, and, to prove<br/>
Their temper, strained them more; and thus, in heat<br/>
Of contest, did opinions every day<br/>
Grow into consequence, till round my mind<br/>
They clung, as if they were its life, nay more,<br/>
The very being of the immortal soul.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This was the time, when, all things tending fast<br/>
To depravation, speculative schemes&mdash;<br/>
That promised to abstract the hopes of Man<br/>
Out of his feelings, to be fixed thenceforth<br/>
For ever in a purer element&mdash;<br/>
Found ready welcome. Tempting region <em>that</em><br/>
For Zeal to enter and refresh herself,<br/>
Where passions had the privilege to work,<br/>
And never hear the sound of their own names.<br/>
But, speaking more in charity, the dream<br/>
Flattered the young, pleased with extremes, nor least<br/>
With that which makes our Reason's naked self<br/>
The object of its fervour. What delight!<br/>
How glorious! in self-knowledge and self-rule,<br/>
To look through all the frailties of the world,<br/>
And, with a resolute mastery shaking off<br/>
Infirmities of nature, time, and place,<br/>
Build social upon personal Liberty,<br/>
Which, to the blind restraints of general laws<br/>
Superior, magisterially adopts<br/>
One guide, the light of circumstances, flashed<br/>
Upon an independent intellect.<br/>
Thus expectation rose again; thus hope,<br/>
From her first ground expelled, grew proud once more.<br/>
Oft, as my thoughts were turned to human kind,<br/>
I scorned indifference; but, inflamed with thirst<br/>
Of a secure intelligence, and sick<br/>
Of other longing, I pursued what seemed<br/>
A more exalted nature; wished that Man<br/>
Should start out of his earthy, worm-like state,<br/>
And spread abroad the wings of Liberty,<br/>
Lord of himself, in undisturbed delight&mdash;<br/>
A noble aspiration! <em>yet</em> I feel<br/>
(Sustained by worthier as by wiser thoughts)<br/>
The aspiration, nor shall ever cease<br/>
To feel it;&mdash;but return we to our course.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Enough, 'tis true&mdash;could such a plea excuse<br/>
Those aberrations&mdash;had the clamorous friends<br/>
Of ancient Institutions said and done<br/>
To bring disgrace upon their very names;<br/>
Disgrace, of which, custom and written law,<br/>
And sundry moral sentiments as props<br/>
Or emanations of those institutes,<br/>
Too justly bore a part. A veil had been<br/>
Uplifted; why deceive ourselves? in sooth,<br/>
'Twas even so; and sorrow for the man<br/>
Who either had not eyes wherewith to see,<br/>
Or, seeing, had forgotten! A strong shock<br/>
Was given to old opinions; all men's minds<br/>
Had felt its power, and mine was both let loose,<br/>
Let loose and goaded. After what hath been<br/>
Already said of patriotic love,<br/>
Suffice it here to add, that, somewhat stern<br/>
In temperament, withal a happy man,<br/>
And therefore bold to look on painful things,<br/>
Free likewise of the world, and thence more bold,<br/>
I summoned my best skill, and toiled, intent<br/>
To anatomise the frame of social life,<br/>
Yea, the whole body of society<br/>
Searched to its heart. Share with me, Friend! the wish<br/>
That some dramatic tale, endued with shapes<br/>
Livelier, and flinging out less guarded words<br/>
Than suit the work we fashion, might set forth<br/>
What then I learned, or think I learned, of truth,<br/>
And the errors into which I fell, betrayed<br/>
By present objects, and by reasonings false<br/>
From their beginnings, inasmuch as drawn<br/>
Out of a heart that had been turned aside<br/>
From Nature's way by outward accidents,<br/>
And which was thus confounded, more and more<br/>
Misguided, and misguiding. So I fared,<br/>
Dragging all precepts, judgments, maxims, creeds,<br/>
Like culprits to the bar; calling the mind,<br/>
Suspiciously, to establish in plain day<br/>
Her titles and her honours; now believing,<br/>
Now disbelieving; endlessly perplexed<br/>
With impulse, motive, right and wrong, the ground<br/>
Of obligation, what the rule and whence<br/>
The sanction; till, demanding formal <em>proof</em>,<br/>
And seeking it in every thing, I lost<br/>
All feeling of conviction, and, in fine,<br/>
Sick, wearied out with contrarieties,<br/>
Yielded up moral questions in despair.
</p>
<p>
This was the crisis of that strong disease,<br/>
This the soul's last and lowest ebb; I drooped,<br/>
Deeming our blessed reason of least use<br/>
Where wanted most: "The lordly attributes<br/>
Of will and choice," I bitterly exclaimed,<br/>
"What are they but a mockery of a Being<br/>
Who hath in no concerns of his a test<br/>
Of good and evil; knows not what to fear<br/>
Or hope for, what to covet or to shun;<br/>
And who, if those could be discerned, would yet<br/>
Be little profited, would see, and ask<br/>
Where is the obligation to enforce?<br/>
And, to acknowledged law rebellious, still,<br/>
As selfish passion urged, would act amiss;<br/>
The dupe of folly, or the slave of crime."
</p>
<p>
Depressed, bewildered thus, I did not walk<br/>
With scoffers, seeking light and gay revenge<br/>
From indiscriminate laughter, nor sate down<br/>
In reconcilement with an utter waste<br/>
Of intellect; such sloth I could not brook,<br/>
(Too well I loved, in that my spring of life,<br/>
Pains-taking thoughts, and truth, their dear reward)<br/>
But turned to abstract science, and there sought<br/>
Work for the reasoning faculty enthroned<br/>
Where the disturbances of space and time&mdash;<br/>
Whether in matters various, properties<br/>
Inherent, or from human will and power<br/>
Derived&mdash;find no admission. Then it was&mdash;<br/>
Thanks to the bounteous Giver of all good!&mdash;<br/>
That the beloved Sister in whose sight<br/>
Those days were passed, now speaking in a voice<br/>
Of sudden admonition&mdash;like a brook<br/>
That did but <em>cross</em> a lonely road, and now<br/>
Is seen, heard, felt, and caught at every turn,<br/>
Companion never lost through many a league&mdash;<br/>
Maintained for me a saving intercourse<br/>
With my true self; for, though bedimmed and changed<br/>
Much, as it seemed, I was no further changed<br/>
Than as a clouded and a waning moon:<br/>
She whispered still that brightness would return,<br/>
She, in the midst of all, preserved me still<br/>
A Poet, made me seek beneath that name,<br/>
And that alone, my office upon earth;<br/>
And, lastly, as hereafter will be shown,<br/>
If willing audience fail not, Nature's self,<br/>
By all varieties of human love<br/>
Assisted, led me back through opening day<br/>
To those sweet counsels between head and heart<br/>
Whence grew that genuine knowledge, fraught with peace,<br/>
Which, through the later sinkings of this cause,<br/>
Hath still upheld me, and upholds me now<br/>
In the catastrophe (for so they dream,<br/>
And nothing less), when, finally to close<br/>
And seal up all the gains of France, a Pope<br/>
Is summoned in, to crown an Emperor&mdash;<br/>
This last opprobrium, when we see a people,<br/>
That once looked up in faith, as if to Heaven<br/>
For manna, take a lesson from the dog<br/>
Returning to his vomit; when the sun<br/>
That rose in splendour, was alive, and moved<br/>
In exultation with a living pomp<br/>
Of clouds&mdash;his glory's natural retinue&mdash;<br/>
Hath dropped all functions by the gods bestowed,<br/>
And, turned into a gewgaw, a machine,<br/>
Sets like an Opera phantom.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, O Friend!<br/>
Through times of honour and through times of shame<br/>
Descending, have I faithfully retraced<br/>
The perturbations of a youthful mind<br/>
Under a long-lived storm of great events&mdash;<br/>
A story destined for thy ear, who now,<br/>
Among the fallen of nations, dost abide<br/>
Where Etna, over hill and valley, casts<br/>
His shadow stretching towards Syracuse,<br/>
The city of Timoleon! Righteous Heaven!<br/>
How are the mighty prostrated! They first,<br/>
They first of all that breathe should have awaked<br/>
When the great voice was heard from out the tombs<br/>
Of ancient heroes. If I suffered grief<br/>
For ill-requited France, by many deemed<br/>
A trifler only in her proudest day;<br/>
Have been distressed to think of what she once<br/>
Promised, now is; a far more sober cause<br/>
Thine eyes must see of sorrow in a land.<br/>
To the reanimating influence lost<br/>
Of memory, to virtue lost and hope,<br/>
Though with the wreck of loftier years bestrewn.
</p>
<p>
But indignation works where hope is not,<br/>
And thou, O Friend! wilt be refreshed. There is<br/>
One great society alone on earth:<br/>
The noble Living and the noble Dead.
</p>
<p>
Thine be such converse strong and sanative,<br/>
A ladder for thy spirit to reascend<br/>
To health and joy and pure contentedness;<br/>
To me the grief confined, that thou art gone<br/>
From this last spot of earth, where Freedom now<br/>
Stands single in her only sanctuary;<br/>
A lonely wanderer art gone, by pain<br/>
Compelled and sickness, at this latter day,<br/>
This sorrowful reverse for all mankind.<br/>
I feel for thee, must utter what I feel:<br/>
The sympathies erewhile in part discharged,<br/>
Gather afresh, and will have vent again:<br/>
My own delights do scarcely seem to me<br/>
My own delights; the lordly Alps themselves,<br/>
Those rosy peaks, from which the Morning looks<br/>
Abroad on many nations, are no more<br/>
For me that image of pure gladsomeness<br/>
Which they were wont to be. Through kindred scenes,<br/>
For purpose, at a time, how different!<br/>
Thou tak'st thy way, carrying the heart and soul<br/>
That Nature gives to Poets, now by thought<br/>
Matured, and in the summer of their strength.<br/>
Oh! wrap him in your shades, ye giant woods,<br/>
On Etna's side; and thou, O flowery field<br/>
Of Enna! is there not some nook of thine,<br/>
From the first play-time of the infant world<br/>
Kept sacred to restorative delight,<br/>
When from afar invoked by anxious love?
</p>
<p>
Child of the mountains, among shepherds reared,<br/>
Ere yet familiar with the classic page,<br/>
I learnt to dream of Sicily; and lo,<br/>
The gloom, that, but a moment past, was deepened<br/>
At thy command, at her command gives way;<br/>
A pleasant promise, wafted from her shores,<br/>
Comes o'er my heart: in fancy I behold<br/>
Her seas yet smiling, her once happy vales;<br/>
Nor can my tongue give utterance to a name<br/>
Of note belonging to that honoured isle,<br/>
Philosopher or Bard, Empedocles,<br/>
Or Archimedes, pure abstracted soul!<br/>
That doth not yield a solace to my grief:<br/>
And, O Theocritus, so far have some<br/>
Prevailed among the powers of heaven and earth,<br/>
By their endowments, good or great, that they<br/>
Have had, as thou reportest, miracles<br/>
Wrought for them in old time: yea, not unmoved,<br/>
When thinking on my own beloved friend,<br/>
I hear thee tell how bees with honey fed<br/>
Divine Comates, by his impious lord<br/>
Within a chest imprisoned; how they came<br/>
Laden from blooming grove or flowery field,<br/>
And fed him there, alive, month after month,<br/>
Because the goatherd, blessed man! had lips<br/>
Wet with the Muses' nectar.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus I soothe<br/>
The pensive moments by this calm fire-side,<br/>
And find a thousand bounteous images<br/>
To cheer the thoughts of those I love, and mine.<br/>
Our prayers have been accepted; thou wilt stand<br/>
On Etna's summit, above earth and sea,<br/>
Triumphant, winning from the invaded heavens<br/>
Thoughts without bound, magnificent designs,<br/>
Worthy of poets who attuned their harps<br/>
In wood or echoing cave, for discipline<br/>
Of heroes; or, in reverence to the gods,<br/>
'Mid temples, served by sapient priests, and choirs<br/>
Of virgins crowned with roses. Not in vain<br/>
Those temples, where they in their ruins yet<br/>
Survive for inspiration, shall attract<br/>
Thy solitary steps: and on the brink<br/>
Thou wilt recline of pastoral Arethuse;<br/>
Or, if that fountain be in truth no more,<br/>
Then, near some other spring&mdash;which, by the name<br/>
Thou gratulatest, willingly deceived&mdash;<br/>
I see thee linger a glad votary,<br/>
And not a captive pining for his home.

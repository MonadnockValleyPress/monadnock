<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Fifth</h2>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>
When Contemplation, like the night-calm felt<br/>
Through earth and sky, spreads widely, and sends deep<br/>
Into the soul its tranquillising power,<br/>
Even then I sometimes grieve for thee, O Man,<br/>
Earth's paramount Creature! not so much for woes<br/>
That thou endurest; heavy though that weight be,<br/>
Cloud-like it mounts, or touched with light divine<br/>
Doth melt away; but for those palms achieved,<br/>
Through length of time, by patient exercise<br/>
Of study and hard thought; there, there, it is<br/>
That sadness finds its fuel. Hitherto,<br/>
In progress through this Verse, my mind hath looked<br/>
Upon the speaking face of earth and heaven<br/>
As her prime teacher, intercourse with man<br/>
Established by the sovereign Intellect,<br/>
Who through that bodily image hath diffused,<br/>
As might appear to the eye of fleeting time,<br/>
A deathless spirit. Thou also, man! hast wrought,<br/>
For commerce of thy nature with herself,<br/>
Things that aspire to unconquerable life;<br/>
And yet we feel&mdash;we cannot choose but feel&mdash;<br/>
That they must perish. Tremblings of the heart<br/>
It gives, to think that our immortal being<br/>
No more shall need such garments; and yet man,<br/>
As long as he shall be the child of earth,<br/>
Might almost "weep to have" what he may lose,<br/>
Nor be himself extinguished, but survive,<br/>
Abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate.<br/>
A thought is with me sometimes, and I say,&mdash;<br/>
Should the whole frame of earth by inward throes<br/>
Be wrenched, or fire come down from far to scorch<br/>
Her pleasant habitations, and dry up<br/>
Old Ocean, in his bed left singed and bare,<br/>
Yet would the living Presence still subsist<br/>
Victorious, and composure would ensue,<br/>
And kindlings like the morning&mdash;presage sure<br/>
Of day returning and of life revived.<br/>
But all the meditations of mankind,<br/>
Yea, all the adamantine holds of truth<br/>
By reason built, or passion, which itself<br/>
Is highest reason in a soul sublime;<br/>
The consecrated works of Bard and Sage,<br/>
Sensuous or intellectual, wrought by men,<br/>
Twin labourers and heirs of the same hopes;<br/>
Where would they be? Oh! why hath not the Mind<br/>
Some element to stamp her image on<br/>
In nature somewhat nearer to her own?<br/>
Why, gifted with such powers to send abroad<br/>
Her spirit, must it lodge in shrines so frail?<br/>
</p>
<p>
One day, when from my lips a like complaint<br/>
Had fallen in presence of a studious friend,<br/>
He with a smile made answer, that in truth<br/>
'Twas going far to seek disquietude;<br/>
But on the front of his reproof confessed<br/>
That he himself had oftentimes given way<br/>
To kindred hauntings. Whereupon I told,<br/>
That once in the stillness of a summer's noon,<br/>
While I was seated in a rocky cave<br/>
By the sea-side, perusing, so it chanced,<br/>
The famous history of the errant knight<br/>
Recorded by Cervantes, these same thoughts<br/>
Beset me, and to height unusual rose,<br/>
While listlessly I sate, and, having closed<br/>
The book, had turned my eyes toward the wide sea.<br/>
On poetry and geometric truth,<br/>
And their high privilege of lasting life,<br/>
From all internal injury exempt,<br/>
I mused, upon these chiefly: and at length,<br/>
My senses yielding to the sultry air,<br/>
Sleep seized me, and I passed into a dream.<br/>
I saw before me stretched a boundless plain<br/>
Of sandy wilderness, all black and void,<br/>
And as I looked around, distress and fear<br/>
Came creeping over me, when at my side,<br/>
Close at my side, an uncouth shape appeared<br/>
Upon a dromedary, mounted high.<br/>
He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes:<br/>
A lance he bore, and underneath one arm<br/>
A stone, and in the opposite hand a shell<br/>
Of a surpassing brightness. At the sight<br/>
Much I rejoiced, not doubting but a guide<br/>
Was present, one who with unerring skill<br/>
Would through the desert lead me; and while yet<br/>
I looked and looked, self-questioned what this freight<br/>
Which the new-comer carried through the waste<br/>
Could mean, the Arab told me that the stone<br/>
(To give it in the language of the dream)<br/>
Was "Euclid's Elements;" and "This," said he,<br/>
"Is something of more worth;" and at the word<br/>
Stretched forth the shell, so beautiful in shape,<br/>
In colour so resplendent, with command<br/>
That I should hold it to my ear. I did so,<br/>
And heard that instant in an unknown tongue,<br/>
Which yet I understood, articulate sounds,<br/>
A loud prophetic blast of harmony;<br/>
An Ode, in passion uttered, which foretold<br/>
Destruction to the children of the earth<br/>
By deluge, now at hand. No sooner ceased<br/>
The song, than the Arab with calm look declared<br/>
That all would come to pass of which the voice<br/>
Had given forewarning, and that he himself<br/>
Was going then to bury those two books:<br/>
The one that held acquaintance with the stars,<br/>
And wedded soul to soul in purest bond<br/>
Of reason, undisturbed by space or time;<br/>
The other that was a god, yea many gods,<br/>
Had voices more than all the winds, with power<br/>
To exhilarate the spirit, and to soothe,<br/>
Through every clime, the heart of human kind.<br/>
While this was uttering, strange as it may seem,<br/>
I wondered not, although I plainly saw<br/>
The one to be a stone, the other a shell;<br/>
Nor doubted once but that they both were books,<br/>
Having a perfect faith in all that passed.<br/>
Far stronger, now, grew the desire I felt<br/>
To cleave unto this man; but when I prayed<br/>
To share his enterprise, he hurried on<br/>
Reckless of me: I followed, not unseen,<br/>
For oftentimes he cast a backward look,<br/>
Grasping his twofold treasure.&mdash;Lance in rest,<br/>
He rode, I keeping pace with him; and now<br/>
He, to my fancy, had become the knight<br/>
Whose tale Cervantes tells; yet not the knight,<br/>
But was an Arab of the desert too;<br/>
Of these was neither, and was both at once.<br/>
His countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturbed;<br/>
And, looking backwards when he looked, mine eyes<br/>
Saw, over half the wilderness diffused,<br/>
A bed of glittering light: I asked the cause:<br/>
"It is," said he, "the waters of the deep<br/>
Gathering upon us;" quickening then the pace<br/>
Of the unwieldy creature he bestrode,<br/>
He left me: I called after him aloud;<br/>
He heeded not; but, with his twofold charge<br/>
Still in his grasp, before me, full in view,<br/>
Went hurrying o'er the illimitable waste,<br/>
With the fleet waters of a drowning world<br/>
In chase of him; whereat I waked in terror,<br/>
And saw the sea before me, and the book,<br/>
In which I had been reading, at my side.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Full often, taking from the world of sleep<br/>
This Arab phantom, which I thus beheld,<br/>
This semi-Quixote, I to him have given<br/>
A substance, fancied him a living man,<br/>
A gentle dweller in the desert, crazed<br/>
By love and feeling, and internal thought<br/>
Protracted among endless solitudes;<br/>
Have shaped him wandering upon this quest!<br/>
Nor have I pitied him; but rather felt<br/>
Reverence was due to a being thus employed;<br/>
And thought that, in the blind and awful lair<br/>
Of such a madness, reason did lie couched.<br/>
Enow there are on earth to take in charge<br/>
Their wives, their children, and their virgin loves,<br/>
Or whatsoever else the heart holds dear;<br/>
Enow to stir for these; yea, will I say,<br/>
Contemplating in soberness the approach<br/>
Of an event so dire, by signs in earth<br/>
Or heaven made manifest, that I could share<br/>
That maniac's fond anxiety, and go<br/>
Upon like errand. Oftentimes at least<br/>
Me hath such strong enhancement overcome,<br/>
When I have held a volume in my hand,<br/>
Poor earthly casket of immortal verse,<br/>
Shakespeare, or Milton, labourers divine!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Great and benign, indeed, must be the power<br/>
Of living nature, which could thus so long<br/>
Detain me from the best of other guides<br/>
And dearest helpers, left unthanked, unpraised,<br/>
Even in the time of lisping infancy;<br/>
And later down, in prattling childhood even,<br/>
While I was travelling back among those days,<br/>
How could I ever play an ingrate's part?<br/>
Once more should I have made those bowers resound,<br/>
By intermingling strains of thankfulness<br/>
With their own thoughtless melodies; at least<br/>
It might have well beseemed me to repeat<br/>
Some simply fashioned tale, to tell again,<br/>
In slender accents of sweet verse, some tale<br/>
That did bewitch me then, and soothes me now.<br/>
O Friend! O Poet! brother of my soul,<br/>
Think not that I could pass along untouched<br/>
By these remembrances. Yet wherefore speak?<br/>
Why call upon a few weak words to say<br/>
What is already written in the hearts<br/>
Of all that breathe?&mdash;what in the path of all<br/>
Drops daily from the tongue of every child,<br/>
Wherever man is found? The trickling tear<br/>
Upon the cheek of listening Infancy<br/>
Proclaims it, and the insuperable look<br/>
That drinks as if it never could be full.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That portion of my story I shall leave<br/>
There registered: whatever else of power<br/>
Or pleasure sown, or fostered thus, may be<br/>
Peculiar to myself, let that remain<br/>
Where still it works, though hidden from all search<br/>
Among the depths of time. Yet is it just<br/>
That here, in memory of all books which lay<br/>
Their sure foundations in the heart of man,<br/>
Whether by native prose, or numerous verse,<br/>
That in the name of all inspirèd souls&mdash;<br/>
From Homer the great Thunderer, from the voice<br/>
That roars along the bed of Jewish song,<br/>
And that more varied and elaborate,<br/>
Those trumpet-tones of harmony that shake<br/>
Our shores in England,&mdash;from those loftiest notes<br/>
Down to the low and wren-like warblings, made<br/>
For cottagers and spinners at the wheel,<br/>
And sun-burnt travellers resting their tired limbs,<br/>
Stretched under wayside hedge-rows, ballad tunes,<br/>
Food for the hungry ears of little ones,<br/>
And of old men who have survived their joys&mdash;<br/>
'Tis just that in behalf of these, the works,<br/>
And of the men that framed them, whether known,<br/>
Or sleeping nameless in their scattered graves,<br/>
That I should here assert their rights, attest<br/>
Their honours, and should, once for all, pronounce<br/>
Their benediction; speak of them as Powers<br/>
For ever to be hallowed; only less,<br/>
For what we are and what we may become,<br/>
Than Nature's self, which is the breath of God,<br/>
Or His pure Word by miracle revealed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Rarely and with reluctance would I stoop<br/>
To transitory themes; yet I rejoice,<br/>
And, by these thoughts admonished, will pour out<br/>
Thanks with uplifted heart, that I was reared<br/>
Safe from an evil which these days have laid<br/>
Upon the children of the land, a pest<br/>
That might have dried me up, body and soul.<br/>
This verse is dedicate to Nature's self,<br/>
And things that teach as Nature teaches: then,<br/>
Oh! where had been the Man, the Poet where,<br/>
Where had we been, we two, beloved Friend!<br/>
If in the season of unperilous choice,<br/>
In lieu of wandering, as we did, through vales<br/>
Rich with indigenous produce, open ground<br/>
Of Fancy, happy pastures ranged at will,<br/>
We had been followed, hourly watched, and noosed,<br/>
Each in his several melancholy walk<br/>
Stringed like a poor man's heifer at its feed,<br/>
Led through the lanes in forlorn servitude;<br/>
Or rather like a stalled ox debarred<br/>
From touch of growing grass, that may not taste<br/>
A flower till it have yielded up its sweets<br/>
A prelibation to the mower's scythe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Behold the parent hen amid her brood,<br/>
Though fledged and feathered, and well pleased to part<br/>
And straggle from her presence, still a brood,<br/>
And she herself from the maternal bond<br/>
Still undischarged; yet doth she little more<br/>
Than move with them in tenderness and love,<br/>
A centre to the circle which they make;<br/>
And now and then, alike from need of theirs<br/>
And call of her own natural appetites,<br/>
She scratches, ransacks up the earth for food,<br/>
Which they partake at pleasure. Early died<br/>
My honoured Mother, she who was the heart<br/>
And hinge of all our learnings and our loves:<br/>
She left us destitute, and, as we might,<br/>
Trooping together. Little suits it me<br/>
To break upon the sabbath of her rest<br/>
With any thought that looks at others' blame;<br/>
Nor would I praise her but in perfect love.<br/>
Hence am I checked: but let me boldly say,<br/>
In gratitude, and for the sake of truth,<br/>
Unheard by her, that she, not falsely taught,<br/>
Fetching her goodness rather from times past,<br/>
Than shaping novelties for times to come,<br/>
Had no presumption, no such jealousy,<br/>
Nor did by habit of her thoughts mistrust<br/>
Our nature, but had virtual faith that He<br/>
Who fills the mother's breast with innocent milk,<br/>
Doth also for our nobler part provide,<br/>
Under His great correction and control,<br/>
As innocent instincts, and as innocent food;<br/>
Or draws for minds that are left free to trust<br/>
In the simplicities of opening life<br/>
Sweet honey out of spurned or dreaded weeds.<br/>
This was her creed, and therefore she was pure<br/>
From anxious fear of error or mishap,<br/>
And evil, overweeningly so called;<br/>
Was not puffed up by false unnatural hopes,<br/>
Nor selfish with unnecessary cares,<br/>
Nor with impatience from the season asked<br/>
More than its timely produce; rather loved<br/>
The hours for what they are, than from regard<br/>
Glanced on their promises in restless pride.<br/>
Such was she&mdash;not from faculties more strong<br/>
Than others have, but from the times, perhaps,<br/>
And spot in which she lived, and through a grace<br/>
Of modest meekness, simple-mindedness,<br/>
A heart that found benignity and hope,<br/>
Being itself benign.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My drift I fear<br/>
Is scarcely obvious; but, that common sense<br/>
May try this modern system by its fruits,<br/>
Leave let me take to place before her sight<br/>
A specimen pourtrayed with faithful hand.<br/>
Full early trained to worship seemliness,<br/>
This model of a child is never known<br/>
To mix in quarrels; that were far beneath<br/>
Its dignity; with gifts he bubbles o'er<br/>
As generous as a fountain; selfishness<br/>
May not come near him, nor the little throng<br/>
Of flitting pleasures tempt him from his path;<br/>
The wandering beggars propagate his name,<br/>
Dumb creatures find him tender as a nun,<br/>
And natural or supernatural fear,<br/>
Unless it leap upon him in a dream,<br/>
Touches him not. To enhance the wonder, see<br/>
How arch his notices, how nice his sense<br/>
Of the ridiculous; not blind is he<br/>
To the broad follies of the licensed world,<br/>
Yet innocent himself withal, though shrewd,<br/>
And can read lectures upon innocence;<br/>
A miracle of scientific lore,<br/>
Ships he can guide across the pathless sea,<br/>
And tell you all their cunning; he can read<br/>
The inside of the earth, and spell the stars;<br/>
He knows the policies of foreign lands;<br/>
Can string you names of districts, cities, towns,<br/>
The whole world over, tight as beads of dew<br/>
Upon a gossamer thread; he sifts, he weighs;<br/>
All things are put to question; he must live<br/>
Knowing that he grows wiser every day<br/>
Or else not live at all, and seeing too<br/>
Each little drop of wisdom as it falls<br/>
Into the dimpling cistern of his heart:<br/>
For this unnatural growth the trainer blame,<br/>
Pity the tree.&mdash;Poor human vanity,<br/>
Wert thou extinguished, little would be left<br/>
Which he could truly love; but how escape?<br/>
For, ever as a thought of purer, birth<br/>
Rises to lead him toward a better clime,<br/>
Some intermeddler still is on the watch<br/>
To drive him back, and pound him, like a stray,<br/>
Within the pinfold of his own conceit.<br/>
Meanwhile old grandame earth is grieved to find<br/>
The playthings, which her love designed for him,<br/>
Unthought of: in their woodland beds the flowers<br/>
Weep, and the river sides are all forlorn.<br/>
Oh! give us once again the wishing cap<br/>
Of Fortunatus, and the invisible coat<br/>
Of Jack the Giant-killer, Robin Hood,<br/>
And Sabra in the forest with St. George!<br/>
The child, whose love is here, at least, doth reap<br/>
One precious gain, that he forgets himself.<br/>
</p>
<p>
These mighty workmen of our later age,<br/>
Who, with a broad highway, have overbridged<br/>
The froward chaos of futurity,<br/>
Tamed to their bidding; they who have the skill<br/>
To manage books, and things, and make them act<br/>
On infant minds as surely as the sun<br/>
Deals with a flower; the keepers of our time,<br/>
The guides and wardens of our faculties,<br/>
Sages who in their prescience would control<br/>
All accidents, and to the very road<br/>
Which they have fashioned would confine us down,<br/>
Like engines; when will their presumption learn,<br/>
That in the unreasoning progress of the world<br/>
A wiser spirit is at work for us,<br/>
A better eye than theirs, most prodigal<br/>
Of blessings, and most studious of our good,<br/>
Even in what seem our most unfruitful hours?<br/>
</p>
<p>
There was a Boy: ye knew him well, ye cliffs<br/>
And islands of Winander!&mdash;many a time<br/>
At evening, when the earliest stars began<br/>
To move along the edges of the hills,<br/>
Rising or setting, would he stand alone<br/>
Beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake,<br/>
And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands<br/>
Pressed closely palm to palm, and to his mouth<br/>
Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,<br/>
Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,<br/>
That they might answer him; and they would shout<br/>
Across the watery vale, and shout again,<br/>
Responsive to his call, with quivering peals,<br/>
And long halloos and screams, and echoes loud,<br/>
Redoubled and redoubled, concourse wild<br/>
Of jocund din; and, when a lengthened pause<br/>
Of silence came and baffled his best skill,<br/>
Then sometimes, in that silence while he hung<br/>
Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise<br/>
Has carried far into his heart the voice<br/>
Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene<br/>
Would enter unawares into his mind,<br/>
With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,<br/>
Its woods, and that uncertain heaven, received<br/>
Into the bosom of the steady lake.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This Boy was taken from his mates, and died<br/>
In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.<br/>
Fair is the spot, most beautiful the vale<br/>
Where he was born; the grassy churchyard hangs<br/>
Upon a slope above the village school,<br/>
And through that churchyard when my way has led<br/>
On summer evenings, I believe that there<br/>
A long half hour together I have stood<br/>
Mute, looking at the grave in which he lies!<br/>
Even now appears before the mind's clear eye<br/>
That self-same village church; I see her sit<br/>
(The thronèd Lady whom erewhile we hailed)<br/>
On her green hill, forgetful of this Boy<br/>
Who slumbers at her feet,&mdash;forgetful, too,<br/>
Of all her silent neighbourhood of graves,<br/>
And listening only to the gladsome sounds<br/>
That, from the rural school ascending, play<br/>
Beneath her and about her. May she long<br/>
Behold a race of young ones like to those<br/>
With whom I herded!&mdash;(easily, indeed,<br/>
We might have fed upon a fatter soil<br/>
Of arts and letters&mdash;but be that forgiven)&mdash;<br/>
A race of real children; not too wise,<br/>
Too learned, or too good; but wanton, fresh,<br/>
And bandied up and down by love and hate;<br/>
Not unresentful where self-justified;<br/>
Fierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy;<br/>
Mad at their sports like withered leaves in winds;<br/>
Though doing wrong and suffering, and full oft<br/>
Bending beneath our life's mysterious weight<br/>
Of pain, and doubt, and fear, yet yielding not<br/>
In happiness to the happiest upon earth.<br/>
Simplicity in habit, truth in speech,<br/>
Be these the daily strengtheners of their minds;<br/>
May books and Nature be their early joy!<br/>
And knowledge, rightly honoured with that name&mdash;<br/>
Knowledge not purchased by the loss of power!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Well do I call to mind the very week<br/>
When I was first intrusted to the care<br/>
Of that sweet Valley; when its paths, its shores,<br/>
And brooks were like a dream of novelty<br/>
To my half-infant thoughts; that very week,<br/>
While I was roving up and down alone,<br/>
Seeking I knew not what, I chanced to cross<br/>
One of those open fields, which, shaped like ears,<br/>
Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake:<br/>
Twilight was coming on, yet through the gloom<br/>
Appeared distinctly on the opposite shore<br/>
A heap of garments, as if left by one<br/>
Who might have there been bathing. Long I watched,<br/>
But no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lake<br/>
Grew dark with all the shadows on its breast,<br/>
And, now and then, a fish up-leaping snapped<br/>
The breathless stillness. The succeeding day,<br/>
Those unclaimed garments telling a plain tale<br/>
Drew to the spot an anxious crowd; some looked<br/>
In passive expectation from the shore,<br/>
While from a boat others hung o'er the deep,<br/>
Sounding with grappling irons and long poles.<br/>
At last, the dead man, 'mid that beauteous scene<br/>
Of trees and hills and water, bolt upright<br/>
Rose, with his ghastly face, a spectre shape<br/>
Of terror; yet no soul-debasing fear,<br/>
Young as I was, a child not nine years old,<br/>
Possessed me, for my inner eye had seen<br/>
Such sights before, among the shining streams<br/>
Of faëry land, the forest of romance.<br/>
Their spirit hallowed the sad spectacle<br/>
With decoration of ideal grace;<br/>
A dignity, a smoothness, like the works<br/>
Of Grecian art, and purest poesy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A precious treasure had I long possessed,<br/>
A little yellow, canvas-covered book,<br/>
A slender abstract of the Arabian tales;<br/>
And, from companions in a new abode,<br/>
When first I learnt, that this dear prize of mine<br/>
Was but a block hewn from a mighty quarry&mdash;<br/>
That there were four large volumes, laden all<br/>
With kindred matter, 'twas to me, in truth,<br/>
A promise scarcely earthly. Instantly,<br/>
With one not richer than myself, I made<br/>
A covenant that each should lay aside<br/>
The moneys he possessed, and hoard up more,<br/>
Till our joint savings had amassed enough<br/>
To make this book our own. Through several months,<br/>
In spite of all temptation, we preserved<br/>
Religiously that vow; but firmness failed,<br/>
Nor were we ever masters of our wish.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And when thereafter to my father's house<br/>
The holidays returned me, there to find<br/>
That golden store of books which I had left,<br/>
What joy was mine! How often in the course<br/>
Of those glad respites, though a soft west wind<br/>
Ruffled the waters to the angler's wish<br/>
For a whole day together, have I lain<br/>
Down by thy side, O Derwent! murmuring stream,<br/>
On the hot stones, and in the glaring sun,<br/>
And there have read, devouring as I read,<br/>
Defrauding the day's glory, desperate!<br/>
Till with a sudden bound of smart reproach,<br/>
Such as an idler deals with in his shame,<br/>
I to the sport betook myself again.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A gracious spirit o'er this earth presides,<br/>
And o'er the heart of man: invisibly<br/>
It comes, to works of unreproved delight,<br/>
And tendency benign, directing those<br/>
Who care not, know not, think not what they do.<br/>
The tales that charm away the wakeful night<br/>
In Araby, romances; legends penned<br/>
For solace by dim light of monkish lamps;<br/>
Fictions, for ladies of their love, devised<br/>
By youthful squires; adventures endless, spun<br/>
By the dismantled warrior in old age,<br/>
Out of the bowels of those very schemes<br/>
In which his youth did first extravagate;<br/>
These spread like day, and something in the shape<br/>
Of these will live till man shall be no more.<br/>
Dumb yearnings, hidden appetites, are ours,<br/>
And <em>they must</em> have their food. Our childhood sits,<br/>
Our simple childhood, sits upon a throne<br/>
That hath more power than all the elements.<br/>
I guess not what this tells of Being past,<br/>
Nor what it augurs of the life to come;<br/>
But so it is, and, in that dubious hour,<br/>
That twilight when we first begin to see<br/>
This dawning earth, to recognise, expect,<br/>
And in the long probation that ensues,<br/>
The time of trial, ere we learn to live<br/>
In reconcilement with our stinted powers;<br/>
To endure this state of meagre vassalage,<br/>
Unwilling to forego, confess, submit,<br/>
Uneasy and unsettled, yoke-fellows<br/>
To custom, mettlesome, and not yet tamed<br/>
And humbled down; oh! then we feel, we feel,<br/>
We know where we have friends. Ye dreamers, then,<br/>
Forgers of daring tales! we bless you then,<br/>
Impostors, drivellers, dotards, as the ape<br/>
Philosophy will call you: <em>then</em> we feel<br/>
With what, and how great might ye are in league,<br/>
Who make our wish, our power, our thought a deed,<br/>
An empire, a possession,&mdash;ye whom time<br/>
And seasons serve; all Faculties to whom<br/>
Earth crouches, the elements are potter's clay,<br/>
Space like a heaven filled up with northern lights,<br/>
Here, nowhere, there, and everywhere at once.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Relinquishing this lofty eminence<br/>
For ground, though humbler, not the less a tract<br/>
Of the same isthmus, which our spirits cross<br/>
In progress from their native continent<br/>
To earth and human life, the Song might dwell<br/>
On that delightful time of growing youth,<br/>
When craving for the marvellous gives way<br/>
To strengthening love for things that we have seen;<br/>
When sober truth and steady sympathies,<br/>
Offered to notice by less daring pens,<br/>
Take firmer hold of us, and words themselves<br/>
Move us with conscious pleasure.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sad<br/>
At thought of raptures now for ever flown;<br/>
Almost to tears I sometimes could be sad<br/>
To think of, to read over, many a page,<br/>
Poems withal of name, which at that time<br/>
Did never fail to entrance me, and are now<br/>
Dead in my eyes, dead as a theatre<br/>
Fresh emptied of spectators. Twice five years<br/>
Or less I might have seen, when first my mind<br/>
With conscious pleasure opened to the charm<br/>
Of words in tuneful order, found them sweet<br/>
For their own <em>sakes</em>, a passion, and a power;<br/>
And phrases pleased me chosen for delight,<br/>
For pomp, or love. Oft, in the public roads<br/>
Yet unfrequented, while the morning light<br/>
Was yellowing the hill tops, I went abroad<br/>
With a dear friend, and for the better part<br/>
Of two delightful hours we strolled along<br/>
By the still borders of the misty lake,<br/>
Repeating favourite verses with one voice,<br/>
Or conning more, as happy as the birds<br/>
That round us chaunted. Well might we be glad,<br/>
Lifted above the ground by airy fancies,<br/>
More bright than madness or the dreams of wine;<br/>
And, though full oft the objects of our love<br/>
Were false, and in their splendour overwrought,<br/>
Yet was there surely then no vulgar power<br/>
Working within us,&mdash;nothing less, in truth,<br/>
Than that most noble attribute of man,<br/>
Though yet untutored and inordinate,<br/>
That wish for something loftier, more adorned,<br/>
Than is the common aspect, daily garb,<br/>
Of human life. What wonder, then, if sounds<br/>
Of exultation echoed through the groves!<br/>
For, images, and sentiments, and words,<br/>
And everything encountered or pursued<br/>
In that delicious world of poesy,<br/>
Kept holiday, a never-ending show,<br/>
With music, incense, festival, and flowers!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here must we pause: this only let me add,<br/>
From heart-experience, and in humblest sense<br/>
Of modesty, that he, who in his youth<br/>
A daily wanderer among woods and fields<br/>
With living Nature hath been intimate,<br/>
Not only in that raw unpractised time<br/>
Is stirred to extasy, as others are,<br/>
By glittering verse; but further, doth receive,<br/>
In measure only dealt out to himself,<br/>
Knowledge and increase of enduring joy<br/>
From the great Nature that exists in works<br/>
Of mighty Poets. Visionary power<br/>
Attends the motions of the viewless winds,<br/>
Embodied in the mystery of words:<br/>
There, darkness makes abode, and all the host<br/>
Of shadowy things work endless changes,&mdash;there,<br/>
As in a mansion like their proper home,<br/>
Even forms and substances are circumfused<br/>
By that transparent veil with light divine,<br/>
And, through the turnings intricate of verse,<br/>
Present themselves as objects recognised,<br/>
In flashes, and with glory not their own.

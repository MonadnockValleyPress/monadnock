<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Seventh</h2>
<h3>Residence in London</h3>
<p>
Six changeful years have vanished since I first<br/>
Poured out (saluted by that quickening breeze<br/>
Which met me issuing from the City's walls)<br/>
A glad preamble to this Verse: I sang<br/>
Aloud, with fervour irresistible<br/>
Of short-lived transport, like a torrent bursting,<br/>
From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side<br/>
To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth<br/>
(So willed the Muse) a less impetuous stream,<br/>
That flowed awhile with unabating strength,<br/>
Then stopped for years; not audible again<br/>
Before last primrose-time, Beloved Friend!<br/>
The assurance which then cheered some heavy thoughts<br/>
On thy departure to a foreign land<br/>
Has failed; too slowly moves the promised work.<br/>
Through the whole summer have I been at rest,<br/>
Partly from voluntary holiday,<br/>
And part through outward hindrance. But I heard,<br/>
After the hour of sunset yester-even,<br/>
Sitting within doors between light and dark,<br/>
A choir of redbreasts gathered somewhere near<br/>
My threshold,&mdash;minstrels from the distant woods<br/>
Sent in on Winter's service, to announce,<br/>
With preparation artful and benign,<br/>
That the rough lord had left the surly North<br/>
On his accustomed journey. The delight,<br/>
Due to this timely notice, unawares<br/>
Smote me, and, listening, I in whispers said,<br/>
"Ye heartsome Choristers, ye and I will be<br/>
Associates, and, unscared by blustering winds,<br/>
Will chant together." Thereafter, as the shades<br/>
Of twilight deepened, going forth, I spied<br/>
A glow-worm underneath a dusky plume<br/>
Or canopy of yet unwithered fern,<br/>
Clear-shining, like a hermit's taper seen<br/>
Through a thick forest. Silence touched me here<br/>
No less than sound had done before; the child<br/>
Of Summer, lingering, shining, by herself,<br/>
The voiceless worm on the unfrequented hills,<br/>
Seemed sent on the same errand with the choir<br/>
Of Winter that had warbled at my door,<br/>
And the whole year breathed tenderness and love.
</p>
<p>
The last night's genial feeling overflowed<br/>
Upon this morning, and my favourite grove,<br/>
Tossing in sunshine its dark boughs aloft,<br/>
As if to make the strong wind visible,<br/>
Wakes in me agitations like its own,<br/>
A spirit friendly to the Poet's task,<br/>
Which we will now resume with lively hope,<br/>
Nor checked by aught of tamer argument<br/>
That lies before us, needful to be told.
</p>
<p>
Returned from that excursion, soon I bade<br/>
Farewell for ever to the sheltered seats<br/>
Of gownèd students, quitted hall and bower,<br/>
And every comfort of that privileged ground,<br/>
Well pleased to pitch a vagrant tent among<br/>
The unfenced regions of society.
</p>
<p>
Yet, undetermined to what course of life<br/>
I should adhere, and seeming to possess<br/>
A little space of intermediate time<br/>
At full command, to London first I turned,<br/>
In no disturbance of excessive hope,<br/>
By personal ambition unenslaved,<br/>
Frugal as there was need, and, though self-willed,<br/>
From dangerous passions free. Three years had flown<br/>
Since I had felt in heart and soul the shock<br/>
Of the huge town's first presence, and had paced<br/>
Her endless streets, a transient visitant:<br/>
Now, fixed amid that concourse of mankind<br/>
Where Pleasure whirls about incessantly,<br/>
And life and labour seem but one, I filled<br/>
An idler's place; an idler well content<br/>
To have a house (what matter for a home?)<br/>
That owned him; living cheerfully abroad<br/>
With unchecked fancy ever on the stir,<br/>
And all my young affections out of doors.
</p>
<p>
There was a time when whatsoe'er is feigned<br/>
Of airy palaces, and gardens built<br/>
By Genii of romance; or hath in grave<br/>
Authentic history been set forth of Rome,<br/>
Alcairo, Babylon, or Persepolis;<br/>
Or given upon report by pilgrim friars,<br/>
Of golden cities ten months' journey deep<br/>
Among Tartarian wilds&mdash;fell short, far short,<br/>
Of what my fond simplicity believed<br/>
And thought of London&mdash;held me by a chain<br/>
Less strong of wonder and obscure delight.<br/>
Whether the bolt of childhood's Fancy shot<br/>
For me beyond its ordinary mark,<br/>
'Twere vain to ask; but in our flock of boys<br/>
Was One, a cripple from his birth, whom chance<br/>
Summoned from school to London; fortunate<br/>
And envied traveller! When the Boy returned,<br/>
After short absence, curiously I scanned<br/>
His mien and person, nor was free, in sooth,<br/>
From disappointment, not to find some change<br/>
In look and air, from that new region brought,<br/>
As if from Fairy-land. Much I questioned him;<br/>
And every word he uttered, on my ears<br/>
Fell flatter than a cagèd parrot's note,<br/>
That answers unexpectedly awry,<br/>
And mocks the prompter's listening. Marvellous things<br/>
Had vanity (quick Spirit that appears<br/>
Almost as deeply seated and as strong<br/>
In a Child's heart as fear itself) conceived<br/>
For my enjoyment. Would that I could now<br/>
Recal what then I pictured to myself,<br/>
Of mitred Prelates, Lords in ermine clad,<br/>
The King, and the King's Palace, and, not last,<br/>
Nor least, Heaven bless him! the renowned Lord Mayor:<br/>
Dreams not unlike to those which once begat<br/>
A change of purpose in young Whittington,<br/>
When he, a friendless and a drooping boy,<br/>
Sate on a stone, and heard the bells speak out<br/>
Articulate music. Above all, one thought<br/>
Baffled my understanding: how men lived<br/>
Even next-door neighbours, as we say, yet still<br/>
Strangers, not knowing each the other's name.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O, wond'rous power of words, by simple faith<br/>
Licensed to take the meaning that we love!<br/>
Vauxhall and Ranelagh! I then had heard<br/>
Of your green groves, and wilderness of lamps<br/>
Dimming the stars, and fireworks magical,<br/>
And gorgeous ladies, under splendid domes,<br/>
Floating in dance, or warbling high in air<br/>
The songs of spirits! Nor had Fancy fed<br/>
With less delight upon that other class<br/>
Of marvels, broad-day wonders permanent:<br/>
The River proudly bridged; the dizzy top<br/>
And Whispering Gallery of St. Paul's; the tombs<br/>
Of Westminster; the Giants of Guildhall;<br/>
Bedlam, and those carved maniacs at the gates,<br/>
Perpetually recumbent; Statues&mdash;man,<br/>
And the horse under him&mdash;in gilded pomp<br/>
Adorning flowery gardens, 'mid vast squares;<br/>
The Monument, and that Chamber of the Tower<br/>
Where England's sovereigns sit in long array,<br/>
Their steeds bestriding,&mdash;every mimic shape<br/>
Cased in the gleaming mail the monarch wore,<br/>
Whether for gorgeous tournament addressed,<br/>
Or life or death upon the battle-field.<br/>
Those bold imaginations in due time<br/>
Had vanished, leaving others in their stead:<br/>
And now I looked upon the living scene;<br/>
Familiarly perused it; oftentimes,<br/>
In spite of strongest disappointment, pleased<br/>
Through courteous self-submission, as a tax<br/>
Paid to the object by prescriptive right.
</p>
<p>
Rise up, thou monstrous ant-hill on the plain<br/>
Of a too busy world! Before me flow,<br/>
Thou endless stream of men and moving things!<br/>
Thy every-day appearance, as it strikes&mdash;<br/>
With wonder heightened, or sublimed by awe&mdash;<br/>
On strangers, of all ages; the quick dance<br/>
Of colours, lights, and forms; the deafening din;<br/>
The comers and the goers face to face,<br/>
Face after face; the string of dazzling wares,<br/>
Shop after shop, with symbols, blazoned names,<br/>
And all the tradesman's honours overhead:<br/>
Here, fronts of houses, like a title-page,<br/>
With letters huge inscribed from top to toe,<br/>
Stationed above the door, like guardian saints;<br/>
There, allegoric shapes, female or male,<br/>
Or physiognomies of real men,<br/>
Land-warriors, kings, or admirals of the sea,<br/>
Boyle, Shakespeare, Newton, or the attractive head<br/>
Of some quack-doctor, famous in his day.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the roar continues, till at length,<br/>
Escaped as from an enemy, we turn<br/>
Abruptly into some sequestered nook,<br/>
Still as a sheltered place when winds blow loud!<br/>
At leisure, thence, through tracts of thin resort,<br/>
And sights and sounds that come at intervals,<br/>
We take our way. A raree-show is here,<br/>
With children gathered round; another street<br/>
Presents a company of dancing dogs,<br/>
Or dromedary, with an antic pair<br/>
Of monkeys on his back; a minstrel band<br/>
Of Savoyards; or, single and alone,<br/>
An English ballad-singer. Private courts,<br/>
Gloomy as coffins, and unsightly lanes<br/>
Thrilled by some female vendor's scream, belike<br/>
The very shrillest of all London cries,<br/>
May then entangle our impatient steps;<br/>
Conducted through those labyrinths, unawares,<br/>
To privileged regions and inviolate,<br/>
Where from their airy lodges studious lawyers<br/>
Look out on waters, walks, and gardens green.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thence back into the throng, until we reach,<br/>
Following the tide that slackens by degrees,<br/>
Some half-frequented scene, where wider streets<br/>
Bring straggling breezes of suburban air.<br/>
Here files of ballads dangle from dead walls;<br/>
Advertisements, of giant-size, from high<br/>
Press forward, in all colours, on the sight;<br/>
These, bold in conscious merit, lower down;<br/>
<em>That</em>, fronted with a most imposing word,<br/>
Is, peradventure, one in masquerade.<br/>
As on the broadening causeway we advance,<br/>
Behold, turned upwards, a face hard and strong<br/>
In lineaments, and red with over-toil.<br/>
'Tis one encountered here and everywhere;<br/>
A travelling cripple, by the trunk cut short,<br/>
And stumping on his arms. In sailor's garb<br/>
Another lies at length, beside a range<br/>
Of well-formed characters, with chalk inscribed<br/>
Upon the smooth flat stones: the Nurse is here,<br/>
The Bachelor, that loves to sun himself,<br/>
The military Idler, and the Dame,<br/>
That field-ward takes her walk with decent steps.
</p>
<p>
Now homeward through the thickening hubbub, where<br/>
See, among less distinguishable shapes,<br/>
The begging scavenger, with hat in hand;<br/>
The Italian, as he thrids his way with care,<br/>
Steadying, far-seen, a frame of images<br/>
Upon his head; with basket at his breast<br/>
The Jew; the stately and slow-moving Turk,<br/>
With freight of slippers piled beneath his arm!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Enough;&mdash;the mighty concourse I surveyed<br/>
With no unthinking mind, well pleased to note<br/>
Among the crowd all specimens of man,<br/>
Through all the colours which the sun bestows,<br/>
And every character of form and face:<br/>
The Swede, the Russian; from the genial south,<br/>
The Frenchman and the Spaniard; from remote<br/>
America, the Hunter-Indian; Moors,<br/>
Malays, Lascars, the Tartar, the Chinese,<br/>
And Negro Ladies in white muslin gowns.<br/>
</p>
<p>
At leisure, then, I viewed, from day to day,<br/>
The spectacles within doors,&mdash;birds and beasts<br/>
Of every nature, and strange plants convened<br/>
From every clime; and, next, those sights that ape<br/>
The absolute presence of reality,<br/>
Expressing, as in mirror, sea and land,<br/>
And what earth is, and what she has to shew.<br/>
I do not here allude to subtlest craft,<br/>
By means refined attaining purest ends,<br/>
But imitations, fondly made in plain<br/>
Confession of man's weakness and his loves.<br/>
Whether the Painter, whose ambitious skill<br/>
Submits to nothing less than taking in<br/>
A whole horizon's circuit, do with power,<br/>
Like that of angels or commissioned spirits,<br/>
Fix us upon some lofty pinnacle,<br/>
Or in a ship on waters, with a world<br/>
Of life, and life-like mockery beneath,<br/>
Above, behind, far stretching and before;<br/>
Or more mechanic artist represent<br/>
By scale exact, in model, wood or clay,<br/>
From blended colours also borrowing help,<br/>
Some miniature of famous spots or things,&mdash;<br/>
St. Peter's Church; or, more aspiring aim,<br/>
In microscopic vision, Rome herself;<br/>
Or, haply, some choice rural haunt,&mdash;the Falls<br/>
Of Tivoli; and, high upon that steep,<br/>
The Sibyl's mouldering Temple! every tree,<br/>
Villa, or cottage, lurking among rocks<br/>
Throughout the landscape; tuft, stone scratch minute&mdash;<br/>
All that the traveller sees when he is there.
</p>
<p>
Add to these exhibitions, mute and still,<br/>
Others of wider scope, where living men,<br/>
Music, and shifting pantomimic scenes,<br/>
Diversified the allurement. Need I fear<br/>
To mention by its name, as in degree,<br/>
Lowest of these and humblest in attempt,<br/>
Yet richly graced with honours of her own,<br/>
Half-rural Sadler's Wells? Though at that time<br/>
Intolerant, as is the way of youth<br/>
Unless itself be pleased, here more than once<br/>
Taking my seat, I saw (nor blush to add,<br/>
With ample recompense) giants and dwarfs,<br/>
Clowns, conjurors, posture-masters, harlequins,<br/>
Amid the uproar of the rabblement,<br/>
Perform their feats. Nor was it mean delight<br/>
To watch crude Nature work in untaught minds;<br/>
To note the laws and progress of belief;<br/>
Though obstinate on this way, yet on that<br/>
How willingly we travel, and how far!<br/>
To have, for instance, brought upon the scene<br/>
The champion, Jack the Giant-killer: Lo!<br/>
He dons his coat of darkness; on the stage<br/>
Walks, and achieves his wonders, from the eye<br/>
Of living Mortal covert, "as the moon<br/>
Hid in her vacant interlunar cave."<br/>
Delusion bold! and how can it be wrought?<br/>
The garb he wears is black as death, the word<br/>
"<em>Invisible</em>" flames forth upon his chest.
</p>
<p>
Here, too, were "forms and pressures of the time,"<br/>
Rough, bold, as Grecian comedy displayed<br/>
When Art was young; dramas of living men,<br/>
And recent things yet warm with life; a sea-fight,<br/>
Shipwreck, or some domestic incident<br/>
Divulged by Truth and magnified by Fame,<br/>
Such as the daring brotherhood of late<br/>
Set forth, too serious theme for that light place&mdash;<br/>
I mean, O distant Friend! a story drawn<br/>
From our own ground,&mdash;the Maid of Buttermere,&mdash;<br/>
And how, unfaithful to a virtuous wife<br/>
Deserted and deceived, the spoiler came<br/>
And wooed the artless daughter of the hills,<br/>
And wedded her, in cruel mockery<br/>
Of love and marriage bonds. These words to thee<br/>
Must needs bring back the moment when we first,<br/>
Ere the broad world rang with the maiden's name,<br/>
Beheld her serving at the cottage inn,<br/>
Both stricken, as she entered or withdrew,<br/>
With admiration of her modest mien<br/>
And carriage, marked by unexampled grace.<br/>
We since that time not unfamiliarly<br/>
Have seen her,&mdash;her discretion have observed,<br/>
Her just opinions, delicate reserve,<br/>
Her patience, and humility of mind<br/>
Unspoiled by commendation and the excess<br/>
Of public notice&mdash;an offensive light<br/>
To a meek spirit suffering inwardly.
</p>
<p>
From this memorial tribute to my theme<br/>
I was returning, when, with sundry forms<br/>
Commingled&mdash;shapes which met me in the way<br/>
That we must tread&mdash;thy image rose again,<br/>
Maiden of Buttermere! She lives in peace<br/>
Upon the spot where she was born and reared;<br/>
Without contamination doth she live<br/>
In quietness, without anxiety:<br/>
Beside the mountain chapel, sleeps in earth<br/>
Her new-born infant, fearless as a lamb<br/>
That, thither driven from some unsheltered place,<br/>
Rests underneath the little rock-like pile<br/>
When storms are raging. Happy are they both&mdash;<br/>
Mother and child!&mdash;These feelings, in themselves<br/>
Trite, do yet scarcely seem so when I think<br/>
On those ingenuous moments of our youth<br/>
Ere we have learnt by use to slight the crimes<br/>
And sorrows of the world. Those simple days<br/>
Are now my theme; and, foremost of the scenes,<br/>
Which yet survive in memory, appears<br/>
One, at whose centre sate a lovely Boy,<br/>
A sportive infant, who, for six months' space,<br/>
Not more, had been of age to deal about<br/>
Articulate prattle&mdash;Child as beautiful<br/>
As ever clung around a mother's neck,<br/>
Or father fondly gazed upon with pride.<br/>
There, too, conspicuous for stature tall<br/>
And large dark eyes, beside her infant stood<br/>
The mother; but, upon her cheeks diffused,<br/>
False tints too well accorded with the glare<br/>
From play-house lustres thrown without reserve<br/>
On every object near. The Boy had been<br/>
The pride and pleasure of all lookers-on<br/>
In whatsoever place, but seemed in this<br/>
A sort of alien scattered from the clouds.<br/>
Of lusty vigour, more than infantine<br/>
He was in limb, in cheek a summer rose<br/>
Just three parts blown&mdash;a cottage-child&mdash;if e'er,<br/>
By cottage-door on breezy mountain side,<br/>
Or in some sheltering vale, was seen a babe<br/>
By Nature's gifts so favoured. Upon a board<br/>
Decked with refreshments had this child been placed,<br/>
<em>His</em> little stage in the vast theatre,<br/>
And there he sate surrounded with a throng<br/>
Of chance spectators, chiefly dissolute men<br/>
And shameless women, treated and caressed;<br/>
Ate, drank, and with the fruit and glasses played,<br/>
While oaths and laughter and indecent speech<br/>
Were rife about him as the songs of birds<br/>
Contending after showers. The mother now<br/>
Is fading out of memory, but I see<br/>
The lovely Boy as I beheld him then<br/>
Among the wretched and the falsely gay,<br/>
Like one of those who walked with hair unsinged<br/>
Amid the fiery furnace. Charms and spells<br/>
Muttered on black and spiteful instigation<br/>
Have stopped, as some believe, the kindliest growths.<br/>
Ah, with how different spirit might a prayer<br/>
Have been preferred, that this fair creature, checked<br/>
By special privilege of Nature's love,<br/>
Should in his childhood be detained for ever!<br/>
But with its universal freight the tide<br/>
Hath rolled along, and this bright innocent,<br/>
Mary! may now have lived till he could look<br/>
With envy on thy nameless babe that sleeps,<br/>
Beside the mountain chapel, undisturbed.
</p>
<p>
Four rapid years had scarcely then been told<br/>
Since, travelling southward from our pastoral hills,<br/>
I heard, and for the first time in my life,<br/>
The voice of woman utter blasphemy&mdash;<br/>
Saw woman as she is, to open shame<br/>
Abandoned, and the pride of public vice;<br/>
I shuddered, for a barrier seemed at once<br/>
Thrown in, that from humanity divorced<br/>
Humanity, splitting the race of man<br/>
In twain, yet leaving the same outward form.<br/>
Distress of mind ensued upon the sight<br/>
And ardent meditation. Later years<br/>
Brought to such spectacle a milder sadness.<br/>
Feelings of pure commiseration, grief<br/>
For the individual and the overthrow<br/>
Of her soul's beauty; farther I was then<br/>
But seldom led, or wished to go; in truth<br/>
The sorrow of the passion stopped me there.
</p>
<p>
But let me now, less moved, in order take<br/>
Our argument. Enough is said to show<br/>
How casual incidents of real life,<br/>
Observed where pastime only had been sought,<br/>
Outweighed, or put to flight, the set events<br/>
And measured passions of the stage, albeit<br/>
By Siddons trod in the fulness of her power.<br/>
Yet was the theatre my dear delight;<br/>
The very gilding, lamps and painted scrolls,<br/>
And all the mean upholstery of the place,<br/>
Wanted not animation, when the tide<br/>
Of pleasure ebbed but to return as fast<br/>
With the ever-shifting figures of the scene,<br/>
Solemn or gay: whether some beauteous dame<br/>
Advanced in radiance through a deep recess<br/>
Of thick entangled forest, like the moon<br/>
Opening the clouds; or sovereign king, announced<br/>
With flourishing trumpet, came in full-blown state<br/>
Of the world's greatness, winding round with train<br/>
Of courtiers, banners, and a length of guards;<br/>
Or captive led in abject weeds, and jingling<br/>
His slender manacles; or romping girl<br/>
Bounced, leapt, and pawed the air; or mumbling sire,<br/>
A scare-crow pattern of old age dressed up<br/>
In all the tatters of infirmity<br/>
All loosely put together, hobbled in,<br/>
Stumping upon a cane with which he smites,<br/>
From time to time, the solid boards, and makes them<br/>
Prate somewhat loudly of the whereabout<br/>
Of one so overloaded with his years.<br/>
But what of this! the laugh, the grin, grimace,<br/>
The antics striving to outstrip each other,<br/>
Were all received, the least of them not lost,<br/>
With an unmeasured welcome. Through the night,<br/>
Between the show, and many-headed mass<br/>
Of the spectators, and each several nook<br/>
Filled with its fray or brawl, how eagerly<br/>
And with what flashes, as it were, the mind<br/>
Turned this way&mdash;that way! sportive and alert<br/>
And watchful, as a kitten when at play,<br/>
While winds are eddying round her, among straws<br/>
And rustling leaves. Enchanting age and sweet!<br/>
Romantic almost, looked at through a space,<br/>
How small, of intervening years! For then,<br/>
Though surely no mean progress had been made<br/>
In meditations holy and sublime,<br/>
Yet something of a girlish child-like gloss<br/>
Of novelty survived for scenes like these;<br/>
Enjoyment haply handed down from times<br/>
When at a country-playhouse, some rude barn<br/>
Tricked out for that proud use, if I perchance<br/>
Caught, on a summer evening through a chink<br/>
In the old wall, an unexpected glimpse<br/>
Of daylight, the bare thought of where I was<br/>
Gladdened me more than if I had been led<br/>
Into a dazzling cavern of romance,<br/>
Crowded with Genii busy among works<br/>
Not to be looked at by the common sun.
</p>
<p>
The matter that detains us now may seem,<br/>
To many, neither dignified enough<br/>
Nor arduous, yet will not be scorned by them,<br/>
Who, looking inward, have observed the ties<br/>
That bind the perishable hours of life<br/>
Each to the other, and the curious props<br/>
By which the world of memory and thought<br/>
Exists and is sustained. More lofty themes,<br/>
Such as at least do wear a prouder face,<br/>
Solicit our regard; but when I think<br/>
Of these, I feel the imaginative power<br/>
Languish within me; even then it slept,<br/>
When, pressed by tragic sufferings, the heart<br/>
Was more than full; amid my sobs and tears<br/>
It slept, even in the pregnant season of youth.<br/>
For though I was most passionately moved<br/>
And yielded to all changes of the scene<br/>
With an obsequious promptness, yet the storm<br/>
Passed not beyond the suburbs of the mind;<br/>
Save when realities of act and mien,<br/>
The incarnation of the spirits that move<br/>
In harmony amid the Poet's world,<br/>
Rose to ideal grandeur, or, called forth<br/>
By power of contrast, made me recognise,<br/>
As at a glance, the things which I had shaped,<br/>
And yet not shaped, had seen and scarcely seen,<br/>
When, having closed the mighty Shakespeare's page,<br/>
I mused, and thought, and felt, in solitude.
</p>
<p>
Pass we from entertainments, that are such<br/>
Professedly, to others titled higher,<br/>
Yet, in the estimate of youth at least,<br/>
More near akin to those than names imply,&mdash;<br/>
I mean the brawls of lawyers in their courts<br/>
Before the ermined judge, or that great stage<br/>
Where senators, tongue-favoured men, perform,<br/>
Admired and envied. Oh! the beating heart,<br/>
When one among the prime of these rose up,&mdash;<br/>
One, of whose name from childhood we had heard<br/>
Familiarly, a household term, like those,<br/>
The Bedfords, Glosters, Salsburys, of old<br/>
Whom the fifth Harry talks of. Silence! hush!<br/>
This is no trifler, no short-flighted wit,<br/>
No stammerer of a minute, painfully<br/>
Delivered. No! the Orator hath yoked<br/>
The Hours, like young Aurora, to his car:<br/>
Thrice welcome Presence! how can patience e'er<br/>
Grow weary of attending on a track<br/>
That kindles with such glory! All are charmed,<br/>
Astonished; like a hero in romance,<br/>
He winds away his never-ending horn;<br/>
Words follow words, sense seems to follow sense:<br/>
What memory and what logic! till the strain<br/>
Transcendent, superhuman as it seemed,<br/>
Grows tedious even in a young man's ear.
</p>
<p>
Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced<br/>
By specious wonders, and too slow to tell<br/>
Of what the ingenuous, what bewildered men,<br/>
Beginning to mistrust their boastful guides,<br/>
And wise men, willing to grow wiser, caught,<br/>
Rapt auditors! from thy most eloquent tongue&mdash;<br/>
Now mute, for ever mute in the cold grave.<br/>
I see him,&mdash;old, but Vigorous in age,&mdash;<br/>
Stand like an oak whose stag-horn branches start<br/>
Out of its leafy brow, the more to awe<br/>
The younger brethren of the grove. But some&mdash;<br/>
While he forewarns, denounces, launches forth,<br/>
Against all systems built on abstract rights,<br/>
Keen ridicule; the majesty proclaims<br/>
Of Institutes and Laws, hallowed by time;<br/>
Declares the vital power of social ties<br/>
Endeared by Custom; and with high disdain,<br/>
Exploding upstart Theory, insists<br/>
Upon the allegiance to which men are born&mdash;<br/>
Some&mdash;say at once a froward multitude&mdash;<br/>
Murmur (for truth is hated, where not loved)<br/>
As the winds fret within the Æolian cave,<br/>
Galled by their monarch's chain. The times were big<br/>
With ominous change, which, night by night, provoked<br/>
Keen struggles, and black clouds of passion raised;<br/>
But memorable moments intervened,<br/>
When Wisdom, like the Goddess from Jove's brain,<br/>
Broke forth in armour of resplendent words,<br/>
Startling the Synod. Could a youth, and one<br/>
In ancient story versed, whose breast had heaved<br/>
Under the weight of classic eloquence,<br/>
Sit, see, and hear, unthankful, uninspired?
</p>
<p>
Nor did the Pulpit's oratory fail<br/>
To achieve its higher triumph. Not unfelt<br/>
Were its admonishments, nor lightly heard<br/>
The awful truths delivered thence by tongues<br/>
Endowed with various power to search the soul;<br/>
Yet ostentation, domineering, oft<br/>
Poured forth harangues, how sadly out of place!&mdash;<br/>
There have I seen a comely bachelor,<br/>
Fresh from a toilette of two hours, ascend<br/>
His rostrum, with seraphic glance look up,<br/>
And, in a tone elaborately low<br/>
Beginning, lead his voice through many a maze<br/>
A minuet course; and, winding up his mouth,<br/>
From time to time, into an orifice<br/>
Most delicate, a lurking eyelet, small,<br/>
And only not invisible, again<br/>
Open it out, diffusing thence a smile<br/>
Of rapt irradiation, exquisite.<br/>
Meanwhile the Evangelists, Isaiah, Job,<br/>
Moses, and he who penned, the other day,<br/>
The Death of Abel, Shakespeare, and the Bard<br/>
Whose genius spangled o'er a gloomy theme<br/>
With fancies thick as his inspiring stars,<br/>
And Ossian (doubt not, 'tis the naked truth)<br/>
Summoned from streamy Morven&mdash;each and all<br/>
Would, in their turns, lend ornaments and flowers<br/>
To entwine the crook of eloquence that helped<br/>
This pretty Shepherd, pride of all the plains,<br/>
To rule and guide his captivated flock.
</p>
<p>
I glance but at a few conspicuous marks,<br/>
Leaving a thousand others, that, in hall,<br/>
Court, theatre, conventicle, or shop,<br/>
In public room or private, park or street,<br/>
Each fondly reared on his own pedestal,<br/>
Looked out for admiration. Folly, vice,<br/>
Extravagance in gesture, mien, and dress,<br/>
And all the strife of singularity,<br/>
Lies to the ear, and lies to every sense&mdash;<br/>
Of these, and of the living shapes they wear,<br/>
There is no end. Such candidates for regard,<br/>
Although well pleased to be where they were found,<br/>
I did not hunt after, nor greatly prize,<br/>
Nor made unto myself a secret boast<br/>
Of reading them with quick and curious eye;<br/>
But, as a common produce, things that are<br/>
To-day, to-morrow will be, took of them<br/>
Such willing note, as, on some errand bound<br/>
That asks not speed, a Traveller might bestow<br/>
On sea-shells that bestrew the sandy beach,<br/>
Or daisies swarming through the fields of June.
</p>
<p>
But foolishness and madness in parade,<br/>
Though most at home in this their dear domain,<br/>
Are scattered everywhere, no rarities,<br/>
Even to the rudest novice of the Schools.<br/>
Me, rather, it employed, to note, and keep<br/>
In memory, those individual sights<br/>
Of courage, or integrity, or truth,<br/>
Or tenderness, which there, set off by foil,<br/>
Appeared more touching. One will I select;<br/>
A Father&mdash;for he bore that sacred name&mdash;<br/>
Him saw I, sitting in an open square,<br/>
Upon a corner-stone of that low wall,<br/>
Wherein were fixed the iron pales that fenced<br/>
A spacious grass-plot; there, in silence, sate<br/>
This One Man, with a sickly babe outstretched<br/>
Upon his knee, whom he had thither brought<br/>
For sunshine, and to breathe the fresher air.<br/>
Of those who passed, and me who looked at him,<br/>
He took no heed; but in his brawny arms<br/>
(The Artificer was to the elbow bare,<br/>
And from his work this moment had been stolen)<br/>
He held the child, and, bending over it,<br/>
As if he were afraid both of the sun<br/>
And of the air, which he had come to seek,<br/>
Eyed the poor babe with love unutterable.
</p>
<p>
As the black storm upon the mountain top<br/>
Sets off the sunbeam in the valley, so<br/>
That huge fermenting mass of human-kind<br/>
Serves as a solemn back-ground, or relief,<br/>
To single forms and objects, whence they draw,<br/>
For feeling and contemplative regard,<br/>
More than inherent liveliness and power.<br/>
How oft, amid those overflowing streets,<br/>
Have I gone forward with the crowd, and said<br/>
Unto myself, "The face of every one<br/>
That passes by me is a mystery!"<br/>
Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed<br/>
By thoughts of what and whither, when and how,<br/>
Until the shapes before my eyes became<br/>
A second-sight procession, such as glides<br/>
Over still mountains, or appears in dreams;<br/>
And once, far-travelled in such mood, beyond<br/>
The reach of common indication, lost<br/>
Amid the moving pageant, I was smitten<br/>
Abruptly, with the view (a sight not rare)<br/>
Of a blind Beggar, who, with upright face,<br/>
Stood, propped against a wall, upon his chest<br/>
Wearing a written paper, to explain<br/>
His story, whence he came, and who he was.<br/>
Caught by the spectacle my mind turned round<br/>
As with the might of waters; an apt type<br/>
This label seemed of the utmost we can know,<br/>
Both of ourselves and of the universe;<br/>
And, on the shape of that unmoving man,<br/>
His steadfast face and sightless eyes, I gazed,<br/>
As if admonished from another world.
</p>
<p>
Though reared upon the base of outward things,<br/>
Structures like these the excited spirit mainly<br/>
Builds for herself; scenes different there are,<br/>
Full-formed, that take, with small internal help,<br/>
Possession of the faculties,&mdash;the peace<br/>
That comes with night; the deep solemnity<br/>
Of nature's intermediate hours of rest,<br/>
When the great tide of human life stands still;<br/>
The business of the day to come, unborn,<br/>
Of that gone by, locked up, as in the grave;<br/>
The blended calmness of the heavens and earth,<br/>
Moonlight and stars, and empty streets, and sounds<br/>
Unfrequent as in deserts; at late hours<br/>
Of winter evenings, when unwholesome rains<br/>
Are falling hard, with people yet astir,<br/>
The feeble salutation from the voice<br/>
Of some unhappy woman, now and then<br/>
Heard as we pass, when no one looks about,<br/>
Nothing is listened to. But these, I fear,<br/>
Are falsely catalogued; things that are, are not,<br/>
As the mind answers to them, or the heart<br/>
Is prompt, or slow, to feel. What say you, then,<br/>
To times, when half the city shall break out<br/>
Full of one passion, vengeance, rage, or fear?<br/>
To executions, to a street on fire,<br/>
Mobs, riots, or rejoicings? From these sights<br/>
Take one,&mdash;that ancient festival, the Fair,<br/>
Holden where martyrs suffered in past time,<br/>
And named of St. Bartholomew; there, see<br/>
A work completed to our hands, that lays,<br/>
If any spectacle on earth can do,<br/>
The whole creative powers of man asleep!&mdash;<br/>
For once, the Muse's help will we implore,<br/>
And she shall lodge us, wafted on her wings,<br/>
Above the press and danger of the crowd,<br/>
Upon some showman's platform. What a shock<br/>
For eyes and ears! what anarchy and din,<br/>
Barbarian and infernal,&mdash;a phantasma,<br/>
Monstrous in colour, motion, shape, sight, sound!<br/>
Below, the open space, through every nook<br/>
Of the wide area, twinkles, is alive<br/>
With heads; the midway region, and above,<br/>
Is thronged with staring pictures and huge scrolls,<br/>
Dumb proclamations of the Prodigies;<br/>
With chattering monkeys dangling from their poles,<br/>
And children whirling in their roundabouts;<br/>
With those that stretch the neck and strain the eyes,<br/>
And crack the voice in rivalship, the crowd<br/>
Inviting; with buffoons against buffoons<br/>
Grimacing, writhing, screaming,&mdash;him who grinds<br/>
The hurdy-gurdy, at the fiddle weaves,<br/>
Rattles the salt-box, thumps the kettle-drum,<br/>
And him who at the trumpet puffs his cheeks,<br/>
The silver-collared Negro with his timbrel,<br/>
Equestrians, tumblers, women, girls, and boys,<br/>
Blue-breeched, pink-vested, with high-towering plumes.&mdash;<br/>
All moveables of wonder, from all parts,<br/>
Are here&mdash;Albinos, painted Indians, Dwarfs,<br/>
The Horse of knowledge, and the learned Pig,<br/>
The Stone-eater, the man that swallows fire,<br/>
Giants, Ventriloquists, the Invisible Girl,<br/>
The Bust that speaks and moves its goggling eyes,<br/>
The Wax-work, Clock-work, all the marvellous craft<br/>
Of modern Merlins, Wild Beasts, Puppet-shows,<br/>
All out-o'-the-way, far-fetched, perverted things,<br/>
All freaks of nature, all Promethean thoughts<br/>
Of man, his dullness, madness, and their feats<br/>
All jumbled up together, to compose<br/>
A Parliament of Monsters. Tents and Booths<br/>
Meanwhile, as if the whole were one vast mill,<br/>
Are vomiting, receiving on all sides,<br/>
Men, Women, three-years' Children, Babes in arms.
</p>
<p>
Oh, blank confusion! true epitome<br/>
Of what the mighty City is herself,<br/>
To thousands upon thousands of her sons,<br/>
Living amid the same perpetual whirl<br/>
Of trivial objects, melted and reduced<br/>
To one identity, by differences<br/>
That have no law, no meaning, and no end&mdash;<br/>
Oppression, under which even highest minds<br/>
Must labour, whence the strongest are not free.<br/>
But though the picture weary out the eye,<br/>
By nature an unmanageable sight,<br/>
It is not wholly so to him who looks<br/>
In steadiness, who hath among least things<br/>
An under-sense of greatest; sees the parts<br/>
As parts, but with a feeling of the whole.<br/>
This, of all acquisitions, first awaits<br/>
On sundry and most widely different modes<br/>
Of education, nor with least delight<br/>
On that through which I passed. Attention springs,<br/>
And comprehensiveness and memory flow,<br/>
From early converse with the works of God<br/>
Among all regions; chiefly where appear<br/>
Most obviously simplicity and power.<br/>
Think, how the everlasting streams and woods,<br/>
Stretched and still stretching far and wide, exalt<br/>
The roving Indian, on his desert sands:<br/>
What grandeur not unfelt, what pregnant show<br/>
Of beauty, meets the sun-burnt Arab's eye:<br/>
And, as the sea propels, from zone to zone,<br/>
Its currents; magnifies its shoals of life<br/>
Beyond all compass; spreads, and sends aloft<br/>
Armies of clouds,&mdash;even so, its powers and aspects<br/>
Shape for mankind, by principles as fixed,<br/>
The views and aspirations of the soul<br/>
To majesty. Like virtue have the forms<br/>
Perennial of the ancient hills; nor less<br/>
The changeful language of their countenances<br/>
Quickens the slumbering mind, and aids the thoughts,<br/>
However multitudinous, to move<br/>
With order and relation. This, if still,<br/>
As hitherto, in freedom I may speak,<br/>
Not violating any just restraint,<br/>
As may be hoped, of real modesty,&mdash;<br/>
This did I feel, in London's vast domain.<br/>
The Spirit of Nature was upon me there;<br/>
The soul of Beauty and enduring Life<br/>
Vouchsafed her inspiration, and diffused,<br/>
Through meagre lines and colours, and the press<br/>
Of self-destroying, transitory things,<br/>
Composure, and ennobling Harmony.

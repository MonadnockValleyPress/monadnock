<h1>Lines Written in Early Spring</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
I heard a thousand blended notes,<br/>
While in a grove I sate reclined,<br/>
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts<br/>
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.
</p>
<p>
To her fair works did Nature link<br/>
The human soul that through me ran;<br/>
And much it grieved my heart to think<br/>
What man has made of man.
</p>
<p>
Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,<br/>
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;<br/>
And 'tis my faith that every flower<br/>
Enjoys the air it breathes.
</p>
<p>
The birds around me hopped and played,<br/>
Their thoughts I cannot measure:&mdash;<br/>
But the least motion which they made,<br/>
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.
</p>
<p>
The budding twigs spread out their fan,<br/>
To catch the breezy air;<br/>
And I must think, do all I can,<br/>
That there was pleasure there.
</p>
<p>
If this belief from heaven be sent,<br/>
If such be Nature's holy plan,<br/>
Have I not reason to lament<br/>
What man has made of man?
</p>

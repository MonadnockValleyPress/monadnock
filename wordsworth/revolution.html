<h1>French Revolution</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth (1805)</h2>
<p>
Oh! pleasant exercise of hope and joy!<br/>
For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood<br/>
Upon our side, we who were strong in love!<br/>
Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,<br/>
But to be young was very heaven!&mdash;Oh! times,<br/>
In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways<br/>
Of custom, law, and statute, took at once<br/>
The attraction of a country in romance!<br/>
When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights,<br/>
When most intent on making of herself<br/>
A prime Enchantress&mdash;to assist the work,<br/>
Which then was going forward in her name!<br/>
Not favoured spots alone, but the whole earth,<br/>
The beauty wore of promise, that which sets<br/>
(As at some moment might not be unfelt<br/>
Among the bowers of paradise itself)<br/>
The budding rose above the rose full blown.<br/>
What temper at the prospect did not wake<br/>
To happiness unthought of? The inert<br/>
Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!<br/>
They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,<br/>
The playfellows of fancy, who had made<br/>
All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength<br/>
Their ministers,&mdash;who in lordly wise had stirred
Among the grandest objects of the sense,<br/>
And dealt with whatsoever they found there<br/>
As if they had within some lurking right<br/>
To wield it;&mdash;they, too, who, of gentle mood,<br/>
Had watched all gentle motions, and to these<br/>
Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,<br/>
And in the region of their peaceful selves;&mdash;<br/>
Now was it that both found, the meek and lofty<br/>
Did both find, helpers to their heart's desire,<br/>
And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish;<br/>
Were called upon to exercise their skill,<br/>
Not in Utopia, subterranean fields,<br/>
Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!<br/>
But in the very world, which is the world<br/>
Of all of us,&mdash;the place where in the end<br/>
We find our happiness, or not at all!

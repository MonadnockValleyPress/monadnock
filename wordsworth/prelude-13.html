<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Thirteenth</h2>
<h3>Imagination and Taste, How Impaired and Restored&mdash;<em>concluded.</em></h3>
<p>
From Nature doth emotion come, and moods<br/>
Of calmness equally are Nature's gift:<br/>
This is her glory; these two attributes<br/>
Are sister horns that constitute her strength.<br/>
Hence Genius, born to thrive by interchange<br/>
Of peace and excitation, finds in her<br/>
His best and purest friend; from her receives<br/>
That energy by which he seeks the truth,<br/>
From her that happy stillness of the mind<br/>
Which fits him to receive it when unsought.
</p>
<p>
Such benefit the humblest intellects<br/>
Partake of, each in their degree; 'tis mine<br/>
To speak, what I myself have known and felt;<br/>
Smooth task! for words find easy way, inspired<br/>
By gratitude, and confidence in truth.<br/>
Long time in search of knowledge did I range<br/>
The field of human life, in heart and mind<br/>
Benighted; but, the dawn beginning now<br/>
To re-appear, 'twas proved that not in vain<br/>
I had been taught to reverence a Power<br/>
That is the visible quality and shape<br/>
And image of right reason; that matures<br/>
Her processes by steadfast laws; gives birth<br/>
To no impatient or fallacious hopes,<br/>
No heat of passion or excessive zeal,<br/>
No vain conceits; provokes to no quick turns<br/>
Of self-applauding intellect; but trains<br/>
To meekness, and exalts by humble faith;<br/>
Holds up before the mind intoxicate<br/>
With present objects, and the busy dance<br/>
Of things that pass away, a temperate show<br/>
Of objects that endure; and by this course<br/>
Disposes her, when over-fondly set<br/>
On throwing off incumbrances, to seek<br/>
In man, and in the frame of social life,<br/>
Whate'er there is desirable and good<br/>
Of kindred permanence, unchanged in form<br/>
And function, or, through strict vicissitude<br/>
Of life and death, revolving. Above all<br/>
Were re-established now those watchful thoughts<br/>
Which, seeing little worthy or sublime<br/>
In what the Historian's pen so much delights<br/>
To blazon&mdash;power and energy detached<br/>
From moral purpose&mdash;early tutored me<br/>
To look with feelings of fraternal love<br/>
Upon the unassuming things that hold<br/>
A silent station in this beauteous world.
</p>
<p>
Thus moderated, thus composed, I found<br/>
Once more in Man an object of delight,<br/>
Of pure imagination, and of love;<br/>
And, as the horizon of my mind enlarged,<br/>
Again I took the intellectual eye<br/>
For my instructor, studious more to see<br/>
Great truths, than touch and handle little ones.<br/>
Knowledge was given accordingly; my trust<br/>
Became more firm in feelings that had stood<br/>
The test of such a trial; clearer far<br/>
My sense of excellence&mdash;of right and wrong:<br/>
The promise of the present time retired<br/>
Into its true proportion; sanguine schemes,<br/>
Ambitious projects, pleased me less; I sought<br/>
For present good in life's familiar face,<br/>
And built thereon my hopes of good to come.
</p>
<p>
With settling judgments now of what would last<br/>
And what would disappear; prepared to find<br/>
Presumption, folly, madness, in the men<br/>
Who thrust themselves upon the passive world<br/>
As Rulers of the world; to see in these,<br/>
Even when the public welfare is their aim,<br/>
Plans without thought, or built on theories<br/>
Vague and unsound; and having brought the books<br/>
Of modern statists to their proper test,<br/>
Life, human life, with all its sacred claims<br/>
Of sex and age, and heaven-descended rights,<br/>
Mortal, or those beyond the reach of death;<br/>
And having thus discerned how dire a thing<br/>
Is worshipped in that idol proudly named<br/>
"The Wealth of Nations," <em>where</em> alone that wealth<br/>
Is lodged, and how increased; and having gained<br/>
A more judicious knowledge of the worth<br/>
And dignity of individual man,<br/>
No composition of the brain, but man<br/>
Of whom we read, the man whom we behold<br/>
With our own eyes&mdash;I could not but inquire&mdash;<br/>
Not with less interest than heretofore,<br/>
But greater, though in spirit more subdued&mdash;<br/>
Why is this glorious creature to be found<br/>
One only in ten thousand? What one is,<br/>
Why may not millions be? What bars are thrown<br/>
By Nature in the way of such a hope?<br/>
Our animal appetites and daily wants,<br/>
Are these obstructions insurmountable?<br/>
If not, then others vanish into air.<br/>
"Inspect the basis of the social pile:<br/>
Inquire," said I, "how much of mental power<br/>
And genuine virtue they possess who live<br/>
By bodily toil, labour exceeding far<br/>
Their due proportion, under all the weight<br/>
Of that injustice which upon ourselves<br/>
Ourselves entail." Such estimate to frame<br/>
I chiefly looked (what need to look beyond?)<br/>
Among the natural abodes of men,<br/>
Fields with their rural works; recalled to mind<br/>
My earliest notices; with these compared<br/>
The observations made in later youth,<br/>
And to that day continued.&mdash;For, the time<br/>
Had never been when throes of mighty Nations<br/>
And the world's tumult unto me could yield,<br/>
How far soe'er transported and possessed,<br/>
Full measure of content; but still I craved<br/>
An intermingling of distinct regards<br/>
And truths of individual sympathy<br/>
Nearer ourselves. Such often might be gleaned<br/>
From the great City, else it must have proved<br/>
To me a heart-depressing wilderness;<br/>
But much was wanting: therefore did I turn<br/>
To you, ye pathways, and ye lonely roads;<br/>
Sought you enriched with everything I prized,<br/>
With human kindnesses and simple joys.
</p>
<p>
Oh! next to one dear state of bliss, vouchsafed<br/>
Alas! to few in this untoward world,<br/>
The bliss of walking daily in life's prime<br/>
Through field or forest with the maid we love,<br/>
While yet our hearts are young, while yet we breathe<br/>
Nothing but happiness, in some lone nook,<br/>
Deep vale, or any where, the home of both,<br/>
From which it would be misery to stir:<br/>
Oh! next to such enjoyment of our youth,<br/>
In my esteem, next to such dear delight,<br/>
Was that of wandering on from day to day<br/>
Where I could meditate in peace, and cull<br/>
Knowledge that step by step might lead me on<br/>
To wisdom; or, as lightsome as a bird<br/>
Wafted upon the wind from distant lands,<br/>
Sing notes of greeting to strange fields or groves,<br/>
Which lacked not voice to welcome me in turn:<br/>
And, when that pleasant toil had ceased to please,<br/>
Converse with men, where if we meet a face<br/>
We almost meet a friend, on naked heaths<br/>
With long long ways before, by cottage bench,<br/>
Or well-spring where the weary traveller rests.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Who doth not love to follow with his eye<br/>
The windings of a public way? the sight,<br/>
Familiar object as it is, hath wrought<br/>
On my imagination since the morn<br/>
Of childhood, when a disappearing line,<br/>
One daily present to my eyes, that crossed<br/>
The naked summit of a far-off hill<br/>
Beyond the limits that my feet had trod,<br/>
Was like an invitation into space<br/>
Boundless, or guide into eternity.<br/>
Yes, something of the grandeur which invests<br/>
The mariner who sails the roaring sea<br/>
Through storm and darkness, early in my mind<br/>
Surrounded, too, the wanderers of the earth;<br/>
Grandeur as much, and loveliness far more.<br/>
Awed have I been by strolling Bedlamites;<br/>
From many other uncouth vagrants (passed<br/>
In fear) have walked with quicker step; but why<br/>
Take note of this? When I began to enquire,<br/>
To watch and question those I met, and speak<br/>
Without reserve to them, the lonely roads<br/>
Were open schools in which I daily read<br/>
With most delight the passions of mankind,<br/>
Whether by words, looks, sighs, or tears, revealed;<br/>
There saw into the depth of human souls,<br/>
Souls that appear to have no depth at all<br/>
To careless eyes. And-now convinced at heart<br/>
How little those formalities, to which<br/>
With overweening trust alone we give<br/>
The name of Education, have to do<br/>
With real feeling and just sense; how vain<br/>
A correspondence with the talking world<br/>
Proves to the most; and called to make good search<br/>
If man's estate, by doom of Nature yoked<br/>
With toil, be therefore yoked with ignorance;<br/>
If virtue be indeed so hard to rear,<br/>
And intellectual strength so rare a boon&mdash;<br/>
I prized such walks still more, for there I found<br/>
Hope to my hope, and to my pleasure peace<br/>
And steadiness, and healing and repose<br/>
To every angry passion. There I heard,<br/>
From mouths of men obscure and lowly, truths<br/>
Replete with honour; sounds in unison<br/>
With loftiest promises of good and fair.
</p>
<p>
There are who think that strong affection, love<br/>
Known by whatever name, is falsely deemed<br/>
A gift, to use a term which they would use,<br/>
Of vulgar nature; that its growth requires<br/>
Retirement, leisure, language purified<br/>
By manners studied and elaborate;<br/>
That whoso feels such passion in its strength<br/>
Must live within the very light and air<br/>
Of courteous usages refined by art.<br/>
True is it, where oppression worse than death<br/>
Salutes the being at his birth, where grace<br/>
Of culture hath been utterly unknown,<br/>
And poverty and labour in excess<br/>
From day to day pre-occupy the ground<br/>
Of the affections, and to Nature's self<br/>
Oppose a deeper nature; there, indeed,<br/>
Love cannot be; nor does it thrive with ease<br/>
Among the close and overcrowded haunts<br/>
Of cities, where the human heart is sick,<br/>
And the eye feeds it not, and cannot feed.<br/>
&mdash;Yes, in those wanderings deeply did I feel<br/>
How we mislead each other; above all,<br/>
How books mislead us, seeking their reward<br/>
From judgments of the wealthy Few, who see<br/>
By artificial lights; how they debase<br/>
The Many for the pleasure of those Few;<br/>
Effeminately level down the truth<br/>
To certain general notions, for the sake<br/>
Of being understood at once, or else<br/>
Through want of better knowledge in the heads<br/>
That framed them; nattering self-conceit with words,<br/>
That, while they most ambitiously set forth<br/>
Extrinsic differences, the outward marks<br/>
Whereby society has parted man<br/>
From man, neglect the universal heart.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here, calling up to mind what then I saw,<br/>
A youthful traveller, and see daily now<br/>
In the familiar circuit of my home,<br/>
Here might I pause, and bend in reverence<br/>
To Nature, and the power of human minds,<br/>
To men as they are men within themselves.<br/>
How oft high service is performed within,<br/>
When all the external man is rude in show,&mdash;<br/>
Not like a temple rich with pomp and gold,<br/>
But a mere mountain chapel, that protects<br/>
Its simple worshippers from sun and shower.<br/>
Of these, said I, shall be my song; of these,<br/>
If future years mature me for the task,<br/>
Will I record the praises, making verse<br/>
Deal boldly with substantial things; in truth<br/>
And sanctity of passion, speak of these,<br/>
That justice may be done, obeisance paid<br/>
Where it is due: thus haply shall I teach,<br/>
Inspire, through unadulterated ears<br/>
Pour rapture, tenderness, and hope,&mdash;my theme<br/>
No other than the very heart of man,<br/>
As found among the best of those who live,<br/>
Not unexalted by religious faith,<br/>
Nor uninformed by books, good books, though few,<br/>
In Nature's presence: thence may I select<br/>
Sorrow, that is not sorrow, but delight;<br/>
And miserable love, that is not pain<br/>
To hear of, for the glory that redounds<br/>
Therefrom to human kind, and what we are.<br/>
Be mine to follow with no timid step<br/>
Where knowledge leads me: it shall be my pride<br/>
That I have dared to tread this holy ground,<br/>
Speaking no dream, but things oracular;<br/>
Matter not lightly to be heard by those<br/>
Who to the letter of the outward promise<br/>
Do read the invisible soul; by men adroit<br/>
In speech, and for communion with the world<br/>
Accomplished; minds whose faculties are then<br/>
Most active when they are most eloquent,<br/>
And elevated most when most admired.<br/>
Men may be found of other mould than these,<br/>
Who are their own upholders, to themselves<br/>
Encouragement, and energy, and will,<br/>
Expressing liveliest thoughts in lively words<br/>
As native passion dictates. Others, too,<br/>
There are among the walks of homely life<br/>
Still higher, men for contemplation framed,<br/>
Shy, and unpractised in the strife of phrase;<br/>
Meek men, whose very souls perhaps would sink<br/>
Beneath them, summoned to such intercourse:<br/>
Theirs is the language of the heavens, the power,<br/>
The thought, the image, and the silent joy:<br/>
Words are but under-agents in their souls;<br/>
When they are grasping with their greatest strength,<br/>
They do not breathe among them: this I speak<br/>
In gratitude to God, Who feeds our hearts<br/>
For His own service; knoweth, loveth us,<br/>
When we are unregarded by the world.
</p>
<p>
Also, about this time did I receive<br/>
Convictions still more strong than heretofore,<br/>
Not only that the inner frame is good,<br/>
And graciously composed, but that, no less,<br/>
Nature for all conditions wants not power<br/>
To consecrate, if we have eyes to see,<br/>
The outside of her creatures, and to breathe<br/>
Grandeur upon the very humblest face<br/>
Of human life. I felt that the array<br/>
Of act and circumstance, and visible form,<br/>
Is mainly to the pleasure of the mind<br/>
What passion makes them; that meanwhile the forms<br/>
Of Nature have a passion in themselves,<br/>
That intermingles with those works of man<br/>
To which she summons him; although the works<br/>
Be mean, have nothing lofty of their own;<br/>
And that the Genius of the Poet hence<br/>
May boldly take his way among mankind<br/>
Wherever Nature leads; that he hath stood<br/>
By Nature's side among the men of old,<br/>
And so shall stand for ever. Dearest Friend!<br/>
If thou partake the animating faith<br/>
That Poets, even as Prophets, each with each<br/>
Connected in a mighty scheme of truth,<br/>
Have each his own peculiar faculty,<br/>
Heaven's gift, a sense that fits him to perceive<br/>
Objects unseen before, thou wilt not blame<br/>
The humblest of this band who dares to hope<br/>
That unto him hath also been vouchsafed<br/>
An insight that in some sort he possesses,<br/>
A privilege whereby a work of his,<br/>
Proceeding from a source of untaught things,<br/>
Creative and enduring, may become<br/>
A power like one of Nature's. To a hope<br/>
Not less ambitious once among the wilds<br/>
Of Sarum's Plain, my youthful spirit was raised;<br/>
There, as I ranged at will the pastoral downs<br/>
Trackless and smooth, or paced the bare white roads<br/>
Lengthening in solitude their dreary line,<br/>
Time with his retinue of ages fled<br/>
Backwards, nor checked his flight until I saw<br/>
Our dim ancestral Past in vision clear;<br/>
Saw multitudes of men, and, here and there,<br/>
A single Briton clothed in wolf-skin vest,<br/>
With shield and stone-axe, stride across the wold;<br/>
The voice of spears was heard, the rattling spear<br/>
Shaken by arms of mighty bone, in strength,<br/>
Long mouldered, of barbaric majesty.<br/>
I called on Darkness&mdash;but before the word<br/>
Was uttered, midnight darkness seemed to take<br/>
All objects from my sight; and lo! again<br/>
The Desert visible by dismal flames;<br/>
It is the sacrificial altar, fed<br/>
With living men&mdash;how deep the groans! the voice<br/>
Of those that crowd the giant wicker thrills<br/>
The monumental hillocks, and the pomp<br/>
Is for both worlds, the living and the dead.<br/>
At other moments (for through that wide waste<br/>
Three summer days I roamed) where'er the Plain<br/>
Was figured o'er with circles, lines, or mounds,<br/>
That yet survive, a work, as some divine,<br/>
Shaped by the Druids, so to represent<br/>
Their knowledge of the heavens, and image forth<br/>
The constellations; gently was I charmed<br/>
Into a waking dream, a reverie<br/>
That, with believing eyes, where'er I turned,<br/>
Beheld long-bearded teachers, with white wands<br/>
Uplifted, pointing to the starry sky,<br/>
Alternately, and plain below, while breath<br/>
Of music swayed their motions, and the waste<br/>
Rejoiced with them and me in those sweet sounds.
</p>
<p>
This for the past, and things that may be viewed<br/>
Or fancied in the obscurity of years<br/>
From monumental hints: and thou, O Friend!<br/>
Pleased with some unpremeditated strains<br/>
That served those wanderings to beguile, hast said<br/>
That then and there my mind had exercised<br/>
Upon the vulgar forms of present things,<br/>
The actual world of our familiar days,<br/>
Yet higher power; had caught from them a tone,<br/>
An image, and a character, by books<br/>
Not hitherto reflected. Call we this<br/>
A partial judgment&mdash;and yet why? for <em>then</em><br/>
We were as strangers; and I may not speak<br/>
Thus wrongfully of verse, however rude,<br/>
Which on thy young imagination, trained<br/>
In the great City, broke like light from far.<br/>
Moreover, each man's Mind is to herself<br/>
Witness and judge; and I remember well<br/>
That in life's every-day appearances<br/>
I seemed about this time to gain clear sight<br/>
Of a new world&mdash;a world, too, that was fit<br/>
To be transmitted, and to other eyes<br/>
Made visible; as ruled by those fixed laws<br/>
Whence spiritual dignity originates,<br/>
Which do both give it being and maintain<br/>
A balance, an ennobling interchange<br/>
Of action from without and from within;<br/>
The excellence, pure function, and best power<br/>
Both of the object seen, and eye that sees.

<h1>I wandered lonely as a cloud</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
I wandered lonely as a cloud<br/>
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br/>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br/>
A host, of golden daffodils;<br/>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br/>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
</p>
<p>
Continuous as the stars that shine<br/>
And twinkle on the milky way,<br/>
They stretched in never-ending line<br/>
Along the margin of a bay:<br/>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br/>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
</p>
<p>
The waves beside them danced; but they<br/>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br/>
A poet could not but be gay,<br/>
In such a jocund company:<br/>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br/>
What wealth the show to me had brought:
</p>
<p>
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br/>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br/>
They flash upon that inward eye<br/>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br/>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br/>
And dances with the daffodils.

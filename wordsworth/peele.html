<h1>Elegiac Stanzas Suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle in a Storm, Painted by Sir George Beaumont</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged Pile!<br/>
Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee:<br/>
I saw thee every day; and all the while<br/>
Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea.<br/>
</p>
<p>So pure the sky, so quiet was the air!<br/>
So like, so very like, was day to day!<br/>
Whene'er I looked, thy Image still was there;<br/>
It trembled, but it never passed away.<br/>
</p>
<p>How perfect was the calm! it seemed no sleep;<br/>
No mood, which season takes away, or brings:<br/>
I could have fancied that the mighty Deep<br/>
Was even the gentlest of all gentle things.<br/>
</p>
<p>Ah! then , if mine had been the Painter's hand,<br/>
To express what then I saw; and add the gleam,<br/>
The light that never was, on sea or land,<br/>
The consecration, and the Poet's dream;<br/>
</p>
<p>I would have planted thee, thou hoary Pile<br/>
Amid a world how different from this!<br/>
Beside a sea that could not cease to smile;<br/>
On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss.<br/>
</p>
<p>Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine<br/>
Of peaceful years; a chronicle of heaven;&mdash;<br/>
Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine<br/>
The very sweetest had to thee been given.<br/>
</p>
<p>A Picture had it been of lasting ease,<br/>
Elysian quiet, without toil or strife;<br/>
No motion but the moving tide, a breeze,<br/>
Or merely silent Nature's breathing life.<br/>
</p>
<p>Such, in the fond illusion of my heart,<br/>
Such Picture would I at that time have made:<br/>
And seen the soul of truth in every part,<br/>
A steadfast peace that might not be betrayed.<br/>
</p>
<p>So once it would have been,&mdash;'tis so no more;<br/>
I have submitted to a new control:<br/>
A power is gone, which nothing can restore;<br/>
A deep distress hath humanised my Soul.<br/>
</p>
<p>Not for a moment could I now behold<br/>
A smiling sea, and be what I have been:<br/>
The feeling of my loss will ne'er be old;<br/>
This, which I know, I speak with mind serene.<br/>
</p>
<p>Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the Friend,<br/>
If he had lived, of Him whom I deplore,<br/>
This work of thine I blame not, but commend;<br/>
This sea in anger, and that dismal shore.<br/>
</p>
<p>O 'tis a passionate Work!&mdash;yet wise and well,<br/>
Well chosen is the spirit that is here;<br/>
That Hulk which labours in the deadly swell,<br/>
This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!<br/>
</p>
<p>And this huge Castle, standing here sublime,<br/>
I love to see the look with which it braves,<br/>
Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time,<br/>
The lightning, the fierce wind, the trampling waves.<br/>
</p>
<p>Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone,<br/>
Housed in a dream, at distance from the Kind!<br/>
Such happiness, wherever it be known,<br/>
Is to be pitied; for 'tis surely blind.<br/>
</p>
<p>But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer,<br/>
And frequent sights of what is to be borne!<br/>
Such sights, or worse, as are before me here.&mdash;<br/>
Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.<br/>

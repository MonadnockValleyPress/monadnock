<h1>The Sparrow’s Nest</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
Behold, within the leafy shade,<br/>
Those bright blue eggs together laid!<br/>
On me the chance-discovered sight<br/>
Gleamed like a vision of delight.<br/>
I started&mdash;seeming to espy<br/>
The home and sheltered bed,<br/>
The Sparrow's dwelling, which, hard by<br/>
My Father's house, in wet or dry<br/>
My sister Emmeline and I<br/>
Together visited.
</p>
<p>
She looked at it and seemed to fear it;<br/>
Dreading, tho' wishing, to be near it:<br/>
Such heart was in her, being then<br/>
A little Prattler among men.<br/>
The Blessing of my later years<br/>
Was with me when a boy:<br/>
She gave me eyes, she gave me ears;<br/>
And humble cares, and delicate fears;<br/>
A heart, the fountain of sweet tears;<br/>
And love, and thought, and joy.

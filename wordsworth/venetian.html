<h1>On the Extinction of the Venetian Republic</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee;<br/>
And was the safeguard of the west: the worth<br/>
Of Venice did not fall below her birth,<br/>
Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty.<br/>
She was a maiden City, bright and free;<br/>
No guile seduced, no force could violate;<br/>
And, when she took unto herself a Mate,<br/>
She must espouse the everlasting Sea.<br/>
And what if she had seen those glories fade,<br/>
Those titles vanish, and that strength decay;<br/>
Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid<br/>
When her long life hath reached its final day:<br/>
Men are we, and must grieve when even the Shade<br/>
Of that which once was great is passed away.

<h1>The world is too much with us; late and soon</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth (1806)</h2>
<p>
The world is too much with us; late and soon,<br/>
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:<br/>
Little we see in Nature that is ours;<br/>
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!<br/>
This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;<br/>
The winds that will be howling at all hours,<br/>
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;<br/>
For this, for every thing, we are out of tune;<br/>
It moves us not.&mdash;Great God! I'd rather be<br/>
A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;<br/>
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,<br/>
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;<br/>
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;<br/>
Or hear old Triton blow his wreath√®d horn.

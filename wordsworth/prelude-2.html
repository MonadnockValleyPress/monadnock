<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Second</h2>
<h3>School-Time continued ...</h3>
<p>
Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much<br/>
Unvisited, endeavoured to retrace<br/>
The simple ways in which my childhood walked;<br/>
Those chiefly that first led me to the love<br/>
Of rivers, woods, and fields. The passion yet<br/>
Was in its birth, sustained as might befal<br/>
By nourishment that came unsought; for still<br/>
From week to week, from month to month, we lived<br/>
A round of tumult. Duly were our games<br/>
Prolonged in summer till the day-light failed:<br/>
No chair remained before the doors; the bench<br/>
And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep<br/>
The labourer, and the old man who had sate<br/>
A later lingerer; yet the revelry<br/>
Continued and the loud uproar: at last,<br/>
When all the ground was dark, and twinkling stars<br/>
Edged the black clouds, home and to bed we went,<br/>
Feverish with weary joints and beating minds.<br/>
Ah! is there one who ever has been young,<br/>
Nor needs a warning voice to tame the pride<br/>
Of intellect and virtue's self-esteem?<br/>
One is there, though the wisest and the best<br/>
Of all mankind, who covets not at times<br/>
Union that cannot be;&mdash;who would not give,<br/>
If so he might, to duty and to truth<br/>
The eagerness of infantine desire?<br/>
A tranquillising spirit presses now<br/>
On my corporeal frame, so wide appears<br/>
The vacancy between me and those days<br/>
Which yet have such self-presence in my mind,<br/>
That, musing on them, often do I seem<br/>
Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself<br/>
And of some other Being. A rude mass<br/>
Of native rock, left midway in the square<br/>
Of our small market village, was the goal<br/>
Or centre of these sports; and when, returned<br/>
After long absence, thither I repaired,<br/>
Gone was the old grey stone, and in its place<br/>
A smart Assembly-room usurped the ground<br/>
That had been ours. There let the fiddle scream,<br/>
And be ye happy! Yet, my Friends! I know<br/>
That more than one of you will think with me<br/>
Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame<br/>
From whom the stone was named, who there had sate,<br/>
And watched her table with its huckster's wares<br/>
Assiduous, through the length of sixty years.<br/>
</p>
<p>
We ran a boisterous course; the year span round<br/>
With giddy motion. But the time approached<br/>
That brought with it a regular desire<br/>
For calmer pleasures, when the winning forms<br/>
Of Nature were collaterally attached<br/>
To every scheme of holiday delight<br/>
And every boyish sport, less grateful else<br/>
And languidly pursued.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When summer came,<br/>
Our pastime was, on bright half-holidays,<br/>
To sweep, along the plain of Windermere<br/>
With rival oars; and the selected bourne<br/>
Was now an Island musical with birds<br/>
That sang and ceased not; now a Sister Isle<br/>
Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown<br/>
With lilies of the valley like a field;<br/>
And now a third small Island, where survived<br/>
In solitude the ruins of a shrine<br/>
Once to Our Lady dedicate, and served<br/>
Daily with chaunted rites. In such a race<br/>
So ended, disappointment could be none,<br/>
Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:<br/>
We rested in the shade, all pleased alike,<br/>
Conquered and conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,<br/>
And the vain-glory of superior skill,<br/>
Were tempered; thus was gradually produced<br/>
A quiet independence of the heart;<br/>
And to my Friend who knows me I may add,<br/>
Fearless of blame, that hence for future days<br/>
Ensued a diffidence and modesty,<br/>
And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,<br/>
The self-sufficing power of Solitude.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Our daily meals were frugal, Sabine fare!<br/>
More than we wished we knew the blessing then<br/>
Of vigorous hunger&mdash;hence corporeal strength<br/>
Unsapped by delicate viands; for, exclude<br/>
A little weekly stipend, and we lived<br/>
Through three divisions of the quartered year<br/>
In penniless poverty. But now to school<br/>
From the half-yearly holidays returned,<br/>
We came with weightier purses, that sufficed<br/>
To furnish treats more costly than the Dame<br/>
Of the old grey stone, from her scant board, supplied.<br/>
Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,<br/>
Or in the woods, or by a river side<br/>
Or shady fountains, while among the leaves<br/>
Soft airs were stirring, and the mid-day sun<br/>
Unfelt shone brightly round us in our joy.<br/>
Nor is my aim neglected if I tell<br/>
How sometimes, in the length of those half-years,<br/>
We from our funds drew largely;&mdash;proud to curb,<br/>
And eager to spur on, the galloping steed;<br/>
And with the courteous inn-keeper, whose stud<br/>
Supplied our want, we haply might employ<br/>
Sly subterfuge, if the adventure's bound<br/>
Were distant: some famed temple where of yore<br/>
The Druids worshipped, or the antique walls<br/>
Of that large abbey, where within the Vale<br/>
Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built,<br/>
Stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch,<br/>
Belfry, and images, and living trees,<br/>
A holy scene! Along the smooth green turf<br/>
Our horses grazed. To more than inland peace<br/>
Left by the west wind sweeping overhead<br/>
From a tumultuous ocean, trees and towers<br/>
In that sequestered valley may be seen,<br/>
Both silent and both motionless alike;<br/>
Such the deep shelter that is there, and such<br/>
The safeguard for repose and quietness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Our steeds remounted and the summons given,<br/>
With whip and spur we through the chauntry flew<br/>
In uncouth race, and left the cross-legged knight,<br/>
And the stone-abbot, and that single wren<br/>
Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave<br/>
Of the old church, that&mdash;though from recent showers<br/>
The earth was comfortless, and touched by faint<br/>
Internal breezes, sobbings of the place<br/>
And respirations, from the roofless walls<br/>
The shuddering ivy dripped large drops&mdash;yet still<br/>
So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible bird<br/>
Sang to herself, that there I could have made<br/>
My dwelling-place, and lived for ever there<br/>
To hear such music. Through the walls we flew<br/>
And down the valley, and, a circuit made<br/>
In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth<br/>
We scampered homewards. Oh, ye rocks and streams,<br/>
And that still spirit shed from evening air!<br/>
Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt<br/>
Your presence, when with slackened step we breathed<br/>
Along the sides of the steep hills, or when<br/>
Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea<br/>
We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Midway on long Winander's eastern shore,<br/>
Within the crescent of a pleasant bay,<br/>
A tavern stood; no homely-featured house,<br/>
Primeval like its neighbouring cottages,<br/>
But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset<br/>
With chaises, grooms, and liveries, and within<br/>
Decanters, glasses, and the blood-red wine.<br/>
In ancient times, and ere the Hall was built<br/>
On the large island, had this dwelling been<br/>
More worthy of a poet's love, a hut,<br/>
Proud of its own bright fire and sycamore shade.<br/>
But&mdash;though the rhymes were gone that once inscribed<br/>
The threshold, and large golden characters,<br/>
Spread o'er the spangled sign-board, had dislodged<br/>
The old Lion and usurped his place, in slight<br/>
And mockery of the rustic painter's hand&mdash;<br/>
Yet, to this hour, the spot to me is dear<br/>
With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay<br/>
Upon a slope surmounted by a plain<br/>
Of a small bowling-green; beneath us stood<br/>
A grove, with gleams of water through the trees<br/>
And over the tree-tops; nor did we want<br/>
Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.<br/>
There, while through half an afternoon we played<br/>
On the smooth platform, whether skill prevailed<br/>
Or happy blunder triumphed, bursts of glee<br/>
Made all the mountains ring. But, ere night-fall,<br/>
When in our pinnace we returned at leisure<br/>
Over the shadowy lake, and to the beach<br/>
Of some small island steered our course with one,<br/>
The Minstrel of the Troop, and left him there,<br/>
And rowed off gently, while he blew his flute<br/>
Alone upon the rock&mdash;oh, then, the calm<br/>
And dead still water lay upon my mind<br/>
Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky,<br/>
Never before so beautiful, sank down<br/>
Into my heart, and held me like a dream!<br/>
Thus were my sympathies enlarged, and thus<br/>
Daily the common range of visible things<br/>
Grew dear to me: already I began<br/>
To love the sun; a boy I loved the sun,<br/>
Not as I since have loved him, as a pledge<br/>
And surety of our earthly life, a light<br/>
Which we behold and feel we are alive;<br/>
Nor for his bounty to so many worlds&mdash;<br/>
But for this cause, that I had seen him lay<br/>
His beauty on the morning hills, had seen<br/>
The western mountain touch his setting orb,<br/>
In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess<br/>
Of happiness, my blood appeared to flow<br/>
For its own pleasure, and I breathed with joy.<br/>
And, from like feelings, humble though intense,<br/>
To patriotic and domestic love<br/>
Analogous, the moon to me was dear;<br/>
For I could dream away my purposes,<br/>
Standing to gaze upon her while she hung<br/>
Midway between the hills, as if she knew<br/>
No other region, but belonged to thee,<br/>
Yea, appertained by a peculiar right<br/>
To thee and thy grey huts, thou one dear Vale!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Those incidental charms which first attached<br/>
My heart to rural objects, day by day<br/>
Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell<br/>
How Nature, intervenient till this time<br/>
And secondary, now at length was sought<br/>
For her own sake. But who shall parcel out<br/>
His intellect by geometric rules,<br/>
Split like a province into round and square?<br/>
Who knows the individual hour in which<br/>
His habits were first sown, even as a seed?<br/>
Who that shall point as with a wand and say<br/>
"This portion of the river of my mind<br/>
Came from yon fountain?" Thou, my Friend! art one<br/>
More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee<br/>
Science appears but what in truth she is,<br/>
Not as our glory and our absolute boast,<br/>
But as a succedaneum, and a prop<br/>
To our infirmity. No officious slave<br/>
Art thou of that false secondary power<br/>
By which we multiply distinctions; then,<br/>
Deem that our puny boundaries are things<br/>
That we perceive, and not that we have made.<br/>
To thee, unblinded by these formal arts,<br/>
The unity of all hath been revealed,<br/>
And thou wilt doubt, with me less aptly skilled<br/>
Than many are to range the faculties<br/>
In scale and order, class the cabinet<br/>
Of their sensations, and in voluble phrase<br/>
Run through the history and birth of each<br/>
As of a single independent thing.<br/>
Hard task, vain hope, to analyse the mind,<br/>
If each most obvious and particular thought,<br/>
Not in a mystical and idle sense,<br/>
But in the words of Reason deeply weighed,<br/>
Hath no beginning.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blest the infant Babe,<br/>
(For with my best conjecture I would trace<br/>
Our Being's earthly progress,) blest the Babe,<br/>
Nursed in his Mother's arms, who sinks to sleep<br/>
Rocked on his Mother's breast; who with his soul<br/>
Drinks in the feelings of his Mother's eye!<br/>
For him, in one dear Presence, there exists<br/>
A virtue which irradiates and exalts<br/>
Objects through widest intercourse of sense.<br/>
No outcast he, bewildered and depressed:<br/>
Along his infant veins are interfused<br/>
The gravitation and the filial bond<br/>
Of nature that connect him with the world.<br/>
Is there a flower, to which he points with hand<br/>
Too weak to gather it, already love<br/>
Drawn from love's purest earthly fount for him<br/>
Hath beautified that flower; already shades<br/>
Of pity cast from inward tenderness<br/>
Do fall around him upon aught that bears<br/>
Unsightly marks of violence or harm.<br/>
Emphatically such a Being lives,<br/>
Frail creature as he is, helpless as frail,<br/>
An inmate of this active universe.<br/>
For feeling has to him imparted power<br/>
That through the growing faculties of sense<br/>
Doth like an agent of the one great Mind<br/>
Create, creator and receiver both,<br/>
Working but in alliance with the works<br/>
Which it beholds. Such, verily, is the first<br/>
Poetic spirit of our human life,<br/>
By uniform control of after years,<br/>
In most, abated or suppressed; in some,<br/>
Through every change of growth and of decay,<br/>
Pre-eminent till death.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From early days,<br/>
Beginning not long after that first time<br/>
In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch<br/>
I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart,<br/>
I have endeavoured to display the means<br/>
Whereby this infant sensibility,<br/>
Great birthright of our being, was in me<br/>
Augmented and sustained. Yet is a path<br/>
More difficult before me; and I fear<br/>
That in its broken windings we shall need<br/>
The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:<br/>
For now a trouble came into my mind<br/>
From unknown causes. I was left alone<br/>
Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why.<br/>
The props of my affections were removed,<br/>
And yet the building stood, as if sustained<br/>
By its own spirit! All that I beheld<br/>
Was dear, and hence to finer influxes<br/>
The mind lay open to a more exact<br/>
And close communion. Many are our joys<br/>
In youth, but oh! what happiness to live<br/>
When every hour brings palpable access<br/>
Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,<br/>
And sorrow is not there! The seasons came,<br/>
And every season wheresoe'er I moved<br/>
Unfolded transitory qualities,<br/>
Which, but for this most watchful power of love,<br/>
Had been neglected; left a register<br/>
Of permanent relations, else unknown.<br/>
Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude<br/>
More active even than "best society"&mdash;<br/>
Society made sweet as solitude<br/>
By silent inobtrusive sympathies&mdash;<br/>
And gentle agitations of the mind<br/>
From manifold distinctions, difference<br/>
Perceived in things, where, to the unwatchful eye,<br/>
No difference is, and hence, from the same source,<br/>
Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone,<br/>
Under the quiet stars, and at that time<br/>
Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound<br/>
To breathe an elevated mood, by form<br/>
Or image unprofaned; and I would stand,<br/>
If the night blackened with a coming storm,<br/>
Beneath some rock, listening to notes that are<br/>
The ghostly language of the ancient earth,<br/>
Or make their dim abode in distant winds.<br/>
Thence did I drink the visionary power;<br/>
And deem not profitless those fleeting moods<br/>
Of shadowy exultation: not for this,<br/>
That they are kindred to our purer mind<br/>
And intellectual life; but that the soul,<br/>
Remembering how she felt, but what she felt<br/>
Remembering not, retains an obscure sense<br/>
Of possible sublimity, whereto<br/>
With growing faculties she doth aspire,<br/>
With faculties still growing, feeling still<br/>
That whatsoever point they gain, they yet<br/>
Have something to pursue.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not alone,<br/>
'Mid gloom and tumult, but no less 'mid fair<br/>
And tranquil scenes, that universal power<br/>
And fitness in the latent qualities<br/>
And essences of things, by which the mind<br/>
Is moved with feelings of delight, to me<br/>
Came, strengthened with a superadded soul,<br/>
A virtue not its own. My morning walks<br/>
Were early;&mdash;oft before the hours of school<br/>
I travelled round our little lake, five miles<br/>
Of pleasant wandering. Happy time! more dear<br/>
For this, that one was by my side, a Friend,<br/>
Then passionately loved; with heart how full<br/>
Would he peruse these lines! For many years<br/>
Have since flowed in between us, and, our minds<br/>
Both silent to each other, at this time<br/>
We live as if those hours had never been.<br/>
Nor seldom did I lift&mdash;our cottage latch<br/>
Far earlier, ere one smoke-wreath had risen<br/>
From human dwelling, or the vernal thrush<br/>
Was audible; and sate among the woods<br/>
Alone upon some jutting eminence,<br/>
At the first gleam of dawn-light, when the Vale,<br/>
Yet slumbering, lay in utter solitude.<br/>
How shall I seek the origin? where find<br/>
Faith in the marvellous things which then I felt?<br/>
Oft in these moments such a holy calm<br/>
Would overspread my soul, that bodily eyes<br/>
Were utterly forgotten, and what I saw<br/>
Appeared like something in myself, a dream,<br/>
A prospect in the mind.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twere long to tell<br/>
What spring and autumn, what the winter snows,<br/>
And what the summer shade, what day and night,<br/>
Evening and morning, sleep and waking, thought<br/>
From sources inexhaustible, poured forth<br/>
To feed the spirit of religious love<br/>
In which I walked with Nature. But let this<br/>
Be not forgotten, that I still retained<br/>
My first creative sensibility;<br/>
That by the regular action of the world<br/>
My soul was unsubdued. A plastic power<br/>
Abode with me; a forming hand, at times<br/>
Rebellious, acting in a devious mood;<br/>
A local spirit of his own, at war<br/>
With general tendency, but, for the most,<br/>
Subservient strictly to external things<br/>
With which it communed. An auxiliar light<br/>
Came from my mind, which on the setting sun<br/>
Bestowed new splendour; the melodious birds,<br/>
The fluttering breezes, fountains that run on<br/>
Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obeyed<br/>
A like dominion, and the midnight storm<br/>
Grew darker in the presence of my eye:<br/>
Hence my obeisance, my devotion hence,<br/>
And hence my transport.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor should this, perchance,<br/>
Pass unrecorded, that I still had loved<br/>
The exercise and produce of a toil,<br/>
Than analytic industry to me<br/>
More pleasing, and whose character I deem<br/>
Is more poetic as resembling more<br/>
Creative agency. The song would speak<br/>
Of that interminable building reared<br/>
By observation of affinities<br/>
In objects where no brotherhood exists<br/>
To passive minds. My seventeenth year was come;<br/>
And, whether from this habit rooted now<br/>
So deeply in my mind; or from excess<br/>
In the great social principle of life<br/>
Coercing all things into sympathy,<br/>
To unorganic natures were transferred<br/>
My own enjoyments; or the power of truth<br/>
Coming in revelation, did converse<br/>
With things that really are; I, at this time,<br/>
Saw blessings spread around me like a sea.<br/>
Thus while the days flew by, and years passed on,<br/>
From Nature and her overflowing soul,<br/>
I had received so much, that all my thoughts<br/>
Were steeped in feeling; I was only then<br/>
Contented, when with bliss ineffable<br/>
I felt the sentiment of Being spread<br/>
O'er all that moves and all that seemeth still;<br/>
O'er all that, lost beyond the reach of thought<br/>
And human knowledge, to the human eye<br/>
Invisible, yet liveth to the heart;<br/>
O'er all that leaps and runs, and shouts and sings,<br/>
Or beats the gladsome air; o'er all that glides<br/>
Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself,<br/>
And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not<br/>
If high the transport, great the joy I felt,<br/>
Communing in this sort through earth and heaven<br/>
With every form of creature, as it looked<br/>
Towards the Uncreated with a countenance<br/>
Of adoration, with an eye of love.<br/>
One song they sang, and it was audible,<br/>
Most audible, then, when the fleshly ear,<br/>
O'ercome by humblest prelude of that strain,<br/>
Forgot her functions, and slept undisturbed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
If this be error, and another faith<br/>
Find easier access to the pious mind,<br/>
Yet were I grossly destitute of all<br/>
Those human sentiments that make this earth<br/>
So dear, if I should fail with grateful voice<br/>
To speak of you, ye mountains, and ye lakes<br/>
And sounding cataracts, ye mists and winds<br/>
That dwell among the hills where I was born.<br/>
If in my youth I have been pure in heart,<br/>
If, mingling with the world, I am content<br/>
With my own modest pleasures, and have lived<br/>
With God and Nature communing, removed<br/>
From little enmities and low desires,<br/>
The gift is yours; if in these times of fear,<br/>
This melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown,<br/>
If, 'mid indifference and apathy,<br/>
And wicked exultation when good men<br/>
On every side fall off, we know not how,<br/>
To selfishness, disguised in gentle names<br/>
Of peace and quiet and domestic love,<br/>
Yet mingled not unwillingly with sneers<br/>
On visionary minds; if, in this time<br/>
Of dereliction and dismay, I yet<br/>
Despair not of our nature, but retain<br/>
A more than Roman confidence, a faith<br/>
That fails not, in all sorrow my support,<br/>
The blessing of my life; the gift is yours,<br/>
Ye winds and sounding cataracts! 'tis yours,<br/>
Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed<br/>
My lofty speculations; and in thee,<br/>
For this uneasy heart of ours, I find<br/>
A never-failing principle of joy<br/>
And purest passion.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, my Friend! wert reared<br/>
In the great city, 'mid far other scenes;<br/>
But we, by different roads, at length have gained<br/>
The self-same bourne. And for this cause to thee<br/>
I speak, unapprehensive of contempt,<br/>
The insinuated scoff of coward tongues,<br/>
And all that silent language which so oft<br/>
In conversation between man and man<br/>
Blots from the human countenance all trace<br/>
Of beauty and of love. For thou hast sought<br/>
The truth in solitude, and, since the days<br/>
That gave thee liberty, full long desired,<br/>
To serve in Nature's temple, thou hast been<br/>
The most assiduous of her ministers;<br/>
In many things my brother, chiefly here<br/>
In this our deep devotion.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fare thee well!<br/>
Health and the quiet of a healthful mind<br/>
Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,<br/>
And yet more often living with thyself,<br/>
And for thyself, so haply shall thy days<br/>
Be many, and a blessing to mankind.

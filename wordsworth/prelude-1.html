<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book First</h2>
<h3>Introduction:&mdash;Childhood and School-Time</h3>
<p>
O there is blessing in this gentle breeze,<br/>
A visitant that while it fans my cheek<br/>
Doth seem half-conscious of the joy it brings<br/>
From the green fields, and from yon azure sky.<br/>
Whate'er its mission, the soft breeze can come<br/>
To none more grateful than to me; escaped<br/>
From the vast city, where I long had pined<br/>
A discontented sojourner: now free,<br/>
Free as a bird to settle where I will.<br/>
What dwelling shall receive me? in what vale<br/>
Shall be my harbour? underneath what grove<br/>
Shall I take up my home? and what clear stream<br/>
Shall with its murmur lull me into rest?<br/>
The earth is all before me. With a heart<br/>
Joyous, nor scared at its own liberty,<br/>
I look about; and should the chosen guide<br/>
Be nothing better than a wandering cloud,<br/>
I cannot miss my way. I breathe again!<br/>
Trances of thought and mountings of the mind<br/>
Come fast upon me: it is shaken off,<br/>
That burthen of my own unnatural self,<br/>
The heavy weight of many a weary day<br/>
Not mine, and such as were not made for me.<br/>
Long months of peace (if such bold word accord<br/>
With any promises of human life),<br/>
Long months of ease and undisturbed delight<br/>
Are mine in prospect; whither shall I turn,<br/>
By road or pathway, or through trackless field,<br/>
Up hill or down, or shall some floating thing<br/>
Upon the river point me out my course?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Dear Liberty! Yet what would it avail<br/>
But for a gift that consecrates the joy?<br/>
For I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven<br/>
Was blowing on my body, felt within<br/>
A correspondent breeze, that gently moved<br/>
With quickening virtue, but is now become<br/>
A tempest, a redundant energy,<br/>
Vexing its own creation. Thanks to both,<br/>
And their congenial powers, that, while they join<br/>
In breaking up a long-continued frost,<br/>
Bring with them vernal promises, the hope<br/>
Of active days urged on by flying hours,&mdash;<br/>
Days of sweet leisure, taxed with patient thought<br/>
Abstruse, nor wanting punctual service high,<br/>
Matins and vespers of harmonious verse!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus far, O Friend! did I, not used to make<br/>
A present joy the matter of a song,<br/>
Pour forth that day my soul in measured strains<br/>
That would not be forgotten, and are here<br/>
Recorded: to the open fields I told<br/>
A prophecy: poetic numbers came<br/>
Spontaneously to clothe in priestly robe<br/>
A renovated spirit singled out,<br/>
Such hope was mine, for holy services.<br/>
My own voice cheered me, and, far more, the mind's<br/>
Internal echo of the imperfect sound;<br/>
To both I listened, drawing from them both<br/>
A cheerful confidence in things to come.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Content and not unwilling now to give<br/>
A respite to this passion, I paced on<br/>
With brisk and eager steps; and came, at length,<br/>
To a green shady place, where down I sate<br/>
Beneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice,<br/>
And settling into gentler happiness.<br/>
'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day,<br/>
With warmth, as much as needed, from a sun<br/>
Two hours declined towards the west; a day<br/>
With silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass,<br/>
And in the sheltered and the sheltering grove<br/>
A perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts<br/>
Encouraged and dismissed, till choice was made<br/>
Of a known Vale, whither my feet should turn,<br/>
Nor rest till they had reached the very door<br/>
Of the one cottage which methought I saw.<br/>
No picture of mere memory ever looked<br/>
So fair; and while upon the fancied scene<br/>
I gazed with growing love, a higher power<br/>
Than Fancy gave assurance of some work<br/>
Of glory there forthwith to be begun,<br/>
Perhaps too there performed. Thus long I mused,<br/>
Nor e'er lost sight of what I mused upon,<br/>
Save when, amid the stately groves of oaks,<br/>
Now here, now there, an acorn, from its cup<br/>
Dislodged, through sere leaves rustled, or at once<br/>
To the bare earth dropped with a startling sound.<br/>
From that soft couch I rose not, till the sun<br/>
Had almost touched the horizon; casting then<br/>
A backward glance upon the curling cloud<br/>
Of city smoke, by distance ruralised;<br/>
Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive,<br/>
But as a Pilgrim resolute, I took,<br/>
Even with the chance equipment of that hour,<br/>
The road that pointed toward the chosen Vale.<br/>
It was a splendid evening, and my soul<br/>
Once more made trial of her strength, nor lacked<br/>
Ã†olian visitations; but the harp<br/>
Was soon defrauded, and the banded host<br/>
Of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds,<br/>
And lastly utter silence! "Be it so;<br/>
Why think of any thing but present good?"<br/>
So, like a home-bound labourer I pursued<br/>
My way beneath the mellowing sun, that shed<br/>
Mild influence; nor left in me one wish<br/>
Again to bend the Sabbath of that time<br/>
To a servile yoke. What need of many words?<br/>
A pleasant loitering journey, through three days<br/>
Continued, brought me to my hermitage,<br/>
I spare to tell of what ensued, the life<br/>
In common things&mdash;the endless store of things,<br/>
Rare, or at least so seeming, every day<br/>
Found all about me in one neighbourhood&mdash;<br/>
The self-congratulation, and, from morn<br/>
To night, unbroken cheerfulness serene.<br/>
But speedily an earnest longing rose<br/>
To brace myself to some determined aim,<br/>
Reading or thinking; either to lay up<br/>
New stores, or rescue from decay the old<br/>
By timely interference: and therewith<br/>
Came hopes still higher, that with outward life<br/>
I might endue some airy phantasies<br/>
That had been floating loose about for years,<br/>
And to such beings temperately deal forth<br/>
The many feelings that oppressed my heart.<br/>
That hope hath been discouraged; welcome light<br/>
Dawns from the east, but dawns to disappear<br/>
And mock me with a sky that ripens not<br/>
Into a steady morning: if my mind,<br/>
Remembering the bold promise of the past,<br/>
Would gladly grapple with some noble theme,<br/>
Vain is her wish; where'er she turns she finds<br/>
Impediments from day to day renewed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now it would content me to yield up<br/>
Those lofty hopes awhile, for present gifts<br/>
Of humbler industry. But, oh, dear Friend!<br/>
The Poet, gentle creature as he is,<br/>
Hath, like the Lover, his unruly times;<br/>
His fits when he is neither sick nor well,<br/>
Though no distress be near him but his own<br/>
Unmanageable thoughts: his mind, best pleased<br/>
While she as duteous as the mother dove<br/>
Sits brooding, lives not always to that end,<br/>
But like the innocent bird, hath goadings on<br/>
That drive her as in trouble through the groves;<br/>
With me is now such passion, to be blamed<br/>
No otherwise than as it lasts too long.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When, as becomes a man who would prepare<br/>
For such an arduous work, I through myself<br/>
Make rigorous inquisition, the report<br/>
Is often cheering; for I neither seem<br/>
To lack that first great gift, the vital soul,<br/>
Nor general Truths, which are themselves a sort<br/>
Of Elements and Agents, Under-powers,<br/>
Subordinate helpers of the living mind:<br/>
Nor am I naked of external things,<br/>
Forms, images, nor numerous other aids<br/>
Of less regard, though won perhaps with toil<br/>
And needful to build up a Poet's praise.<br/>
Time, place, and manners do I seek, and these<br/>
Are found in plenteous store, but nowhere such<br/>
As may be singled out with steady choice;<br/>
No little band of yet remembered names<br/>
Whom I, in perfect confidence, might hope<br/>
To summon back from lonesome banishment,<br/>
And make them dwellers in the hearts of men<br/>
Now living, or to live in future years.<br/>
Sometimes the ambitious Power of choice, mistaking<br/>
Proud spring-tide swellings for a regular sea,<br/>
Will settle on some British theme, some old<br/>
Romantic tale by Milton left unsung;<br/>
More often turning to some gentle place<br/>
Within the groves of Chivalry, I pipe<br/>
To shepherd swains, or seated harp in hand,<br/>
Amid reposing knights by a river side<br/>
Or fountain, listen to the grave reports<br/>
Of dire enchantments faced and overcome<br/>
By the strong mind, and tales of warlike feats,<br/>
Where spear encountered spear, and sword with sword<br/>
Fought, as if conscious of the blazonry<br/>
That the shield bore, so glorious was the strife;<br/>
Whence inspiration for a song that winds<br/>
Through ever changing scenes of votive quest<br/>
Wrongs to redress, harmonious tribute paid<br/>
To patient courage and unblemished truth,<br/>
To firm devotion, zeal unquenchable,<br/>
And Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves.<br/>
Sometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate<br/>
How vanquished Mithridates northward passed,<br/>
And, hidden in the cloud of years, became<br/>
Odin, the Father of a race by whom<br/>
Perished the Roman Empire: how the friends<br/>
And followers of Sertorius, out of Spain<br/>
Flying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles,<br/>
And left their usages, their arts and laws,<br/>
To disappear by a slow gradual death,<br/>
To dwindle and to perish one by one,<br/>
Starved in those narrow bounds: but not the soul<br/>
Of Liberty, which fifteen hundred years<br/>
Survived, and, when the European came<br/>
With skill and power that might not be withstood,<br/>
Did, like a pestilence, maintain its hold<br/>
And wasted down by glorious death that race<br/>
Of natural heroes: or I would record<br/>
How, in tyrannic times, some high-souled man,<br/>
Unnamed among the chronicles of kings,<br/>
Suffered in silence for Truth's sake: or tell,<br/>
How that one Frenchman, through continued force<br/>
Of meditation on the inhuman deeds<br/>
Of those who conquered first the Indian Isles,<br/>
Went single in his ministry across<br/>
The Ocean; not to comfort the oppressed,<br/>
But, like a thirsty wind, to roam about<br/>
Withering the Oppressor: how Gustavus sought<br/>
Help at his need in Dalecarlia's mines:<br/>
How Wallace fought for Scotland; left the name<br/>
Of Wallace to be found, like a wild flower,<br/>
All over his dear Country; left the deeds<br/>
Of Wallace, like a family of Ghosts,<br/>
To people the steep rocks and river banks,<br/>
Her natural sanctuaries, with a local soul<br/>
Of independence and stern liberty.<br/>
Sometimes it suits me better to invent<br/>
A tale from my own heart, more near akin<br/>
To my own passions and habitual thoughts;<br/>
Some variegated story, in the main<br/>
Lofty, but the unsubstantial structure melts<br/>
Before the very sun that brightens it,<br/>
Mist into air dissolving! Then a wish,<br/>
My best and favourite aspiration, mounts<br/>
With yearning toward some philosophic song<br/>
Of Truth that cherishes our daily life;<br/>
With meditations passionate from deep<br/>
Recesses in man's heart, immortal verse<br/>
Thoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre;<br/>
But from this awful burthen I full soon<br/>
Take refuge and beguile myself with trust<br/>
That mellower years will bring a riper mind<br/>
And clearer insight. Thus my days are past<br/>
In contradiction; with no skill to part<br/>
Vague longing, haply bred by want of power,<br/>
From paramount impulse not to be withstood,<br/>
A timorous capacity from prudence,<br/>
From circumspection, infinite delay.<br/>
Humility and modest awe themselves<br/>
Betray me, serving often for a cloak<br/>
To a more subtle selfishness; that now<br/>
Locks every function up in blank reserve,<br/>
Now dupes me, trusting to an anxious eye<br/>
That with intrusive restlessness beats off<br/>
Simplicity and self-presented truth.<br/>
Ah! better far than this, to stray about<br/>
Voluptuously through fields and rural walks,<br/>
And ask no record of the hours, resigned<br/>
To vacant musing, unreproved neglect<br/>
Of all things, and deliberate holiday.<br/>
Far better never to have heard the name<br/>
Of zeal and just ambition, than to live<br/>
Baffled and plagued by a mind that every hour<br/>
Turns recreant to her task; takes heart again,<br/>
Then feels immediately some hollow thought<br/>
Hang like an interdict upon her hopes.<br/>
This is my lot; for either still I find<br/>
Some imperfection in the chosen theme,<br/>
Or see of absolute accomplishment<br/>
Much wanting, so much wanting, in myself,<br/>
That I recoil and droop, and seek repose<br/>
In listlessness from vain perplexity,<br/>
Unprofitably travelling toward the grave,<br/>
Like a false steward who hath much received<br/>
And renders nothing back.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it for this<br/>
That one, the fairest of all rivers, loved<br/>
To blend his murmurs with my nurse's song,<br/>
And, from his alder shades and rocky falls,<br/>
And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice<br/>
That flowed along my dreams? For this, didst thou,<br/>
O Derwent! winding among grassy holms<br/>
Where I was looking on, a babe in arms,<br/>
Make ceaseless music that composed my thoughts<br/>
To more than infant softness, giving me<br/>
Amid the fretful dwellings of mankind<br/>
A foretaste, a dim earnest, of the calm<br/>
That Nature breathes among the hills and groves?<br/>
When he had left the mountains and received<br/>
On his smooth breast the shadow of those towers<br/>
That yet survive, a shattered monument<br/>
Of feudal sway, the bright blue river passed<br/>
Along the margin of our terrace walk;<br/>
A tempting playmate whom we dearly loved.<br/>
Oh, many a time have I, a five years' child,<br/>
In a small mill-race severed from his stream,<br/>
Made one long bathing of a summer's day;<br/>
Basked in the sun, and plunged and basked again<br/>
Alternate, all a summer's day, or scoured<br/>
The sandy fields, leaping through flowery groves<br/>
Of yellow ragwort; or when rock and hill,<br/>
The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,<br/>
Were bronzed with deepest radiance, stood alone<br/>
Beneath the sky, as if I had been born<br/>
On Indian plains, and from my mother's hut<br/>
Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport<br/>
A naked savage, in the thunder shower.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up<br/>
Fostered alike by beauty and by fear:<br/>
Much favoured in my birth-place, and no less<br/>
In that beloved Vale to which erelong<br/>
We were transplanted&mdash;there were we let loose<br/>
For sports of wider range. Ere I had told<br/>
Ten birth-days, when among the mountain slopes<br/>
Frost, and the breath of frosty wind, had snapped<br/>
The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy<br/>
With store of springes o'er my shoulder hung<br/>
To range the open heights where woodcocks run<br/>
Along the smooth green turf. Through half the night,<br/>
Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied<br/>
That anxious visitation;&mdash;moon and stars<br/>
Were shining o'er my head. I was alone,<br/>
And seemed to be a trouble to the peace<br/>
That dwelt among them. Sometimes it befel<br/>
In these night wanderings, that a strong desire<br/>
O'erpowered my better reason, and the bird<br/>
Which was the captive of another's toil<br/>
Became my prey; and when the deed was done<br/>
I heard among the solitary hills<br/>
Low breathings coming after me, and sounds<br/>
Of undistinguishable motion, steps<br/>
Almost as silent as the turf they trod.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor less when spring had warmed the cultured Vale,<br/>
Moved we as plunderers where the mother-bird<br/>
Had in high places built her lodge; though mean<br/>
Our object and inglorious, yet the end<br/>
Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung<br/>
Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass<br/>
And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock<br/>
But ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)<br/>
Suspended by the blast that blew amain,<br/>
Shouldering the naked crag, oh, at that time<br/>
While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,<br/>
With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind<br/>
Blow through my ear! the sky seemed not a sky<br/>
Of earth&mdash;and with what motion moved the clouds!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Dust as we are, the immortal spirit grows<br/>
Like harmony in music; there is a dark<br/>
Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles<br/>
Discordant elements, makes them cling together<br/>
In one society. How strange that all<br/>
The terrors, pains, and early miseries,<br/>
Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused<br/>
Within my mind, should e'er have borne a part,<br/>
And that a needful part, in making up<br/>
The calm existence that is mine when I<br/>
Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end!<br/>
Thanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ;<br/>
Whether her fearless visitings, or those<br/>
That came with soft alarm, like hurtless light<br/>
Opening the peaceful clouds; or she may use<br/>
Severer interventions, ministry<br/>
More palpable, as best might suit her aim.<br/>
</p>
<p>
One summer evening (led by her) I found<br/>
A little boat tied to a willow tree<br/>
Within a rocky cave, its usual home.<br/>
Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in<br/>
Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth<br/>
And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice<br/>
Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;<br/>
Leaving behind her still, on either side,<br/>
Small circles glittering idly in the moon,<br/>
Until they melted all into one track<br/>
Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,<br/>
Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point<br/>
With an unswerving line, I fixed my view<br/>
Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,<br/>
The horizon's utmost boundary; far above<br/>
Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.<br/>
She was an elfin pinnace; lustily<br/>
I dipped my oars into the silent lake,<br/>
And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat<br/>
Went heaving through the water like a swan;<br/>
When, from behind that craggy steep till then<br/>
The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,<br/>
As if with voluntary power instinct<br/>
Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,<br/>
And growing still in stature the grim shape<br/>
Towered up between me and the stars, and still,<br/>
For so it seemed, with purpose of its own<br/>
And measured motion like a living thing,<br/>
Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,<br/>
And through the silent water stole my way<br/>
Back to the covert of the willow tree;<br/>
There in her mooring-place I left my bark,&mdash;<br/>
And through the meadows homeward went, in grave<br/>
And serious mood; but after I had seen<br/>
That spectacle, for many days, my brain<br/>
Worked with a dim and undetermined sense<br/>
Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts<br/>
There hung a darkness, call it solitude<br/>
Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes<br/>
Remained, no pleasant images of trees,<br/>
Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;<br/>
But huge and mighty forms, that do not live<br/>
Like living men, moved slowly through the mind<br/>
By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!<br/>
Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought,<br/>
That givest to forms and images a breath<br/>
And everlasting motion, not in vain<br/>
By day or star-light thus from my first dawn<br/>
Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me<br/>
The passions that build up our human soul;<br/>
Not with the mean and vulgar works of man,<br/>
But with high objects, with enduring things&mdash;<br/>
With life and nature, purifying thus<br/>
The elements of feeling and of thought,<br/>
And sanctifying, by such discipline,<br/>
Both pain and fear, until we recognise<br/>
A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.<br/>
Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me<br/>
With stinted kindness. In November days,<br/>
When vapours rolling down the valley made<br/>
A lonely scene more lonesome, among woods<br/>
At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,<br/>
When, by the margin of the trembling lake,<br/>
Beneath the gloomy hills homeward I went<br/>
In solitude, such intercourse was mine;<br/>
Mine was it in the fields both day and night,<br/>
And by the waters, all the summer long.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And in the frosty season, when the sun<br/>
Was set, and visible for many a mile<br/>
The cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom,<br/>
I heeded not their summons: happy time<br/>
It was indeed for all of us&mdash;for me<br/>
It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud<br/>
The village clock tolled six,&mdash;I wheeled about,<br/>
Proud and exulting like an untired horse<br/>
That cares not for his home. All shod with steel,<br/>
We hissed along the polished ice in games<br/>
Confederate, imitative of the chase<br/>
And woodland pleasures,&mdash;the resounding horn,<br/>
The pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare.<br/>
So through the darkness and the cold we flew,<br/>
And not a voice was idle; with the din<br/>
Smitten, the precipices rang aloud;<br/>
The leafless trees and every icy crag<br/>
Tinkled like iron; while far distant hills<br/>
Into the tumult sent an alien sound<br/>
Of melancholy not unnoticed, while the stars<br/>
Eastward were sparkling clear, and in the west<br/>
The orange sky of evening died away.<br/>
Not seldom from the uproar I retired<br/>
Into a silent bay, or sportively<br/>
Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,<br/>
To cut across the reflex of a star<br/>
That fled, and, flying still before me, gleamed<br/>
Upon the glassy plain; and oftentimes,<br/>
When we had given our bodies to the wind,<br/>
And all the shadowy banks on either side<br/>
Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still<br/>
The rapid line of motion, then at once<br/>
Have I, reclining back upon my heels,<br/>
Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs<br/>
Wheeled by me&mdash;even as if the earth had rolled<br/>
With visible motion her diurnal round!<br/>
Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,<br/>
Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched<br/>
Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ye Presences of Nature in the sky<br/>
And on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!<br/>
And Souls of lonely places! can I think<br/>
A vulgar hope was yours when ye employed<br/>
Such ministry, when ye through many a year<br/>
Haunting me thus among my boyish sports,<br/>
On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,<br/>
Impressed upon all forms the characters<br/>
Of danger or desire; and thus did make<br/>
The surface of the universal earth<br/>
With triumph and delight, with hope and fear,<br/>
Work like a sea?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not uselessly employed,<br/>
Might I pursue this theme through every change<br/>
Of exercise and play, to which the year<br/>
Did summon us in his delightful round.<br/>
</p>
<p>
We were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven<br/>
Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours;<br/>
Nor saw a band in happiness and joy<br/>
Richer, or worthier of the ground they trod.<br/>
I could record with no reluctant voice<br/>
The woods of autumn, and their hazel bowers<br/>
With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,<br/>
True symbol of hope's foolishness, whose strong<br/>
And unreproved enchantment led us on<br/>
By rocks and pools shut out from every star,<br/>
All the green summer, to forlorn cascades<br/>
Among the windings hid of mountain brooks.<br/>
&mdash;Unfading recollections! at this hour<br/>
The heart is almost mine with which I felt,<br/>
From some hill-top on sunny afternoons,<br/>
The paper kite high among fleecy clouds<br/>
Pull at her rein like an impetuous courser;<br/>
Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days,<br/>
Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly<br/>
Dashed headlong, and rejected by the storm.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ye lowly cottages wherein we dwelt,<br/>
A ministration of your own was yours;<br/>
Can I forget you, being as you were<br/>
So beautiful among the pleasant fields<br/>
In which ye stood? or can I here forget<br/>
The plain and seemly countenance with which<br/>
Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye<br/>
Delights and exultations of your own.<br/>
Eager and never weary we pursued<br/>
Our home-amusements by the warm peat-fire<br/>
At evening, when with pencil, and smooth slate<br/>
In square divisions parcelled out and all<br/>
With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,<br/>
We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head<br/>
In strife too humble to be named in verse:<br/>
Or round the naked table, snow-white deal,<br/>
Cherry or maple, sate in close array,<br/>
And to the combat, Loo or Whist, led on<br/>
A thick-ribbed army; not, as in the world,<br/>
Neglected and ungratefully thrown by<br/>
Even for the very service they had wrought,<br/>
But husbanded through many a long campaign.<br/>
Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few<br/>
Had changed their functions; some, plebeian cards<br/>
Which Fate, beyond the promise of their birth,<br/>
Had dignified, and called to represent<br/>
The persons of departed potentates.<br/>
Oh, with what echoes on the board they fell!<br/>
Ironic diamonds,&mdash;clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades,<br/>
A congregation piteously akin!<br/>
Cheap matter offered they to boyish wit,<br/>
Those sooty knaves, precipitated down<br/>
With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of heaven:<br/>
The paramount ace, a moon in her eclipse,<br/>
Queens gleaming through their splendour's last decay,<br/>
And monarchs surly at the wrongs sustained<br/>
By royal visages. Meanwhile abroad<br/>
Incessant rain was falling, or the frost<br/>
Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth;<br/>
And, interrupting oft that eager game,<br/>
From under Esthwaite's splitting fields of ice<br/>
The pent-up air, struggling to free itself,<br/>
Gave out to meadow grounds and hills a loud<br/>
Protracted yelling, like the noise of wolves<br/>
Howling in troops along the Bothnic Main.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace<br/>
How Nature by extrinsic passion first<br/>
Peopled the mind with forms sublime or fair,<br/>
And made me love them, may I here omit<br/>
How other pleasures have been mine, and joys<br/>
Of subtler origin; how I have felt,<br/>
Not seldom even in that tempestuous time,<br/>
Those hallowed and pure motions of the sense<br/>
Which seem, in their simplicity, to own<br/>
An intellectual charm; that calm delight<br/>
Which, if I err not, surely must belong<br/>
To those first-born affinities that fit<br/>
Our new existence to existing things,<br/>
And, in our dawn of being, constitute<br/>
The bond of union between life and joy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yes, I remember when the changeful earth,<br/>
And twice five summers on my mind had stamped<br/>
The faces of the moving year, even then<br/>
I held unconscious intercourse with beauty<br/>
Old as creation, drinking in a pure<br/>
Organic pleasure from the silver wreaths<br/>
Of curling mist, or from the level plain<br/>
Of waters coloured by impending clouds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The sands of Westmoreland, the creeks and bays<br/>
Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell<br/>
How, when the Sea threw off his evening shade,<br/>
And to the shepherd's hut on distant hills<br/>
Sent welcome notice of the rising moon,<br/>
How I have stood, to fancies such as these<br/>
A stranger, linking with the spectacle<br/>
No conscious memory of a kindred sight,<br/>
And bringing with me no peculiar sense<br/>
Of quietness or peace; yet have I stood,<br/>
Even while mine eye hath moved o'er many a league<br/>
Of shining water, gathering as it seemed<br/>
Through every hair-breadth in that field of light<br/>
New pleasure like a bee among the flowers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus oft amid those fits of vulgar joy<br/>
Which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits<br/>
Are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss<br/>
Which, like a tempest, works along the blood<br/>
And is forgotten; even then I felt<br/>
Gleams like the flashing of a shield;&mdash;the earth<br/>
And common face of Nature spake to me<br/>
Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,<br/>
By chance collisions and quaint accidents<br/>
(Like those ill-sorted unions, work supposed<br/>
Of evil-minded fairies), yet not vain<br/>
Nor profitless, if haply they impressed<br/>
Collateral objects and appearances,<br/>
Albeit lifeless then, and doomed to sleep<br/>
Until maturer seasons called them forth<br/>
To impregnate and to elevate the mind.<br/>
&mdash;And if the vulgar joy by its own weight<br/>
Wearied itself out of the memory,<br/>
The scenes which were a witness of that joy<br/>
Remained in their substantial lineaments<br/>
Depicted on the brain, and to the eye<br/>
Were visible, a daily sight; and thus<br/>
By the impressive discipline of fear,<br/>
By pleasure and repeated happiness,<br/>
So frequently repeated, and by force<br/>
Of obscure feelings representative<br/>
Of things forgotten, these same scenes so bright,<br/>
So beautiful, so majestic in themselves,<br/>
Though yet the day was distant, did become<br/>
Habitually dear, and all their forms<br/>
And changeful colours by invisible links<br/>
Were fastened to the affections.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began<br/>
My story early&mdash;not misled, I trust,<br/>
By an infirmity of love for days<br/>
Disowned by memory&mdash;ere the breath of spring<br/>
Planting my snowdrops among winter snows:<br/>
Nor will it seem to thee, O Friend! so prompt<br/>
In sympathy, that I have lengthened out<br/>
With fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale.<br/>
Meanwhile, my hope has been, that I might fetch<br/>
Invigorating thoughts from former years;<br/>
Might fix the wavering balance of my mind,<br/>
And haply meet reproaches too, whose power<br/>
May spur me on, in manhood now mature<br/>
To honourable toil. Yet should these hopes<br/>
Prove vain, and thus should neither I be taught<br/>
To understand myself, nor thou to know<br/>
With better knowledge how the heart was framed<br/>
Of him thou lovest; need I dread from thee<br/>
Harsh judgments, if the song be loth to quit<br/>
Those recollected hours that have the charm<br/>
Of visionary things, those lovely forms<br/>
And sweet sensations that throw back our life,<br/>
And almost make remotest infancy<br/>
A visible scene, on which the sun is shining?<br/>
</p>
<p>
One end at least hath been attained; my mind<br/>
Hath been revived, and if this genial mood<br/>
Desert me not, forthwith shall be brought down<br/>
Through later years the story of my life.<br/>
The road lies plain before me;&mdash;'tis a theme<br/>
Single and of determined bounds; and hence<br/>
I choose it rather at this time, than work<br/>
Of ampler or more varied argument,<br/>
Where I might be discomfited and lost:<br/>
And certain hopes are with me, that to thee<br/>
This labour will be welcome, honoured Friend!

<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Fourth</h2>
<h3>Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>
Bright was the summer's noon when quickening steps<br/>
Followed each other till a dreary moor<br/>
Was crossed, a bare ridge clomb, upon whose top <br/>
Standing alone, as from a rampart's edge,<br/>
I overlooked the bed of Windermere,<br/>
Like a vast river, stretching in the sun.<br/>
With exultation, at my feet I saw<br/>
Lake, islands, promontories, gleaming bays,<br/>
A universe of Nature's fairest forms<br/>
Proudly revealed with instantaneous burst,<br/>
Magnificent, and beautiful, and gay.<br/>
I bounded down the hill shouting amain<br/>
For the old Ferryman; to the shout the rocks<br/>
Replied, and when the Charon of the flood<br/>
Had staid his oars, and touched the jutting pier, <br/>
I did not step into the well-known boat<br/>
Without a cordial greeting. Thence with speed<br/>
Up the familiar hill I took my way <br/>
Towards that sweet Valley  where I had been reared;<br/>
'Twas but a short hour's walk, ere veering round<br/>
I saw the snow-white church upon her hill <br/>
Sit like a thron√®d Lady, sending out<br/>
A gracious look all over her domain. <br/>
Yon azure smoke betrays the lurking town;<br/>
With eager footsteps I advance and reach<br/>
The cottage threshold where my journey closed.<br/>
Glad welcome had I, with some tears, perhaps,<br/>
From my old Dame, so kind and motherly, <br/>
While she perused me with a parent's pride.<br/>
The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew<br/>
Upon thy grave, good creature! While my heart<br/>
Can beat never will I forget thy name.<br/>
Heaven's blessing be upon thee where thou liest<br/>
After thy innocent and busy stir<br/>
In narrow cares, thy little daily growth<br/>
Of calm enjoyments, after eighty years,<br/>
And more than eighty, of untroubled life, <br/>
Childless, yet by the strangers to thy blood<br/>
Honoured with little less than filial love.<br/>
What joy was mine to see thee once again,<br/>
Thee and thy dwelling, and a crowd of things<br/>
About its narrow precincts all beloved, <br/>
And many of them seeming yet my own!<br/>
Why should I speak of what a thousand hearts<br/>
Have felt, and every man alive can guess?<br/>
The rooms, the court, the garden were not left<br/>
Long unsaluted, nor the sunny seat<br/>
Round the stone table under the dark pine, <br/>
Friendly to studious or to festive hours;<br/>
Nor that unruly child of mountain birth,<br/>
The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed<br/>
Within our garden,  found himself at once,<br/>
As if by trick insidious and unkind,<br/>
Stripped of his voice  and left to dimple down<br/>
(Without an effort and without a will)<br/>
A channel paved by man's officious care. <br/>
I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,<br/>
And in the press of twenty thousand thoughts, <br/>
"Ha," quoth I, "pretty prisoner, are you there!"<br/>
Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered,<br/>
"An emblem here behold of thy own life;<br/>
In its late course of even days with all<br/>
Their smooth enthralment;" but the heart was full,<br/>
Too full for that reproach. My aged Dame<br/>
Walked proudly at my side: she guided me;<br/>
I willing, nay&mdash;nay, wishing to be led.<br/>
&mdash;The face of every neighbour whom I met<br/>
Was like a volume to me; some were hailed<br/>
Upon the road, some busy at their work,<br/>
Unceremonious greetings interchanged<br/>
With half the length of a long field between.<br/>
Among my schoolfellows I scattered round<br/>
Like recognitions, but with some constraint<br/>
Attended, doubtless, with a little pride,<br/>
But with more shame, for my habiliments,<br/>
The transformation wrought by gay attire.<br/>
Not less delighted did I take my place<br/>
At our domestic table: and,  dear Friend<br/>
In this endeavour simply to relate<br/>
A Poet's history, may I leave untold<br/>
The thankfulness with which I laid me down<br/>
In my accustomed bed, more welcome now<br/>
Perhaps than if it had been more desired<br/>
Or been more often thought of with regret;<br/>
That lowly bed whence I had heard the wind<br/>
Roar and the rain beat hard, where I so oft<br/>
Had lain awake on summer nights to watch<br/>
The moon in splendour couched among the leaves<br/>
Of a tall ash, that near our cottage stood; <br/>
Had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro<br/>
In the dark summit of the waving tree<br/>
She rocked with every impulse of the breeze.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Among the favourites whom it pleased me well<br/>
To see again, was one by ancient right<br/>
Our inmate, a rough terrier of the hills;<br/>
By birth and call of nature pre-ordained<br/>
To hunt the badger and unearth the fox<br/>
Among the impervious crags, but having been<br/>
From youth our own adopted, he had passed<br/>
Into a gentler service. And when first<br/>
The boyish spirit flagged, and day by day<br/>
Along my veins I kindled with the stir,<br/>
The fermentation, and the vernal heat<br/>
Of poesy, affecting private shades<br/>
Like a sick Lover, then this dog was used<br/>
To watch me, an attendant and a friend,<br/>
Obsequious to my steps early and late,<br/>
Though often of such dilatory walk<br/>
Tired, and uneasy at the halts I made.<br/>
A hundred times when, roving high and low<br/>
I have been harassed with the toil of verse,<br/>
Much pains and little progress, and at once<br/>
Some lovely Image in the song rose up<br/>
Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;<br/>
Then have I darted forwards to let<br/>
My hand upon his back with stormy joy,<br/>
Caressing him again and yet again.<br/>
And when at evening on the public way<br/>
I sauntered, like a river murmuring<br/>
And talking to itself when all things<br/>
Are still, the creature trotted on before;<br/>
Such was his custom; but whene'er he met<br/>
A passenger approaching, he would turn<br/>
To give me timely notice, and straightway,<br/>
Grateful for that admonishment, I<br/>
My voice, composed my gait, and, with the air<br/>
And mien of one whose thoughts are free, advanced<br/>
To give and take a greeting that might save<br/>
My name from piteous rumours, such as wait<br/>
On men suspected to be crazed in brain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Those walks well worthy to be prized and loved&mdash;<br/>
Regretted!&mdash;that word, too, was on my tongue,<br/>
But they were richly laden with all good,<br/>
And cannot be remembered but with thanks<br/>
And gratitude, and perfect joy of heart&mdash;<br/>
Those walks in all their freshness now came back<br/>
Like a returning Spring. When first I made<br/>
Once more the circuit of our little lake,<br/>
If ever happiness hath lodged with man,<br/>
That day consummate happiness was mine,<br/>
Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.<br/>
The sun was set, or setting, when I left<br/>
Our cottage door, and evening soon brought on<br/>
A sober hour, not winning or serene,<br/>
For cold and raw the air was, and untuned;<br/>
But as a face we love is sweetest then<br/>
When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look<br/>
It chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart<br/>
Have fulness in herself; even so with me<br/>
It fared that evening. Gently did my soul<br/>
Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood<br/>
Naked, as in the presence of her God.<br/>
While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch<br/>
A heart that had not been disconsolate:<br/>
Strength came where weakness was not known to be,<br/>
At least not felt; and restoration came<br/>
Like an intruder knocking at the door<br/>
Of unacknowledged weariness. I took<br/>
The balance, and with firm hand weighed myself.<br/>
&mdash;Of that external scene which round me lay,<br/>
Little, in this abstraction, did I see;<br/>
Remembered less; but I had inward hopes<br/>
And swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,<br/>
Conversed with promises, had glimmering views<br/>
How life pervades the undecaying mind;<br/>
How the immortal soul with God-like power<br/>
Informs, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep<br/>
That time can lay upon her; how on earth,<br/>
Man, if he do but live within the light<br/>
Of high endeavours, daily spreads abroad<br/>
His being armed with strength that cannot fail.<br/>
Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love<br/>
Of innocence, and holiday repose;<br/>
And more than pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir<br/>
Of boldest projects, and a peaceful end<br/>
At last, or glorious, by endurance won.<br/>
Thus musing, in a wood I sate me down<br/>
Alone, continuing there to muse: the slopes<br/>
And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread<br/>
With darkness, and before a rippling breeze<br/>
The long lake lengthened out its hoary line,<br/>
And in the sheltered coppice where I sate,<br/>
Around me from among the hazel leaves,<br/>
Now here, now there, moved by the straggling wind,<br/>
Came ever and anon a breath-like sound,<br/>
Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog,<br/>
The off and on companion of my walk;<br/>
And such, at times, believing them to be,<br/>
I turned my head to look if he were there;<br/>
Then into solemn thought I passed once more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A freshness also found I at this time<br/>
In human Life, the daily life of those<br/>
Whose occupations really I loved;<br/>
The peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise<br/>
Changed like a garden in the heat of spring<br/>
After an eight-days' absence. For (to omit<br/>
The things which were the same and yet appeared<br/>
Fair otherwise) amid this rural solitude,<br/>
A narrow Vale where each was known to all,<br/>
'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind<br/>
To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook,<br/>
Where an old man had used to sit alone,<br/>
Now vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left<br/>
In arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet<br/>
Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down;<br/>
And growing girls whose beauty, filched away<br/>
With all its pleasant promises, was gone<br/>
To deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yes, I had something of a subtler sense,<br/>
And often looking round was moved to smiles<br/>
Such as a delicate work of humour breeds;<br/>
I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,<br/>
Of those plain-living people now observed<br/>
With clearer knowledge; with another eye<br/>
I saw the quiet woodman in the woods,<br/>
The shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,<br/>
This chiefly, did I note my grey-haired Dame;<br/>
Saw her go forth to church or other work<br/>
Of state, equipped in monumental trim;<br/>
Short velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like),<br/>
A mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers<br/>
Wore in old time. Her smooth domestic life,<br/>
Affectionate without disquietude,<br/>
Her talk, her business, pleased me; and no less<br/>
Her clear though shallow stream of piety<br/>
That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;<br/>
With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read<br/>
Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,<br/>
And loved the book, when she had dropped asleep<br/>
And made of it a pillow for her head.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor less do I remember to have felt,<br/>
Distinctly manifested at this time,<br/>
A human-heartedness about my love<br/>
For objects hitherto the absolute wealth<br/>
Of my own private being and no more:<br/>
Which I had loved, even as a blessed spirit<br/>
Or Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,<br/>
Might love in individual happiness.<br/>
But now there opened on me other thoughts<br/>
Of change, congratulation or regret,<br/>
A pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;<br/>
The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,<br/>
The stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts&mdash;<br/>
White Sirius glittering o'er the southern crags,<br/>
Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven,<br/>
Acquaintances of every little child,<br/>
And Jupiter, my own beloved star!<br/>
Whatever shadings of mortality,<br/>
Whatever imports from the world of death<br/>
Had come among these objects heretofore,<br/>
Were, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,<br/>
Deep, gloomy were they, and severe; the scatterings<br/>
Of awe or tremulous dread, that had given way<br/>
In later youth to yearnings of a love<br/>
Enthusiastic, to delight and hope.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As one who hangs down-bending from the side<br/>
Of a slow-moving boat, upon the breast<br/>
Of a still water, solacing himself<br/>
With such discoveries as his eye can make<br/>
Beneath him in the bottom of the deep,<br/>
Sees many beauteous sights&mdash;weeds, fishes, flowers.<br/>
Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more,<br/>
Yet often is perplexed and cannot part<br/>
The shadow from the substance, rocks and sky,<br/>
Mountains and clouds, reflected in the depth<br/>
Of the clear flood, from things which there abide<br/>
In their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam<br/>
Of his own image, by a sun-beam now,<br/>
And wavering motions sent he knows not whence,<br/>
Impediments that make his task more sweet;<br/>
Such pleasant office have we long pursued<br/>
Incumbent o'er the surface of past time<br/>
With like success, nor often have appeared<br/>
Shapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned<br/>
Than these to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!<br/>
Would now direct thy notice. Yet in spite<br/>
Of pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,<br/>
There was an inner falling off&mdash;I loved,<br/>
Loved deeply all that had been loved before,<br/>
More deeply even than ever: but a swarm<br/>
Of heady schemes jostling each other, gawds,<br/>
And feast and dance, and public revelry,<br/>
And sports and games (too grateful in themselves,<br/>
Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe,<br/>
Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh<br/>
Of manliness and freedom) all conspired<br/>
To lure my mind from firm habitual quest<br/>
Of feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal<br/>
And damp those yearnings which had once been mine&mdash;<br/>
A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up<br/>
To his own eager thoughts. It would demand<br/>
Some skill, and longer time than may be spared,<br/>
To paint these vanities, and how they wrought<br/>
In haunts where they, till now, had been unknown.<br/>
It seemed the very garments that I wore<br/>
Preyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet stream<br/>
Of self-forgetfulness.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that heartless chase<br/>
Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange<br/>
For books and nature at that early age.<br/>
'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained<br/>
Of character or life; but at that time,<br/>
Of manners put to school I took small note,<br/>
And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere.<br/>
Far better had it been to exalt the mind<br/>
By solitary study, to uphold<br/>
Intense desire through meditative peace;<br/>
And yet, for chastisement of these regrets,<br/>
The memory of one particular hour<br/>
Doth here rise up against me. 'Mid a throng<br/>
Of maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid,<br/>
A medley of all tempers, I had passed<br/>
The night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth,<br/>
With din of instruments and shuffling feet,<br/>
And glancing forms, and tapers glittering,<br/>
And unaimed prattle flying up and down; <br/>
Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there<br/>
Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,<br/>
Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head,<br/>
And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired,<br/>
The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky<br/>
Was kindling, not unseen, from humble copse<br/>
And open field, through which the pathway wound,<br/>
And homeward led my steps. Magnificent<br/>
The morning rose, in memorable pomp,<br/>
Glorious as e'er I had beheld&mdash;in front,<br/>
The sea lay laughing at a distance; near,<br/>
The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,<br/>
Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;<br/>
And in the meadows and the lower grounds<br/>
Was all the sweetness of a common dawn&mdash;<br/>
Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds, <br/>
And labourers going forth to till the fields.<br/>
Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brim<br/>
My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows<br/>
Were then made for me; bond unknown to me<br/>
Was given, that I should be, else sinning greatly,<br/>
A dedicated Spirit. On I walked<br/>
In thankful blessedness, which yet survives. <br/>
</p>
<p>
Strange rendezvous! My mind was at that time<br/>
A parti-coloured show of grave and gay,<br/>
Solid and light, short-sighted and profound;<br/>
Of inconsiderate habits and sedate,<br/>
Consorting in one mansion unreproved.<br/>
The worth I knew of powers that I possessed,<br/>
Though slighted and too oft misused. Besides,<br/>
That summer, swarming as it did with thoughts<br/>
Transient and idle, lacked not intervals<br/>
When Folly from the frown of fleeting Time<br/>
Shrunk, and the mind experienced in herself<br/>
Conformity as just as that of old<br/>
To the end and written spirit of God's works,<br/>
Whether held forth in Nature or in Man,<br/>
Through pregnant vision, separate or conjoined.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When from our better selves we have too long<br/>
Been parted by the hurrying world, and droop,<br/>
Sick of its business, of its pleasures tired,<br/>
How gracious, how benign, is Solitude;<br/>
How potent a mere image of her sway;<br/>
Most potent when impressed upon the mind<br/>
With an appropriate human centre&mdash;hermit,<br/>
Deep in the bosom of the wilderness;<br/>
Votary (in vast cathedral, where no foot<br/>
Is treading, where no other face is seen)<br/>
Kneeling at prayers; or watchman on the top<br/>
Of lighthouse, beaten by Atlantic waves;<br/>
Or as the soul of that great Power is met<br/>
Sometimes embodied on a public road,<br/>
When, for the night deserted, it assumes<br/>
A character of quiet more profound<br/>
Than pathless wastes.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, when those summer months<br/>
Were flown, and autumn brought its annual show<br/>
Of oars with oars contending, sails with sails,<br/>
Upon Winander's spacious breast, it chanced<br/>
That&mdash;after I had left a flower-decked room<br/>
(Whose in-door pastime, lighted up, survived<br/>
To a late hour), and spirits overwrought<br/>
Were making night do penance for a day<br/>
Spent in a round of strenuous idleness&mdash;<br/>
My homeward course led up a long ascent,<br/>
Where the road's watery surface, to the top<br/>
Of that sharp rising, glittered to the moon<br/>
And bore the semblance of another stream<br/>
Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook<br/>
That murmured in the vale.  All else was still;<br/>
No living thing appeared in earth or air,<br/>
And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,<br/>
Sound there was none&mdash;but, lo! an uncouth shape,<br/>
Shown by a sudden turning of the road,<br/>
So near that, slipping back into the shade<br/>
Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,<br/>
Myself unseen. He was of stature tall,<br/>
A span above man's common measure, tall,<br/>
Stiff, lank, and upright; a more meagre man<br/>
Was never seen before by night or day.<br/>
Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth<br/>
Looked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,<br/>
A mile-stone propped him; I could also ken<br/>
That he was clothed in military garb,<br/>
Though faded, yet entire. Companionless,<br/>
No dog attending, by no staff sustained,<br/>
He stood, and in his very dress appeared<br/>
A desolation, a simplicity,<br/>
To which the trappings of a gaudy world<br/>
Make a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere long,<br/>
Issued low muttered sounds, as if of pain<br/>
Or some uneasy thought; yet still his form<br/>
Kept the same awful steadiness&mdash;at his feet<br/>
His shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blame<br/>
Not wholly free, I watched him thus; at length<br/>
Subduing my heart's specious cowardice,<br/>
I left the shady nook where I had stood<br/>
And hailed him. Slowly from his resting-place<br/>
He rose, and with a lean and wasted arm<br/>
In measured gesture lifted to his head<br/>
Returned my salutation; then resumed<br/>
His station as before; and when I asked<br/>
His history, the veteran, in reply,<br/>
Was neither slow nor eager; but, unmoved,<br/>
And with a quiet uncomplaining voice,<br/>
A stately air of mild indifference,<br/>
He told in few plain words a soldier's tale&mdash;<br/>
That in the Tropic Islands he had served,<br/>
Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past:<br/>
That on his landing he had been dismissed,<br/>
And now was travelling towards his native home.<br/>
This heard, I said, in pity, "Come with me."<br/>
He stooped, and straightway from the ground took up<br/>
An oaken staff by me yet unobserved&mdash;<br/>
A staff which must have dropt from his slack hand<br/>
And lay till now neglected in the grass.<br/>
Though weak his step and cautious, he appeared<br/>
To travel without pain, and I beheld,<br/>
With an astonishment but ill suppressed,<br/>
His ghostly figure moving at my side;<br/>
Nor could I, while we journeyed thus, forbear<br/>
To turn from present hardships to the past,<br/>
And speak of war, battle, and pestilence,<br/>
Sprinkling this talk with questions, better spared,<br/>
On what he might himself have seen or felt.<br/>
He all the while was in demeanour calm,<br/>
Concise in answer; solemn and sublime<br/>
He might have seemed, but that in all he said<br/>
There was a strange half-absence, as of one<br/>
Knowing too well the importance of his theme,<br/>
But feeling it no longer. Our discourse<br/>
Soon ended, and together on we passed<br/>
In silence through a wood gloomy and still.<br/>
Up-turning, then, along an open field,<br/>
We reached a cottage. At the door I knocked,<br/>
And earnestly to charitable care<br/>
Commended him as a poor friendless man,<br/>
Belated and by sickness overcome.<br/>
Assured that now the traveller would repose<br/>
In comfort, I entreated that henceforth<br/>
He would not linger in the public ways,<br/>
But ask for timely furtherance and help<br/>
Such as his state required. At this reproof,<br/>
With the same ghastly mildness in his look,<br/>
He said, "My trust is in the God of Heaven,<br/>
And in the eye of him who passes me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The cottage door was speedily unbarred,<br/>
And now the soldier touched his hat once more<br/>
With his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,<br/>
Whose tone bespake reviving interests<br/>
Till then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned<br/>
The farewell blessing of the patient man,<br/>
And so we parted. Back I cast a look,<br/>
And lingered near the door a little space,<br/>
Then sought with quiet heart my distant home.

<h1>I grieved for Buonaparté</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
I grieved for Buonaparté, with a vain<br/>
And an unthinking grief! The tenderest mood<br/>
Of that Man's mind—what can it be? what food<br/>
Fed his first hopes? what knowledge could he gain?<br/>
'Tis not in battles that from youth we train<br/>
The Governor who must be wise and good,<br/>
And temper with the sternness of the brain<br/>
Thoughts motherly, and meek as womanhood.<br/>
Wisdom doth live with children round her knees:<br/>
Books, leisure, perfect freedom, and the talk<br/>
Man holds with week-day man in the hourly walk<br/>
Of the mind's business: these are the degrees<br/>
By which true Sway doth mount; this is the stalk<br/>
True Power doth grow on; and her rights are these.

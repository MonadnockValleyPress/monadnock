<h1>London, 1802</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
Milton! thou should'st be living at this hour:<br/>
England hath need of thee: she is a fen<br/>
Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen,<br/>
Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,<br/>
Have forfeited their ancient English dower<br/>
Of inward happiness. We are selfish men;<br/>
Oh! raise us up, return to us again;<br/>
And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power.<br/>
Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart:<br/>
Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea:<br/>
Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,<br/>
So didst thou travel on life's common way,<br/>
In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart<br/>
The lowliest duties on herself did lay.
</p>

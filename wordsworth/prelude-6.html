<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Sixth</h2>
<h3>Cambridge and the Alps</h3>
<p>
The leaves were fading when to Esthwaite's banks<br/>
And the simplicities of cottage life<br/>
I bade farewell; and, one among the youth<br/>
Who, summoned by that season, reunite<br/>
As scattered birds troop to the fowler's lure,<br/>
Went back to Granta's cloisters, not so prompt<br/>
Or eager, though as gay and undepressed<br/>
In mind, as when I thence had taken flight<br/>
A few short months before. I turned my face<br/>
Without repining from the coves and heights<br/>
Clothed in the sunshine of the withering fern;<br/>
Quitted, not both, the mild magnificence<br/>
Of calmer lakes and louder streams; and you,<br/>
Frank-hearted maids of rocky Cumberland,<br/>
You and your not unwelcome days of mirth,<br/>
Relinquished, and your nights of revelry,<br/>
And in my own unlovely cell sate down<br/>
In lightsome mood&mdash;such privilege has youth<br/>
That cannot take long leave of pleasant thoughts.<br/>
The bonds of indolent society<br/>
Relaxing in their hold, henceforth I lived<br/>
More to myself. Two winters may be passed<br/>
Without a separate notice: many books<br/>
Were skimmed, devoured, or studiously perused,<br/>
But with no settled plan. I was detached<br/>
Internally from academic cares;<br/>
Yet independent study seemed a course<br/>
Of hardy disobedience toward friends<br/>
And kindred, proud rebellion and unkind.<br/>
This spurious virtue, rather let it bear<br/>
A name it now deserves, this cowardice,<br/>
Gave treacherous sanction to that over-love<br/>
Of freedom which encouraged me to turn<br/>
From regulations even of my own<br/>
As from restraints and bonds. Yet who can tell&mdash;<br/>
Who knows what thus may have been gained, both then<br/>
And at a later season, or preserved;<br/>
What love of nature, what original strength<br/>
Of contemplation, what intuitive truths,<br/>
The deepest and the best, what keen research,<br/>
Unbiassed, unbewildered, and unawed?
</p>
<p>
The Poet's soul was with me at that time;<br/>
Sweet meditations, the still overflow<br/>
Of present happiness, while future years<br/>
Lacked not anticipations, tender dreams,<br/>
No few of which have since been realised;<br/>
And some remain, hopes for my future life.<br/>
Four years and thirty, told this very week,<br/>
Have I been now a sojourner on earth,<br/>
By sorrow not unsmitten; yet for me<br/>
Life's morning radiance hath not left the hills,<br/>
Her dew is on the flowers. Those were the days<br/>
Which also first emboldened me to trust<br/>
With firmness, hitherto but lightly touched<br/>
By such a daring thought, that I might leave<br/>
Some monument behind me which pure hearts<br/>
Should reverence. The instinctive humbleness,<br/>
Maintained even by the very name and thought<br/>
Of printed books and authorship, began<br/>
To melt away; and further, the dread awe<br/>
Of mighty names was softened down and seemed<br/>
Approachable, admitting fellowship<br/>
Of modest sympathy. Such aspect now,<br/>
Though not familiarly, my mind put on,<br/>
Content to observe, to achieve, and to enjoy.
</p>
<p>
All winter long, whenever free to choose,<br/>
Did I by night frequent the College groves<br/>
And tributary walks; the last, and oft<br/>
The only one, who had been lingering there<br/>
Through hours of silence, till the porter's bell,<br/>
A punctual follower on the stroke of nine,<br/>
Rang with its blunt unceremonious voice,<br/>
Inexorable summons! Lofty elms,<br/>
Inviting shades of opportune recess,<br/>
Bestowed composure on a neighbourhood<br/>
Unpeaceful in itself. A single tree<br/>
With sinuous trunk, boughs exquisitely wreathed,<br/>
Grew there; an ash which Winter for himself<br/>
Decked out with pride, and with outlandish grace:<br/>
Up from the ground, and almost to the top,<br/>
The trunk and every master branch were green<br/>
With clustering ivy, and the lightsome twigs<br/>
And outer spray profusely tipped with seeds<br/>
That hung in yellow tassels, while the air<br/>
Stirred them, not voiceless. Often have I stood<br/>
Foot-bound uplooking at this lovely tree<br/>
Beneath a frosty moon. The hemisphere<br/>
Of magic fiction, verse of mine perchance<br/>
May never tread; but scarcely Spenser's self<br/>
Could have more tranquil visions in his youth,<br/>
Or could more bright appearances create<br/>
Of human forms with superhuman powers,<br/>
Than I beheld loitering on calm clear nights<br/>
Alone, beneath this fairy work of earth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the vague reading of a truant youth<br/>
'Twere idle to descant. My inner judgment<br/>
Not seldom differed from my taste in books.<br/>
As if it appertained to another mind,<br/>
And yet the books which then I valued most<br/>
Are dearest to me <em>now</em>; for, having scanned,<br/>
Not heedlessly, the laws, and watched the forms<br/>
Of Nature, in that knowledge I possessed<br/>
A standard, often usefully applied,<br/>
Even when unconsciously, to things removed<br/>
From a familiar sympathy.&mdash;In fine,<br/>
I was a better judge of thoughts than words,<br/>
Misled in estimating words, not only<br/>
By common inexperience of youth,<br/>
But by the trade in classic niceties,<br/>
The dangerous craft of culling term and phrase<br/>
From languages that want the living voice<br/>
To carry meaning to the natural heart;<br/>
To tell us what is passion, what is truth,<br/>
What reason, what simplicity and sense.
</p>
<p>
Yet may we not entirely overlook<br/>
The pleasure gathered from the rudiments<br/>
Of geometric science. Though advanced<br/>
In these inquiries, with regret I speak,<br/>
No farther than the threshold, there I found<br/>
Both elevation and composed delight:<br/>
With Indian awe and wonder, ignorance pleased<br/>
With its own struggles, did I meditate<br/>
On the relation those abstractions bear<br/>
To Nature's laws, and by what process led,<br/>
Those immaterial agents bowed their heads<br/>
Duly to serve the mind of earth-born man;<br/>
From star to star, from kindred sphere to sphere,<br/>
From system on to system without end.<br/>
</p>
<p>
More frequently from the same source I drew<br/>
A pleasure quiet and profound, a sense<br/>
Of permanent and universal sway,<br/>
And paramount belief; there, recognised<br/>
A type, for finite natures, of the one<br/>
Supreme Existence, the surpassing life<br/>
Which&mdash;to the boundaries of space and time,<br/>
Of melancholy space and doleful time,<br/>
Superior, and incapable of change,<br/>
Nor touched by welterings of passion&mdash;is,<br/>
And hath the name of, God. Transcendent peace<br/>
And silence did await upon these thoughts<br/>
That were a frequent comfort to my youth.
</p>
<p>
'Tis told by one whom stormy waters threw,<br/>
With fellow-sufferers by the shipwreck spared,<br/>
Upon a desert coast, that having brought<br/>
To land a single volume, saved by chance,<br/>
A treatise of Geometry, he wont,<br/>
Although of food and clothing destitute,<br/>
And beyond common wretchedness depressed,<br/>
To part from company and take this book<br/>
(Then first a self-taught pupil in its truths)<br/>
To spots remote, and draw his diagrams<br/>
With a long staff upon the sand, and thus<br/>
Did oft beguile his sorrow, and almost<br/>
Forget his feeling: so (if like effect<br/>
From the same cause produced, 'mid outward things<br/>
So different, may rightly be compared),<br/>
So was it then with me, and so will be<br/>
With Poets ever. Mighty is the charm<br/>
Of those abstractions to a mind beset<br/>
With images, and haunted by herself,<br/>
And specially delightful unto me<br/>
Was that clear synthesis built up aloft<br/>
So gracefully; even then when it appeared<br/>
Not more than a mere plaything, or a toy<br/>
To sense embodied: not the thing it is<br/>
In verity, an independent world,<br/>
Created out of pure intelligence.
</p>
<p>
Such dispositions then were mine unearned<br/>
By aught, I fear, of genuine desert&mdash;<br/>
Mine, through heaven's grace and inborn aptitudes.<br/>
And not to leave the story of that time<br/>
Imperfect, with these habits must be joined,<br/>
Moods melancholy, fits of spleen, that loved<br/>
A pensive sky, sad days, and piping winds,<br/>
The twilight more than dawn, autumn than spring;<br/>
A treasured and luxurious gloom of choice<br/>
And inclination mainly, and the mere<br/>
Redundancy of youth's contentedness.<br/>
&mdash;To time thus spent, add multitudes of hours<br/>
Pilfered away, by what the Bard who sang<br/>
Of the Enchanter Indolence hath called<br/>
"Good-natured lounging," and behold a map<br/>
Of my collegiate life&mdash;far less intense<br/>
Than duty called for, or, without regard<br/>
To duty, <em>might</em> have sprung up of itself<br/>
By change of accidents, or even, to speak<br/>
Without unkindness, in another place.<br/>
Yet why take refuge in that plea?&mdash;the fault,<br/>
This I repeat, was mine; mine be the blame.
</p>
<p>
In summer, making quest for works of art,<br/>
Or scenes renowned for beauty, I explored<br/>
That streamlet whose blue current works its way<br/>
Between romantic Dovedale's spiry rocks;<br/>
Pried into Yorkshire dales, or hidden tracts<br/>
Of my own native region, and was blest<br/>
Between these sundry wanderings with a joy<br/>
Above all joys, that seemed another morn<br/>
Risen on mid noon; blest with the presence, Friend!<br/>
Of that sole Sister, her who hath been long<br/>
Dear to thee also, thy true friend and mine,<br/>
Now, after separation desolate,<br/>
Restored to me&mdash;such absence that she seemed<br/>
A gift then first bestowed. The varied banks<br/>
Of Emont, hitherto unnamed in song,<br/>
And that monastic castle, 'mid tall trees,<br/>
Low-standing by the margin of the stream,<br/>
A mansion visited (as fame reports)<br/>
By Sidney, where, in sight of our Helvellyn,<br/>
Or stormy Cross-fell, snatches he might pen<br/>
Of his Arcadia, by fraternal love<br/>
Inspired;&mdash;that river and those mouldering towers<br/>
Have seen us side by side, when, having clomb<br/>
The darksome windings of a broken stair,<br/>
And crept along a ridge of fractured wall,<br/>
Not without trembling, we in safety looked<br/>
Forth, through some Gothic window's open space,<br/>
And gathered with one mind a rich reward<br/>
From the far-stretching landscape, by the light<br/>
Of morning beautified, or purple eve;<br/>
Or, not less pleased, lay on some turret's head,<br/>
Catching from tufts of grass and hare-bell flowers<br/>
Their faintest whisper to the passing breeze,<br/>
Given out while mid-day heat oppressed the plains.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Another maid there was, who also shed<br/>
A gladness o'er that season, then to me,<br/>
By her exulting outside look of youth<br/>
And placid under-countenance, first endeared;<br/>
That other spirit, Coleridge! who is now<br/>
So near to us, that meek confiding heart,<br/>
So reverenced by us both. O'er paths and fields<br/>
In all that neighbourhood, through narrow lanes<br/>
Of eglantine, and through the shady woods,<br/>
And o'er the Border Beacon, and the waste<br/>
Of naked pools, and common crags that lay<br/>
Exposed on the bare felt, were scattered love,<br/>
The spirit of pleasure, and youth's golden gleam.<br/>
O Friend! we had not seen thee at that time,<br/>
And yet a power is on me, and a strong<br/>
Confusion, and I seem to plant thee there.<br/>
Far art thou wandered now in search of health<br/>
And milder breezes,&mdash;melancholy lot!<br/>
But thou art with us, with us in the past,<br/>
The present, with us in the times to come.<br/>
There is no grief, no sorrow, no despair,<br/>
No languor, no dejection, no dismay,<br/>
No absence scarcely can there be, for those<br/>
Who love as we do. Speed thee well! divide<br/>
With us thy pleasure; thy returning strength,<br/>
Receive it daily as a joy of ours;<br/>
Share with us thy fresh spirits, whether gift<br/>
Of gales Etesian or of tender thoughts.
</p>
<p>
I, too, have been a wanderer; but, alas!<br/>
How different the fate of different men.<br/>
Though mutually unknown, yea nursed and reared<br/>
As if in several elements, we were framed<br/>
To bend at last to the same discipline,<br/>
Predestined, if two beings ever were,<br/>
To seek the same delights, and have one health,<br/>
One happiness. Throughout this narrative,<br/>
Else sooner ended, I have borne in mind<br/>
For whom it registers the birth, and marks the growth,<br/>
Of gentleness, simplicity, and truth,<br/>
And joyous loves, that hallow innocent days<br/>
Of peace and self-command. Of rivers, fields,<br/>
And groves I speak to thee, my Friend! to thee,<br/>
Who, yet a liveried schoolboy, in the depths<br/>
Of the huge city, on the leaded roof<br/>
Of that wide edifice, thy school and home,<br/>
Wert used to lie and gaze upon the clouds<br/>
Moving in heaven; or, of that pleasure tired,<br/>
To shut thine eyes, and by internal light<br/>
See trees, and meadows, and thy native stream,<br/>
Far distant, thus beheld from year to year<br/>
Of a long exile. Nor could I forget,<br/>
In this late portion of my argument,<br/>
That scarcely, as my term of pupilage<br/>
Ceased, had I left those academic bowers<br/>
When thou wert thither guided. From the heart<br/>
Of London, and from cloisters there, thou camest,<br/>
And didst sit down in temperance and peace,<br/>
A rigorous student. What a stormy course<br/>
Then followed. Oh! it is a pang that calls<br/>
For utterance, to think what easy change<br/>
Of circumstances might to thee have spared<br/>
A world of pain, ripened a thousand hopes,<br/>
For ever withered. Through this retrospect<br/>
Of my collegiate life I still have had<br/>
Thy after-sojourn in the self-same place<br/>
Present before my eyes, have played with times<br/>
And accidents as children do with cards,<br/>
Or as a man, who, when his house is built,<br/>
A frame locked up in wood and stone, doth still,<br/>
As impotent fancy prompts, by his fireside,<br/>
Rebuild it to his liking. I have thought<br/>
Of thee, thy learning, gorgeous eloquence,<br/>
And all the strength and plumage of thy youth,<br/>
Thy subtle speculations, toils abstruse<br/>
Among the schoolmen, and Platonic forms<br/>
Of wild ideal pageantry, shaped out<br/>
From things well-matched or ill, and words for things,<br/>
The self-created sustenance of a mind<br/>
Debarred from Nature's living images,<br/>
Compelled to be a life unto herself,<br/>
And unrelentingly possessed by thirst<br/>
Of greatness, love, and beauty. Not alone,<br/>
Ah! surely not in singleness of heart<br/>
Should I have seen the light of evening fade<br/>
From smooth Cam's silent waters: had we met,<br/>
Even at that early time, needs must I trust<br/>
In the belief, that my maturer age,<br/>
My calmer habits, and more steady voice,<br/>
Would with an influence benign have soothed,<br/>
Or chased away, the airy wretchedness<br/>
That battened on thy youth. But thou hast trod<br/>
A march of glory, which doth put to shame<br/>
These vain regrets; health suffers in thee, else<br/>
Such grief for thee would be the weakest thought<br/>
That ever harboured in the breast of man.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A passing word erewhile did lightly touch<br/>
On wanderings of my own, that now embraced<br/>
With livelier hope a region wider far.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When the third summer freed us from restraint,<br/>
A youthful friend, he too a mountaineer,<br/>
Not slow to share my wishes, took his staff,<br/>
And sallying forth, we journeyed side by side,<br/>
Bound to the distant Alps. A hardy slight<br/>
Did this unprecedented course imply<br/>
Of college studies and their set rewards;<br/>
Nor had, in truth, the scheme been formed by me<br/>
Without uneasy forethought of the pain,<br/>
The censures, and ill-omening of those<br/>
To whom my worldly interests were dear.<br/>
But Nature then was sovereign in my mind,<br/>
And mighty forms, seizing a youthful fancy,<br/>
Had given a charter to irregular hopes.<br/>
In any age of uneventful calm<br/>
Among the nations, surely would my heart<br/>
Have been possessed by similar desire;<br/>
But Europe at that time was thrilled with joy,<br/>
France standing on the top of golden hours,<br/>
And human nature seeming born again.
</p>
<p>
Lightly equipped, and but a few brief looks<br/>
Cast on the white cliffs of our native shore<br/>
From the receding vessel's deck, we chanced<br/>
To land at Calais on the very eve<br/>
Of that great federal day; and there we saw,<br/>
In a mean city, and among a few,<br/>
How bright a face is worn when joy of one<br/>
Is joy for tens of millions. Southward thence<br/>
We held our way, direct through hamlets, towns,<br/>
Gaudy with reliques of that festival,<br/>
Flowers left to wither on triumphal arcs,<br/>
And window-garlands. On the public roads,<br/>
And, once, three days successively, through paths<br/>
By which our toilsome journey was abridged,<br/>
Among sequestered villages we walked<br/>
And found benevolence and blessedness<br/>
Spread like a fragrance everywhere, when spring<br/>
Hath left no corner of the land untouched:<br/>
Where elms for many and many a league in files<br/>
With their thin umbrage, on the stately roads<br/>
Of that great kingdom, rustled o'er our heads,<br/>
For ever near us as we paced along:<br/>
How sweet at such a time, with such delight<br/>
On every side, in prime of youthful strength,<br/>
To feed a Poet's tender melancholy<br/>
And fond conceit of sadness, with the sound<br/>
Of undulations varying as might please<br/>
The wind that swayed them; once, and more than once,<br/>
Unhoused beneath the evening star we saw<br/>
Dances of liberty, and, in late hours<br/>
Of darkness, dances in the open air<br/>
Deftly prolonged, though grey-haired lookers on<br/>
Might waste their breath in chiding.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under hills&mdash;<br/>
The vine-clad hills and slopes of Burgundy,<br/>
Upon the bosom of the gentle Saône<br/>
We glided forward with the flowing stream,<br/>
Swift Rhone! thou wert the <em>wings</em> on which we cut<br/>
A winding passage with majestic ease<br/>
Between thy lofty rocks. Enchanting show<br/>
Those woods and farms and orchards did present<br/>
And single cottages and lurking towns,<br/>
Reach after reach, succession without end<br/>
Of deep and stately vales! A lonely pair<br/>
Of strangers, till day closed, we sailed along,<br/>
Clustered together with a merry crowd<br/>
Of those emancipated, a blithe host<br/>
Of travellers, chiefly delegates returning<br/>
From the great spousals newly solemnised<br/>
At their chief city, in the sight of Heaven.<br/>
Like bees they swarmed, gaudy and gay as bees;<br/>
Some vapoured in the unruliness of joy,<br/>
And with their swords flourished as if to fight<br/>
The saucy air. In this proud company<br/>
We landed&mdash;took with them our evening meal,<br/>
Guests welcome almost as the angels were<br/>
To Abraham of old. The supper done,<br/>
With flowing cups elate and happy thoughts<br/>
We rose at signal given, and formed a ring<br/>
And, hand in hand, danced round and round the board;<br/>
All hearts were open, every tongue was loud<br/>
With amity and glee; we bore a name<br/>
Honoured in France, the name of Englishmen,<br/>
And hospitably did they give us hail,<br/>
As their forerunners in a glorious course;<br/>
And round and round the board we danced again.<br/>
With these blithe friends our voyage we renewed<br/>
At early dawn. The monastery bells<br/>
Made a sweet jingling in our youthful ears;<br/>
The rapid river flowing without noise,<br/>
And each uprising or receding spire<br/>
Spake with a sense of peace, at intervals<br/>
Touching the heart amid the boisterous crew<br/>
By whom we were encompassed. Taking leave<br/>
Of this glad throng, foot-travellers side by side,<br/>
Measuring our steps in quiet, we pursued<br/>
Our journey, and ere twice the sun had set<br/>
Beheld the Convent of Chartreuse, and there<br/>
Rested within an awful <em>solitude:</em><br/>
Yes, for even then no other than a place<br/>
Of soul-affecting <em>solitude</em> appeared<br/>
That far-famed region, though our eyes had seen,<br/>
As toward the sacred mansion we advanced,<br/>
Arms flashing, and a military glare<br/>
Of riotous men commissioned to expel<br/>
The blameless inmates, and belike subvert<br/>
That frame of social being, which so long<br/>
Had bodied forth the ghostliness of things<br/>
In silence visible and perpetual calm.
</p>
<p>
&mdash;"Stay, stay your sacrilegious hands!"&mdash;The voice<br/>
Was Nature's, uttered from her Alpine throne;<br/>
I heard it then and seem to hear it now&mdash;<br/>
"Your impious work forbear, perish what may,<br/>
Let this one temple last, be this one spot<br/>
Of earth devoted to eternity!"<br/>
She ceased to speak, but while St. Bruno's pines<br/>
Waved their dark tops, not silent as they waved,<br/>
And while below, along their several beds,<br/>
Murmured the sister streams of Life and Death,<br/>
Thus by conflicting passions pressed, my heart<br/>
Responded; "Honour to the patriot's zeal!<br/>
Glory and hope to new-born Liberty!<br/>
Hail to the mighty projects of the time!<br/>
Discerning sword that Justice wields, do thou<br/>
Go forth and prosper; and, ye purging fires,<br/>
Up to the loftiest towers of Pride ascend,<br/>
Fanned by the breath of angry Providence.<br/>
But oh! if Past and Future be the wings,<br/>
On whose support harmoniously conjoined<br/>
Moves the great spirit of human knowledge, spare<br/>
These courts of mystery, where a step advanced<br/>
Between the portals of the shadowy rocks<br/>
Leaves far behind life's treacherous vanities,<br/>
For penitential tears and trembling hopes<br/>
Exchanged&mdash;to equalise in God's pure sight<br/>
Monarch and peasant: be the house redeemed<br/>
With its unworldly votaries, for the sake<br/>
Of conquest over sense, hourly achieved<br/>
Through faith and meditative reason, resting<br/>
Upon the word of heaven-imparted truth,<br/>
Calmly triumphant; and for humbler claim<br/>
Of that imaginative impulse sent<br/>
From these majestic floods, yon shining cliffs,<br/>
The untransmuted shapes of many worlds,<br/>
Cerulean ether's pure inhabitants,<br/>
These forests unapproachable by death,<br/>
That shall endure as long as man endures,<br/>
To think, to hope, to worship, and to feel,<br/>
To struggle, to be lost within himself<br/>
In trepidation, from the blank abyss<br/>
To look with bodily eyes, and be consoled."<br/>
Not seldom since that moment have I wished<br/>
That thou, O Friend! the trouble or the calm<br/>
Hadst shared, when, from profane regards apart,<br/>
In sympathetic reverence we trod<br/>
The floors of those dim cloisters, till that hour,<br/>
From their foundation, strangers to the presence<br/>
Of unrestricted and unthinking man.<br/>
Abroad, how cheeringly the sunshine lay<br/>
Upon the open lawns! Vallombre's groves<br/>
Entering, we fed the soul with darkness; thence<br/>
Issued, and with uplifted eyes beheld,<br/>
In different quarters of the bending sky,<br/>
The cross of Jesus stand erect, as if<br/>
Hands of angelic powers had fixed it there,<br/>
Memorial reverenced by a thousand storms;<br/>
Yet then, from the undiscriminating sweep<br/>
And rage of one State-whirlwind, insecure.
</p>
<p>
'Tis not my present purpose to retrace<br/>
That variegated journey step by step.<br/>
A march it was of military speed,<br/>
And Earth did change her images and forms<br/>
Before us, fast as clouds are changed in heaven.<br/>
Day after day, up early and down late,<br/>
From hill to vale we dropped, from vale to hill<br/>
Mounted&mdash;from province on to province swept,<br/>
Keen hunters in a chase of fourteen weeks,<br/>
Eager as birds of prey, or as a ship<br/>
Upon the stretch, when winds are blowing fair:<br/>
Sweet coverts did we cross of pastoral life,<br/>
Enticing valleys, greeted them and left<br/>
Too soon, while yet the very flash and gleam<br/>
Of salutation were not passed away.<br/>
Oh! sorrow for the youth who could have seen<br/>
Unchastened, unsubdued, unawed, unraised<br/>
To patriarchal dignity of mind,<br/>
And pure simplicity of wish and will,<br/>
Those sanctified abodes of peaceful man,<br/>
Pleased (though to hardship born, and compassed round<br/>
With danger, varying as the seasons change),<br/>
Pleased with his daily task, or, if not pleased,<br/>
Contented, from the moment that the dawn<br/>
(Ah! surely not without attendant gleams<br/>
Of soul-illumination) calls him forth<br/>
To industry, by glistenings flung on rocks,<br/>
Whose evening shadows lead him to repose,<br/>
Well might a stranger look with bounding heart<br/>
Down on a green recess, the first I saw<br/>
Of those deep haunts, an aboriginal vale,<br/>
Quiet and lorded over and possessed<br/>
By naked huts, wood-built, and sown like tents<br/>
Or Indian cabins over the fresh lawns<br/>
And by the river side.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That very day,<br/>
From a bare ridge we also first beheld<br/>
Unveiled the summit of Mont Blanc, and grieved<br/>
To have a soulless image on the eye<br/>
That had usurped upon a living thought<br/>
That never more could be. The wondrous Vale<br/>
Of Chamouny stretched far below, and soon<br/>
With its dumb cataracts and streams of ice,<br/>
A motionless array of mighty waves,<br/>
Five rivers broad and vast, made rich amends,<br/>
And reconciled us to realities;<br/>
There small birds warble from the leafy trees,<br/>
The eagle soars high in the element,<br/>
There doth the reaper bind the yellow sheaf,<br/>
The maiden spread the haycock in the sun,<br/>
While Winter like a well-tamed lion walks,<br/>
Descending from the mountain to make sport<br/>
Among the cottages by beds of flowers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Whate'er in this wide circuit we beheld,<br/>
Or heard, was fitted to our unripe state<br/>
Of intellect and heart. With such a book<br/>
Before our eyes, we could not choose but read<br/>
Lessons of genuine brotherhood, the plain<br/>
And universal reason of mankind,<br/>
The truths of young and old. Nor, side by side<br/>
Pacing, two social pilgrims, or alone<br/>
Each with his humour, could we fail to abound<br/>
In dreams and fictions, pensively composed:<br/>
Dejection taken up for pleasure's sake,<br/>
And gilded sympathies, the willow wreath,<br/>
And sober posies of funereal flowers,<br/>
Gathered among those solitudes sublime<br/>
From formal gardens of the lady Sorrow,<br/>
Did sweeten many a meditative hour.
</p>
<p>
Yet still in me with those soft luxuries<br/>
Mixed something of stem mood, an under-thirst<br/>
Of vigour seldom utterly allayed.<br/>
And from that source how different a sadness<br/>
Would issue, let one incident make known.<br/>
When from the Vallais we had turned, and clomb<br/>
Along the Simplon's steep and rugged road, <br/>
Following a band of muleteers, we reached<br/>
A halting-place, where all together took<br/>
Their noon-tide meal. Hastily rose our guide,<br/>
Leaving us at the board; awhile we lingered,<br/>
Then paced the beaten downward way that led<br/>
Right to a rough stream's edge, and there broke off;<br/>
The only track now visible was one<br/>
That from the torrent's further brink held forth<br/>
Conspicuous invitation to ascend<br/>
A lofty mountain. After brief delay<br/>
Crossing the unbridged stream, that road we took,<br/>
And clomb with eagerness, till anxious fears<br/>
Intruded, for we failed to overtake<br/>
Our comrades gone before. By fortunate chance,<br/>
While every moment added doubt to doubt,<br/>
A peasant met us, from whose mouth we learned<br/>
That to the spot which had perplexed us first<br/>
We must descend, and there should find the road,<br/>
Which in the stony channel of the stream<br/>
Lay a few steps, and then along its banks;<br/>
And, that our future course, all plain to sight,<br/>
Was downwards, with the current of that stream.<br/>
Loth to believe what we so grieved to hear,<br/>
For still we had hopes that pointed to the clouds,<br/>
We questioned him again, and yet again;<br/>
But every word that from the peasant's lips<br/>
Came in reply, translated by our feelings,<br/>
Ended in this,&mdash;'that we had crossed the Alps'.
</p>
<p>
Imagination&mdash;here the Power so called<br/>
Through sad incompetence of human speech,<br/>
That awful Power rose from the mind's abyss<br/>
Like an unfathered vapour that enwraps,<br/>
At once, some lonely traveller. I was lost;<br/>
Halted without an effort to break through;<br/>
But to my conscious soul I now can say&mdash;<br/>
"I recognise thy glory:" in such strength<br/>
Of usurpation, when the light of sense<br/>
Goes out, but with a flash that has revealed<br/>
The invisible world, doth greatness make abode,<br/>
There harbours; whether we be young or old,<br/>
Our destiny, our being's heart and home,<br/>
Is with infinitude, and only there;<br/>
With hope it is, hope that can never die,<br/>
Effort, and expectation, and desire,<br/>
And something evermore about to be.<br/>
Under such banners militant, the soul<br/>
Seeks for no trophies, struggles for no spoils<br/>
That may attest her prowess, blest in thoughts<br/>
That are their own perfection and reward,<br/>
Strong in herself and in beatitude<br/>
That hides her, like the mighty flood of Nile<br/>
Poured from his fount of Abyssinian clouds<br/>
To fertilise the whole Egyptian plain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The melancholy slackening that ensued<br/>
Upon those tidings by the peasant given<br/>
Was soon dislodged. Downwards we hurried fast,<br/>
And, with the half-shaped road which we had missed,<br/>
Entered a narrow chasm. The brook and road<br/>
Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy strait, <br/>
And with them did we journey several hours<br/>
At a slow pace. The immeasurable height<br/>
Of woods decaying, never to be decayed,<br/>
The stationary blasts of waterfalls,<br/>
And in the narrow rent at every turn<br/>
Winds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn,<br/>
The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,<br/>
The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,<br/>
Black drizzling crags that spake by the way-side<br/>
As if a voice were in them, the sick sight<br/>
And giddy prospect of the raving stream,<br/>
The unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens,<br/>
Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light&mdash;<br/>
Were all like workings of one mind, the features<br/>
Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree;<br/>
Characters of the great Apocalypse,<br/>
The types and symbols of Eternity,<br/>
Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That night our lodging was a house that stood<br/>
Alone within the valley, at a point<br/>
Where, tumbling from aloft, a torrent swelled<br/>
The rapid stream whose margin we had trod;<br/>
A dreary mansion, large beyond all need, <br/>
With high and spacious rooms, deafened and stunned<br/>
By noise of waters, making innocent sleep<br/>
Lie melancholy among weary bones.
</p>
<p>
Uprisen betimes, our journey we renewed,<br/>
Led by the stream, ere noon-day magnified<br/>
Into a lordly river, broad and deep,<br/>
Dimpling along in silent majesty,<br/>
With mountains for its neighbours, and in view<br/>
Of distant mountains and their snowy tops,<br/>
And thus proceeding to Locarno's Lake, <br/>
Fit resting-place for such a visitant.<br/>
Locarno! spreading out in width like Heaven,<br/>
How dost thou cleave to the poetic heart,<br/>
Bask in the sunshine of the memory;<br/>
And Como! thou, a treasure whom the earth<br/>
Keeps to herself, confined as in a depth<br/>
Of Abyssinian privacy. I spake<br/>
Of thee, thy chestnut woods, and garden plots<br/>
Of Indian corn tended by dark-eyed maids;<br/>
Thy lofty steeps, and pathways roofed with vines,<br/>
Winding from house to house, from town to town,<br/>
Sole link that binds them to each other; walks,<br/>
League after league, and cloistral avenues,<br/>
Where silence dwells if music be not there:<br/>
While yet a youth undisciplined in verse,<br/>
Through fond ambition of that hour I strove<br/>
To chant your praise; nor can approach you now<br/>
Ungreeted by a more melodious Song,<br/>
Where tones of Nature smoothed by learned Art<br/>
May flow in lasting current. Like a breeze<br/>
Or sunbeam over your domain I passed<br/>
In motion without pause; but ye have left<br/>
Your beauty with me, a serene accord<br/>
Of forms and colours, passive, yet endowed<br/>
In their submissiveness with power as sweet<br/>
And gracious, almost might I dare to say,<br/>
As virtue is, or goodness; sweet as love,<br/>
Or the remembrance of a generous deed,<br/>
Or mildest visitations of pure thought,<br/>
When God, the giver of all joy, is thanked<br/>
Religiously, in silent blessedness;<br/>
Sweet as this last herself, for such it is.
</p>
<p>
With those delightful pathways we advanced,<br/>
For two days' space, in presence of the Lake,<br/>
That, stretching far among the Alps, assumed<br/>
A character more stern. The second night,<br/>
From sleep awakened, and misled by sound<br/>
Of the church clock telling the hours with strokes<br/>
Whose import then we had not learned, we rose<br/>
By moonlight, doubting not that day was nigh,<br/>
And that meanwhile, by no uncertain path,<br/>
Along the winding margin of the lake,<br/>
Led, as before, we should behold the scene<br/>
Hushed in profound repose. We left the town<br/>
Of Gravedona with this hope; but soon<br/>
Were lost, bewildered among woods immense,<br/>
And on a rock sate down, to wait for day.<br/>
An open place it was, and overlooked,<br/>
From high, the sullen water far beneath,<br/>
On which a dull red image of the moon<br/>
Lay bedded, changing oftentimes its form<br/>
Like an uneasy snake. From hour to hour<br/>
We sate and sate, wondering, as if the night<br/>
Had been ensnared by witchcraft. On the rock<br/>
At last we stretched our weary limbs for sleep,<br/>
But <em>could not</em> sleep, tormented by the stings<br/>
Of insects, which, with noise like that of noon,<br/>
Filled all the woods; the cry of unknown birds;<br/>
The mountains more by blackness visible<br/>
And their own size, than any outward light;<br/>
The breathless wilderness of clouds; the clock<br/>
That told, with unintelligible voice,<br/>
The widely parted hours; the noise of streams,<br/>
And sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand,<br/>
That did not leave us free from personal fear;<br/>
And, lastly, the withdrawing moon, that set<br/>
Before us, while she still was high in heaven;&mdash;<br/>
These were our food; and such a summer's night <br/>
Followed that pair of golden days that shed<br/>
On Como's Lake, and all that round it lay,<br/>
Their fairest, softest, happiest influence.
</p>
<p>
But here I must break off, and bid farewell<br/>
To days, each offering some new sight, or fraught<br/>
With some untried adventure, in a course<br/>
Prolonged till sprinklings of autumnal snow<br/>
Checked our unwearied steps. Let this alone<br/>
Be mentioned as a parting word, that not<br/>
In hollow exultation, dealing out<br/>
Hyperboles of praise comparative;<br/>
Not rich one moment to be poor for ever;<br/>
Not prostrate, overborne, as if the mind<br/>
Herself were nothing, a mere pensioner<br/>
On outward forms&mdash;did we in presence stand<br/>
Of that magnificent region. On the front<br/>
Of this whole Song is written that my heart<br/>
Must, in such Temple, needs have offered up<br/>
A different worship. Finally, whate'er<br/>
I saw, or heard, or felt, was but a stream<br/>
That flowed into a kindred stream; a gale,<br/>
Confederate with the current of the soul,<br/>
To speed my voyage; every sound or sight,<br/>
In its degree of power, administered<br/>
To grandeur or to tenderness,&mdash;to the one<br/>
Directly, but to tender thoughts by means<br/>
Less often instantaneous in effect;<br/>
Led me to these by paths that, in the main,<br/>
Were more circuitous, but not less sure<br/>
Duly to reach the point marked out by Heaven.
</p>
<p>
Oh, most belovèd Friend! a glorious time,<br/>
A happy time that was; triumphant looks<br/>
Were then the common language of all eyes;<br/>
As if awaked from sleep, the Nations hailed<br/>
Their great expectancy: the fife of war<br/>
Was then a spirit-stirring sound indeed,<br/>
A black-bird's whistle in a budding grove.<br/>
We left the Swiss exulting in the fate<br/>
Of their near neighbours; and, when shortening fast<br/>
Our pilgrimage, nor distant far from home,<br/>
We crossed the Brabant armies on the fret <br/>
For battle in the cause of Liberty.<br/>
A stripling, scarcely of the household then<br/>
Of social life, I looked upon these things<br/>
As from a distance; heard, and saw, and felt,<br/>
Was touched, but with no intimate concern;<br/>
I seemed to move along them, as a bird<br/>
Moves through the air, or as a fish pursues<br/>
Its sport, or feeds in its proper element;<br/>
I wanted not that joy, I did not need<br/>
Such help; the ever-living universe,<br/>
Turn where I might, was opening out its glories,<br/>
And the independent spirit of pure youth<br/>
Called forth, at every season, new delights<br/>
Spread round my steps like sunshine o'er green fields.

<h1>To a Butterfly</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth (1802)</h2>
<p>
I've watch'd you now a full half-hour,<br/>
Self-poised upon that yellow flower;<br/>
And, little Butterfly! indeed<br/>
I know not if you sleep or feed.<br/>
How motionless!&mdash;not frozen seas<br/>
More motionless! and then<br/>
What joy awaits you, when the breeze<br/>
Hath found you out among the trees,<br/>
And calls you forth again!
</p>
<p>
This plot of orchard-ground is ours;<br/>
My trees they are, my Sister's flowers;<br/>
Here rest your wings when they are weary;<br/>
Here lodge as in a sanctuary!<br/>
Come often to us, fear no wrong;<br/>
Sit near us on the bough!<br/>
We'll talk of sunshine and of song,<br/>
And summer days, when we were young;<br/>
Sweet childish days, that were as long<br/>
As twenty days are now.

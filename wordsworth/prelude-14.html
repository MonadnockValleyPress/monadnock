<h1>The Prelude</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<h2>Book Fourteenth</h2>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
In one of those excursions (may they ne'er<br/>
Fade from remembrance!) through the Northern tracts<br/>
Of Cambria ranging with a youthful friend,<br/>
I left Bethgelert's huts at couching-time,<br/>
And westward took my way, to see the sun<br/>
Rise from the top of Snowdon. To the door<br/>
Of a rude cottage at the mountain's base<br/>
We came, and roused the shepherd who attends<br/>
The adventurous stranger's steps, a trusty guide;<br/>
Then, cheered by short refreshment, sallied forth.
</p>
<p>
It was a close, warm, breezeless summer night,<br/>
Wan, dull, and glaring, with a dripping fog<br/>
Low-hung and thick that covered all the sky;<br/>
But, undiscouraged, we began to climb<br/>
The mountain-side. The mist soon girt us round,<br/>
And, after ordinary travellers' talk<br/>
With our conductor, pensively we sank<br/>
Each into commerce with his private thoughts:<br/>
Thus did we breast the ascent, and by myself<br/>
Was nothing either seen or heard that checked<br/>
Those musings or diverted, save that once<br/>
The shepherd's lurcher, who, among the crags,<br/>
Had to his joy unearthed a hedgehog, teased<br/>
His coiled-up prey with barkings turbulent.<br/>
This small adventure, for even such it seemed<br/>
In that wild place and at the dead of night,<br/>
Being over and forgotten, on we wound<br/>
In silence as before. With forehead bent<br/>
Earthward, as if in opposition set<br/>
Against an enemy, I panted up<br/>
With eager pace, and no less eager thoughts.<br/>
Thus might we wear a midnight hour away,<br/>
Ascending at loose distance each from each,<br/>
And I, as chanced, the foremost of the band;<br/>
When at my feet the ground appeared to brighten,<br/>
And with a step or two seemed brighter still;<br/>
Nor was time given to ask or learn the cause,<br/>
For instantly a light upon the turf<br/>
Fell like a flash, and lo! as I looked up,<br/>
The Moon hung naked in a firmament<br/>
Of azure without cloud, and at my feet<br/>
Rested a silent sea of hoary mist.<br/>
A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved<br/>
All over this still ocean; and beyond,<br/>
Far, far beyond, the solid vapours stretched,<br/>
In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes,<br/>
Into the main Atlantic, that appeared<br/>
To dwindle, and give up his majesty,<br/>
Usurped upon far as the sight could reach.<br/>
Not so the ethereal vault; encroachment none<br/>
Was there, nor loss; only the inferior stars<br/>
Had disappeared, or shed a fainter light<br/>
In the clear presence of the full-orbed Moon,<br/>
Who, from her sovereign elevation, gazed<br/>
Upon the billowy ocean, as it lay<br/>
All meek and silent, save that through a rift&mdash;<br/>
Not distant from the shore whereon we stood,<br/>
A fixed, abysmal, gloomy, breathing-place&mdash;<br/>
Mounted the roar of waters, torrents, streams<br/>
Innumerable, roaring with one voice!<br/>
Heard over earth and sea, and, in that hour,<br/>
For so it seemed, felt by the starry heavens.
</p>
<p>
When into air had partially dissolved<br/>
That vision, given to spirits of the night<br/>
And three chance human wanderers, in calm thought<br/>
Reflected, it appeared to me the type<br/>
Of a majestic intellect, its acts<br/>
And its possessions, what it has and craves,<br/>
What in itself it is, and would become.<br/>
There I beheld the emblem of a mind<br/>
That feeds upon infinity, that broods<br/>
Over the dark abyss, intent to hear<br/>
Its voices issuing forth to silent light<br/>
In one continuous stream; a mind sustained<br/>
By recognitions of transcendent power,<br/>
In sense conducting to ideal form,<br/>
In soul of more than mortal privilege.<br/>
One function, above all, of such a mind<br/>
Had Nature shadowed there, by putting forth,<br/>
'Mid circumstances awful and sublime,<br/>
That mutual domination which she loves<br/>
To exert upon the face of outward things,<br/>
So moulded, joined, abstracted, so endowed<br/>
With interchangeable supremacy,<br/>
That men, least sensitive, see, hear, perceive,<br/>
And cannot choose but feel. The power, which all<br/>
Acknowledge when thus moved, which Nature thus<br/>
To bodily sense exhibits, is the express<br/>
Resemblance of that glorious faculty<br/>
That higher minds bear with them as their own.<br/>
This is the very spirit in which they deal<br/>
With the whole compass of the universe:<br/>
They from their native selves can send abroad<br/>
Kindred mutations; for themselves create<br/>
A like existence; and, whene'er it dawns<br/>
Created for them, catch it, or are caught<br/>
By its inevitable mastery,<br/>
Like angels stopped upon the wind by sound<br/>
Of harmony from Heaven's remotest spheres.<br/>
Them the enduring and the transient both<br/>
Serve to exalt; they build up greatest things<br/>
From least suggestions; ever on the watch,<br/>
Willing to work and to be wrought upon,<br/>
They need not extraordinary calls<br/>
To rouse them; in a world of life they live,<br/>
By sensible impressions not enthralled,<br/>
But by their quickening impulse made more prompt<br/>
To hold fit converse with the spiritual world,<br/>
And with the generations of mankind<br/>
Spread over time, past, present, and to come,<br/>
Age after age, till Time shall be no more.<br/>
Such minds are truly from the Deity,<br/>
For they are Powers; and hence the highest bliss<br/>
That flesh can know is theirs&mdash;the consciousness<br/>
Of Whom they are, habitually infused<br/>
Through every image and through every thought,<br/>
And all affections by communion raised<br/>
From earth to heaven, from human to divine;<br/>
Hence endless occupation for the Soul,<br/>
Whether discursive or intuitive;<br/>
Hence cheerfulness for acts of daily life,<br/>
Emotions which best foresight need not fear,<br/>
Most worthy then of trust when most intense<br/>
Hence, amid ills that vex and wrongs that crush<br/>
Our hearts&mdash;if here the words of Holy Writ<br/>
May with fit reverence be applied&mdash;that peace<br/>
Which passeth understanding, that repose<br/>
In moral judgments which from this pure source<br/>
Must come, or will by man be sought in vain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh! who is he that hath his whole life long<br/>
Preserved, enlarged, this freedom in himself?<br/>
For this alone is genuine liberty:<br/>
Where is the favoured being who hath held<br/>
That course unchecked, unerring, and untired,<br/>
In one perpetual progress smooth and bright?&mdash;<br/>
A humbler destiny have we retraced,<br/>
And told of lapse and hesitating choice,<br/>
And backward wanderings along thorny ways:<br/>
Yet&mdash;compassed round by mountain solitudes,<br/>
Within whose solemn temple I received<br/>
My earliest visitations, careless then<br/>
Of what was given me; and which now I range,<br/>
A meditative, oft a suffering man&mdash;<br/>
Do I declare&mdash;in accents which, from truth<br/>
Deriving cheerful confidence, shall blend<br/>
Their modulation with these vocal streams&mdash;<br/>
That, whatsoever falls my better mind,<br/>
Revolving with the accidents of life,<br/>
May have sustained, that, howsoe'er misled,<br/>
Never did I, in quest of right and wrong,<br/>
Tamper with conscience from a private aim;<br/>
Nor was in any public hope the dupe<br/>
Of selfish passions; nor did ever yield<br/>
Wilfully to mean cares or low pursuits,<br/>
But shrunk with apprehensive jealousy<br/>
From every combination which might aid<br/>
The tendency, too potent in itself,<br/>
Of use and custom to bow down the soul<br/>
Under a growing weight of vulgar sense,<br/>
And substitute a universe of death<br/>
For that which moves with light and life informed,<br/>
Actual, divine, and true. To fear and love,<br/>
To love as prime and chief, for there fear ends,<br/>
Be this ascribed; to early intercourse,<br/>
In presence of sublime or beautiful forms,<br/>
With the adverse principles of pain and joy&mdash;<br/>
Evil, as one is rashly named by men<br/>
Who know not what they speak. By love subsists<br/>
All lasting grandeur, by pervading love;<br/>
That gone, we are as dust.&mdash;Behold the fields<br/>
In balmy spring-time full of rising flowers<br/>
And joyous creatures; see that pair, the lamb<br/>
And the lamb's mother, and their tender ways<br/>
Shall touch thee to the heart; thou callest this love,<br/>
And not inaptly so, for love it is,<br/>
Far as it carries thee. In some green bower<br/>
Rest, and be not alone, but have thou there<br/>
The One who is thy choice of all the world:<br/>
There linger, listening, gazing, with delight<br/>
Impassioned, but delight how pitiable!<br/>
Unless this love by a still higher love<br/>
Be hallowed, love that breathes not without awe;<br/>
Love that adores, but on the knees of prayer,<br/>
By heaven inspired; that frees from chains the soul,<br/>
Lifted, in union with the purest, best,<br/>
Of earth-born passions, on the wings of praise<br/>
Bearing a tribute to the Almighty's Throne.
</p>
<p>
This spiritual Love acts not nor can exist<br/>
Without Imagination, which, in truth,<br/>
Is but another name for absolute power<br/>
And clearest insight, amplitude of mind,<br/>
And Reason in her most exalted mood.<br/>
This faculty hath been the feeding source<br/>
Of our long labour: we have traced the stream<br/>
From the blind cavern whence is faintly heard<br/>
Its natal murmur; followed it to light<br/>
And open day; accompanied its course<br/>
Among the ways of Nature, for a time<br/>
Lost sight of it bewildered and engulphed:<br/>
Then given it greeting as it rose once more<br/>
In strength, reflecting from its placid breast<br/>
The works of man and face of human life;<br/>
And lastly, from its progress have we drawn<br/>
Faith in life endless, the sustaining thought<br/>
Of human Being, Eternity, and God.
</p>
<p>
Imagination having been our theme,<br/>
So also hath that intellectual Love,<br/>
For they are each in each, and cannot stand<br/>
Dividually.&mdash;Here must thou be, O Man!<br/>
Power to thyself; no Helper hast thou here;<br/>
Here keepest thou in singleness thy state:<br/>
No other can divide with thee this work:<br/>
No secondary hand can intervene<br/>
To fashion this ability; 'tis thine,<br/>
The prime and vital principle is thine<br/>
In the recesses of thy nature, far<br/>
From any reach of outward fellowship,<br/>
Else is not thine at all. But joy to him,<br/>
Oh, joy to him who here hath sown, hath laid<br/>
Here, the foundation of his future years!<br/>
For all that friendship, all that love can do,<br/>
All that a darling countenance can look<br/>
Or dear voice utter, to complete the man,<br/>
Perfect him, made imperfect in himself,<br/>
All shall be his: and he whose soul hath risen<br/>
Up to the height of feeling intellect<br/>
Shall want no humbler tenderness; his heart<br/>
Be tender as a nursing mother's heart;<br/>
Of female softness shall his life be full,<br/>
Of humble cares and delicate desires,<br/>
Mild interests and gentlest sympathies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Child of my parents! Sister of my soul!<br/>
Thanks in sincerest verse have been elsewhere<br/>
Poured out for all the early tenderness<br/>
Which I from thee imbibed: and 'tis most true<br/>
That later seasons owed to thee no less;<br/>
For, spite of thy sweet influence and the touch<br/>
Of kindred hands that opened out the springs<br/>
Of genial thought in childhood, and in spite<br/>
Of all that unassisted I had marked<br/>
In life or nature of those charms minute<br/>
That win their way into the heart by stealth<br/>
(Still to the very going-out of youth),<br/>
I too exclusively esteemed <em>that</em> love,<br/>
And sought <em>that</em> beauty, which, as Milton sings,<br/>
Hath terror in it. Thou didst soften down<br/>
This over-sternness; but for thee, dear Friend!<br/>
My soul, too reckless of mild grace, had stood<br/>
In her original self too confident,<br/>
Retained too long a countenance severe;<br/>
A rock with torrents roaring, with the clouds<br/>
Familiar, and a favourite of the stars:<br/>
But thou didst plant its crevices with flowers,<br/>
Hang it with shrubs that twinkle in the breeze,<br/>
And teach the little birds to build their nests<br/>
And warble in its chambers. At a time<br/>
When Nature, destined to remain so long<br/>
Foremost in my affections, had fallen back<br/>
Into a second place, pleased to become<br/>
A handmaid to a nobler than herself,<br/>
When every day brought with it some new sense<br/>
Of exquisite regard for common things,<br/>
And all the earth was budding with these gifts<br/>
Of more refined humanity, thy breath,<br/>
Dear Sister! was a kind of gentler spring<br/>
That went before my steps. Thereafter came<br/>
One whom with thee friendship had early paired;<br/>
She came, no more a phantom to adorn<br/>
A moment, but an inmate of the heart,<br/>
And yet a spirit, there for me enshrined<br/>
To penetrate the lofty and the low;<br/>
Even as one essence of pervading light<br/>
Shines, in the brightest of ten thousand stars,<br/>
And the meek worm that feeds her lonely lamp<br/>
Couched in the dewy grass.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a theme,<br/>
Coleridge! with this my argument, of thee<br/>
Shall I be silent? O capacious Soul!<br/>
Placed on this earth to love and understand,<br/>
And from thy presence shed the light of love,<br/>
Shall I be mute, ere thou be spoken of?<br/>
Thy kindred influence to my heart of hearts<br/>
Did also find its way. Thus fear relaxed<br/>
Her over-weening grasp; thus thoughts and things<br/>
In the self-haunting spirit learned to take<br/>
More rational proportions; mystery,<br/>
The incumbent mystery of sense and soul,<br/>
Of life and death, time and eternity,<br/>
Admitted more habitually a mild<br/>
Interposition&mdash;a serene delight<br/>
In closelier gathering cares, such as become<br/>
A human creature, howsoe'er endowed,<br/>
Poet, or destined for a humbler name;<br/>
And so the deep enthusiastic joy,<br/>
The rapture of the hallelujah sent<br/>
From all that breathes and is, was chastened, stemmed<br/>
And balanced by pathetic truth, by trust<br/>
In hopeful reason, leaning on the stay<br/>
Of Providence; and in reverence for duty,<br/>
Here, if need be, struggling with storms, and there<br/>
Strewing in peace life's humblest ground with herbs,<br/>
At every season green, sweet at all hours.
</p>
<p>
And now, O Friend! this history is brought<br/>
To its appointed close: the discipline<br/>
And consummation of a Poet's mind,<br/>
In everything that stood most prominent,<br/>
Have faithfully been pictured; we have reached<br/>
The time (our guiding object from the first)<br/>
When we may, not presumptuously, I hope,<br/>
Suppose my powers so far confirmed, and such<br/>
My knowledge, as to make me capable<br/>
Of building up a Work that shall endure.<br/>
Yet much hath been omitted, as need was;<br/>
Of books how much! and even of the other wealth<br/>
That is collected among woods and fields,<br/>
Far more: for Nature's secondary grace<br/>
Hath hitherto been barely touched upon,<br/>
The charm more superficial that attends<br/>
Her works, as they present to Fancy's choice<br/>
Apt illustrations of the moral world,<br/>
Caught at a glance, or traced with curious pains.
</p>
<p>
Finally, and above all, O Friend! (I speak<br/>
With due regret) how much is overlooked<br/>
In human nature and her subtle ways,<br/>
As studied first in our own hearts, and then<br/>
In life among the passions of mankind,<br/>
Varying their composition and their hue,<br/>
Where'er we move, under the diverse shapes<br/>
That individual character presents<br/>
To an attentive eye. For progress meet,<br/>
Along this intricate and difficult path,<br/>
Whate'er was wanting, something had I gained,<br/>
As one of many schoolfellows compelled,<br/>
In hardy independence, to stand up<br/>
Amid conflicting interests, and the shock<br/>
Of various tempers; to endure and note<br/>
What was not understood, though known to be;<br/>
Among the mysteries of love and hate,<br/>
Honour and shame, looking to right and left,<br/>
Unchecked by innocence too delicate,<br/>
And moral notions too intolerant,<br/>
Sympathies too contracted. Hence, when called<br/>
To take a station among men, the step<br/>
Was easier, the transition more secure,<br/>
More profitable also; for, the mind<br/>
Learns from such timely exercise to keep<br/>
In wholesome separation the two natures,<br/>
The one that feels, the other that observes.
</p>
<p>
Yet one word more of personal concern&mdash;<br/>
Since I withdrew unwillingly from France,<br/>
I led an undomestic wanderer's life,<br/>
In London chiefly harboured, whence I roamed,<br/>
Tarrying at will in many a pleasant spot<br/>
Of rural England's cultivated vales<br/>
Or Cambrian solitudes. A youth&mdash;(he bore<br/>
The name of Calvert&mdash;it shall live, if words<br/>
Of mine can give it life,) in firm belief<br/>
That by endowments not from me withheld<br/>
Good might be furthered&mdash;in his last decay<br/>
By a bequest sufficient for my needs<br/>
Enabled me to pause for choice, and walk<br/>
At large and unrestrained, nor damped too soon<br/>
By mortal cares. Himself no Poet, yet<br/>
Far less a common follower of the world,<br/>
He deemed that my pursuits and labours lay<br/>
Apart from all that leads to wealth, or even<br/>
A necessary maintenance insures,<br/>
Without some hazard to the finer sense;<br/>
He cleared a passage for me, and the stream<br/>
Flowed in the bent of Nature.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having now<br/>
Told what best merits mention, further pains<br/>
Our present purpose seems not to require,<br/>
And I have other tasks. Recall to mind<br/>
The mood in which this labour was begun,<br/>
O Friend! The termination of my course<br/>
Is nearer now, much nearer; yet even then,<br/>
In that distraction and intense desire,<br/>
I said unto the life which I had lived,<br/>
Where art thou? Hear I not a voice from thee<br/>
Which 'tis reproach to hear? Anon I rose<br/>
As if on wings, and saw beneath me stretched<br/>
Vast prospect of the world which I had been<br/>
And was; and hence this Song, which like a lark<br/>
I have protracted, in the unwearied heavens<br/>
Singing, and often with more plaintive voice<br/>
To earth attempered and her deep-drawn sighs,<br/>
Yet centring all in love, and in the end<br/>
All gratulant, if rightly understood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Whether to me shall be allotted life,<br/>
And, with life, power to accomplish aught of worth,<br/>
That will be deemed no insufficient plea<br/>
For having given the story of myself,<br/>
Is all uncertain: but, beloved Friend!<br/>
When, looking back, thou seest, in clearer view<br/>
Than any liveliest sight of yesterday,<br/>
That summer, under whose indulgent skies,<br/>
Upon smooth Quantock's airy ridge we roved<br/>
Unchecked, or loitered 'mid her sylvan combs,<br/>
Thou in bewitching words, with happy heart,<br/>
Didst chaunt the vision of that Ancient Man,<br/>
The bright-eyed Mariner, and rueful woes<br/>
Didst utter of the Lady Christabel;<br/>
And I, associate with such labour, steeped<br/>
In soft forgetfulness the livelong hours,<br/>
Murmuring of him who, joyous hap, was found,<br/>
After the perils of his moonlight ride,<br/>
Near the loud waterfall; or her who sate<br/>
In misery near the miserable Thorn;<br/>
When thou dost to that summer turn thy thoughts,<br/>
And hast before thee all which then we were,<br/>
To thee, in memory of that happiness,<br/>
It will be known, by thee at least, my Friend!<br/>
Felt, that the history of a Poet's mind<br/>
Is labour not unworthy of regard:<br/>
To thee the work shall justify itself.
</p>
<p>
The last and later portions of this gift<br/>
Have been prepared, not with the buoyant spirits<br/>
That were our daily portion when we first<br/>
Together wantoned in wild Poesy,<br/>
But, under pressure of a private grief,<br/>
Keen and enduring, which the mind and heart,<br/>
That in this meditative history<br/>
Have been laid open, needs must make me feel<br/>
More deeply, yet enable me to bear<br/>
More firmly; and a comfort now hath risen<br/>
From hope that thou art near, and wilt be soon<br/>
Restored to us in renovated health;<br/>
When, after the first mingling of our tears,<br/>
'Mong other consolations, we may draw<br/>
Some pleasure from this offering of my love.
</p>
<p>
Oh! yet a few short years of useful life,<br/>
And all will be complete, thy race be run,<br/>
Thy monument of glory will be raised;<br/>
Then, though (too weak to tread the ways of truth)<br/>
This age fall back to old idolatry,<br/>
Though men return to servitude as fast<br/>
As the tide ebbs, to ignominy and shame<br/>
By nations sink together, we shall still<br/>
Find solace&mdash;knowing what we have learnt to know,<br/>
Rich in true happiness if allowed to be<br/>
Faithful alike in forwarding a day<br/>
Of firmer trust, joint labourers in the work<br/>
(Should Providence such grace to us vouchsafe)<br/>
Of their deliverance, surely yet to come.<br/>
Prophets of Nature, we to them will speak<br/>
A lasting inspiration, sanctified<br/>
By reason, blest by faith: what we have loved,<br/>
Others will love, and we will teach them how;<br/>
Instruct them how the mind of man becomes<br/>
A thousand times more beautiful than the earth<br/>
On which he dwells, above this frame of things<br/>
(Which, 'mid all revolution in the hopes<br/>
And fears of men, doth still remain unchanged)<br/>
In beauty exalted, as it is itself<br/>
Of quality and fabric more divine.

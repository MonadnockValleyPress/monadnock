<h1>Character of the Happy Warrior</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
Who is the happy Warrior? Who is he<br/>
That every man in arms should wish to be?<br/>
&mdash;It is the generous Spirit, who, when brought<br/>
Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought<br/>
Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought:<br/>
Whose high endeavours are an inward light<br/>
That makes the path before him always bright;<br/>
Who, with a natural instinct to discern<br/>
What knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn;<br/>
Abides by this resolve, and stops not there,<br/>
But makes his moral being his prime care;<br/>
Who, doomed to go in company with Pain,<br/>
And Fear, and Bloodshed, miserable train!<br/>
Turns his necessity to glorious gain;<br/>
In face of these doth exercise a power<br/>
Which is our human nature's highest dower:<br/>
Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves<br/>
Of their bad influence, and their good receives:<br/>
By objects, which might force the soul to abate<br/>
Her feeling, rendered more compassionate;<br/>
Is placable&mdash;because occasions rise<br/>
So often that demand such sacrifice;<br/>
More skilful in self-knowledge, even more pure,<br/>
As tempted more; more able to endure,<br/>
As more exposed to suffering and distress;<br/>
Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.<br/>
&mdash;Tis he whose law is reason; who depends<br/>
Upon that law as on the best of friends;<br/>
Whence, in a state where men are tempted still<br/>
To evil for a guard against worse ill,<br/>
And what in quality or act is best<br/>
Doth seldom on a right foundation rest,<br/>
He labours good on good to fix, and owes<br/>
To virtue every triumph that he knows:<br/>
&mdash;Who, if he rise to station of command,<br/>
Rises by open means; and there will stand<br/>
On honourable terms, or else retire,<br/>
And in himself possess his own desire;<br/>
Who comprehends his trust, and to the same<br/>
Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim;<br/>
And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait<br/>
For wealth, or honours, or for worldly state;<br/>
Whom they must follow; on whose head must fall,<br/>
Like showers of manna, if they come at all:<br/>
Whose powers shed round him in the common strife,<br/>
Or mild concerns of ordinary life,<br/>
A constant influence, a peculiar grace;<br/>
But who, if he be called upon to face<br/>
Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined<br/>
Great issues, good or bad for human kind,<br/>
Is happy as a Lover; and attired<br/>
With sudden brightness, like a Man inspired;<br/>
And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law<br/>
In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw;<br/>
Or if an unexpected call succeed,<br/>
Come when it will, is equal to the need:<br/>
&mdash;He who, though thus endued as with a sense<br/>
And faculty for storm and turbulence,<br/>
Is yet a Soul whose master-bias leans<br/>
To homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes;<br/>
Sweet images! which, wheresoe'er he be,<br/>
Are at his heart; and such fidelity<br/>
It is his darling passion to approve;<br/>
More brave for this, that he hath much to love:&mdash;<br/>
'Tis, finally, the Man, who, lifted high,<br/>
Conspicuous object in a Nation's eye,<br/>
Or left unthought-of in obscurity,&mdash;<br/>
Who, with a toward or untoward lot,<br/>
Prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not&mdash;<br/>
Plays, in the many games of life, that one<br/>
Where what he most doth value must be won:<br/>
Whom neither shape or danger can dismay,<br/>
Nor thought of tender happiness betray;<br/>
Who, not content that former worth stand fast,<br/>
Looks forward, persevering to the last,<br/>
From well to better, daily self-surpast:<br/>
Who, whether praise of him must walk the earth<br/>
For ever, and to noble deeds give birth,<br/>
Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,<br/>
And leave a dead unprofitable name&mdash;<br/>
Finds comfort in himself and in his cause;<br/>
And, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws<br/>
His breath in confidence of Heaven's applause:<br/>
This is the happy Warrior; this is he<br/>
That every man in arms should wish to be.

<h1>England and Switzerland</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth</h2>
<p>
Two Voices are there; one is of the Sea,<br/>
One of the Mountains; each a mighty voice:<br/>
In both from age to age thou didst rejoice,<br/>
They were thy chosen music, Liberty!<br/>
</p>
<p>There came a tyrant, and with holy glee<br/>
Thou fought'st against him,&mdash;but hast vainly striven:<br/>
Thou from thy Alpine holds at length are driven<br/>
Where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee.<br/>
</p>
<p>&mdash;Of one deep bliss thine ear hath been bereft;<br/>
Then cleave, O cleave to that which still is left&mdash;<br/>
For, high-soul'd Maid, what sorrow would it be<br/>
</p>
<p>That Mountain floods should thunder as before,<br/>
And Ocean bellow from his rocky shore,<br/>
And neither awful Voice be heard by Thee!<br/>
</p>

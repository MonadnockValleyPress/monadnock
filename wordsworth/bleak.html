<h1>Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak</h1>
<h2>by William Wordsworth (1800)</h2>
<p>
Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak,<br/>
When hitherward we journeyed, side by side,<br/>
Through burst of sunshine and through flying showers,<br/>
Paced the long vales, how long they were, and yet<br/>
How fast that length of way was left behind,<br/>
Wensley's rich vale and Sedbergh's naked heights.<br/><br/>
The frosty wind, as if to make amends<br/>
For its keen breath, was aiding to our steps,<br/>
And drove us onward like two ships at sea;<br/>
Or, like two birds, companions in mid-air,<br/>
Parted and reunited by the blast.<br/>
Stern was the face of nature; we rejoiced<br/>
In that stern countenance; for our souls thence drew<br/>
A feeling of their strength. The naked trees,<br/>
The icy brooks, as on we passed, appeared<br/>
To question us, "Whence come ye? To what end?"<br/>

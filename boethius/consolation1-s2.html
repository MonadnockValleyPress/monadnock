<h1>The Consolation of Philosophy</h1>
<h2>by Boethius</h2>
<h3>Book I, Chapter II.</h2>
<h3>Song II. His Despondency.</h3>
<p>
Alas! in what abyss his mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is plunged, how wildly tossed!<br/>
Still, still towards the outer night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She sinks, her true light lost,<br/>
As oft as, lashed tumultuously<br/>
By earth-born blasts, care's waves rise high.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet once he ranged the open heavens,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun's bright pathway tracked;<br/>
Watched how the cold moon waxed and waned;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor rested, till there lacked<br/>
To his wide ken no star that steers<br/>
Amid the maze of circling spheres.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The causes why the blusterous winds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Vex ocean's tranquil face,<br/>
Whose hand doth turn the stable globe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or why his even race<br/>
From out the ruddy east the sun<br/>
Unto the western waves doth run:<br/>
</p>
<p>
What is it tempers cunningly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The placid hours of spring,<br/>
So that it blossoms with the rose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For earth's engarlanding:<br/>
Who loads the year's maturer prime<br/>
With clustered grapes in autumn time:<br/>
</p>
<p>
All this he knew &mdash; thus ever strove<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep Nature's lore to guess.<br/>
Now, reft of reason's light, he lies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bonds his neck oppress;<br/>
While by the heavy load constrained,<br/>
His eyes to this dull earth are chained.<br/>

<h1>The Consolation of Philosophy</h1>
<h2>by Boethius</h2>
<h3>Book IV, Chapter III.</h2>
<h3>Song III. Circe's Cup.</h3>
<p>
Th' Ithacan discreet,<br/>
And all his storm-tossed fleet,<br/>
Far o'er the ocean wave<br/>
The winds of heaven drave &mdash; <br/>
Drave to the mystic isle,<br/>
Where dwelleth in her guile<br/>
That fair and faithless one,<br/>
The daughter of the Sun.<br/>
There for the stranger crew<br/>
With cunning spells she knew<br/>
To mix th' enchanted cup.<br/>
For whoso drinks it up,<br/>
Must suffer hideous change<br/>
To monstrous shapes and strange.<br/>
One like a boar appears;<br/>
This his huge form uprears,<br/>
Mighty in bulk and limb &mdash; <br/>
An Afric lion &mdash; grim<br/>
With claw and fang. Confessed<br/>
A wolf, this, sore distressed<br/>
When he would weep, doth howl;<br/>
And, strangely tame, these prowl<br/>
The Indian tiger's mates.<br/>
</p><p>
And though in such sore straits,<br/>
The pity of the god<br/>
Who bears the mystic rod<br/>
Had power the chieftain brave<br/>
From her fell arts to save;<br/>
His comrades, unrestrained,<br/>
The fatal goblet drained.<br/>
All now with low-bent head,<br/>
Like swine, on acorns fed;<br/>
Man's speech and form were reft,<br/>
No human feature left;<br/>
But steadfast still, the mind,<br/>
Unaltered, unresigned,<br/>
The monstrous change bewailed.<br/>
</p><p>
How little, then, availed<br/>
The potencies of ill!<br/>
These herbs, this baneful skill,<br/>
May change each outward part,<br/>
But cannot touch the heart.<br/>
In its true home, deep-set,<br/>
Man's spirit liveth yet.<br/>
<em>Those</em> poisons are more fell,<br/>
More potent to expel<br/>
Man from his high estate,<br/>
Which subtly penetrate,<br/>
And leave the body whole,<br/>
But deep infect the soul.<br/>

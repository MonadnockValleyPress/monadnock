<h1>The Consolation of Philosophy</h1>
<h2>by Boethius</h2>
<h3>Book III.</h3>
<h3>Song XII. Orpheus and Eurydice.</h3>
<p>
Blest he whose feet have stood<br/>
Beside the fount of good;<br/>
Blest he whose will could break<br/>
Earth's chains for wisdom's sake!<br/>
</p><p>
The Thracian bard, 'tis said,<br/>
Mourned his dear consort dead;<br/>
To hear the plaintive strain<br/>
The woods moved in his train,<br/>
And the stream ceased to flow,<br/>
Held by so soft a woe;<br/>
The deer without dismay<br/>
Beside the lion lay;<br/>
The hound, by song subdued,<br/>
No more the hare pursued,<br/>
But the pang unassuaged<br/>
In his own bosom raged.<br/>
The music that could calm<br/>
All else brought him no balm.<br/>
Chiding the powers immortal,<br/>
He came unto Hell's portal;<br/>
There breathed all tender things<br/>
Upon his sounding strings,<br/>
Each rhapsody high-wrought<br/>
His goddess-mother taught &mdash; <br/>
All he from grief could borrow<br/>
And love redoubling sorrow,<br/>
Till, as the echoes waken,<br/>
All Tænarus is shaken;<br/>
Whilst he to ruth persuades<br/>
The monarch of the shades<br/>
With dulcet prayer. Spell-bound,<br/>
The triple-headed hound<br/>
At sounds so strangely sweet<br/>
Falls crouching at his feet.<br/>
The dread Avengers, too,<br/>
That guilty minds pursue<br/>
With ever-haunting fears,<br/>
Are all dissolved in tears.<br/>
Ixion, on his wheel,<br/>
A respite brief doth feel;<br/>
For, lo! the wheel stands still.<br/>
And, while those sad notes thrill,<br/>
Thirst-maddened Tantalus<br/>
Listens, oblivious<br/>
Of the stream's mockery<br/>
And his long agony.<br/>
The vulture, too, doth spare<br/>
Some little while to tear<br/>
At Tityus' rent side,<br/>
Sated and pacified.<br/>
</p><p>
At length the shadowy king,<br/>
His sorrows pitying,<br/>
'He hath prevailèd!' cried;<br/>
'We give him back his bride!<br/>
To him she shall belong,<br/>
As guerdon of his song.<br/>
One sole condition yet<br/>
Upon the boon is set:<br/>
Let him not turn his eyes<br/>
To view his hard-won prize,<br/>
Till they securely pass<br/>
The gates of Hell.' Alas!<br/>
What law can lovers move?<br/>
A higher law is love!<br/>
For Orpheus &mdash; woe is me! &mdash; <br/>
On his Eurydice &mdash; <br/>
Day's threshold all but won &mdash; <br/>
Looked, lost, and was undone!<br/>
</p><p>
Ye who the light pursue,<br/>
This story is for you,<br/>
Who seek to find a way<br/>
Unto the clearer day.<br/>
If on the darkness past<br/>
One backward look ye cast,<br/>
Your weak and wandering eyes<br/>
Have lost the matchless prize.<br/>

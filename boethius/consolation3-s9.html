<h1>The Consolation of Philosophy</h1>
<h2>by Boethius</h2>
<h3>Book III.</h3>
<h3>Song IX. Invocation.</h3>
<p>
Maker of earth and sky, from age to age<br/>
Who rul'st the world by reason; at whose word<br/>
Time issues from Eternity's abyss:<br/>
To all that moves the source of movement, fixed<br/>
Thyself and moveless. Thee no cause impelled<br/>
Extrinsic this proportioned frame to shape<br/>
From shapeless matter; but, deep-set within<br/>
Thy inmost being, the form of perfect good,<br/>
From envy free; and Thou didst mould the whole<br/>
To that supernal pattern. Beauteous<br/>
The world in Thee thus imaged, being Thyself<br/>
</p><p>
Most beautiful. So Thou the work didst fashion<br/>
In that fair likeness, bidding it put on<br/>
Perfection through the exquisite perfectness<br/>
Of every part's contrivance. Thou dost bind<br/>
The elements in balanced harmony,<br/>
So that the hot and cold, the moist and dry,<br/>
Contend not; nor the pure fire leaping up<br/>
Escape, or weight of waters whelm the earth.<br/>
</p><p>
Thou joinest and diffusest through the whole,<br/>
Linking accordantly its several parts,<br/>
A soul of threefold nature, moving all.<br/>
This, cleft in twain, and in two circles gathered,<br/>
Speeds in a path that on itself returns,<br/>
Encompassing mind's limits, and conforms<br/>
The heavens to her true semblance. Lesser souls<br/>
And lesser lives by a like ordinance<br/>
Thou sendest forth, each to its starry car<br/>
Affixing, and dost strew them far and wide<br/>
O'er earth and heaven. These by a law benign<br/>
Thou biddest turn again, and render back<br/>
To thee their fires. Oh, grant, almighty Father,<br/>
Grant us on reason's wing to soar aloft<br/>
To heaven's exalted height; grant us to see<br/>
The fount of good; grant us, the true light found,<br/>
To fix our steadfast eyes in vision clear<br/>
On Thee. Disperse the heavy mists of earth,<br/>
And shine in Thine own splendour. For Thou art<br/>
The true serenity and perfect rest<br/>
Of every pious soul &mdash; to see Thy face,<br/>
The end and the beginning &mdash; One the guide,<br/>
The traveller, the pathway, and the goal.<br/>

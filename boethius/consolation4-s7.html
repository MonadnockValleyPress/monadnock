<h1>The Consolation of Philosophy</h1>
<h2>by Boethius</h2>
<h3>Book IV.</h3>
<h3>Song VII. The Hero's Path.</h3>
<p>
Ten years a tedious warfare raged,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere Ilium's smoking ruins paid<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For wedlock stained and faith betrayed,<br/>
And great Atrides' wrath assuaged.<br/>
</p><p>
But when heaven's anger asked a life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And baffling winds his course withstood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The king put off his fatherhood,<br/>
And slew his child with priestly knife.<br/>
</p><p>
When by the cavern's glimmering light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His comrades dear Odysseus saw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the huge Cyclops' hideous maw<br/>
Engulfed, he wept the piteous sight.<br/>
</p><p>
But blinded soon, and wild with pain &mdash; <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In bitter tears and sore annoy &mdash; <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For that foul feast's unholy joy<br/>
Grim Polyphemus paid again.<br/>
</p><p>
His labours for Alcides win<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A name of glory far and wide;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He tamed the Centaur's haughty pride,<br/>
And from the lion reft his skin.<br/>
</p><p>
The foul birds with sure darts he slew;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden fruit he stole &mdash; in vain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's watch; with triple chain<br/>
From hell's depths Cerberus he drew.<br/>
</p><p>
With their fierce lord's own flesh he fed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild steeds; Hydra overcame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With fire. 'Neath his own waves in shame<br/>
Maimed Achelous hid his head.<br/>
</p><p>
Huge Cacus for his crimes was slain;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On Libya's sands Ant√¶us hurled;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoulders that upheld the world<br/>
The great boar's dribbled spume did stain.<br/>
</p><p>
Last toil of all &mdash; his might sustained<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ball of heaven, nor did he bend<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath; this toil, his labour's end,<br/>
The prize of heaven's high glory gained.<br/>
</p><p>
Brave hearts, press on! Lo, heavenward lead<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These bright examples! From the fight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn not your backs in coward flight;<br/>
Earth's conflict won, the stars your meed!<br/>

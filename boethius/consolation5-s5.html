<h1>The Consolation of Philosophy</h1>
<h2>by Boethius</h2>
<h3>Book V, Chapter V.</h2>
<h3>Song V. The Upward Look.</h3>
<p>
In what divers shapes and fashions do the creatures great and small<br/>
Over wide earth's teeming surface skim, or scud, or walk, or crawl!<br/>
Some with elongated body sweep the ground, and, as they move,<br/>
Trail perforce with writhing belly in the dust a sinuous groove;<br/>
Some, on light wing upward soaring, swiftly do the winds divide,<br/>
And through heaven's ample spaces in free motion smoothly glide;<br/>
These earth's solid surface pressing, with firm paces onward rove,<br/>
Ranging through the verdant meadows, crouching in the woodland grove.<br/>
Great and wondrous is their variance! Yet in all the head low-bent<br/>
Dulls the soul and blunts the senses, though their forms be different.<br/>
Man alone, erect, aspiring, lifts his forehead to the skies,<br/>
And in upright posture steadfast seems earth's baseness to despise.<br/>
If with earth not all besotted, to this parable give ear,<br/>
Thou whose gaze is fixed on heaven, who thy face on high dost rear:<br/>
Lift thy soul, too, heavenward; haply lest it stain its heavenly worth,<br/>
And thine eyes alone look upward, while thy mind cleaves to the earth!<br/>

<h1>The Consolation of Philosophy</h1>
<h2>by Boethius</h2>
<h3>Book IV, Chapter II.</h2>
<h3>Song II. The Bondage of Passion.</h3>
<p>
When high-enthroned the monarch sits, resplendent in the pride<br/>
Of purple robes, while flashing steel guards him on every side;<br/>
When baleful terrors on his brow with frowning menace lower,<br/>
And Passion shakes his labouring breast &mdash; how dreadful seems his power!<br/>
But if the vesture of his state from such a one thou tear,<br/>
Thou'lt see what load of secret bonds this lord of earth doth wear.<br/>
Lust's poison rankles; o'er his mind rage sweeps in tempest rude;<br/>
Sorrow his spirit vexes sore, and empty hopes delude.<br/>
Then thou'lt confess: one hapless wretch, whom many lords oppress,<br/>
Does never what he would, but lives in thraldom's helplessness.<br/>

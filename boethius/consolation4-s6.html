<h1>The Consolation of Philosophy</h1>
<h2>by Boethius</h2>
<h3>Book IV, Chapter VI.</h2>
<h3>Song VI. The Universal Aim.</h3>
<p>
Wouldst thou with unclouded mind<br/>
View the laws by God designed,<br/>
Lift thy steadfast gaze on high<br/>
To the starry canopy;<br/>
See in rightful league of love<br/>
All the constellations move.<br/>
Fiery Sol, in full career,<br/>
Ne'er obstructs cold Phoebe's sphere;<br/>
When the Bear, at heaven's height,<br/>
Wheels his coursers' rapid flight,<br/>
Though he sees the starry train<br/>
Sinking in the western main,<br/>
He repines not, nor desires<br/>
In the flood to quench his fires.<br/>
</p><p>
In true sequence, as decreed,<br/>
Daily morn and eve succeed;<br/>
Vesper brings the shades of night,<br/>
Lucifer the morning light.<br/>
Love, in alternation due,<br/>
Still the cycle doth renew,<br/>
And discordant strife is driven<br/>
From the starry realm of heaven.<br/>
Thus, in wondrous amity,<br/>
Warring elements agree;<br/>
Hot and cold, and moist and dry,<br/>
Lay their ancient quarrel by;<br/>
High the flickering flame ascends,<br/>
Downward earth for ever tends.<br/>
</p><p>
So the year in spring's mild hours<br/>
Loads the air with scent of flowers;<br/>
Summer paints the golden grain;<br/>
Then, when autumn comes again,<br/>
Bright with fruit the orchards glow;<br/>
Winter brings the rain and snow.<br/>
Thus the seasons' fixed progression,<br/>
Tempered in a due succession,<br/>
Nourishes and brings to birth<br/>
All that lives and breathes on earth.<br/>
Then, soon run life's little day,<br/>
All it brought it takes away.<br/>
</p><p>
But One sits and guides the reins,<br/>
He who made and all sustains;<br/>
King and Lord and Fountain-head,<br/>
Judge most holy, Law most dread;<br/>
Now impels and now keeps back,<br/>
Holds each waverer in the track.<br/>
Else, were once the power withheld<br/>
That the circling spheres compelled<br/>
In their orbits to revolve,<br/>
This world's order would dissolve,<br/>
And th' harmonious whole would all<br/>
In one hideous ruin fall.<br/>
</p><p>
But through this connected frame<br/>
Runs one universal aim;<br/>
Towards the Good do all things tend,<br/>
Many paths, but one the end.<br/>
For naught lasts, unless it turns<br/>
Backward in its course, and yearns<br/>
To that Source to flow again<br/>
Whence its being first was ta'en.<br/>

<h1>The Consolation of Philosophy</h1>
<h2>by Boethius</h2>
<h3>Book III.</h3>
<h3>Song II. The Bent of Nature.</h3>
<p>
How the might of Nature sways<br/>
All the world in ordered ways,<br/>
How resistless laws control<br/>
Each least portion of the whole &mdash; <br/>
Fain would I in sounding verse<br/>
On my pliant strings rehearse.<br/>
</p><p>
Lo, the lion captive ta'en<br/>
Meekly wears his gilded chain;<br/>
Yet though he by hand be fed,<br/>
Though a master's whip he dread,<br/>
If but once the taste of gore<br/>
Whet his cruel lips once more,<br/>
Straight his slumbering fierceness wakes,<br/>
With one roar his bonds he breaks,<br/>
And first wreaks his vengeful force<br/>
On his trainer's mangled corse.<br/>
</p><p>
And the woodland songster, pent<br/>
In forlorn imprisonment,<br/>
Though a mistress' lavish care<br/>
Store of honeyed sweets prepare;<br/>
Yet, if in his narrow cage,<br/>
As he hops from bar to bar,<br/>
He should spy the woods afar,<br/>
Cool with sheltering foliage,<br/>
All these dainties he will spurn,<br/>
To the woods his heart will turn;<br/>
Only for the woods he longs,<br/>
Pipes the woods in all his songs.<br/>
</p><p>
To rude force the sapling bends,<br/>
While the hand its pressure lends;<br/>
If the hand its pressure slack,<br/>
Straight the supple wood springs back.<br/>
Ph≈ìbus in the western main<br/>
Sinks; but swift his car again<br/>
By a secret path is borne<br/>
To the wonted gates of morn.<br/>
</p><p>
Thus are all things seen to yearn<br/>
In due time for due return;<br/>
And no order fixed may stay,<br/>
Save which in th' appointed way<br/>
Joins the end to the beginning<br/>
In a steady cycle spinning.<br/>

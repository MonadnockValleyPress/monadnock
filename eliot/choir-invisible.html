<h1>The Choir Invisible</h1>
<h2>by George Eliot</h2>
<p>
O May I join the choir invisible<br/>
Of those immortal dead who live again<br/>
In minds made better by their presence: live<br/>
In pulses stirr'd to generosity,<br/>
In deeds of daring rectitude, in scorn<br/>
For miserable aims that end with self,<br/>
In thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars,<br/>
And with their mild persistence urge man's search<br/>
To vaster issues.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to live is heaven:<br/>
To make undying music in the world,<br/>
Breathing as beauteous order that controls<br/>
With growing sway the growing life of man.<br/>
So we inherit that sweet purity<br/>
For which we struggled, fail'd, and agoniz'd<br/>
With widening retrospect that bred despair.<br/>
Rebellious flesh that would not be subdued,<br/>
A vicious parent shaming still its child,<br/>
Poor anxious penitence, is quick dissolv'd;<br/>
Its discords, quench'd by meeting harmonies,<br/>
Die in the large and charitable air.<br/>
And all our rarer, better, truer self,<br/>
That sobb'd religiously in yearning song,<br/>
That watch'd to ease the burthen of the world,<br/>
Laboriously tracing what must be,<br/>
And what may yet be better,&mdash;saw within<br/>
A worthier image for the sanctuary,<br/>
And shap'd it forth before the multitude,<br/>
Divinely human, raising worship so<br/>
To higher reverence more mix'd with love,&mdash;<br/>
That better self shall live till human Time<br/>
Shall fold its eyelids, and the human sky<br/>
Be gather'd like a scroll within the tomb <br/>
Unread forever.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is life to come,<br/>
Which martyr'd men have made more glorious<br/>
For us who strive to follow. May I reach<br/>
That purest heaven, be to other souls<br/>
The cup of strength in some great agony,<br/>
Enkindle generous ardor, feed pure love,<br/>
Beget the smiles that have no cruelty,<br/>
Be the sweet presence of a good diffus'd,<br/>
And in diffusion ever more intense!<br/>
So shall I join the choir invisible<br/>
Whose music is the gladness of the world.

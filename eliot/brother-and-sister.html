<h1>Brother and Sister</h1>
<h2>by George Eliot</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
I cannot choose but think upon the time<br/>
When our two lives grew like two buds that kiss<br/>
At lightest thrill from the bee's swinging chime,<br/>
Because the one so near the other is.<br/>
</p><p>
He was the elder and a little man<br/>
Of forty inches, bound to show no dread,<br/>
And I the girl that puppy-like now ran,<br/>
Now lagged behind my brother's larger tread.<br/>
</p><p>
I held him wise, and when he talked to me<br/>
Of snakes and birds, and which God loved the best,<br/>
I thought his knowledge marked the boundary<br/>
Where men grew blind, though angels knew the rest.<br/>
</p><p>
If he said Hush! I tried to hold my breath;<br/>
Wherever he said Come! I stepped in faith.<br/>
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
Long years have left their writing on my brow,<br/>
But yet the freshness and the dew-fed beam<br/>
Of those young mornings are about me now,<br/>
When we two wandered toward the far-off stream<br/>
</p><p>
With rod and line. Our basket held a store<br/>
Baked for us only, and I thought with joy<br/>
That I should have my share, though he had more,<br/>
Because he was the elder and a boy.<br/>
</p><p>
The firmaments of daisies since to me<br/>
Have had those mornings in their opening eyes,<br/>
The bunchèd cowslip's pale transparency<br/>
Carries that sunshine of sweet memories,<br/>
</p><p>
And wild-rose branches take their finest scent<br/>
From those blest hours of infantine content.<br/>
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
Our mother bade us keep the trodden ways,<br/>
Stroked down my tippet, set my brother's frill,<br/>
Then with the benediction of her gaze<br/>
Clung to us lessening, and pursued us still<br/>
</p><p>
Across the homestead to the rookery elms,<br/>
Whose tall old trunks had each a grassy mound,<br/>
So rich for us, we counted them as realms<br/>
With varied products: here were earth-nuts found,<br/>
</p><p>
And here the Lady-fingers in deep shade;<br/>
Here sloping toward the Moat the rushes grew,<br/>
The large to split for pith, the small to braid;<br/>
While over all the dark rooks cawing flew,<br/>
</p><p>
And made a happy strange solemnity,<br/>
A deep-toned chant from life unknown to me.<br/>
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
Our meadow-path had memorable spots:<br/>
One where it bridged a tiny rivulet,<br/>
Deep hid by tangled blue Forget-me-nots;<br/>
And all along the waving grasses met<br/>
</p><p>
My little palm, or nodded to my cheek,<br/>
When flowers with upturned faces gazing drew<br/>
My wonder downward, seeming all to speak<br/>
With eyes of souls that dumbly heard and knew.<br/>
</p><p>
Then came the copse, where wild things rushed unseen,<br/>
And black-scathed grass betrayed the past abode<br/>
Of mystic gypsies, who still lurked between<br/>
Me and each hidden distance of the road.<br/>
</p><p>
A gypsy once had startled me at play,<br/>
Blotting with her dark smile my sunny day.<br/>
</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>
Thus rambling we were schooled in deepest lore,<br/>
And learned the meanings that give words a soul,<br/>
The fear, the love, the primal passionate store,<br/>
Whose shaping impulses make manhood whole.<br/>
</p><p>
Those hours were seed to all my after good;<br/>
My infant gladness, through eye, ear, and touch,<br/>
Took easily as warmth a various food<br/>
To nourish the sweet skill of loving much.<br/>
</p><p>
For who in age shall roam the earth and find<br/>
Reasons for loving that will strike out love<br/>
With sudden rod from the hard year-pressed mind?<br/>
Were reasons sown as thick as stars above,<br/>
</p><p>
'Tis love must see them, as the eye sees light:<br/>
Day is but Number to the darkened sight.<br/>
</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
Our brown canal was endless to my thought;<br/>
And on its banks I sat in dreamy peace,<br/>
Unknowing how the good I loved was wrought,<br/>
Untroubled by the fear that it would cease.<br/>
</p><p>
Slowly the barges floated into view<br/>
Rounding a grassy hill to me sublime<br/>
With some Unknown beyond it, whither flew<br/>
The parting cuckoo toward a fresh spring time.<br/>
</p><p>
The wide-arched bridge, the scented elder-flowers,<br/>
The wondrous watery rings that died too soon,<br/>
The echoes of the quarry, the still hours<br/>
With white robe sweeping-on the shadeless noon,<br/>
</p><p>
Were but my growing self, are part of me,<br/>
My present Past, my root of piety.<br/>
</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>
Those long days measured by my little feet<br/>
Had chronicles which yield me many a text;<br/>
Where irony still finds an image meet<br/>
Of full-grown judgments in this world perplext.<br/>
</p><p>
One day my brother left me in high charge,<br/>
To mind the rod, while he went seeking bait,<br/>
And bade me, when I saw a nearing barge,<br/>
Snatch out the line lest he should come too late.<br/>
</p><p>
Proud of the task, I watched with all my might<br/>
For one whole minute, till my eyes grew wide,<br/>
Till sky and earth took on a strange new light<br/>
And seemed a dream-world floating on some tide&mdash;<br/>
</p><p>
A fair pavilioned boat for me alone<br/>
Bearing me onward through the vast unknown.<br/>
</p>
<h3>VIII.</h3>
<p>
But sudden came the barge's pitch-black prow,<br/>
Nearer and angrier came my brother's cry,<br/>
And all my soul was quivering fear, when lo!<br/>
Upon the imperilled line, suspended high,<br/>
</p><p>
A silver perch! My guilt that won the prey,<br/>
Now turned to merit, had a guerdon rich<br/>
Of songs and praises, and made merry play,<br/>
Until my triumph reached its highest pitch<br/>
</p><p>
When all at home were told the wondrous feat,<br/>
And how the little sister had fished well.<br/>
In secret, though my fortune tasted sweet,<br/>
I wondered why this happiness befell.<br/>
</p><p>
The little lass had luck, the gardener said:<br/>
And so I learned, luck was with glory wed.<br/>
</p>
<h3>IX.</h3>
<p>
We had the self-same world enlarged for each<br/>
By loving difference of girl and boy:<br/>
The fruit that hung on high beyond my reach<br/>
He plucked for me, and oft he must employ<br/>
</p><p>
A measuring glance to guide my tiny shoe<br/>
Where lay firm stepping-stones, or call to mind<br/>
This thing I like my sister may not do,<br/>
For she is little, and I must be kind.<br/>
</p><p>
Thus boyish Will the nobler mastery learned<br/>
Where inward vision over impulse reigns,<br/>
Widening its life with separate life discerned,<br/>
A Like unlike, a Self that self restrains.<br/>
</p><p>
His years with others must the sweeter be<br/>
For those brief days he spent in loving me.<br/>
</p>
<h3>X.</h3>
<p>
His sorrow was my sorrow, and his joy<br/>
Sent little leaps and laughs through all my frame;<br/>
My doll seemed lifeless and no girlish toy<br/>
Had any reason when my brother came.<br/>
</p><p>
I knelt with him at marbles, marked his fling<br/>
Cut the ringed stem and make the apple drop,<br/>
Or watched him winding close the spiral string<br/>
That looped the orbits of the humming top.<br/>
</p><p>
Grasped by such fellowship my vagrant thought<br/>
Ceased with dream-fruit dream-wishes to fulfil;<br/>
My aëry-picturing fantasy was taught<br/>
Subjection to the harder, truer skill<br/>
</p><p>
That seeks with deeds to grave a thought-tracked line,<br/>
And by What is, What will be to define.<br/>
</p>
<h3>XI.</h3>
<p>
School parted us; we never found again<br/>
That childish world where our two spirits mingled<br/>
Like scents from varying roses that remain<br/>
One sweetness, nor can evermore be singled.<br/>
</p><p>
Yet the twin habit of that early time<br/>
Lingered for long about the heart and tongue:<br/>
We had been natives of one happy clime<br/>
And its dear accent to our utterance clung.<br/>
</p><p>
Till the dire years whose awful name is Change<br/>
Had grasped our souls still yearning in divorce,<br/>
And pitiless shaped them in two forms that range<br/>
Two elements which sever their life's course.<br/>
</p><p>
But were another childhood-world my share,<br/>
I would be born a little sister there.<br/>

<h2>by Thomas Jefferson</h2>
<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<ol>
<li>And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</li>  
<li>And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</li>  
<li>Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</li>  
<li>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</li>  
<li>So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</li>  
<li>And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</li>  
<li>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</li>  
<li>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</li>  
<li>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</li>  
<li>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</li>  
<li>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</li>  
<li>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</li>  
<li>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</li>  
<li>And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</li>  
<li>And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</li>  
<li>Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.</li>  
<li>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</li>  
<li>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</li>  
<li>And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</li>  
<li>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</li>  
<li>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</li>  
<li>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</li>  
<li>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</li>  
<li>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</li>  
<li>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</li>  
<li>For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</li>  
<li>Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</li>  
<li>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</li>  
<li>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</li>  
<li>Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!</li>  
<li>It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</li>  
<li>Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</li>  
<li>And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.</li>  
<li>But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</li>  
<li>And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</li>  
<li>Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</li>  
<li>So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</li>  
<li>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</li>  
<li>And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</li>  
<li>They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</li>  
<li>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</li>  
<li>But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</li>  
<li>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</li>  
<li>In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</li>  
<li>Remember Lot's wife.</li>  
<li>Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</li>  
<li>I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</li>  
<li>Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. (48a:  Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.)</li>  
<li>And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</li>  
<li>Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</li>  
<li>And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Render justice for me against mine adversary.</li>  
<li>And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</li>  
<li>Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will render her justice, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</li>  
<li>And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</li>  
<li>And shall not God render justice for his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</li>  
<li>I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</li>  
<li>And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</li>  
<li>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</li>  
<li>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</li>  
<li>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</li>  
<li>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</li>  
<li>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</li>  
<li>Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.</li>  
<li>And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.</li>  
<li>But Martha was cumbered  about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</li>  
<li>And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</li>  
<li>But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</li>

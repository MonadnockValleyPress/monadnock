<h1>The Jefferson Bible</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Jefferson</h2>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<ol>
<li>At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</li>  
<li>And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</li>  
<li>And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</li>  
<li>Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</li>  
<li>Woe unto the world because of offences!  for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</li>  
<li>Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.</li>  
<li>And if thine eye causeth offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</li>  
<li>How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?</li>  
<li>And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.</li>  
<li>Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</li>  
<li>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee,  thou hast gained thy brother.</li>  
<li>But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</li>  
<li>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect even to hear the church, let him be unto thee as a Gentile man and an heathen.</li>  
<li>Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</li>  
<li>Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</li>  
<li>Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.</li>  
<li>And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.</li>  
<li>But forasmuch as he had not wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</li>  
<li>The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</li>  
<li>Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</li>  
<li>But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</li>  
<li>And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</li>  
<li>And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</li>
<li>So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</li>  
<li>Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant!  I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:</li>  
<li>Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?</li>  
<li>And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.</li>  
<li>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</li>  
<li>After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.</li>  
<li>Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.</li>  
<li>Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.</li>  
<li>Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.</li>  
<li>And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.</li>  
<li>And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.</li>  
<li>And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.</li>  
<li>And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:</li>
<li>But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,</li>  
<li>Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</li>  
<li>But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.</li>  
<li>Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.</li>  
<li>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</li>  
<li>For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</li>  
<li>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</li>  
<li>Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</li>  
<li>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</li>  
<li>Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.</li>  
<li>When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</li>  
<li>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</li>  
<li>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</li>  
<li>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</li>  
<li>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</li>  
<li>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</li>  
<li>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</li>  
<li>Jesus answered them, and said,</li>  
<li>Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</li>  
<li>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</li>  
<li>Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</li>  
<li>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</li>  
<li>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</li>  
<li>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</li>  
<li>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</li>  
<li>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</li>  
<li>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</li>  
<li>So there was a division among the people because of him.</li>  
<li>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</li>  
<li>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</li>  
<li>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</li>  
<li>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</li>  
<li>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</li>  
<li>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</li>  
<li>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</li>  
<li>Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</li>  
<li>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</li>  
<li>And every man went unto his own house.</li>

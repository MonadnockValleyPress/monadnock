<h1>The Jefferson Bible</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Jefferson</h2>
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<ol>
<li>Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</li>  
<li>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</li>  
<li>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</li>  
<li>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</li>  
<li>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</li>  
<li>This they said, tempting him, that they might have cause to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</li>  
<li>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him  first cast a stone at her.</li>  
<li>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</li>  
<li>And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</li>  
<li>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</li>  
<li>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</li>  
<li>And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</li>  
<li>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</li>  
<li>Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</li>  
<li>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</li>  
<li>But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</li>  
<li>To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</li>  
<li>And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</li>  
<li>And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</li>  
<li>I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</li>  
<li>But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</li>  
<li>The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</li>  
<li>I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.</li>  
<li>And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</li>  
<li>And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and put tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</li>  
<li>He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?</li>  
<li>And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</li>  
<li>And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</li>  
<li>But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</li>  
<li>And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</li>  
<li>And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</li>  
<li>And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</li>  
<li>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</li>  
<li>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</li>  
<li>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</li>  
<li>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</li>  
<li>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</li>  
<li>And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</li>  
<li>And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven,  Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.</li>  
<li>Give us day by day our daily bread.</li>  
<li>And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.</li>  
<li>And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;</li>  
<li>For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?</li>  
<li>And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.</li>  
<li>I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.</li>  
<li>And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</li>  
<li>For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</li>  
<li>If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?</li>  
<li>Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?</li>  
<li>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</li>

<h2>by Thomas Jefferson</h2>
<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<ol>
<li>When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.</li>  
<li>And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.</li>  
<li>Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</li>  
<li>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</li>  
<li>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</li>  
<li>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore are thou come?</li>  
<li>Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?</li>  
<li>They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</li>  
<li>As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</li>  
<li>Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</li>  
<li>Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</li>  
<li>Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</li>  
<li>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</li>  
<li>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</li>  
<li>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</li>  
<li>Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</li>  
<li>And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</li>  
<li>And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</li>  
<li>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</li>  
<li>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</li>  
<li>But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</li>  
<li>And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.</li>  
<li>Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.</li>  
<li>And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</li>  
<li>One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</li>  
<li>Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.</li>  
<li>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</li>  
<li>The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</li>  
<li>Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</li>  
<li>Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</li>  
<li>And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</li>  
<li>Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</li>  
<li>And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</li>  
<li>And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</li>  
<li>For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</li>  
<li>And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</li>  
<li>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</li>  
<li>But neither so did their witness agree together.</li>  
<li>And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</li>  
<li>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</li>  
<li>And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</li>  
<li>And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</li>  
<li>Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</li>  
<li>Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</li>  
<li>Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</li>  
<li>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</li>  
<li>Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</li>  
<li>Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</li>  
<li>They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</li>  
<li>Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</li>  
<li>Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</li>  
<li>Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</li>  
<li>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</li>  
<li>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</li>  
<li>Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</li>  
<li>Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.</li>  
<li>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</li>  
<li>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</li>  
<li>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.</li>  
<li>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</li>  
<li>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</li>  
<li>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</li>  
<li>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</li>  
<li>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</li>  
<li>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</li>  
<li>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</li>  
<li>Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</li>  
<li>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</li>  
<li>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</li>

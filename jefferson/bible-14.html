<h1>The Jefferson Bible</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Jefferson</h2>
<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<ol>
<li>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</li>  
<li>And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</li>  
<li>They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</li>  
<li>But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</li>  
<li>While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</li>  
<li>And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</li>  
<li>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</li>  
<li>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</li>  
<li>But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</li>  
<li>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage; and the door was shut.</li>  
<li>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</li>  
<li>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</li>  
<li>Watch therefore.</li>  
<li> For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</li>  
<li>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to  another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</li>  
<li>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</li>  
<li>And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</li>  
<li>But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</li>  
<li>After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</li>  
<li>And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</li>  
<li>His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</li>  
<li>He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</li>  
<li>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</li>  
<li>Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</li>  
<li>And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</li>  
<li>His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</li>  
<li>Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</li>  
<li>Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</li>  
<li>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</li>  
<li>And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</li>  
<li>And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.</li>  
<li>For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.</li>  
<li>Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</li>  
<li>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</li>  
<li>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</li>  
<li>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</li>  
<li>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</li>  
<li>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</li>  
<li>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</li>  
<li>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</li>  
<li>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</li>  
<li>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</li>  
<li>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</li>  
<li>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</li>  
<li>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</li>  
<li>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</li>  
<li>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</li>  
<li>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</li>  
<li>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</li>

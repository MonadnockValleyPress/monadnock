<h1>The Jefferson Bible</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Jefferson</h2>
<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<ol>
<li>And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;</li>  
<li>And great multitudes followed him.</li>  
<li>The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</li>  
<li>And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,</li>  
<li>And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?</li>  
<li>Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</li>  
<li>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</li>  
<li>He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</li>  
<li>And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</li>  
<li>His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.</li>  
<li>But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.</li>  
<li>For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</li>  
<li>Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</li>  
<li>But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</li>  
<li>And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</li>  
<li>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</li>  
<li>And he said unto him, Why calleth thou me good? there is none good but one, that is God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</li>  
<li>He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</li>  
<li>Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</li>  
<li>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</li>  
<li>Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</li>  
<li>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</li>  
<li>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</li>  
<li>And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</li>  
<li>When his disciples heard it,  they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</li>  
<li>But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</li>  
<li>For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</li>  
<li>And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</li>  
<li>And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</li>  
<li>And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.</li>  
<li>Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.</li>  
<li>And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</li>  
<li>They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard: and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.</li>  
<li>So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</li>  
<li>And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</li>  
<li>And when the first came, they supposed that they should receive more; but they likewise received every man a denarius.</li>  
<li>And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,</li>  
<li>Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</li>  
<li>But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?</li>  
<li>Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.</li>  
<li>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</li>  
<li>So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</li>  
<li>And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.</li>  
<li>And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.</li>  
<li>And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.</li>  
<li>And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.</li>  
<li>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.</li>  
<li>And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</li>  
<li>And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</li>  
<li>And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.</li>  
<li>And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</li>  
<li>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</li>  
<li>And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem,  and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</li>  
<li>He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</li>  
<li>And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</li>  
<li>But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.</li>  
<li>And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</li>  
<li>Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</li>  
<li>And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</li>  
<li>And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</li>  
<li>And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</li>  
<li>And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</li>  
<li>For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.</li>  
<li>And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</li>  
<li>Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</li>  
<li>And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</li>  
<li>(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</li>  
<li>For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.</li>  
<li>But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</li>  
<li>And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</li>

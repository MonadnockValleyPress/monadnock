<h1>The Jefferson Bible</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Jefferson</h2>
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<ol>
<li>And it came to pass that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</li>  
<li>And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</li>  
<li>And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</li>  
<li>Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</li>  
<li>And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</li>  
<li>And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</li>
<li>And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</li>  
<li>And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</li>  
<li>And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and</li>  
<li>Many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</li>  
<li>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</li>  
<li>When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</li>  
<li>And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.</li>  
<li>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</li>  
<li>But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</li>  
<li>And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</li>  
<li>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</li>  
<li>Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</li>  
<li>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath  this man all these things?</li>  
<li>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</li>  
<li>But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.</li>  
<li>And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two;</li>  
<li>And commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:</li>  
<li>But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</li>  
<li>Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,</li>  
<li>Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves:  for the workman is worthy of his meat.</li>  
<li>And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</li>  
<li>And when ye come into an house, salute it.</li>  
<li>And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</li>  
<li>And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</li>  
<li>Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</li>  
<li>Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</li>  
<li>But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you</li>
<li>And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.</li>  
<li>But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another:</li>  
<li>Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</li>  
<li>What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.</li>  
<li>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</li>  
<li>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.</li>  
<li>But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</li>  
<li>Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</li>  
<li>And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</li>  
<li>And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</li>  
<li>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</li>  
<li>Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</li>  
<li>And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</li>  
<li>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</li>
<li>And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</li>  
<li>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</li>  
<li>And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</li>  
<li>There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.  (51a: If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.)</li>  
<li>And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</li>  
<li>And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</li>  
<li>Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</li>  
<li>And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</li>  
<li>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</li>  
<li>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</li>  
<li>All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</li>  
<li>And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.</li>

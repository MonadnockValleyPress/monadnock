<h1>The Jefferson Bible</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Jefferson</h2>
<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<ol>
<li>After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.</li>  
<li>But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.</li>  
<li>And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman  having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.</li>  
<li>And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?</li>  
<li>For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</li>  
<li>And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.</li>  
<li>For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</li>  
<li>She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</li>  
<li>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</li>  
<li>And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</li>  
<li>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</li>  
<li>Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</li>  
<li>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</li>  
<li>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</li>  
<li>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</li>  
<li>And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</li>  
<li>And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</li>  
<li>But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</li>  
<li>For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</li>  
<li>And supped being ended,</li>  
<li>He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</li>  
<li>After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</li>  
<li>Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</li>  
<li>Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</li>  
<li>Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</li>  
<li>Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</li>  
<li>Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</li>  
<li>For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</li>  
<li>So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</li>  
<li>Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</li>  
<li>If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</li>  
<li>For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</li>  
<li>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</li>  
<li>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</li>  
<li>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</li>  
<li>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</li>  
<li>Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</li>  
<li>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he whould ask who it should be of whom he spake.</li>  
<li>He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</li>  
<li>Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</li>  
<li>Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said,</li>  
<li>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</li>  
<li>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</li>  
<li>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night:</li>  
<li>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</li>  
<li>I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</li>  
<li>And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</li>  
<li>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</li>  
<li>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</li>  
<li>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</li>  
<li>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</li>  
<li>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</li>  
<li>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</li>  
<li>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</li>  
<li>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</li>  
<li>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</li>  
<li>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</li>  
<li>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them,  Sleep on now, and take your rest.</li>

<h1>Letter to Walt Whitman</h1>
<h2>by Mark Twain</h2>
<h3>May 24th, 1889</h3>
<p>To Walt Whitman:</p>
<p>You have lived just the seventy years which are greatest in the world's history &amp; richest in benefit &amp; advancement to its peoples. These seventy years have done much more to widen the interval between man &amp; the other animals than was accomplished by any five centuries which preceded them.</p>
<p>What great births you have witnessed! The steam press, the steamship, the steel ship, the railroad, the perfected cotton-gin, the telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the photograph, photo-gravure, the electrotype, the gaslight, the electric light, the sewing machine, &amp; the amazing, infinitely varied &amp; innumerable products of coal tar, those latest &amp; strangest marvels of a marvelous age. And you have seen even greater births than these; for you have seen the application of an√¶sthesia to surgery-practice, whereby the ancient dominion of pain, which began with the first created life, came to an end in this earth forever; you have seen the slave set free, you have seen monarchy banished from France, &amp; reduced in England to a machine which makes an imposing show of diligence &amp; attention to business, but isn't connected with the works. Yes, you have indeed seen much&mdash;but tarry yet a while, for the greatest is yet to come. Wait thirty years, &amp; <em>then</em> look out over the earth! You shall see marvels upon marvels added to these whose nativity you have witnessed; &amp; conspicuous above them you shall see their formidable Result&mdash;Man at almost his full stature at last!&mdash;&amp; still growing, visibly growing while you look. In that day, who that hath a throne, or a gilded privilege not attainable by his neighbor, let him procure him slippers &amp; get ready to dance, for there is going to be music. Abide, &amp; see these things!</p>
<p>Thirty of us who honor &amp; love you, offer the opportunity. We have among us 600 years, good &amp; sound, left in the bank of life. Take 30 of them&mdash;the richest birth-day gift ever offered to a poet in this world&mdash;&amp; sit down &amp; wait. Wait till you see that great figure appear, &amp; catch the far glint of the sun upon his banner; then you may depart satisfied, as knowing you have seen him for whom the earth was made, &amp; that he will proclaim that human wheat is worth more than human tares, &amp; proceed to reorganize human values on that basis.</p>
<p>Mark Twain</p>

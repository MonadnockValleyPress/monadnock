<h1>The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd</h1>
<h2>by Sir Walter Raleigh</h2>
<p><em>(This poem was written in response to Christopher Marlowe's poem <a href='/marlowe/shepherd.html'>The Passionate Shepherd to His Love</a>.)</em></p>
<p>
If all the world and love were young,<br/>
And truth in every shepherd's tongue,<br/>
These pretty pleasures might me move<br/>
To live with thee and be thy love.
</p>
<p>
Time drives the flocks from field to fold,<br/>
When rivers rage and rocks grow cold;<br/>
And Philomel becometh dumb;<br/>
The rest complains of cares to come.
</p>
<p>
The flowers do fade, and wanton fields<br/>
To wayward winter reckoning yields:<br/>
A honey tongue, a heart of gall,<br/>
Is fancy's spring, but sorrow's fall.
</p>
<p>
The gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of roses,<br/>
Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies<br/>
Soon break, soon wither, soon forgotten,&mdash;<br/>
In folly ripe, in reason rotten.
</p>
<p>
Thy belt of straw and ivy buds,<br/>
Thy coral clasps and amber studs,<br/>
All these in me no means can move<br/>
To come to thee and be thy love.
</p>
<p>
But could youth last and love still breed,<br/>
Had joys no date nor age no need,<br/>
Then these delights my mind might move<br/>
To live with thee and be thy love.

<h1>Pilgrim to Pilgrim</h1>
<h2>by Sir Walter Raleigh</h2>
<p>
As you came from the holy land<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Walsinghame,<br/>
Met you not with my true love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way as you came?
</p>
<p>
How shall I know your true love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That have met many one,<br/>
As I went to the holy land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That have come, that have gone?
</p>
<p>
She is neither white nor brown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the heavens fair;<br/>
There is none hath a form so divine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earth or the air.
</p>
<p>
Such a one did I meet, good sir,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an angel-like face,<br/>
Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By her gait, by her grace.
</p>
<p>
She hath left me here all alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone, as unknown,<br/>
Who sometimes did me lead with herself,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And me loved as her own.
</p>
<p>
What's the cause that she leaves you alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a new way doth take,<br/>
Who loved you once as her own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her joy did you make?
</p>
<p>
I have loved her all my youth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now old, as you see,<br/>
Love likes not the falling fruit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the withered tree.
</p>
<p>
Know that Love is a careless child,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forgets promise past;<br/>
He is blind, he is deaf when he list,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in faith never fast.
</p>
<p>
His desire is a dureless content,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a trustless joy;<br/>
He is won with a world of despair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is lost with a toy.
</p>
<p>
Of womankind such indeed is the love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the word love abusèd,<br/>
Under which many childish desires<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And conceits are excusèd.
</p>
<p>
But true love is a durable fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind ever burning,<br/>
Never sick, never old, never dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From itself never turning.

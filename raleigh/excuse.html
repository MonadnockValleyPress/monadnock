<h1>The Excuse</h1>
<h2>by Sir Walter Raleigh</h2>
<p>
Calling to mind, my eyes went long about<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To cause my heart to forsake my breast,<br/>
All in a rage I sought to pull them out,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As who had been such traitors to my rest:<br/>
What could they say to win again my grace?&mdash;<br/>
Forsooth, that they had seen my mistress' face.
</p>
<p>
Another time, my heart I called to mind,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that he this woe on me had brought,<br/>
Because that he to love his force resigned,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When of such wars my fancy never thought:<br/>
What could he say when I would him have slain?&mdash;<br/>
That he was hers, and had forgone my chain.
</p>
<p>
At last, when I perceived both eyes and heart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Excuse themselves, as guiltless of my ill,<br/>
I found myself the cause of all my smart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And told myself that I myself would kill:<br/>
Yet when I saw myself to you was true,<br/>
I loved myself, because myself loved you.

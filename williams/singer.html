<h1>The Late Singer</h1>
<h2>by William Carlos Williams</h2>
<p>
Here it is spring again<br/>
and I still a young man!<br/>
I am late at my singing.<br/>
The sparrow with the black rain on his breast<br/>
has been at his cadenzas for two weeks past:<br/>
What is it that is dragging at my heart?<br/>
The grass by the back door<br/>
is stiff with sap.<br/>
The old maples are opening<br/>
their branches of brown and yellow moth-flowers.<br/>
A moon hangs in the blue<br/>
in the early afternoons over the marshes.<br/>
I am late at my singing.

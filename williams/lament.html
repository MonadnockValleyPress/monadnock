<h1>The Widow's Lament in Springtime</h1>
<h2>by William Carlos Williams</h2>
<p>
Sorrow is my own yard<br/>
where the new grass<br/>
flames as it has flamed<br/>
often before but not<br/>
with the cold fire<br/>
that closes round me this year.<br/>
Thirtyfive years<br/>
I lived with my husband.<br/>
The plumtree is white today<br/>
with masses of flowers.<br/>
Masses of flowers<br/>
load the cherry branches<br/>
and color some bushes<br/>
yellow and some red<br/><br/>
but the grief in my heart<br/>
is stronger than they<br/>
for though they were my joy<br/>
formerly, today I notice them<br/>
and turn away forgetting.<br/>
Today my son told me<br/>
that in the meadows,<br/>
at the edge of the heavy woods<br/>
in the distance, he saw<br/>
trees of white flowers.<br/>
I feel that I would like<br/>
to go there<br/>
and fall into those flowers<br/>
and sink into the marsh near them.

<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XXIII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Thus humbled in the dust, the pensive train<br/>
Through the sad city mourn'd her hero slain.<br/>
The body soil'd with dust, and black with gore,<br/>
Lies on broad Hellespont's resounding shore.<br/>
The Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand,<br/>
All, but the martial Myrmidonian band:<br/>
These yet assembled great Achilles holds,<br/>
And the stern purpose of his mind unfolds:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Not yet, my brave companions of the war,<br/>
Release your smoking coursers from the car;<br/>
But, with his chariot each in order led,<br/>
Perform due honours to Patroclus dead.<br/>
Ere yet from rest or food we seek relief,<br/>
Some rites remain, to glut our rage of grief."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The troops obey'd; and thrice in order led<br/>
(Achilles first) their coursers round the dead;<br/>
And thrice their sorrows and laments renew;<br/>
Tears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.<br/>
For such a warrior Thetis aids their woe,<br/>
Melts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.<br/>
But chief, Pelides: thick-succeeding sighs<br/>
Burst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes:<br/>
His slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid<br/>
On his dead friend's cold breast, and thus he said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"All hail, Patroclus! let thy honour'd ghost<br/>
Hear, and rejoice on Pluto's dreary coast;<br/>
Behold! Achilles' promise is complete;<br/>
The bloody Hector stretch'd before thy feet.<br/>
Lo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;<br/>
And twelve sad victims, of the Trojan line,<br/>
Sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire;<br/>
Their lives effused around thy funeral pyre."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Gloomy he said, and (horrible to view)<br/>
Before the bier the bleeding Hector threw,<br/>
Prone on the dust. The Myrmidons around<br/>
Unbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.<br/>
All to Achilles' sable ship repair,<br/>
Frequent and full, the genial feast to share.<br/>
Now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,<br/>
The bristly victims hissing o'er the fire:<br/>
The huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries<br/>
Expires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.<br/>
Around the hero's prostrate body flow'd,<br/>
In one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.<br/>
And now a band of Argive monarchs brings<br/>
The glorious victor to the king of kings.<br/>
From his dead friend the pensive warrior went,<br/>
With steps unwilling, to the regal tent.<br/>
The attending heralds, as by office bound,<br/>
With kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:<br/>
To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,<br/>
They urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"No drop shall touch me, by almighty Jove!<br/>
The first and greatest of the gods above!<br/>
Till on the pyre I place thee; till I rear<br/>
The grassy mound, and clip thy sacred hair.<br/>
Some ease at least those pious rites may give,<br/>
And soothe my sorrows, while I bear to live.<br/>
Howe'er, reluctant as I am, I stay<br/>
And share your feast; but with the dawn of day,<br/>
(O king of men!) it claims thy royal care,<br/>
That Greece the warrior's funeral pile prepare,<br/>
And bid the forests fall: (such rites are paid<br/>
To heroes slumbering in eternal shade:)<br/>
Then, when his earthly part shall mount in fire,<br/>
Let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke: they hear him, and the word obey;<br/>
The rage of hunger and of thirst allay,<br/>
Then ease in sleep the labours of the day.<br/>
But great Pelides, stretch'd along the shore,<br/>
Where, dash'd on rocks, the broken billows roar,<br/>
Lies inly groaning; while on either hand<br/>
The martial Myrmidons confusedly stand.<br/>
Along the grass his languid members fall,<br/>
Tired with his chase around the Trojan wall;<br/>
Hush'd by the murmurs of the rolling deep,<br/>
At length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep.<br/>
When lo! the shade, before his closing eyes,<br/>
Of sad Patroclus rose, or seem'd to rise:<br/>
In the same robe he living wore, he came:<br/>
In stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.<br/>
The form familiar hover'd o'er his head,<br/>
"And sleeps Achilles? (thus the phantom said:)<br/>
Sleeps my Achilles, his Patroclus dead?<br/>
Living, I seem'd his dearest, tenderest care,<br/>
But now forgot, I wander in the air.<br/>
Let my pale corse the rites of burial know,<br/>
And give me entrance in the realms below:<br/>
Till then the spirit finds no resting-place,<br/>
But here and there the unbodied spectres chase<br/>
The vagrant dead around the dark abode,<br/>
Forbid to cross the irremeable flood.<br/>
Now give thy hand; for to the farther shore<br/>
When once we pass, the soul returns no more:<br/>
When once the last funereal flames ascend,<br/>
No more shall meet Achilles and his friend;<br/>
No more our thoughts to those we loved make known;<br/>
Or quit the dearest, to converse alone.<br/>
Me fate has sever'd from the sons of earth,<br/>
The fate fore-doom'd that waited from my birth:<br/>
Thee too it waits; before the Trojan wall<br/>
Even great and godlike thou art doom'd to fall.<br/>
Hear then; and as in fate and love we join,<br/>
Ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine!<br/>
Together have we lived; together bred,<br/>
One house received us, and one table fed;<br/>
That golden urn, thy goddess-mother gave,<br/>
May mix our ashes in one common grave."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And is it thou? (he answers) To my sight<br/>
Once more return'st thou from the realms of night?<br/>
O more than brother! Think each office paid,<br/>
Whate'er can rest a discontented shade;<br/>
But grant one last embrace, unhappy boy!<br/>
Afford at least that melancholy joy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and with his longing arms essay'd<br/>
In vain to grasp the visionary shade!<br/>
Like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly,<br/>
And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.<br/>
Confused he wakes; amazement breaks the bands<br/>
Of golden sleep, and starting from the sands,<br/>
Pensive he muses with uplifted hands:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"'Tis true, 'tis certain; man, though dead, retains<br/>
Part of himself; the immortal mind remains:<br/>
The form subsists without the body's aid,<br/>
Aerial semblance, and an empty shade!<br/>
This night my friend, so late in battle lost,<br/>
Stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost:<br/>
Even now familiar, as in life, he came;<br/>
Alas! how different! yet how like the same!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:<br/>
And now the rosy-finger'd morn appears,<br/>
Shows every mournful face with tears o'erspread,<br/>
And glares on the pale visage of the dead.<br/>
But Agamemnon, as the rites demand,<br/>
With mules and waggons sends a chosen band<br/>
To load the timber, and the pile to rear;<br/>
A charge consign'd to Merion's faithful care.<br/>
With proper instruments they take the road,<br/>
Axes to cut, and ropes to sling the load.<br/>
First march the heavy mules, securely slow,<br/>
O'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks they go:<br/>
Jumping, high o'er the shrubs of the rough ground,<br/>
Rattle the clattering cars, and the shock'd axles bound.<br/>
But when arrived at Ida's spreading woods,<br/>
(Fair Ida, water'd with descending floods,)<br/>
Loud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes;<br/>
On all sides round the forest hurls her oaks<br/>
Headlong. Deep echoing groan the thickets brown;<br/>
Then rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down.<br/>
The wood the Grecians cleave, prepared to burn;<br/>
And the slow mules the same rough road return.<br/>
The sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore<br/>
(Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;<br/>
There on the spot which great Achilles show'd,<br/>
They eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;<br/>
Circling around the place, where times to come<br/>
Shall view Patroclus' and Achilles' tomb.<br/>
The hero bids his martial troops appear<br/>
High on their cars in all the pomp of war;<br/>
Each in refulgent arms his limbs attires,<br/>
All mount their chariots, combatants and squires.<br/>
The chariots first proceed, a shining train;<br/>
Then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;<br/>
Next these the melancholy band appear;<br/>
Amidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;<br/>
O'er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;<br/>
Achilles next, oppress'd with mighty woe,<br/>
Supporting with his hands the hero's head,<br/>
Bends o'er the extended body of the dead.<br/>
Patroclus decent on the appointed ground<br/>
They place, and heap the sylvan pile around.<br/>
But great Achilles stands apart in prayer,<br/>
And from his head divides the yellow hair;<br/>
Those curling locks which from his youth he vow'd,<br/>
And sacred grew, to Sperchius' honour'd flood:<br/>
Then sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,<br/>
And roll'd his eyes around the watery waste:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost<br/>
Delightful roll along my native coast!<br/>
To whom we vainly vow'd, at our return,<br/>
These locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:<br/>
Full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,<br/>
Where to the day thy silver fountains rise,<br/>
And where in shade of consecrated bowers<br/>
Thy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!<br/>
So vow'd my father, but he vow'd in vain;<br/>
No more Achilles sees his native plain;<br/>
In that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,<br/>
Patroclus bears them to the shades below."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus o'er Patroclus while the hero pray'd,<br/>
On his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.<br/>
Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:<br/>
And now the sun had set upon their woe;<br/>
But to the king of men thus spoke the chief:<br/>
"Enough, Atrides! give the troops relief:<br/>
Permit the mourning legions to retire,<br/>
And let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;<br/>
The pious care be ours, the dead to burn&mdash;"<br/>
He said: the people to their ships return:<br/>
While those deputed to inter the slain<br/>
Heap with a rising pyramid the plain.<br/>
A hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,<br/>
The growing structure spreads on every side;<br/>
High on the top the manly corse they lay,<br/>
And well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:<br/>
Achilles covered with their fat the dead,<br/>
And the piled victims round the body spread;<br/>
Then jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,<br/>
Suspends around, low-bending o'er the pile.<br/>
Four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan<br/>
Pour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.<br/>
Of nine large dogs, domestic at his board,<br/>
Fall two, selected to attend their lord,<br/>
Then last of all, and horrible to tell,<br/>
Sad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.<br/>
On these the rage of fire victorious preys,<br/>
Involves and joins them in one common blaze.<br/>
Smear'd with the bloody rites, he stands on high,<br/>
And calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"All hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost<br/>
Hear, and exult, on Pluto's dreary coast.<br/>
Behold Achilles' promise fully paid,<br/>
Twelve Trojan heroes offer'd to thy shade;<br/>
But heavier fates on Hector's corse attend,<br/>
Saved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain<br/>
His threat, and guard inviolate the slain:<br/>
Celestial Venus hover'd o'er his head,<br/>
And roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:<br/>
She watch'd him all the night and all the day,<br/>
And drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.<br/>
Nor sacred Phoebus less employ'd his care;<br/>
He pour'd around a veil of gather'd air,<br/>
And kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,<br/>
Against the solar beam and Sirian fire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies,<br/>
Smokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;<br/>
But, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer,<br/>
Invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,<br/>
And victims promised, and libations cast,<br/>
To gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:<br/>
He call'd the aerial powers, along the skies<br/>
To breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.<br/>
The winged Iris heard the hero's call,<br/>
And instant hasten'd to their airy hall,<br/>
Where in old Zephyr's open courts on high,<br/>
Sat all the blustering brethren of the sky.<br/>
She shone amidst them, on her painted bow;<br/>
The rocky pavement glitter'd with the show.<br/>
All from the banquet rise, and each invites<br/>
The various goddess to partake the rites.<br/>
"Not so (the dame replied), I haste to go<br/>
To sacred Ocean, and the floods below:<br/>
Even now our solemn hecatombs attend,<br/>
And heaven is feasting on the world's green end<br/>
With righteous Ethiops (uncorrupted train!)<br/>
Far on the extremest limits of the main.<br/>
But Peleus' son entreats, with sacrifice,<br/>
The western spirit, and the north, to rise!<br/>
Let on Patroclus' pile your blast be driven,<br/>
And bear the blazing honours high to heaven."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift as the word she vanish'd from their view;<br/>
Swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;<br/>
Forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,<br/>
And heaps on heaps the clouds are toss'd before.<br/>
To the wide main then stooping from the skies,<br/>
The heaving deeps in watery mountains rise:<br/>
Troy feels the blast along her shaking walls,<br/>
Till on the pile the gather'd tempest falls.<br/>
The structure crackles in the roaring fires,<br/>
And all the night the plenteous flame aspires.<br/>
All night Achilles hails Patroclus' soul,<br/>
With large libations from the golden bowl.<br/>
As a poor father, helpless and undone,<br/>
Mourns o'er the ashes of an only son,<br/>
Takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,<br/>
And pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:<br/>
So stay'd Achilles, circling round the shore,<br/>
So watch'd the flames, till now they flame no more.<br/>
'Twas when, emerging through the shades of night.<br/>
The morning planet told the approach of light;<br/>
And, fast behind, Aurora's warmer ray<br/>
O'er the broad ocean pour'd the golden day:<br/>
Then sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn'd,<br/>
And to their caves the whistling winds return'd:<br/>
Across the Thracian seas their course they bore;<br/>
The ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then parting from the pile he ceased to weep,<br/>
And sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,<br/>
Exhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd<br/>
Of thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;<br/>
The tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook<br/>
Unwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!<br/>
First let us quench the yet remaining flame<br/>
With sable wine; then, as the rites direct,<br/>
The hero's bones with careful view select:<br/>
(Apart, and easy to be known they lie<br/>
Amidst the heap, and obvious to the eye:<br/>
The rest around the margin will be seen<br/>
Promiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)<br/>
These wrapp'd in double cauls of fat, prepare;<br/>
And in the golden vase dispose with care;<br/>
There let them rest with decent honour laid,<br/>
Till I shall follow to the infernal shade.<br/>
Meantime erect the tomb with pious hands,<br/>
A common structure on the humble sands:<br/>
Hereafter Greece some nobler work may raise,<br/>
And late posterity record our praise!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,<br/>
Wide o'er the pile the sable wine they throw,<br/>
And deep subsides the ashy heap below.<br/>
Next the white bones his sad companions place,<br/>
With tears collected, in the golden vase.<br/>
The sacred relics to the tent they bore;<br/>
The urn a veil of linen covered o'er.<br/>
That done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,<br/>
And cast the deep foundations round the pyre;<br/>
High in the midst they heap the swelling bed<br/>
Of rising earth, memorial of the dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The swarming populace the chief detains,<br/>
And leads amidst a wide extent of plains;<br/>
There placed them round: then from the ships proceeds<br/>
A train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,<br/>
Vases and tripods (for the funeral games),<br/>
Resplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.<br/>
First stood the prizes to reward the force<br/>
Of rapid racers in the dusty course:<br/>
A woman for the first, in beauty's bloom,<br/>
Skill'd in the needle, and the labouring loom;<br/>
And a large vase, where two bright handles rise,<br/>
Of twenty measures its capacious size.<br/>
The second victor claims a mare unbroke,<br/>
Big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:<br/>
The third, a charger yet untouch'd by flame;<br/>
Four ample measures held the shining frame:<br/>
Two golden talents for the fourth were placed:<br/>
An ample double bowl contents the last.<br/>
These in fair order ranged upon the plain,<br/>
The hero, rising, thus address'd the train:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed<br/>
To the brave rulers of the racing steed;<br/>
Prizes which none beside ourself could gain,<br/>
Should our immortal coursers take the plain;<br/>
(A race unrivall'd, which from ocean's god<br/>
Peleus received, and on his son bestow'd.)<br/>
But this no time our vigour to display;<br/>
Nor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:<br/>
Lost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck<br/>
Their flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.<br/>
Sad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,<br/>
And trail those graceful honours on the sand!<br/>
Let others for the noble task prepare,<br/>
Who trust the courser and the flying car."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fired at his word the rival racers rise;<br/>
But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,<br/>
Famed though Pieria for the fleetest breed,<br/>
And skill'd to manage the high-bounding steed.<br/>
With equal ardour bold Tydides swell'd,<br/>
The steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell'd<br/>
(Which late obey'd the Dardan chief's command,<br/>
When scarce a god redeem'd him from his hand).<br/>
Then Menelaus his Podargus brings,<br/>
And the famed courser of the king of kings:<br/>
Whom rich Echepolus (more rich than brave),<br/>
To 'scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave,<br/>
(Æthe her name) at home to end his days;<br/>
Base wealth preferring to eternal praise.<br/>
Next him Antilochus demands the course<br/>
With beating heart, and cheers his Pylian horse.<br/>
Experienced Nestor gives his son the reins,<br/>
Directs his judgment, and his heat restrains;<br/>
Nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears<br/>
The prudent son with unattending ears.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,<br/>
The gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless'd;<br/>
Neptune and Jove on thee conferr'd the skill<br/>
Swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.<br/>
To guide thy conduct little precept needs;<br/>
But slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.<br/>
Fear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known;<br/>
Compare those rivals' judgment and thy own:<br/>
It is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,<br/>
And to be swift is less than to be wise.<br/>
'Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes<br/>
The dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks;<br/>
By art the pilot, through the boiling deep<br/>
And howling tempest, steers the fearless ship;<br/>
And 'tis the artist wins the glorious course;<br/>
Not those who trust in chariots and in horse.<br/>
In vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,<br/>
And short, or wide, the ungovern'd courser drive:<br/>
While with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,<br/>
The knowing racer to his end proceeds;<br/>
Fix'd on the goal his eye foreruns the course,<br/>
His hand unerring steers the steady horse,<br/>
And now contracts, or now extends the rein,<br/>
Observing still the foremost on the plain.<br/>
Mark then the goal, 'tis easy to be found;<br/>
Yon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;<br/>
Of some once stately oak the last remains,<br/>
Or hardy fir, unperish'd with the rains:<br/>
Inclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;<br/>
And round, a circle for the wheeling car.<br/>
(Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;<br/>
Or then, as now, the limit of a race.)<br/>
Bear close to this, and warily proceed,<br/>
A little bending to the left-hand steed;<br/>
But urge the right, and give him all the reins;<br/>
While thy strict hand his fellow's head restrains,<br/>
And turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,<br/>
The wheel's round naves appear to brush the goal.<br/>
Yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)<br/>
Clear of the stony heap direct the course;<br/>
Lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be<br/>
A joy to others, a reproach to me.<br/>
So shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,<br/>
And leave unskilful swiftness far behind:<br/>
Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed<br/>
Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;<br/>
Or the famed race, through all the regions known,<br/>
That whirl'd the car of proud Laomedon."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage<br/>
Concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.<br/>
Next bold Meriones was seen to rise,<br/>
The last, but not least ardent for the prize.<br/>
They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose<br/>
(Roll'd in his helmet, these Achilles throws).<br/>
Young Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;<br/>
And next the brother of the king of men:<br/>
Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;<br/>
And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.<br/>
They stand in order, an impatient train:<br/>
Pelides points the barrier on the plain,<br/>
And sends before old Phoenix to the place,<br/>
To mark the racers, and to judge the race.<br/>
At once the coursers from the barrier bound;<br/>
The lifted scourges all at once resound;<br/>
Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;<br/>
And up the champaign thunder from the shore:<br/>
Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,<br/>
And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;<br/>
Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,<br/>
Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:<br/>
The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,<br/>
Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.<br/>
While hot for fame, and conquest all their care,<br/>
(Each o'er his flying courser hung in air,)<br/>
Erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,<br/>
They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.<br/>
Now (the last compass fetch'd around the goal)<br/>
At the near prize each gathers all his soul,<br/>
Each burns with double hope, with double pain,<br/>
Tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.<br/>
First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;<br/>
With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:<br/>
Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,<br/>
And seem just mounting on his car behind;<br/>
Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,<br/>
And, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees.<br/>
Then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;<br/>
But angry Phoebus to Tydides flies,<br/>
Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain<br/>
His matchless horses' labour on the plain.<br/>
Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey<br/>
Snatch'd from his hope the glories of the day.<br/>
The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,<br/>
Springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,<br/>
And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke<br/>
She breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke:<br/>
No more their way the startled horses held;<br/>
The car reversed came rattling on the field;<br/>
Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,<br/>
Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;<br/>
His batter'd face and elbows strike the ground;<br/>
Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound:<br/>
Grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:<br/>
Before him far the glad Tydides flies;<br/>
Minerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,<br/>
And crowns him victor of the labour'd race.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;<br/>
While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:<br/>
"Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;<br/>
Not that we hope to match Tydides' horse,<br/>
Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,<br/>
And gives their lord the honours of the day;<br/>
But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo<br/>
Your swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?<br/>
Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain<br/>
The last ignoble gift be all we gain,<br/>
No more shall Nestor's hand your food supply,<br/>
The old man's fury rises, and ye die.<br/>
Haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,<br/>
Presents the occasion, could we use it right."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus he. The coursers at their master's threat<br/>
With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.<br/>
And now Antilochus with nice survey<br/>
Observes the compass of the hollow way.<br/>
'Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,<br/>
Fast by the road a precipice was worn:<br/>
Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng<br/>
The Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.<br/>
Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,<br/>
Still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.<br/>
Atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,<br/>
And wonders at the rashness of his foe.<br/>
"Hold, stay your steeds&mdash;What madness thus to ride<br/>
This narrow way! take larger field (he cried),<br/>
Or both must fall."&mdash;Atrides cried in vain;<br/>
He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.<br/>
Far as an able arm the disk can send,<br/>
When youthful rivals their full force extend,<br/>
So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew<br/>
Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew<br/>
His horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears<br/>
The rattling ruin of the clashing cars,<br/>
The floundering coursers rolling on the plain,<br/>
And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.<br/>
But thus upbraids his rival as he flies:<br/>
"Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!<br/>
Go, but expect not I'll the prize resign;<br/>
Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine&mdash;"<br/>
Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,<br/>
"Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!<br/>
Your rivals, destitute of youthful force,<br/>
With fainting knees shall labour in the course,<br/>
And yield the glory yours."&mdash;The steeds obey;<br/>
Already at their heels they wing their way,<br/>
And seem already to retrieve the day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld<br/>
The coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.<br/>
The first who mark'd them was the Cretan king;<br/>
High on a rising ground, above the ring,<br/>
The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey<br/>
He well observed the chief who led the way,<br/>
And heard from far his animating cries,<br/>
And saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes;<br/>
On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,<br/>
Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.<br/>
He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:<br/>
"Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?<br/>
Or can ye, all, another chief survey,<br/>
And other steeds than lately led the way?<br/>
Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,<br/>
Lie sure disabled in the middle field:<br/>
For, since the goal they doubled, round the plain<br/>
I search to find them, but I search in vain.<br/>
Perchance the reins forsook the driver's hand,<br/>
And, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand,<br/>
Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray<br/>
With frantic fury from the destined way.<br/>
Rise then some other, and inform my sight,<br/>
For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;<br/>
Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,<br/>
The great Ætolian chief, renown'd in war."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Old man! (Oileus rashly thus replies)<br/>
Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;<br/>
Of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,<br/>
Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.<br/>
Eumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase,<br/>
Still, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race:<br/>
I well discern him, as he shakes the rein,<br/>
And hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin'd:<br/>
"Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!<br/>
Contentious prince, of all the Greeks beside<br/>
The last in merit, as the first in pride!<br/>
To vile reproach what answer can we make?<br/>
A goblet or a tripod let us stake,<br/>
And be the king the judge. The most unwise<br/>
Will learn their rashness, when they pay the price."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,<br/>
Stern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn<br/>
To fell extremes. But Thetis' godlike son<br/>
Awful amidst them rose, and thus begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;<br/>
Much would ye blame, should others thus offend:<br/>
And lo! the approaching steeds your contest end."<br/>
No sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,<br/>
Drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.<br/>
High o'er his head the circling lash he wields:<br/>
His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:<br/>
His car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd,<br/>
Bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,<br/>
Refulgent through the cloud: no eye could find<br/>
The track his flying wheels had left behind:<br/>
And the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace<br/>
So swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.<br/>
Now victor at the goal Tydides stands,<br/>
Quits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;<br/>
From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;<br/>
The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:<br/>
With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,<br/>
The tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:<br/>
These to the ships his train triumphant leads,<br/>
The chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Young Nestor follows (who by art, not force,<br/>
O'erpass'd Atrides) second in the course.<br/>
Behind, Atrides urged the race, more near<br/>
Than to the courser in his swift career<br/>
The following car, just touching with his heel<br/>
And brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:<br/>
Such, and so narrow now the space between<br/>
The rivals, late so distant on the green;<br/>
So soon swift Æthe her lost ground regain'd,<br/>
One length, one moment, had the race obtain'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Merion pursued, at greater distance still,<br/>
With tardier coursers, and inferior skill.<br/>
Last came, Admetus! thy unhappy son;<br/>
Slow dragged the steeds his batter'd chariot on:<br/>
Achilles saw, and pitying thus begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass'd<br/>
The sons of Greece! the ablest, yet the last!<br/>
Fortune denies, but justice bids us pay<br/>
(Since great Tydides bears the first away)<br/>
To him the second honours of the day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,<br/>
And then Eumelus had received the prize,<br/>
But youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,<br/>
The award opposes, and asserts his claim.<br/>
"Think not (he cries) I tamely will resign,<br/>
O Peleus' son! the mare so justly mine.<br/>
What if the gods, the skilful to confound,<br/>
Have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?<br/>
Perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice,<br/>
And vows omitted forfeited the prize.<br/>
If yet (distinction to thy friend to show,<br/>
And please a soul desirous to bestow)<br/>
Some gift must grace Eumelus, view thy store<br/>
Of beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore;<br/>
An ample present let him thence receive,<br/>
And Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.<br/>
But this my prize I never shall forego;<br/>
This, who but touches, warriors! is my foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;<br/>
Pleased with the well-turn'd flattery of a friend,<br/>
Achilles smiled: "The gift proposed (he cried),<br/>
Antilochus! we shall ourself provide.<br/>
With plates of brass the corslet cover'd o'er,<br/>
(The same renown'd Asteropaeus wore,)<br/>
Whose glittering margins raised with silver shine,<br/>
(No vulgar gift,) Eumelus! shall be thine."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: Automedon at his command<br/>
The corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.<br/>
Distinguish'd by his friend, his bosom glows<br/>
With generous joy: then Menelaus rose;<br/>
The herald placed the sceptre in his hands,<br/>
And still'd the clamour of the shouting bands.<br/>
Not without cause incensed at Nestor's son,<br/>
And inly grieving, thus the king begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain'd,<br/>
An act so rash, Antilochus! has stain'd.<br/>
Robb'd of my glory and my just reward,<br/>
To you, O Grecians! be my wrong declared:<br/>
So not a leader shall our conduct blame,<br/>
Or judge me envious of a rival's fame.<br/>
But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?<br/>
What needs appealing in a fact so plain?<br/>
What Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,<br/>
And vindicate by oath th' ill-gotten prize?<br/>
Rise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,<br/>
The driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;<br/>
And touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent<br/>
Was but to conquer, not to circumvent.<br/>
Swear by that god whose liquid arms surround<br/>
The globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The prudent chief with calm attention heard;<br/>
Then mildly thus: "Excuse, if youth have err'd;<br/>
Superior as thou art, forgive the offence,<br/>
Nor I thy equal, or in years, or sense.<br/>
Thou know'st the errors of unripen'd age,<br/>
Weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.<br/>
The prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;<br/>
The mare, or aught thou ask'st, be freely thine<br/>
Ere I become (from thy dear friendship torn)<br/>
Hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So spoke Antilochus; and at the word<br/>
The mare contested to the king restored.<br/>
Joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain<br/>
Lifts the green ear above the springing plain,<br/>
The fields their vegetable life renew,<br/>
And laugh and glitter with the morning dew;<br/>
Such joy the Spartan's shining face o'erspread,<br/>
And lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Still may our souls, O generous youth! agree<br/>
'Tis now Atrides' turn to yield to thee.<br/>
Rash heat perhaps a moment might control,<br/>
Not break, the settled temper of thy soul.<br/>
Not but (my friend) 'tis still the wiser way<br/>
To waive contention with superior sway;<br/>
For ah! how few, who should like thee offend,<br/>
Like thee, have talents to regain the friend!<br/>
To plead indulgence, and thy fault atone,<br/>
Suffice thy father's merit and thy own:<br/>
Generous alike, for me, the sire and son<br/>
Have greatly suffer'd, and have greatly done.<br/>
I yield; that all may know, my soul can bend,<br/>
Nor is my pride preferr'd before my friend."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; and pleased his passion to command,<br/>
Resign'd the courser to Noemon's hand,<br/>
Friend of the youthful chief: himself content,<br/>
The shining charger to his vessel sent.<br/>
The golden talents Merion next obtain'd;<br/>
The fifth reward, the double bowl, remain'd.<br/>
Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears.<br/>
And thus the purpose of his gift declares:<br/>
"Accept thou this, O sacred sire! (he said)<br/>
In dear memorial of Patroclus dead;<br/>
Dead and for ever lost Patroclus lies,<br/>
For ever snatch'd from our desiring eyes!<br/>
Take thou this token of a grateful heart,<br/>
Though 'tis not thine to hurl the distant dart,<br/>
The quoit to toss, the ponderous mace to wield,<br/>
Or urge the race, or wrestle on the field:<br/>
Thy pristine vigour age has overthrown,<br/>
But left the glory of the past thy own."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and placed the goblet at his side;<br/>
With joy the venerable king replied:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved<br/>
A senior honour'd, and a friend beloved!<br/>
Too true it is, deserted of my strength,<br/>
These wither'd arms and limbs have fail'd at length.<br/>
Oh! had I now that force I felt of yore,<br/>
Known through Buprasium and the Pylian shore!<br/>
Victorious then in every solemn game,<br/>
Ordain'd to Amarynces' mighty name;<br/>
The brave Epeians gave my glory way,<br/>
Ætolians, Pylians, all resign'd the day.<br/>
I quell'd Clytomedes in fights of hand,<br/>
And backward hurl'd Ancaeus on the sand,<br/>
Surpass'd Iphyclus in the swift career,<br/>
Phyleus and Polydorus with the spear.<br/>
The sons of Actor won the prize of horse,<br/>
But won by numbers, not by art or force:<br/>
For the famed twins, impatient to survey<br/>
Prize after prize by Nestor borne away,<br/>
Sprung to their car; and with united pains<br/>
One lash'd the coursers, while one ruled the reins.<br/>
Such once I was! Now to these tasks succeeds<br/>
A younger race, that emulate our deeds:<br/>
I yield, alas! (to age who must not yield?)<br/>
Though once the foremost hero of the field.<br/>
Go thou, my son! by generous friendship led,<br/>
With martial honours decorate the dead:<br/>
While pleased I take the gift thy hands present,<br/>
(Pledge of benevolence, and kind intent,)<br/>
Rejoiced, of all the numerous Greeks, to see<br/>
Not one but honours sacred age and me:<br/>
Those due distinctions thou so well canst pay,<br/>
May the just gods return another day!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Proud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:<br/>
Achilles heard him, prouder of the praise.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The prizes next are order'd to the field,<br/>
For the bold champions who the caestus wield.<br/>
A stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,<br/>
Of six years' age, unconscious of the yoke,<br/>
Is to the circus led, and firmly bound;<br/>
Next stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.<br/>
Achilles rising, thus: "Let Greece excite<br/>
Two heroes equal to this hardy fight;<br/>
Who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke,<br/>
And rush beneath the long-descending stroke.<br/>
On whom Apollo shall the palm bestow,<br/>
And whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know,<br/>
This mule his dauntless labours shall repay,<br/>
The vanquish'd bear the massy bowl away."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This dreadful combat great Epeus chose;<br/>
High o'er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,<br/>
And seized the beast, and thus began to say:<br/>
"Stand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!<br/>
(Price of his ruin: for who dares deny<br/>
This mule my right; the undoubted victor I)<br/>
Others, 'tis own'd, in fields of battle shine,<br/>
But the first honours of this fight are mine;<br/>
For who excels in all? Then let my foe<br/>
Draw near, but first his certain fortune know;<br/>
Secure this hand shall his whole frame confound,<br/>
Mash all his bones, and all his body pound:<br/>
So let his friends be nigh, a needful train,<br/>
To heave the batter'd carcase off the plain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze<br/>
The host beheld him, silent with amaze!<br/>
'Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire<br/>
To meet his might, and emulate thy sire,<br/>
The great Mecistheus; who in days of yore<br/>
In Theban games the noblest trophy bore,<br/>
(The games ordain'd dead OEdipus to grace,)<br/>
And singly vanquish the Cadmean race.<br/>
Him great Tydides urges to contend,<br/>
Warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;<br/>
Officious with the cincture girds him round;<br/>
And to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.<br/>
Amid the circle now each champion stands,<br/>
And poises high in air his iron hands;<br/>
With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,<br/>
Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,<br/>
And painful sweat from all their members flows.<br/>
At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow<br/>
Full on the cheek of his unwary foe;<br/>
Beneath that ponderous arm's resistless sway<br/>
Down dropp'd he, nerveless, and extended lay.<br/>
As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,<br/>
By some huge billow dash'd against the shore,<br/>
Lies panting; not less batter'd with his wound,<br/>
The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.<br/>
To rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,<br/>
Scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;<br/>
Whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,<br/>
And dragging his disabled legs along;<br/>
Nodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o'er;<br/>
His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;<br/>
Wrapp'd round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;<br/>
His friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The third bold game Achilles next demands,<br/>
And calls the wrestlers to the level sands:<br/>
A massy tripod for the victor lies,<br/>
Of twice six oxen its reputed price;<br/>
And next, the loser's spirits to restore,<br/>
A female captive, valued but at four.<br/>
Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose<br/>
When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.<br/>
Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,<br/>
Embracing rigid with implicit hands.<br/>
Close lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd:<br/>
Below, their planted feet at distance fix'd;<br/>
Like two strong rafters which the builder forms,<br/>
Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,<br/>
Their tops connected, but at wider space<br/>
Fix'd on the centre stands their solid base.<br/>
Now to the grasp each manly body bends;<br/>
The humid sweat from every pore descends;<br/>
Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs<br/>
Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.<br/>
Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown'd,<br/>
O'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;<br/>
Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow<br/>
The watchful caution of his artful foe.<br/>
While the long strife even tired the lookers on,<br/>
Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:<br/>
"Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:<br/>
Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground<br/>
With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found<br/>
The strength to evade, and where the nerves combine<br/>
His ankle struck: the giant fell supine;<br/>
Ulysses, following, on his bosom lies;<br/>
Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.<br/>
Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;<br/>
He barely stirr'd him, but he could not raise:<br/>
His knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied;<br/>
And grappling close, they tumbled side by side.<br/>
Defiled with honourable dust they roll,<br/>
Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:<br/>
Again they rage, again to combat rise;<br/>
When great Achilles thus divides the prize:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;<br/>
Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.<br/>
Ye both have won: let others who excel,<br/>
Now prove that prowess you have proved so well."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The hero's words the willing chiefs obey,<br/>
From their tired bodies wipe the dust away,<br/>
And, clothed anew, the following games survey.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now succeed the gifts ordain'd to grace<br/>
The youths contending in the rapid race:<br/>
A silver urn that full six measures held,<br/>
By none in weight or workmanship excell'd:<br/>
Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,<br/>
Elaborate, with artifice divine;<br/>
Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,<br/>
And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:<br/>
From him descended, good Eunaeus heir'd<br/>
The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,<br/>
To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:<br/>
Now, the same hero's funeral rites to grace,<br/>
It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.<br/>
A well-fed ox was for the second placed;<br/>
And half a talent must content the last.<br/>
Achilles rising then bespoke the train:<br/>
"Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,<br/>
Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The hero said, and starting from his place,<br/>
Oilean Ajax rises to the race;<br/>
Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass'd<br/>
His youthful equals, Nestor's son, the last.<br/>
Ranged in a line the ready racers stand;<br/>
Pelides points the barrier with his hand;<br/>
All start at once; Oileus led the race;<br/>
The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;<br/>
Behind him, diligently close, he sped,<br/>
As closely following as the running thread<br/>
The spindle follows, and displays the charms<br/>
Of the fair spinster's breast and moving arms:<br/>
Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,<br/>
And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;<br/>
His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:<br/>
The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:<br/>
To him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,<br/>
And send their souls before him as he flies.<br/>
Now three times turn'd in prospect of the goal,<br/>
The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:<br/>
"Assist, O goddess!" thus in thought he pray'd!<br/>
And present at his thought descends the maid.<br/>
Buoy'd by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,<br/>
And feels a pinion lifting every limb.<br/>
All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,<br/>
Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain<br/>
(O'erturn'd by Pallas), where the slippery shore<br/>
Was clogg'd with slimy dung and mingled gore.<br/>
(The self-same place beside Patroclus' pyre,<br/>
Where late the slaughter'd victims fed the fire.)<br/>
Besmear'd with filth, and blotted o'er with clay,<br/>
Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;<br/>
The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,<br/>
And left the urn Ulysses' rich reward.<br/>
Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,<br/>
The baffled hero thus the Greeks address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;<br/>
A mortal I, a goddess was my foe;<br/>
She urged her favourite on the rapid way,<br/>
And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus sourly wail'd he, sputtering dirt and gore;<br/>
A burst of laughter echoed through the shore.<br/>
Antilochus, more humorous than the rest,<br/>
Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Why with our wiser elders should we strive?<br/>
The gods still love them, and they always thrive.<br/>
Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:<br/>
He to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;<br/>
(A green old age unconscious of decays,<br/>
That proves the hero born in better days!)<br/>
Behold his vigour in this active race!<br/>
Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:<br/>
For who can match Achilles? He who can,<br/>
Must yet be more than hero, more than man."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,<br/>
"Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.<br/>
Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll'd;<br/>
Receive a talent of the purest gold."<br/>
The youth departs content. The host admire<br/>
The son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;<br/>
Cast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:<br/>
Arms which of late divine Sarpedon wore,<br/>
And great Patroclus in short triumph bore.<br/>
"Stand forth the bravest of our host! (he cries)<br/>
Whoever dares deserve so rich a prize,<br/>
Now grace the lists before our army's sight,<br/>
And sheathed in steel, provoke his foe to fight.<br/>
Who first the jointed armour shall explore,<br/>
And stain his rival's mail with issuing gore,<br/>
The sword Asteropaeus possess'd of old,<br/>
(A Thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,)<br/>
Shall pay the stroke, and grace the striker's side:<br/>
These arms in common let the chiefs divide:<br/>
For each brave champion, when the combat ends,<br/>
A sumptuous banquet at our tents attends."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fierce at the word uprose great Tydeus' son,<br/>
And the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon.<br/>
Clad in refulgent steel, on either hand,<br/>
The dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand;<br/>
Louring they meet, tremendous to the sight;<br/>
Each Argive bosom beats with fierce delight.<br/>
Opposed in arms not long they idly stood,<br/>
But thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew'd.<br/>
A furious pass the spear of Ajax made<br/>
Through the broad shield, but at the corslet stay'd.<br/>
Not thus the foe: his javelin aim'd above<br/>
The buckler's margin, at the neck he drove.<br/>
But Greece, now trembling for her hero's life,<br/>
Bade share the honours, and surcease the strife.<br/>
Yet still the victor's due Tydides gains,<br/>
With him the sword and studded belt remains.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then hurl'd the hero, thundering on the ground,<br/>
A mass of iron (an enormous round),<br/>
Whose weight and size the circling Greeks admire,<br/>
Rude from the furnace, and but shaped by fire.<br/>
This mighty quoit Aetion wont to rear,<br/>
And from his whirling arm dismiss in air;<br/>
The giant by Achilles slain, he stow'd<br/>
Among his spoils this memorable load.<br/>
For this, he bids those nervous artists vie,<br/>
That teach the disk to sound along the sky.<br/>
"Let him, whose might can hurl this bowl, arise;<br/>
Who farthest hurls it, take it as his prize;<br/>
If he be one enrich'd with large domain<br/>
Of downs for flocks, and arable for grain,<br/>
Small stock of iron needs that man provide;<br/>
His hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied<br/>
From hence; nor ask the neighbouring city's aid<br/>
For ploughshares, wheels, and all the rural trade."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Stern Polypoetes stepp'd before the throng,<br/>
And great Leonteus, more than mortal strong;<br/>
Whose force with rival forces to oppose,<br/>
Uprose great Ajax; up Epeus rose.<br/>
Each stood in order: first Epeus threw;<br/>
High o'er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew.<br/>
Leonteus next a little space surpass'd;<br/>
And third, the strength of godlike Ajax cast.<br/>
O'er both their marks it flew; till fiercely flung<br/>
From Polypoetes' arm the discus sung:<br/>
Far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws,<br/>
That distant falls among the grazing cows,<br/>
So past them all the rapid circle flies:<br/>
His friends, while loud applauses shake the skies,<br/>
With force conjoin'd heave off the weighty prize.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Those, who in skilful archery contend,<br/>
He next invites the twanging bow to bend;<br/>
And twice ten axes casts amidst the round,<br/>
Ten double-edged, and ten that singly wound<br/>
The mast, which late a first-rate galley bore,<br/>
The hero fixes in the sandy shore;<br/>
To the tall top a milk-white dove they tie,<br/>
The trembling mark at which their arrows fly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird, shall bear<br/>
These two-edged axes, terrible in war;<br/>
The single, he whose shaft divides the cord."<br/>
He said: experienced Merion took the word;<br/>
And skilful Teucer: in the helm they threw<br/>
Their lots inscribed, and forth the latter flew.<br/>
Swift from the string the sounding arrow flies;<br/>
But flies unbless'd! No grateful sacrifice,<br/>
No firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow<br/>
To Phoebus, patron of the shaft and bow.<br/>
For this, thy well-aim'd arrow turn'd aside,<br/>
Err'd from the dove, yet cut the cord that tied:<br/>
Adown the mainmast fell the parted string,<br/>
And the free bird to heaven displays her wing:<br/>
Sea, shores, and skies, with loud applause resound,<br/>
And Merion eager meditates the wound:<br/>
He takes the bow, directs the shaft above,<br/>
And following with his eye the soaring dove,<br/>
Implores the god to speed it through the skies,<br/>
With vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrifice.<br/>
The dove, in airy circles as she wheels,<br/>
Amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels;<br/>
Quite through and through the point its passage found,<br/>
And at his feet fell bloody to the ground.<br/>
The wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last,<br/>
With flagging wings alighted on the mast,<br/>
A moment hung, and spread her pinions there,<br/>
Then sudden dropp'd, and left her life in air.<br/>
From the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise,<br/>
And to the ships brave Merion bears the prize.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To close the funeral games, Achilles last<br/>
A massy spear amid the circle placed,<br/>
And ample charger of unsullied frame,<br/>
With flowers high-wrought, not blacken'd yet by flame.<br/>
For these he bids the heroes prove their art,<br/>
Whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart.<br/>
Here too great Merion hopes the noble prize;<br/>
Nor here disdain'd the king of men to rise.<br/>
With joy Pelides saw the honour paid,<br/>
Rose to the monarch, and respectful said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thee first in virtue, as in power supreme,<br/>
O king of nations! all thy Greeks proclaim;<br/>
In every martial game thy worth attest,<br/>
And know thee both their greatest and their best.<br/>
Take then the prize, but let brave Merion bear<br/>
This beamy javelin in thy brother's war."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pleased from the hero's lips his praise to hear,<br/>
The king to Merion gives the brazen spear:<br/>
But, set apart for sacred use, commands<br/>
The glittering charger to Talthybius' hands.<br/>

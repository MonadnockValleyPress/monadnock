<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book VI</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
While thus the weary wanderer sunk to rest,<br/>
And peaceful slumbers calmed his anxious breast,<br/>
The martial maid from heaven's aërial height<br/>
Swift to Phæacia wing'd her rapid flight.<br/>
In elder times the soft Phæacian train<br/>
In ease possess'd the wide Hyperian plain;<br/>
Till the Cyclopæan race in arms arose,<br/>
A lawless nation of gigantic foes;<br/>
Then great Nausithous from Hyperia far,<br/>
Through seas retreating from the sounds of war,<br/>
The recreant nation to fair Scheria led,<br/>
Where never science rear'd her laurell'd head;<br/>
There round his tribes a strength of wall he raised;<br/>
To heaven the glittering domes and temples blazed;<br/>
Just to his realms, he parted grounds from grounds,<br/>
And shared the lands, and gave the lands their bounds.<br/>
Now in the silent grave the monarch lay,<br/>
And wise Alcinous held the legal sway.
</p>
<p>
To his high palace through the fields of air<br/>
The goddess shot; Ulysses was her care.<br/>
There, as the night in silence roll'd away,<br/>
A heaven of charms divine Nausicaa lay:<br/>
Through the thick gloom the shining portals blaze;<br/>
Two nymphs the portals guard, each nymph a Grace,<br/>
Light as the viewless air the warrior maid<br/>
Glides through the valves, and hovers round her head;<br/>
A favourite virgin's blooming form she took,<br/>
From Dymas sprung, and thus the vision spoke:
</p>
<p>
"Oh Indolent! to waste thy hours away!<br/>
And sleep'st thou careless of the bridal day!<br/>
Thy spousal ornament neglected lies;<br/>
Arise, prepare the bridal train, arise!<br/>
A just applause the cares of dress impart,<br/>
And give soft transport to a parent's heart.<br/>
Haste, to the limpid stream direct thy way,<br/>
When the gay morn unveils her smiling ray;<br/>
Haste to the stream! companion of thy care,<br/>
Lo, I thy steps attend, thy labours share.<br/>
Virgin, awake! the marriage hour is nigh,<br/>
See from their thrones thy kindred monarchs sigh!<br/>
The royal car at early dawn obtain,<br/>
And order mules obedient to the rein;<br/>
For rough the way, and distant rolls the wave,<br/>
Where their fair vests Phæacian virgins lave,<br/>
In pomp ride forth; for pomp becomes the great<br/>
And majesty derives a grace from state."<br/>
Then to the palaces of heaven she sails,<br/>
Incumbent on the wings of wafting gales;<br/>
The seat of gods; the regions mild of peace,<br/>
Full joy, and calm eternity of ease.<br/>
There no rude winds presume to shake the skies,<br/>
No rains descend, no snowy vapours rise;<br/>
But on immortal thrones the blest repose;<br/>
The firmament with living splendours glows.<br/>
Hither the goddess winged the aërial way,<br/>
Through heaven's eternal gates that blazed with day.
</p>
<p>
Now from her rosy car Aurora shed<br/>
The dawn, and all the orient flamed with red.<br/>
Up rose the virgin with the morning light,<br/>
Obedient to the vision of the night.<br/>
The queen she sought, the queen her hours bestowed<br/>
In curious works; the whirling spindle glow'd<br/>
With crimson threads, while busy damsels call<br/>
The snowy fleece, or twist the purpled wool.<br/>
Meanwhile Phæacia's peers in council sate;<br/>
From his high dome the king descends in state;<br/>
Then with a filial awe the royal maid<br/>
Approach'd him passing, and submissive said:
</p>
<p>
"Will my dread sire his ear regardful deign,<br/>
And may his child the royal car obtain?<br/>
Say, with my garments shall I bend my way?<br/>
Where through the vales the mazy waters stray?<br/>
A dignity of dress adorns the great,<br/>
And kings draw lustre from the robe of state.<br/>
Five sons thou hast; three wait the bridal day.<br/>
And spotless robes become the young and gay;<br/>
So when with praise amid the dance they shine,<br/>
By these my cares adorn'd that praise is mine."
</p>
<p>
Thus she: but blushes ill-restrain'd betray<br/>
Her thoughts intentive on the bridal day,<br/>
The conscious sire the dawning blush survey'd,<br/>
And, smiling, thus bespoke the blooming maid<br/>
"My child, my darling joy, the car receive;<br/>
That, and whate'er our daughter asks, we give."<br/>
Swift at the royal nod the attending train<br/>
The car prepare, the mules incessant rein,<br/>
The blooming virgin with despatchful cares<br/>
Tunics, and stoles, and robes imperial, bears.<br/>
The queen, assiduous to her train assigns<br/>
The sumptuous viands, and the flavorous wines.<br/>
The train prepare a cruse of curious mould,<br/>
A cruse of fragrance, form'd of burnish'd gold;<br/>
Odour divine! whose soft refreshing streams<br/>
Sleek the smooth skin, and scent the snowy limbs.
</p>
<p>
Now mounting the gay seat, the silken reins<br/>
Shine in her hand; along the sounding plains<br/>
Swift fly the mules; nor rode the nymph alone;<br/>
Around, a bevy of bright damsels shone.<br/>
They seek the cisterns where Phæacian dames<br/>
Wash their fair garments in the limpid streams;<br/>
Where, gathering into depth from falling rills,<br/>
The lucid wave a spacious bason fills.<br/>
The mules, unharness'd, range beside the main,<br/>
Or crop the verdant herbage of the plain.
</p>
<p>
Then emulous the royal robes they lave,<br/>
And plunge the vestures in the cleansing wave<br/>
(The vestures cleansed o'erspread the shelly sand,<br/>
Their snowy lustre whitens all the strand);<br/>
Then with a short repast relieve their toil,<br/>
And o'er their limbs diffuse ambrosial oil;<br/>
And while the robes imbibe the solar ray,<br/>
O'er the green mead the sporting virgins play<br/>
(Their shining veils unbound). Along the skies,<br/>
Toss'd and retoss'd, the ball incessant flies.<br/>
They sport, they feast; Nausicaa lifts her voice,<br/>
And, warbling sweet, makes earth and heaven rejoice.
</p>
<p>
As when o'er Erymanth Diana roves,<br/>
Or wide Täygetus' resounding groves;<br/>
A sylvan train the huntress queen surrounds,<br/>
Her rattling quiver from her shoulders sounds:<br/>
Fierce in the sport, along the mountain's brow<br/>
They bay the boar, or chase the bounding roe;<br/>
High o'er the lawn, with more majestic pace,<br/>
Above the nymphs she treads with stately grace;<br/>
Distinguish'd excellence the goddess proves;<br/>
Exults Latona as the virgin moves.<br/>
With equal grace Nausicaa trod the plain,<br/>
And shone transcendent o'er the beauteous train.
</p>
<p>
Meantime (the care and favourite of the skies<br/>
Wrapp'd in imbowering shade, Ulysses lies,<br/>
His woes forgot! but Pallas now address'd<br/>
To break the bands of all-composing rest.<br/>
Forth from her snowy hand Nausicaa threw<br/>
The various ball; the ball erroneous flew<br/>
And swam the stream; loud shrieks the virgin train,<br/>
And the loud shriek redoubles from the main.<br/>
Waked by the shrilling sound, Ulysses rose,<br/>
And, to the deaf woods wailing, breathed his woes:
</p>
<p>
"Ah me! on what inhospitable coast,<br/>
On what new region is Ulysses toss'd;<br/>
Possess'd by wild barbarians fierce in arms;<br/>
Or men, whose bosom tender pity warms?<br/>
What sounds are these that gather from he shores?<br/>
The voice of nymphs that haunt the sylvan bowers,<br/>
The fair-hair'd Dryads of the shady wood;<br/>
Or azure daughters of the silver flood;<br/>
Or human voice? but issuing from the shades,<br/>
Why cease I straight to learn what sound invades?"
</p>
<p>
Then, where the grove with leaves umbrageous bends,<br/>
With forceful strength a branch the hero rends;<br/>
Around his loins the verdant cincture spreads<br/>
A wreathy foliage and concealing shades.<br/>
As when a lion in the midnight hours,<br/>
Beat by rude blasts, and wet with wintry showers,<br/>
Descends terrific from the mountains brow;<br/>
With living flames his rolling eye balls glow;<br/>
With conscious strength elate, he bends his way,<br/>
Majestically fierce, to seize his prey<br/>
(The steer or stag;) or, with keen hunger bold,<br/>
Spring o'er the fence and dissipates the fold.<br/>
No less a terror, from the neighbouring groves<br/>
(Rough from the tossing surge) Ulysses moves;<br/>
Urged on by want, and recent from the storms;<br/>
The brackish ooze his manly grace deforms.<br/>
Wide o'er the shore with many a piercing cry<br/>
To rocks, to caves, the frightened virgins fly;<br/>
All but the nymph; the nymph stood fix'd alone,<br/>
By Pallas arm'd with boldness not her own.<br/>
Meantime in dubious thought the king awaits,<br/>
And, self-considering, as he stands, debates;<br/>
Distant his mournful story to declare,<br/>
Or prostrate at her knee address the prayer.<br/>
But fearful to offend, by wisdom sway'd,<br/>
At awful distance he accosts the maid:
</p>
<p>
"If from the skies a goddess, or if earth<br/>
(Imperial virgin) boast thy glorious birth,<br/>
To thee I bend! If in that bright disguise<br/>
Thou visit earth, a daughter of the skies,<br/>
Hail, Dian, hail! the huntress of the groves<br/>
So shines majestic, and so stately moves,<br/>
So breathes an air divine! But if thy race<br/>
Be mortal, and this earth thy native place,<br/>
Blest is the father from whose loins you sprung,<br/>
Blest is the mother at whose breast you hung.<br/>
Blest are the brethren who thy blood divide,<br/>
To such a miracle of charms allied:<br/>
Joyful they see applauding princes gaze,<br/>
When stately in the dance you swim the harmonious maze.<br/>
But blest o'er all, the youth with heavenly charms,<br/>
Who clasps the bright perfection in his arms!<br/>
Never, I never view'd till this blest hour<br/>
Such finish'd grace! I gaze, and I adore!<br/>
Thus seems the palm with stately honours crown'd<br/>
By Phœbus' altars; thus o'erlooks the ground;<br/>
The pride of Delos. (By the Delian coast,<br/>
I voyaged, leader of a warrior-host,<br/>
But ah, how changed! from thence my sorrow flows;<br/>
O fatal voyage, source of all my woes;)<br/>
Raptured I stood, and as this hour amazed,<br/>
With reverence at the lofty wonder gazed:<br/>
Raptured I stand! for earth ne'er knew to bear<br/>
A plant so stately, or a nymph so fair.<br/>
Awed from access, I lift my suppliant hands;<br/>
For Misery, O queen! before thee stands.<br/>
Twice ten tempestuous nights I roll'd, resign'd<br/>
To roaring billows, and the warring wind;<br/>
Heaven bade the deep to spare; but heaven, my foe,<br/>
Spares only to inflict some mightier woe.<br/>
Inured to cares, to death in all its forms;<br/>
Outcast I rove, familiar with the storms.<br/>
Once more I view the face of human kind:<br/>
Oh let soft pity touch thy generous mind!<br/>
Unconscious of what air I breathe, I stand<br/>
Naked, defenceless on a narrow land.<br/>
Propitious to my wants a vest supply<br/>
To guard the wretched from the inclement sky:<br/>
So may the gods, who heaven and earth control,<br/>
Crown the chaste wishes of thy virtuous soul,<br/>
On thy soft hours their choicest blessings shed;<br/>
Blest with a husband be thy bridal bed;<br/>
Blest be thy husband with a blooming race,<br/>
And lasting union crown your blissful days.<br/>
The gods, when they supremely bless, bestow<br/>
Firm union on their favourites below;<br/>
Then envy grieves, with inly-pining hate;<br/>
The good exult, and heaven is in our state."
</p>
<p>
To whom the nymph: "O stranger, cease thy care;<br/>
Wise is thy soul, but man is born to bear;<br/>
Jove weighs affairs of earth in dubious scales,<br/>
And the good suffers, while the bad prevails.<br/>
Bear, with a soul resign'd, the will of Jove;<br/>
Who breathes, must mourn: thy woes are from above.<br/>
But since thou tread'st our hospitable shore,<br/>
'Tis mine to bid the wretched grieve no more,<br/>
To clothe the naked, and thy way to guide.<br/>
Know, the Phæacian tribes this land divide;<br/>
From great Alcinous' royal loins I spring,<br/>
A happy nation, and a happy king."
</p>
<p>
Then to her maids: "Why, why, ye coward train,<br/>
These fears, this flight? ye fear, and fly in vain.<br/>
Dread ye a foe? dismiss that idle dread,<br/>
'Tis death with hostile step these shores to tread;<br/>
Safe in the love of heaven, an ocean flows<br/>
Around our realm, a barrier from the foes;<br/>
'Tis ours this son of sorrow to relieve,<br/>
Cheer the sad heart, nor let affliction grieve.<br/>
By Jove the stranger and the poor are sent;<br/>
And what to those we give to Jove is lent.<br/>
Then food supply, and bathe his fainting limbs<br/>
Where waving shades obscure the mazy streams."
</p>
<p>
Obedient to the call, the chief they guide<br/>
To the calm current of the secret tide;<br/>
Close by the stream a royal dress they lay,<br/>
A vest and robe, with rich embroidery gay;<br/>
Then unguents in a vase of gold supply,<br/>
That breathed a fragrance through the balmy sky.
</p>
<p>
To them the king: "No longer I detain<br/>
Your friendly care: retire, ye virgin train!<br/>
Retire, while from my wearied limbs I lave<br/>
The foul pollution of the briny wave.<br/>
Ye gods! since this worn frame refection knew,<br/>
What scenes have I surveyed of dreadful view!<br/>
But, nymphs, recede! sage chastity denies<br/>
To raise the blush, or pain the modest eyes."
</p>
<p>
The nymphs withdrawn, at once into the tide<br/>
Active he bounds; the flashing waves divide<br/>
O'er all his limbs his hands the waves diffuse,<br/>
And from his locks compress the weedy ooze;<br/>
The balmy oil, a fragrant shower, be sheds;<br/>
Then, dressed, in pomp magnificently treads.<br/>
The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine<br/>
With majesty enlarged, and air divine:<br/>
Back from his brows a length of hair unfurls,<br/>
His hyacinthine locks descend in wavy curls.<br/>
As by some artist, to whom Vulcan gives<br/>
His skill divine, a breathing statue lives;<br/>
By Pallas taught, he frames the wondrous mould,<br/>
And o'er the silver pours the fusile gold<br/>
So Pallas his heroic frame improves<br/>
With heavenly bloom, and like a god he moves.<br/>
A fragrance breathes around; majestic grace<br/>
Attends his steps: the astonished virgins gaze.<br/>
Soft he reclines along the murmuring seas,<br/>
Inhaling freshness from the fanning breeze.
</p>
<p>
The wondering nymph his glorious port survey'd,<br/>
And to her damsels, with amazement, said:
</p>
<p>
"Not without care divine the stranger treads<br/>
This land of joy; his steps some godhead leads:<br/>
Would Jove destroy him, sure he had been driven<br/>
Far from this realm, the favourite isle of heaven.<br/>
Late, a sad spectacle of woe, he trod<br/>
The desert sands, and now he looks a god.<br/>
Oh heaven! in my connubial hour decree<br/>
This man my spouse, or such a spouse as he!<br/>
But haste, the viands and the bowl provide."<br/>
The maids the viands and the bowl supplied:<br/>
Eager he fed, for keen his hunger raged,<br/>
And with the generous vintage thirst assuaged.
</p>
<p>
Now on return her care Nausicaa bends,<br/>
The robes resumes, the glittering car ascends,<br/>
Far blooming o'er the field; and as she press'd<br/>
The splendid seat, the listening chief address'd:
</p>
<p>
"Stranger, arise! the sun rolls down the day.<br/>
Lo, to the palace I direct thy way;<br/>
Where, in high state, the nobles of the land<br/>
Attend my royal sire, a radiant band<br/>
But hear, though wisdom in thy soul presides,<br/>
Speaks from thy tongue, and every action guides;<br/>
Advance at distance, while I pass the plain<br/>
Where o'er the furrows waves the golden grain;<br/>
Alone I reascend&mdash;With airy mounds<br/>
A strength of wall the guarded city bounds;<br/>
The jutting land two ample bays divides:<br/>
Full through the narrow mouths descend the tides;<br/>
The spacious basons arching rocks enclose,<br/>
A sure defence from every storm that blows.<br/>
Close to the bay great Neptune's fane adjoins;<br/>
And near, a forum flank'd with marble shines,<br/>
Where the bold youth, the numerous fleets to store,<br/>
Shape the broad sail, or smooth the taper oar:<br/>
For not the bow they bend, nor boast the skill<br/>
To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill;<br/>
But the tall mast above the vessel rear,<br/>
Or teach the fluttering sail to float in air.<br/>
They rush into the deep with eager joy,<br/>
Climb the steep surge, and through the tempest fly;<br/>
A proud, unpolish'd race&mdash;To me belongs<br/>
The care to shun the blast of slanderous tongues;<br/>
Lest malice, prone the virtuous to defame,<br/>
Thus with wild censure taint my spotless name:<br/>
'What stranger this whom thus Nausicaa leads!<br/>
Heavens, with what graceful majesty he treads!<br/>
Perhaps a native of some distant shore,<br/>
The future consort of her bridal hour:<br/>
Or rather some descendant of the skies;<br/>
Won by her prayer, the aërial bridegroom flies,<br/>
Heaven on that hour its choicest influence shed,<br/>
That gave a foreign spouse to crown her bed!<br/>
All, all the godlike worthies that adorn<br/>
This realm, she flies: Phæacia is her scorn.'<br/>
And just the blame: for female innocence<br/>
Not only flies the guilt, but shuns the offence:<br/>
The unguarded virgin, as unchaste, I blame;<br/>
And the least freedom with the sex is shame,<br/>
Till our consenting sires a spouse provide,<br/>
And public nuptials justify the bride,<br/>
But would'st thou soon review thy native plain?<br/>
Attend, and speedy thou shalt pass the main:<br/>
Nigh where a grove with verdant poplars crown'd,<br/>
To Pallas sacred, shades the holy ground,<br/>
We bend our way; a bubbling fount distills<br/>
A lucid lake, and thence descends in rills;<br/>
Around the grove, a mead with lively green<br/>
Falls by degrees, and forms a beauteous scene;<br/>
Here a rich juice the royal vineyard pours;<br/>
And there the garden yields a waste of flowers.<br/>
Hence lies the town, as far as to the ear<br/>
Floats a strong shout along the waves of air.<br/>
There wait embower'd, while I ascend alone<br/>
To great Alcinous on his royal throne.<br/>
Arrived, advance, impatient of delay,<br/>
And to the lofty palace bend thy way:<br/>
The lofty palace overlooks the town,<br/>
From every dome by pomp superior known;<br/>
A child may point the way. With earnest gait<br/>
Seek thou the queen along the rooms of state;<br/>
Her royal hand a wondrous work designs,<br/>
Around a circle of bright damsels shines;<br/>
Part twist the threads, and part the wool dispose,<br/>
While with the purple orb the spindle glows.<br/>
High on a throne, amid the Scherian powers,<br/>
My royal father shares the genial hours:<br/>
But to the queen thy mournful tale disclose,<br/>
With the prevailing eloquence of woes:<br/>
So shalt thou view with joy thy natal shore,<br/>
Though mountains rise between and oceans roar."
</p>
<p>
She added not, but waving, as she wheel'd,<br/>
The silver scourge, it glitter'd o'er the field;<br/>
With skill the virgin guides the embroider'd rein,<br/>
Slow rolls the car before the attending train,<br/>
Now whirling down the heavens, the golden day<br/>
Shot through the western clouds a dewy ray;<br/>
The grove they reach, where, from the sacred shade,<br/>
To Pallas thus the pensive hero pray'd:
</p>
<p>
"Daughter of Jove! whose arms in thunder wield<br/>
The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield;<br/>
Forsook by thee, in vain I sought thy aid<br/>
When booming billows closed above my bead;<br/>
Attend, unconquer'd maid! accord my vows,<br/>
Bid the Great hear, and pitying, heal my woes."
</p>
<p>
This heard Minerva, but forbore to fly<br/>
(By Neptune awed) apparent from the sky;<br/>
Stern god! who raged with vengeance, unrestrain'd.<br/>
Till great Ulysses hail'd his native land.

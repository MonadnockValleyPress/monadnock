<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XI</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
And now to Xanthus' gliding stream they drove,<br/>
Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.<br/>
The river here divides the flying train,<br/>
Part to the town fly diverse o'er the plain,<br/>
Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,<br/>
Now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:<br/>
(These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds,<br/>
And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)<br/>
Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars,<br/>
The flashing billows beat the whiten'd shores:<br/>
With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,<br/>
And here, and there, in eddies whirling round,<br/>
The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown'd.<br/>
As the scorch'd locusts from their fields retire,<br/>
While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;<br/>
Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,<br/>
The clustering legions rush into the flood:<br/>
So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles' force,<br/>
Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.<br/>
His bloody lance the hero casts aside,<br/>
(Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)<br/>
Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,<br/>
Arm'd with his sword, high brandish'd o'er the waves:<br/>
Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,<br/>
Deep groan'd the waters with the dying sound;<br/>
Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,<br/>
And the warm purple circled on the tide.<br/>
Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,<br/>
And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:<br/>
So the huge dolphin tempesting the main,<br/>
In shoals before him fly the scaly train,<br/>
Confusedly heap'd they seek their inmost caves,<br/>
Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.<br/>
Now, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band<br/>
Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;<br/>
With their rich belts their captive arms restrains<br/>
(Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).<br/>
These his attendants to the ships convey'd,<br/>
Sad victims destined to Patroclus' shade;<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, as once more he plunged amid the flood,<br/>
The young Lycaon in his passage stood;<br/>
The son of Priam; whom the hero's hand<br/>
But late made captive in his father's land<br/>
(As from a sycamore, his sounding steel<br/>
Lopp'd the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel)<br/>
To Lemnos' isle he sold the royal slave,<br/>
Where Jason's son the price demanded gave;<br/>
But kind Eetion, touching on the shore,<br/>
The ransom'd prince to fair Arisbe bore.<br/>
Ten days were past, since in his father's reign<br/>
He felt the sweets of liberty again;<br/>
The next, that god whom men in vain withstand<br/>
Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand<br/>
Now never to return! and doom'd to go<br/>
A sadder journey to the shades below.<br/>
His well-known face when great Achilles eyed,<br/>
(The helm and visor he had cast aside<br/>
With wild affright, and dropp'd upon the field<br/>
His useless lance and unavailing shield,)<br/>
As trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,<br/>
And knock'd his faltering knees, the hero said:<br/>
"Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!<br/>
Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?<br/>
Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans kill'd<br/>
Rise from the shades, and brave me on the field;<br/>
As now the captive, whom so late I bound<br/>
And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!<br/>
Not him the sea's unmeasured deeps detain,<br/>
That bar such numbers from their native plain;<br/>
Lo! he returns. Try, then, my flying spear!<br/>
Try, if the grave can hold the wanderer;<br/>
If earth, at length this active prince can seize,<br/>
Earth, whose strong grasp has held down Hercules."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus while he spoke, the Trojan pale with fears<br/>
Approach'd, and sought his knees with suppliant tears<br/>
Loth as he was to yield his youthful breath,<br/>
And his soul shivering at the approach of death.<br/>
Achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;<br/>
He kiss'd his feet, extended on the ground:<br/>
And while, above, the spear suspended stood,<br/>
Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,<br/>
One hand embraced them close, one stopp'd the dart,<br/>
While thus these melting words attempt his heart:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thy well-known captive, great Achilles! see,<br/>
Once more Lycaon trembles at thy knee.<br/>
Some pity to a suppliant's name afford,<br/>
Who shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board;<br/>
Whom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore,<br/>
Far from his father, friends, and native shore;<br/>
A hundred oxen were his price that day,<br/>
Now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.<br/>
Scarce respited from woes I yet appear,<br/>
And scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here;<br/>
Lo! Jove again submits me to thy hands,<br/>
Again, her victim cruel Fate demands!<br/>
I sprang from Priam, and Laothoe fair,<br/>
(Old Altes' daughter, and Lelegia's heir;<br/>
Who held in Pedasus his famed abode,<br/>
And ruled the fields where silver Satnio flow'd,)<br/>
Two sons (alas! unhappy sons) she bore;<br/>
For ah! one spear shall drink each brother's gore,<br/>
And I succeed to slaughter'd Polydore.<br/>
How from that arm of terror shall I fly?<br/>
Some demon urges! 'tis my doom to die!<br/>
If ever yet soft pity touch'd thy mind,<br/>
Ah! think not me too much of Hector's kind!<br/>
Not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,<br/>
With his, who wrought thy loved Patroclus' death."<br/>
</p>
<p>
These words, attended with a shower of tears,<br/>
The youth address'd to unrelenting ears:<br/>
"Talk not of life, or ransom (he replies):<br/>
Patroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies:<br/>
In vain a single Trojan sues for grace;<br/>
But least, the sons of Priam's hateful race.<br/>
Die then, my friend! what boots it to deplore?<br/>
The great, the good Patroclus is no more!<br/>
He, far thy better, was foredoom'd to die,<br/>
And thou, dost thou bewail mortality?<br/>
Seest thou not me, whom nature's gifts adorn,<br/>
Sprung from a hero, from a goddess born?<br/>
The day shall come (which nothing can avert)<br/>
When by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,<br/>
By night, or day, by force, or by design,<br/>
Impending death and certain fate are mine!<br/>
Die then,"â€”He said; and as the word he spoke,<br/>
The fainting stripling sank before the stroke:<br/>
His hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,<br/>
While all his trembling frame confess'd his fear:<br/>
Sudden, Achilles his broad sword display'd,<br/>
And buried in his neck the reeking blade.<br/>
Prone fell the youth; and panting on the land,<br/>
The gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.<br/>
The victor to the stream the carcase gave,<br/>
And thus insults him, floating on the wave:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround<br/>
Thy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound:<br/>
There no sad mother shall thy funerals weep,<br/>
But swift Scamander roll thee to the deep,<br/>
Whose every wave some watery monster brings,<br/>
To feast unpunish'd on the fat of kings.<br/>
So perish Troy, and all the Trojan line!<br/>
Such ruin theirs, and such compassion mine.<br/>
What boots ye now Scamander's worshipp'd stream,<br/>
His earthly honours, and immortal name?<br/>
In vain your immolated bulls are slain,<br/>
Your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!<br/>
Thus he rewards you, with this bitter fate;<br/>
Thus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete:<br/>
Thus is atoned Patroclus' honour'd shade,<br/>
And the short absence of Achilles paid."<br/>
</p>
<p>
These boastful words provoked the raging god;<br/>
With fury swells the violated flood.<br/>
What means divine may yet the power employ<br/>
To check Achilles, and to rescue Troy?<br/>
Meanwhile the hero springs in arms, to dare<br/>
The great Asteropeus to mortal war;<br/>
The son of Pelagon, whose lofty line<br/>
Flows from the source of Axius, stream divine!<br/>
(Fair Peribaea's love the god had crown'd,<br/>
With all his refluent waters circled round:)<br/>
On him Achilles rush'd; he fearless stood,<br/>
And shook two spears, advancing from the flood;<br/>
The flood impell'd him, on Pelides' head<br/>
To avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.<br/>
Near as they drew, Achilles thus began:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?<br/>
Who, or from whence? Unhappy is the sire<br/>
Whose son encounters our resistless ire."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O son of Peleus! what avails to trace<br/>
(Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?<br/>
From rich Paeonia's valleys I command,<br/>
Arm'd with protended spears, my native band;<br/>
Now shines the tenth bright morning since I came<br/>
In aid of Ilion to the fields of fame:<br/>
Axius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,<br/>
And wide around the floated region fills,<br/>
Begot my sire, whose spear much glory won:<br/>
Now lift thy arm, and try that hero's son!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Threatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;<br/>
At once Asteropeus discharged each lance,<br/>
(For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)<br/>
One struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield;<br/>
One razed Achilles' hand; the spouting blood<br/>
Spun forth; in earth the fasten'd weapon stood.<br/>
Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:<br/>
Its erring fury hiss'd along the skies;<br/>
Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,<br/>
Even to the middle earth; and quiver'd there.<br/>
Then from his side the sword Pelides drew,<br/>
And on his foe with double fury flew.<br/>
The foe thrice tugg'd, and shook the rooted wood;<br/>
Repulsive of his might the weapon stood:<br/>
The fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain;<br/>
Bent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;<br/>
His belly open'd with a ghastly wound,<br/>
The reeking entrails pour upon the ground.<br/>
Beneath the hero's feet he panting lies,<br/>
And his eye darkens, and his spirit flies;<br/>
While the proud victor thus triumphing said,<br/>
His radiant armour tearing from the dead:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"So ends thy glory! Such the fate they prove,<br/>
Who strive presumptuous with the sons of Jove!<br/>
Sprung from a river, didst thou boast thy line?<br/>
But great Saturnius is the source of mine.<br/>
How durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?<br/>
Of Peleus, Ã†acus, and Jove, am I.<br/>
The race of these superior far to those,<br/>
As he that thunders to the stream that flows.<br/>
What rivers can, Scamander might have shown;<br/>
But Jove he dreads, nor wars against his son.<br/>
Even Achelous might contend in vain,<br/>
And all the roaring billows of the main.<br/>
The eternal ocean, from whose fountains flow<br/>
The seas, the rivers, and the springs below,<br/>
The thundering voice of Jove abhors to hear,<br/>
And in his deep abysses shakes with fear."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: then from the bank his javelin tore,<br/>
And left the breathless warrior in his gore.<br/>
The floating tides the bloody carcase lave,<br/>
And beat against it, wave succeeding wave;<br/>
Till, roll'd between the banks, it lies the food<br/>
Of curling eels, and fishes of the flood.<br/>
All scatter'd round the stream (their mightiest slain)<br/>
The amazed Paeonians scour along the plain;<br/>
He vents his fury on the flying crew,<br/>
Thrasius, Astyplus, and Mnesus slew;<br/>
Mydon, Thersilochus, with Ã†nius, fell;<br/>
And numbers more his lance had plunged to hell,<br/>
But from the bottom of his gulfs profound<br/>
Scamander spoke; the shores return'd the sound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O first of mortals! (for the gods are thine)<br/>
In valour matchless, and in force divine!<br/>
If Jove have given thee every Trojan head,<br/>
'Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.<br/>
See! my choked streams no more their course can keep,<br/>
Nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.<br/>
Turn then, impetuous! from our injured flood;<br/>
Content, thy slaughters could amaze a god."<br/>
</p>
<p>
In human form, confess'd before his eyes,<br/>
The river thus; and thus the chief replies:<br/>
"O sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;<br/>
But not till Troy the destined vengeance pay,<br/>
Not till within her towers the perjured train<br/>
Shall pant, and tremble at our arms again;<br/>
Not till proud Hector, guardian of her wall,<br/>
Or stain this lance, or see Achilles fall."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; and drove with fury on the foe.<br/>
Then to the godhead of the silver bow<br/>
The yellow flood began: "O son of Jove!<br/>
Was not the mandate of the sire above<br/>
Full and express, that Phoebus should employ<br/>
His sacred arrows in defence of Troy,<br/>
And make her conquer, till Hyperion's fall<br/>
In awful darkness hide the face of all?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke in vainâ€”The chief without dismay<br/>
Ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.<br/>
Then rising in his rage above the shores,<br/>
From all his deep the bellowing river roars,<br/>
Huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,<br/>
And round the banks the ghastly dead are toss'd.<br/>
While all before, the billows ranged on high,<br/>
(A watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly.<br/>
Now bursting on his head with thundering sound,<br/>
The falling deluge whelms the hero round:<br/>
His loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;<br/>
His feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,<br/>
Sliddering, and staggering. On the border stood<br/>
A spreading elm, that overhung the flood;<br/>
He seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;<br/>
The plant uprooted to his weight gave way.<br/>
Heaving the bank, and undermining all;<br/>
Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall<br/>
Of the thick foliage. The large trunk display'd<br/>
Bridged the rough flood across: the hero stay'd<br/>
On this his weight, and raised upon his hand,<br/>
Leap'd from the channel, and regain'd the land.<br/>
Then blacken'd the wild waves: the murmur rose:<br/>
The god pursues, a huger billow throws,<br/>
And bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy<br/>
The man whose fury is the fate of Troy.<br/>
He like the warlike eagle speeds his pace<br/>
(Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);<br/>
Far as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;<br/>
At every bound his clanging armour rings:<br/>
Now here, now there, he turns on every side,<br/>
And winds his course before the following tide;<br/>
The waves flow after, wheresoe'er he wheels,<br/>
And gather fast, and murmur at his heels.<br/>
So when a peasant to his garden brings<br/>
Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,<br/>
And calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,<br/>
And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:<br/>
Soon as he clears whate'er their passage stay'd,<br/>
And marks the future current with his spade,<br/>
Swift o'er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,<br/>
Louder and louder purl the falling rills;<br/>
Before him scattering, they prevent his pains,<br/>
And shine in mazy wanderings o'er the plains.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Still flies Achilles, but before his eyes<br/>
Still swift Scamander rolls where'er he flies:<br/>
Not all his speed escapes the rapid floods;<br/>
The first of men, but not a match for gods.<br/>
Oft as he turn'd the torrent to oppose,<br/>
And bravely try if all the powers were foes;<br/>
So oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,<br/>
Beats on his back, or bursts upon his head.<br/>
Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,<br/>
And still indignant bounds above the waves.<br/>
Tired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;<br/>
Wash'd from beneath him slides the slimy soil;<br/>
When thus (his eyes on heaven's expansion thrown)<br/>
Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Is there no god Achilles to befriend,<br/>
No power to avert his miserable end?<br/>
Prevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,<br/>
And make my future life the sport of fate.<br/>
Of all heaven's oracles believed in vain,<br/>
But most of Thetis must her son complain;<br/>
By Phoebus' darts she prophesied my fall,<br/>
In glorious arms before the Trojan wall.<br/>
Oh! had I died in fields of battle warm,<br/>
Stretch'd like a hero, by a hero's arm!<br/>
Might Hector's spear this dauntless bosom rend,<br/>
And my swift soul o'ertake my slaughter'd friend.<br/>
Ah no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,<br/>
Oh how unworthy of the brave and great!<br/>
Like some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,<br/>
Crossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,<br/>
An unregarded carcase to the sea."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Neptune and Pallas haste to his relief,<br/>
And thus in human form address'd the chief:<br/>
The power of ocean first: "Forbear thy fear,<br/>
O son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!<br/>
Behold! from Jove descending to thy aid,<br/>
Propitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.<br/>
Stay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave<br/>
'Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.<br/>
But thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!<br/>
Nor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,<br/>
Till Troy receive her flying sons, till all<br/>
Her routed squadrons pant behind their wall:<br/>
Hector alone shall stand his fatal chance,<br/>
And Hector's blood shall smoke upon thy lance.<br/>
Thine is the glory doom'd." Thus spake the gods:<br/>
Then swift ascended to the bright abodes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Stung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell'd,<br/>
He springs impetuous, and invades the field:<br/>
O'er all the expanded plain the waters spread;<br/>
Heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,<br/>
Floating 'midst scatter'd arms; while casques of gold<br/>
And turn'd-up bucklers glitter'd as they roll'd.<br/>
High o'er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,<br/>
He wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.<br/>
Not a whole river stops the hero's course,<br/>
While Pallas fills him with immortal force.<br/>
With equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,<br/>
And lifts his billows, and o'erwhelms his shores.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus to Simois! "Haste, my brother flood;<br/>
And check this mortal that controls a god;<br/>
Our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,<br/>
And Ilion tumble from her towery height.<br/>
Call then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,<br/>
From all thy fountains swell thy watery store,<br/>
With broken rocks, and with a load of dead,<br/>
Charge the black surge, and pour it on his head.<br/>
Mark how resistless through the floods he goes,<br/>
And boldly bids the warring gods be foes!<br/>
But nor that force, nor form divine to sight,<br/>
Shall aught avail him, if our rage unite:<br/>
Whelm'd under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,<br/>
That blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;<br/>
And deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl'd,<br/>
Immersed remain this terror of the world.<br/>
Such ponderous ruin shall confound the place,<br/>
No Greeks shall e'er his perish'd relics grace,<br/>
No hand his bones shall gather, or inhume;<br/>
These his cold rites, and this his watery tomb."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; and on the chief descends amain,<br/>
Increased with gore, and swelling with the slain.<br/>
Then, murmuring from his beds, he boils, he raves,<br/>
And a foam whitens on the purple waves:<br/>
At every step, before Achilles stood<br/>
The crimson surge, and deluged him with blood.<br/>
Fear touch'd the queen of heaven: she saw dismay'd,<br/>
She call'd aloud, and summon'd Vulcan's aid.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Rise to the war! the insulting flood requires<br/>
Thy wasteful arm! assemble all thy fires!<br/>
While to their aid, by our command enjoin'd,<br/>
Rush the swift eastern and the western wind:<br/>
These from old ocean at my word shall blow,<br/>
Pour the red torrent on the watery foe,<br/>
Corses and arms to one bright ruin turn,<br/>
And hissing rivers to their bottoms burn.<br/>
Go, mighty in thy rage! display thy power,<br/>
Drink the whole flood, the crackling trees devour.<br/>
Scorch all the banks! and (till our voice reclaim)<br/>
Exert the unwearied furies of the flame!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The power ignipotent her word obeys:<br/>
Wide o'er the plain he pours the boundless blaze;<br/>
At once consumes the dead, and dries the soil<br/>
And the shrunk waters in their channel boil.<br/>
As when autumnal Boreas sweeps the sky,<br/>
And instant blows the water'd gardens dry:<br/>
So look'd the field, so whiten'd was the ground,<br/>
While Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.<br/>
Swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys;<br/>
Along the margin winds the running blaze:<br/>
The trees in flaming rows to ashes turn,<br/>
The flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn,<br/>
Broad elm, and cypress rising in a spire;<br/>
The watery willows hiss before the fire.<br/>
Now glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,<br/>
The eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:<br/>
Now flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,<br/>
Or, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.<br/>
At length the river rear'd his languid head,<br/>
And thus, short-panting, to the god he said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Oh Vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?<br/>
I faint, I sink, unequal to the fightâ€”<br/>
I yieldâ€”Let Ilion fall; if fate decreeâ€”<br/>
Ahâ€”bend no more thy fiery arms on me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;<br/>
The bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.<br/>
As when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,<br/>
To melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,<br/>
Amid the fierce embrace of circling fires<br/>
The waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires:<br/>
So boils the imprison'd flood, forbid to flow,<br/>
And choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.<br/>
To Juno then, imperial queen of air,<br/>
The burning river sends his earnest prayer:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ah why, Saturnia; must thy son engage<br/>
Me, only me, with all his wasteful rage?<br/>
On other gods his dreadful arm employ,<br/>
For mightier gods assert the cause of Troy.<br/>
Submissive I desist, if thou command;<br/>
But ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.<br/>
Hear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate<br/>
Unaided Ilion, and her destined state,<br/>
Till Greece shall gird her with destructive flame,<br/>
And in one ruin sink the Trojan name."<br/>
</p>
<p>
His warm entreaty touch'd Saturnia's ear:<br/>
She bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,<br/>
Recall the flame, nor in a mortal cause<br/>
Infest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:<br/>
Again the branching streams begin to spread,<br/>
And soft remurmur in their wonted bed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While these by Juno's will the strife resign,<br/>
The warring gods in fierce contention join:<br/>
Rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms:<br/>
With horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms:<br/>
Heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound;<br/>
And wide beneath them groans the rending ground.<br/>
Jove, as his sport, the dreadful scene descries,<br/>
And views contending gods with careless eyes.<br/>
The power of battles lifts his brazen spear,<br/>
And first assaults the radiant queen of war:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What moved thy madness, thus to disunite<br/>
Ethereal minds, and mix all heaven in fight?<br/>
What wonder this, when in thy frantic mood<br/>
Thou drovest a mortal to insult a god?<br/>
Thy impious hand Tydides' javelin bore,<br/>
And madly bathed it in celestial gore."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and smote the long-resounding shield,<br/>
Which bears Jove's thunder on its dreadful field:<br/>
The adamantine aegis of her sire,<br/>
That turns the glancing bolt and forked fire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand<br/>
A stone, the limit of the neighbouring land,<br/>
There fix'd from eldest times; black, craggy, vast;<br/>
This at the heavenly homicide she cast.<br/>
Thundering he falls, a mass of monstrous size:<br/>
And seven broad acres covers as he lies.<br/>
The stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound:<br/>
Loud o'er the fields his ringing arms resound:<br/>
The scornful dame her conquest views with smiles,<br/>
And, glorying, thus the prostrate god reviles:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hast thou not yet, insatiate fury! known<br/>
How far Minerva's force transcends thy own?<br/>
Juno, whom thou rebellious darest withstand,<br/>
Corrects thy folly thus by Pallas' hand;<br/>
Thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace,<br/>
And partial aid to Troy's perfidious race."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The goddess spoke, and turn'd her eyes away,<br/>
That, beaming round, diffused celestial day.<br/>
Jove's Cyprian daughter, stooping on the land,<br/>
Lent to the wounded god her tender hand:<br/>
Slowly he rises, scarcely breathes with pain,<br/>
And, propp'd on her fair arm, forsakes the plain.<br/>
This the bright empress of the heavens survey'd,<br/>
And, scoffing, thus to war's victorious maid:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lo! what an aid on Mars's side is seen!<br/>
The smiles' and loves' unconquerable queen!<br/>
Mark with what insolence, in open view,<br/>
She moves: let Pallas, if she dares, pursue."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Minerva smiling heard, the pair o'ertook,<br/>
And slightly on her breast the wanton strook:<br/>
She, unresisting, fell (her spirits fled);<br/>
On earth together lay the lovers spread.<br/>
"And like these heroes be the fate of all<br/>
(Minerva cries) who guard the Trojan wall!<br/>
To Grecian gods such let the Phrygian be,<br/>
So dread, so fierce, as Venus is to me;<br/>
Then from the lowest stone shall Troy be moved."<br/>
Thus she, and Juno with a smile approved.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meantime, to mix in more than mortal fight,<br/>
The god of ocean dares the god of light.<br/>
"What sloth has seized us, when the fields around<br/>
Ring with conflicting powers, and heaven returns the sound:<br/>
Shall, ignominious, we with shame retire,<br/>
No deed perform'd, to our Olympian sire?<br/>
Come, prove thy arm! for first the war to wage,<br/>
Suits not my greatness, or superior age:<br/>
Rash as thou art to prop the Trojan throne,<br/>
(Forgetful of my wrongs, and of thy own,)<br/>
And guard the race of proud Laomedon!<br/>
Hast thou forgot, how, at the monarch's prayer,<br/>
We shared the lengthen'd labours of a year?<br/>
Troy walls I raised (for such were Jove's commands),<br/>
And yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands:<br/>
Thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves<br/>
Along fair Ida's vales and pendant groves.<br/>
But when the circling seasons in their train<br/>
Brought back the grateful day that crown'd our pain,<br/>
With menace stern the fraudful king defied<br/>
Our latent godhead, and the prize denied:<br/>
Mad as he was, he threaten'd servile bands,<br/>
And doom'd us exiles far in barbarous lands.<br/>
Incensed, we heavenward fled with swiftest wing,<br/>
And destined vengeance on the perjured king.<br/>
Dost thou, for this, afford proud Ilion grace,<br/>
And not, like us, infest the faithless race;<br/>
Like us, their present, future sons destroy,<br/>
And from its deep foundations heave their Troy?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Apollo thus: "To combat for mankind<br/>
Ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind;<br/>
For what is man? Calamitous by birth,<br/>
They owe their life and nourishment to earth;<br/>
Like yearly leaves, that now, with beauty crown'd,<br/>
Smile on the sun; now, wither on the ground.<br/>
To their own hands commit the frantic scene,<br/>
Nor mix immortals in a cause so mean."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then turns his face, far-beaming heavenly fires,<br/>
And from the senior power submiss retires:<br/>
Him thus retreating, Artemis upbraids,<br/>
The quiver'd huntress of the sylvan shades:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And is it thus the youthful Phoebus flies,<br/>
And yields to ocean's hoary sire the prize?<br/>
How vain that martial pomp, and dreadful show<br/>
Of pointed arrows and the silver bow!<br/>
Now boast no more in yon celestial bower,<br/>
Thy force can match the great earth-shaking power."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid:<br/>
Not so Saturnia bore the vaunting maid:<br/>
But furious thus: "What insolence has driven<br/>
Thy pride to face the majesty of heaven?<br/>
What though by Jove the female plague design'd,<br/>
Fierce to the feeble race of womankind,<br/>
The wretched matron feels thy piercing dart;<br/>
Thy sex's tyrant, with a tiger's heart?<br/>
What though tremendous in the woodland chase<br/>
Thy certain arrows pierce the savage race?<br/>
How dares thy rashness on the powers divine<br/>
Employ those arms, or match thy force with mine?<br/>
Learn hence, no more unequal war to wageâ€”"<br/>
She said, and seized her wrists with eager rage;<br/>
These in her left hand lock'd, her right untied<br/>
The bow, the quiver, and its plumy pride.<br/>
About her temples flies the busy bow;<br/>
Now here, now there, she winds her from the blow;<br/>
The scattering arrows, rattling from the case,<br/>
Drop round, and idly mark the dusty place.<br/>
Swift from the field the baffled huntress flies,<br/>
And scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes:<br/>
So, when the falcon wings her way above,<br/>
To the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove;<br/>
(Not fated yet to die;) there safe retreats,<br/>
Yet still her heart against the marble beats.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To her Latona hastes with tender care;<br/>
Whom Hermes viewing, thus declines the war:<br/>
"How shall I face the dame, who gives delight<br/>
To him whose thunders blacken heaven with night?<br/>
Go, matchless goddess! triumph in the skies,<br/>
And boast my conquest, while I yield the prize."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; and pass'd: Latona, stooping low,<br/>
Collects the scatter'd shafts and fallen bow,<br/>
That, glittering on the dust, lay here and there<br/>
Dishonour'd relics of Diana's war:<br/>
Then swift pursued her to her blest abode,<br/>
Where, all confused, she sought the sovereign god;<br/>
Weeping, she grasp'd his knees: the ambrosial vest<br/>
Shook with her sighs, and panted on her breast.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The sire superior smiled, and bade her show<br/>
What heavenly hand had caused his daughter's woe?<br/>
Abash'd, she names his own imperial spouse;<br/>
And the pale crescent fades upon her brows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus they above: while, swiftly gliding down,<br/>
Apollo enters Ilion's sacred town;<br/>
The guardian-god now trembled for her wall,<br/>
And fear'd the Greeks, though fate forbade her fall.<br/>
Back to Olympus, from the war's alarms,<br/>
Return the shining bands of gods in arms;<br/>
Some proud in triumph, some with rage on fire;<br/>
And take their thrones around the ethereal sire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through blood, through death, Achilles still proceeds,<br/>
O'er slaughter'd heroes, and o'er rolling steeds.<br/>
As when avenging flames with fury driven<br/>
On guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven;<br/>
The pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly;<br/>
And the red vapours purple all the sky:<br/>
So raged Achilles: death and dire dismay,<br/>
And toils, and terrors, fill'd the dreadful day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
High on a turret hoary Priam stands,<br/>
And marks the waste of his destructive hands;<br/>
Views, from his arm, the Trojans' scatter'd flight,<br/>
And the near hero rising on his sight!<br/>
No stop, no check, no aid! With feeble pace,<br/>
And settled sorrow on his aged face,<br/>
Fast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;<br/>
And thus descending, on the guards he calls:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"You to whose care our city-gates belong,<br/>
Set wide your portals to the flying throng:<br/>
For lo! he comes, with unresisted sway;<br/>
He comes, and desolation marks his way!<br/>
But when within the walls our troops take breath,<br/>
Lock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death."<br/>
Thus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung<br/>
The opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.<br/>
Phoebus rush'd forth, the flying bands to meet;<br/>
Struck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat,<br/>
On heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,<br/>
And gladsome see their last escape from fate.<br/>
Thither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train,<br/>
Hoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:<br/>
And gasping, panting, fainting, labour on<br/>
With heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.<br/>
Enraged Achilles follows with his spear;<br/>
Wild with revenge, insatiable of war.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,<br/>
And Troy inglorious to her walls retired;<br/>
But he, the god who darts ethereal flame,<br/>
Shot down to save her, and redeem her fame:<br/>
To young Agenor force divine he gave;<br/>
(Antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)<br/>
In aid of him, beside the beech he sate,<br/>
And wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate.<br/>
When now the generous youth Achilles spies,<br/>
Thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.<br/>
(So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)<br/>
He stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!<br/>
Like others fly, and be like others slain?<br/>
Vain hope! to shun him by the self-same road<br/>
Yon line of slaughter'd Trojans lately trod.<br/>
No: with the common heap I scorn to fallâ€”<br/>
What if they pass'd me to the Trojan wall,<br/>
While I decline to yonder path, that leads<br/>
To Ida's forests and surrounding shades?<br/>
So may I reach, conceal'd, the cooling flood,<br/>
From my tired body wash the dirt and blood,<br/>
As soon as night her dusky veil extends,<br/>
Return in safety to my Trojan friends.<br/>
What if?â€”But wherefore all this vain debate?<br/>
Stand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?<br/>
Even now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,<br/>
The fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:<br/>
Such is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,<br/>
And such his valour, that who stands must die.<br/>
Howe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,<br/>
Here, and in public view, to meet my fate.<br/>
Yet sure he too is mortal; he may feel<br/>
(Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.<br/>
One only soul informs that dreadful frame:<br/>
And Jove's sole favour gives him all his fame."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and stood, collected, in his might;<br/>
And all his beating bosom claim'd the fight.<br/>
So from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,<br/>
Roused from his thicket by a storm of darts:<br/>
Untaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds<br/>
Of shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;<br/>
Though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;<br/>
And the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain:<br/>
On their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;<br/>
And tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.<br/>
Not less resolved, Antenor's valiant heir<br/>
Confronts Achilles, and awaits the war,<br/>
Disdainful of retreat: high held before,<br/>
His shield (a broad circumference) he bore;<br/>
Then graceful as he stood, in act to throw<br/>
The lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"How proud Achilles glories in his fame!<br/>
And hopes this day to sink the Trojan name<br/>
Beneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;<br/>
A thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.<br/>
Parents and children our just arms employ,<br/>
And strong and many are the sons of Troy.<br/>
Great as thou art, even thou may'st stain with gore<br/>
These Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: with matchless force the javelin flung<br/>
Smote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung<br/>
Beneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms<br/>
He stands impassive in the ethereal arms.<br/>
Then fiercely rushing on the daring foe,<br/>
His lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:<br/>
But, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds<br/>
The god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.<br/>
Safe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,<br/>
Dismiss'd with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.<br/>
Meanwhile the god, to cover their escape,<br/>
Assumes Agenor's habit, voice and shape,<br/>
Flies from the furious chief in this disguise;<br/>
The furious chief still follows where he flies.<br/>
Now o'er the fields they stretch with lengthen'd strides,<br/>
Now urge the course where swift Scamander glides:<br/>
The god, now distant scarce a stride before,<br/>
Tempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;<br/>
While all the flying troops their speed employ,<br/>
And pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:<br/>
No stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,<br/>
Who 'scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.<br/>
'Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;<br/>
And sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.<br/>
Pale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:<br/>
And nations breathe, deliver'd from their fate.<br/>

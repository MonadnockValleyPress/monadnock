<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XX</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
An ample hide devine Ulysses spread.<br/>
And form'd of fleecy skins his humble bed<br/>
(The remnants of the spoil the suitor-crowd<br/>
In festival devour'd, and victims vow'd).<br/>
Then o'er the chief, Eurynome the chaste<br/>
With duteous care a downy carpet cast:<br/>
With dire revenge his thoughtful bosom glows,<br/>
And, ruminating wrath, he scorns repose.
</p>
<p>
As thus pavilion'd in the porch he lay,<br/>
Scenes of lewd loves his wakeful eyes survey,<br/>
Whilst to nocturnal joys impure repair,<br/>
With wanton glee, the prostituted fair.<br/>
His heart with rage this new dishonour stung,<br/>
Wavering his thoughts in dubious balance hung:<br/>
Or instant should he quench the guilty flame<br/>
With their own blood, and intercept the shame:<br/>
Or to their lust indulge a last embrace,<br/>
And let the peers consummate the disgrace<br/>
Round his swoln heart the murmurous fury rolls,<br/>
As o'er her young the mother-mastiff growls,<br/>
And bays the stranger groom: so wrath compress'd,<br/>
Recoiling, mutter'd thunder in his breast.<br/>
"Poor suffering heart! (he cried,) support the pain<br/>
Of wounded honour, and thy rage restrain.<br/>
Not fiercer woes thy fortitude could foil,<br/>
When the brave partners of thy ten years' toil<br/>
Dire Polypheme devour'd; I then was freed<br/>
By patient prudence from the death decreed."
</p>
<p>
Thus anchor'd safe on reason's peaceful coast,<br/>
Tempests of wrath his soul no longer toss'd;<br/>
Restless his body rolls, to rage resign'd<br/>
As one who long with pale-eyed famine pined,<br/>
The savoury cates on glowing embers cast<br/>
Incessant turns, impatient for repast<br/>
Ulysses so, from side to side-devolved,<br/>
In self-debate the suitor's doom resolved<br/>
When in the form of mortal nymph array'd,<br/>
From heaven descends the Jove-born martial maid;<br/>
And hovering o'er his head in view confess'd,<br/>
The goddess thus her favourite care address'd:
</p>
<p>
"O thou, of mortals most inured to woes!<br/>
Why roll those eyes unfriended of repose?<br/>
Beneath thy palace-roof forget thy care;<br/>
Bless'd in thy queen! bless'd in thy blooming heir!<br/>
Whom, to the gods when suppliant fathers bow<br/>
They name the standard of their dearest vow."
</p>
<p>
"Just is thy kind reproach (the chief rejoin'd),<br/>
Deeds full of fate distract my various mind,<br/>
In contemplation wrapp'd. This hostile crew<br/>
What single arm hath prowess to subdue?<br/>
Or if, by Jove's and thy auxiliar aid,<br/>
They're doom'd to bleed; O say, celestial maid!<br/>
Where shall Ulysses shun, or how sustain<br/>
Nations embattled to revenge the slain?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh impotence of faith! (Minerva cries,)<br/>
If man on frail unknowing man relies,<br/>
Doubt you the gods? Lo, Pallas self descends,<br/>
Inspires thy counsels, and thy toils attends.<br/>
In me affianced, fortify thy breast,<br/>
Though myriads leagued thy rightful claim contest<br/>
My sure divinity shall bear the shield,<br/>
And edge thy sword to reap the glorious field.<br/>
Now, pay the debt to craving nature due,<br/>
Her faded powers with balmy rest renew."<br/>
She ceased, ambrosial slumbers seal his eyes;<br/>
Her care dissolves in visionary joys<br/>
The goddess, pleased, regains her natal skies.
</p>
<p>
Not so the queen; the downy bands of sleep<br/>
By grief relax'd she waked again to weep:<br/>
A gloomy pause ensued of dumb despair;<br/>
Then thus her fate invoked, with fervent prayer
</p>
<p>
"Diana! speed thy deathful ebon dart,<br/>
And cure the pangs of this convulsive heart.<br/>
Snatch me, ye whirlwinds! far from human race,<br/>
Toss'd through the void illimitable space<br/>
Or if dismounted from the rapid cloud,<br/>
Me with his whelming wave let Ocean shroud!<br/>
So, Pandarus, thy hopes, three orphan fair,<br/>
Were doom'd to wander through the devious air;<br/>
Thyself untimely, and thy consort died,<br/>
But four celestials both your cares supplied.<br/>
Venus in tender delicacy rears<br/>
With honey, milk, and wine their infant years;<br/>
Imperial Juno to their youth assigned<br/>
A form majestic, and sagacious mind;<br/>
With shapely growth Diana graced their bloom;<br/>
And Pallas taught the texture of the loom.<br/>
But whilst, to learn their lots in nuptial love,<br/>
Bright Cytherea sought the bower of Jove<br/>
(The God supreme, to whose eternal eye<br/>
The registers of fate expanded lie);<br/>
Wing'd Harpies snatch the unguarded charge away,<br/>
And to the Furies bore a grateful prey.<br/>
Be such my lot! Or thou, Diana, speed<br/>
Thy shaft, and send me joyful to the dead;<br/>
To seek my lord among the warrior train,<br/>
Ere second vows my bridal faith profane.<br/>
When woes the waking sense alone assail,<br/>
Whilst Night extends her soft oblivious veil,<br/>
Of other wretches' care the torture ends;<br/>
No truce the warfare of my heart suspends!<br/>
The night renews the day distracting theme,<br/>
And airy terrors sable every dream.<br/>
The last alone a kind illusion wrought,<br/>
And to my bed my loved Ulysses brought,<br/>
In manly bloom, and each majestic grace,<br/>
As when for Troy he left my fond embrace;<br/>
Such raptures in my beating bosom rise,<br/>
I deem it sure a vision of the skies."
</p>
<p>
Thus, whilst Aurora mounts her purple throne,<br/>
In audible laments she breathes her moan;<br/>
The sounds assault Ulysses' wakeful ear;<br/>
Misjudging of the cause, a sudden fear<br/>
Of his arrival known, the chief alarms;<br/>
He thinks the queen is rushing to his arms.<br/>
Upspringing from his couch, with active haste<br/>
The fleece and carpet in the dome he placed<br/>
(The hide, without, imbibed the morning air);<br/>
And thus the gods invoked with ardent prayer:
</p>
<p>
"Jove, and eternal thrones! with heaven to friend,<br/>
If the long series of my woes shall end;<br/>
Of human race now rising from repose,<br/>
Let one a blissful omen here disclose;<br/>
And, to confirm my faith, propitious Jove!<br/>
Vouchsafe the sanction of a sign above."
</p>
<p>
Whilst lowly thus the chief adoring bows,<br/>
The pitying god his guardian aid avows.<br/>
Loud from a sapphire sky his thunder sounds;<br/>
With springing hope the hero's heart rebounds.<br/>
Soon, with consummate joy to crown his prayer,<br/>
An omen'd voice invades his ravish'd ear.<br/>
Beneath a pile that close the dome adjoin'd,<br/>
Twelve female slaves the gift of Ceres grind;<br/>
Task'd for the royal board to bolt the bran<br/>
From the pure flour (the growth and strength of man)<br/>
Discharging to the day the labour due,<br/>
Now early to repose the rest withdrew;<br/>
One maid unequal to the task assign'd,<br/>
Still turn'd the toilsome mill with anxious mind;<br/>
And thus in bitterness of soul divined:
</p>
<p>
"Father of gods and men, whose thunders roll<br/>
O'er the cerulean vault, and shake the pole:<br/>
Whoe'er from Heaven has gain'd this rare ostent<br/>
(Of granted vows a certain signal sent),<br/>
In this blest moment of accepted prayer,<br/>
Piteous, regard a wretch consumed with care!<br/>
Instant, O Jove! confound the suitor-train,<br/>
For whom o'ertoil'd I grind the golden grain:<br/>
Far from this dome the lewd devourers cast,<br/>
And be this festival decreed their last!"
</p>
<p>
Big with their doom denounced in earth and sky,<br/>
Ulysses' heart dilates with secret joy.<br/>
Meantime the menial train with unctious wood<br/>
Heap'd high the genial hearth, Vulcanian food:<br/>
When, early dress'd, advanced the royal heir;<br/>
With manly grasp he waved a martial spear;<br/>
A radiant sabre graced his purple zone,<br/>
And on his foot the golden sandal shone.<br/>
His steps impetuous to the portal press'd;<br/>
And Euryclea thus he there address'd:
</p>
<p>
"Say thou to whom my youth its nurture owes,<br/>
Was care for due refection and repose<br/>
Bestow'd the stranger-guest? Or waits he grieved,<br/>
His age not honour'd, nor his wants relieved?<br/>
Promiscuous grace on all the queen confers<br/>
(In woes bewilder'd, oft the wisest errs).<br/>
The wordy vagrant to the dole aspires,<br/>
And modest worth with noble scorn retires."
</p>
<p>
She thus: "O cease that ever-honour'd name<br/>
To blemish now: it ill deserves your blame,<br/>
A bowl of generous wine sufficed the guest;<br/>
In vain the queen the night refection press'd;<br/>
Nor would he court repose in downy state,<br/>
Unbless'd, abandon'd to the rage of Fate!<br/>
A hide beneath the portico was spread,<br/>
And fleecy skins composed an humble bed;<br/>
A downy carpet cast with duteous care,<br/>
Secured him from the keen nocturnal air."
</p>
<p>
His cornel javelin poised with regal port,<br/>
To the sage Greeks convened in Themis' court,<br/>
Forth-issuing from the dome the prince repair'd;<br/>
Two dogs of chase, a lion-hearted guard,<br/>
Behind him sourly stalked. Without delay<br/>
The dame divides the labour of the day;<br/>
Thus urging to the toil the menial train;
</p>
<p>
"What marks of luxury the marble stain<br/>
Its wonted lustre let the floor regain;<br/>
The seats with purple clothe in order due;<br/>
And let the abstersive sponge the board renew;<br/>
Let some refresh the vase's sullied mould;<br/>
Some bid the goblets boast their native gold;<br/>
Some to the spring, with each a jar, repair,<br/>
And copious waters pure for bathing bear;<br/>
Dispatch! for soon the suitors will essay<br/>
The lunar feast-rites to the god of day."
</p>
<p>
She said: with duteous haste a bevy fair<br/>
Of twenty virgins to the spring repair;<br/>
With varied toils the rest adorn the dome.<br/>
Magnificent, and blithe, the suitors come.<br/>
Some wield the sounding axe; the dodder'd oaks<br/>
Divide, obedient to the forceful strokes.<br/>
Soon from the fount, with each a brimming urn<br/>
(Eumaeus in their train), the maids return.<br/>
Three porkers for the feast, all brawny-chined,<br/>
He brought; the choicest of the tusky-kind;<br/>
In lodgments first secure his care he viewed,<br/>
Then to the king this friendly speech renew'd:<br/>
"Now say sincere, my guest! the suitor-train<br/>
Still treat thy worth with lordly dull disdain;<br/>
Or speaks their deed a bounteous mind humane?"
</p>
<p>
"Some pitying god (Ulysses sad replied)<br/>
With vollied vengeance blast their towering pride!<br/>
No conscious blush, no sense of right, restrains<br/>
The tides of lust that swell the boiling veins;<br/>
From vice to vice their appetites are toss'd,<br/>
All cheaply sated at another's cost!"
</p>
<p>
While thus the chief his woes indignant told,<br/>
Melanthius, master of the bearded fold,<br/>
The goodliest goats of all the royal herd<br/>
Spontaneous to the suitors' feast preferr'd;<br/>
Two grooms assistant bore the victims bound;<br/>
With quavering cries the vaulted roofs resound;<br/>
And to the chief austere aloud began<br/>
The wretch unfriendly to the race of man:
</p>
<p>
"Here vagrant, still? offensive to my lords!<br/>
Blows have more energy than airy words;<br/>
These arguments I'll use: nor conscious shame,<br/>
Nor threats, thy bold intrusion will reclaim.<br/>
On this high feast the meanest vulgar boast<br/>
A plenteous board! Hence! seek another host!"
</p>
<p>
Rejoinder to the churl the king disdain'd,<br/>
But shook his head, and rising wrath restrain'd.
</p>
<p>
From Cephalenia 'cross the surgy main<br/>
Philaetius late arrived, a faithful swain.<br/>
A steer ungrateful to the bull's embrace.<br/>
And goats he brought, the pride of all their race;<br/>
Imported in a shallop not his own;<br/>
The dome re-echoed to the mingl'd moan.<br/>
Straight to the guardian of the bristly kind<br/>
He thus began, benevolent of mind:
</p>
<p>
"What guest is he, of such majestic air?<br/>
His lineage and paternal clime declare:<br/>
Dim through the eclipse of fate, the rays divine<br/>
Of sovereign state with faded splendour shine.<br/>
If monarchs by the gods are plunged in woe,<br/>
To what abyss are we foredoom'd to go!"<br/>
Then affable he thus the chief address'd,<br/>
Whilst with pathetic warmth his hand he press'd:
</p>
<p>
"Stranger, may fate a milder aspect show,<br/>
And spin thy future with a whiter clue!<br/>
O Jove! for ever deaf to human cries;<br/>
The tyrant, not the father of the skies!<br/>
Unpiteous of the race thy will began!<br/>
The fool of fate, thy manufacture, man,<br/>
With penury, contempt, repulse, and care,<br/>
The galling load of life is doom'd to bear.<br/>
Ulysses from his state a wanderer still,<br/>
Upbraids thy power, thy wisdom, or thy will!<br/>
O monarch ever dear!-O man of woe!<br/>
Fresh flow my tears, and shall for ever flow!<br/>
Like thee, poor stranger guest, denied his home,<br/>
Like thee: in rags obscene decreed to roam!<br/>
Or, haply perish'd on some distant coast,<br/>
In stygian gloom he glides, a pensive ghost!<br/>
Oh, grateful for the good his bounty gave,<br/>
I'll grieve, till sorrow sink me to the grave!<br/>
His kind protecting hand my youth preferr'd,<br/>
The regent of his Cephalenian herd;<br/>
With vast increase beneath my care it spreads:<br/>
A stately breed! and blackens far the meads.<br/>
Constrain'd, the choicest beeves I thence import,<br/>
To cram these cormorants that crowd his court:<br/>
Who in partition seek his realm to share;<br/>
Nor human right nor wrath divine revere,<br/>
Since here resolved oppressive these reside,<br/>
Contending doubts my anxious heart divide:<br/>
Now to some foreign clime inclined to fly,<br/>
And with the royal herd protection buy;<br/>
Then, happier thoughts return the nodding scale,<br/>
Light mounts despair, alternate hopes prevail:<br/>
In opening prospects of ideal joy,<br/>
My king returns; the proud usurpers die."
</p>
<p>
To whom the chief: "In thy capacious mind<br/>
Since daring zeal with cool debate is join'd,<br/>
Attend a deed already ripe in fate:<br/>
Attest, O Jove! the truth I now relate!<br/>
This sacred truth attest, each genial power,<br/>
Who bless the board, and guard this friendly bower!<br/>
Before thou quit the dome (nor long delay)<br/>
Thy wish produced in act, with pleased survey,<br/>
Thy wondering eyes shall view: his rightful reign<br/>
By arms avow'd Ulysses shall regain,<br/>
And to the shades devote the suitor-train."
</p>
<p>
"O Jove supreme! (the raptured swain replies,)<br/>
With deeds consummate soon the promised joys!<br/>
These aged nerves, with new-born vigour strung,<br/>
In that blest cause should emulate the young."<br/>
Assents Eumaeus to the prayer address'd;<br/>
And equal ardours fire his loyal breast.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the suitors urge the prince's fate,<br/>
And deathful arts employ the dire debate:<br/>
When in his airy tour, the bird of Jove<br/>
Truss'd with his sinewy pounce a trembling dove;<br/>
Sinister to their hope! This omen eyed<br/>
Amphinomus, who thus presaging cried:
</p>
<p>
"The gods from force and fraud the prince defend;<br/>
O peers! the sanguinary scheme suspend:<br/>
Your future thought let sable fate employ;<br/>
And give the present hour to genial joy."
</p>
<p>
From council straight the assenting peerage ceased,<br/>
And in the dome prepared the genial feast.<br/>
Disrobed, their vests apart in order lay,<br/>
Then all with speed succinct the victims slay:<br/>
With sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled,<br/>
And the proud steer was on the marble spread.<br/>
With fire prepared, they deal the morsels round,<br/>
Wine, rosy-bright, the brimming goblets crown'd,<br/>
By sage Eumaeus borne; the purple tide<br/>
Melanthius from an ample jar supplied:<br/>
High canisters of bread Philaetius placed;<br/>
And eager all devour the rich repast.<br/>
Disposed apart, Ulysses shares the treat;<br/>
A trivet table, and ignobler seat,<br/>
The prince appoints; but to his sire assigns<br/>
The tasteful inwards, and nectareous wines.<br/>
"Partake, my guest (he cried), without control<br/>
The social feast, and drain the cheering bowl:<br/>
Dread not the railer's laugh, nor ruffian's rage;<br/>
No vulgar roof protects thy honour'd age;<br/>
This dome a refuge to thy wrongs shall be,<br/>
From my great sire too soon devolved to me!<br/>
Your violence and scorn, ye suitors, cease,<br/>
Lest arms avenge the violated peace."
</p>
<p>
Awed by the prince, so haughty, brave, and young,<br/>
Rage gnaw'd the lip, amazement chain'd the tongue.<br/>
"Be patient, peers! (at length Antinous cries,)<br/>
The threats of vain imperious youth despise:<br/>
Would Jove permit the meditated blow,<br/>
That stream of eloquence should cease to flow."
</p>
<p>
Without reply vouchsafed, Antinous ceased:<br/>
Meanwhile the pomp of festival increased:<br/>
By heralds rank'd; in marshall'd order move<br/>
The city tribes, to pleased Apollo's grove:<br/>
Beneath the verdure of which awful shade,<br/>
The lunar hecatomb they grateful laid;<br/>
Partook the sacred feast, and ritual honours paid.<br/>
But the rich banquet, in the dome prepared<br/>
(An humble sideboard set) Ulysses shared.<br/>
Observant of the prince's high behest,<br/>
His menial train attend the stranger-guest;<br/>
Whom Pallas with unpardoning fury fired,<br/>
By lordly pride and keen reproach inspired.<br/>
A Samian peer, more studious than the rest<br/>
Of vice, who teem'd with many a dead-born jest;<br/>
And urged, for title to a consort queen,<br/>
Unnumber'd acres arable and green<br/>
(Ctesippus named); this lord Ulysses eyed,<br/>
And thus burst out the imposthumate with pride:
</p>
<p>
"The sentence I propose, ye peers, attend:<br/>
Since due regard must wait the prince's friend,<br/>
Let each a token of esteem bestow:<br/>
This gift acquits the dear respect I owe;<br/>
With which he nobly may discharge his seat,<br/>
And pay the menials for a master's treat."
</p>
<p>
He said: and of the steer before him placed,<br/>
That sinewy fragment at Ulysses cast,<br/>
Where to the pastern-bone, by nerves combined,<br/>
The well-horn'd foot indissolubly join'd;<br/>
Which whizzing high, the wall unseemly sign'd.<br/>
The chief indignant grins a ghastly smile;<br/>
Revenge and scorn within his bosom boil:<br/>
When thus the prince with pious rage inflamed:<br/>
"Had not the inglorious wound thy malice aim'd<br/>
Fall'n guiltless of the mark, my certain spear<br/>
Had made thee buy the brutal triumph dear:<br/>
Nor should thy sire a queen his daughter boast;<br/>
The suitor, now, had vanish'd in a ghost:<br/>
No more, ye lewd compeers, with lawless power<br/>
Invade my dome, my herds and flocks devour:<br/>
For genuine worth, of age mature to know,<br/>
My grape shall redden, and my harvest grow<br/>
Or, if each other's wrongs ye still support,<br/>
With rapes and riot to profane my court;<br/>
What single arm with numbers can contend?<br/>
On me let all your lifted swords descend,<br/>
And with my life such vile dishonours end."
</p>
<p>
A long cessation of discourse ensued,<br/>
By gentler Agelaus thus renew'd:
</p>
<p>
"A just reproof, ye peers! your rage restrain<br/>
From the protected guest, and menial train:<br/>
And, prince! to stop the source of future ill,<br/>
Assent yourself, and gain the royal will.<br/>
Whilst hope prevail'd to see your sire restored,<br/>
Of right the queen refused a second lord:<br/>
But who so vain of faith, so blind to fate,<br/>
To think he still survives to claim the state?<br/>
Now press the sovereign dame with warm desire<br/>
To wed, as wealth or worth her choice inspire:<br/>
The lord selected to the nuptial joys<br/>
Far hence will lead the long-contested prize:<br/>
Whilst in paternal pomp with plenty bless'd,<br/>
You reign, of this imperial dome possess'd."
</p>
<p>
Sage and serene Telemachus replies:<br/>
"By him at whose behest the thunder flies,<br/>
And by the name on earth I most revere,<br/>
By great Ulysses and his woes I swear!<br/>
(Who never must review his dear domain;<br/>
Enroll'd, perhaps, in Pluto's dreary train),<br/>
Whene'er her choice the royal dame avows,<br/>
My bridal gifts shall load the future spouse:<br/>
But from this dome my parent queen to chase!<br/>
From me, ye gods! avert such dire disgrace."
</p>
<p>
But Pallas clouds with intellectual gloom<br/>
The suitors' souls, insensate of their doom!<br/>
A mirthful frenzy seized the fated crowd;<br/>
The roofs resound with causeless laughter loud;<br/>
Floating in gore, portentous to survey!<br/>
In each discolour'd vase the viands lay;<br/>
Then down each cheek the tears spontaneous flow<br/>
And sudden sighs precede approaching woe.<br/>
In vision wrapp'd, the Hyperesian seer<br/>
Uprose, and thus divined the vengeance near:
</p>
<p>
"O race to death devote! with Stygian shade<br/>
Each destin'd peer impending fates invade;<br/>
With tears your wan distorted cheeks are drown'd;<br/>
With sanguine drops the walls are rubied round:<br/>
Thick swarms the spacious hall with howling ghosts,<br/>
To people Orcus, and the burning coasts!<br/>
Nor gives the sun his golden orb to roll,<br/>
But universal night usurps the pole!"
</p>
<p>
Yet warn'd in vain, with laughter loud elate<br/>
The peers reproach the sure divine of Fate;<br/>
And thus Eurymachus: "The dotard's mind<br/>
To every sense is lost, to reason blind;<br/>
Swift from the dome conduct the slave away;<br/>
Let him in open air behold the day."
</p>
<p>
"Tax not (the heaven-illumined seer rejoin'd)<br/>
Of rage, or folly, my prophetic mind,<br/>
No clouds of error dim the ethereal rays,<br/>
Her equal power each faithful sense obeys.<br/>
Unguided hence my trembling steps I bend,<br/>
Far hence, before yon hovering deaths descend;<br/>
Lest the ripe harvest of revenge begun,<br/>
I share the doom ye suitors cannot shun."
</p>
<p>
This said, to sage Piraeus sped the seer,<br/>
His honour'd host, a welcome inmate there.<br/>
O'er the protracted feast the suitors sit,<br/>
And aim to wound the prince with pointless wit:<br/>
Cries one, with scornful leer and mimic voice,<br/>
"Thy charity we praise, but not thy choice;<br/>
Why such profusion of indulgence shown<br/>
To this poor, timorous, toil-detesting drone?<br/>
That others feeds on planetary schemes,<br/>
And pays his host with hideous noon-day dreams.<br/>
But, prince! for once at least believe a friend;<br/>
To some Sicilian mart these courtiers send,<br/>
Where, if they yield their freight across the main,<br/>
Dear sell the slaves! demand no greater gain."
</p>
<p>
Thus jovial they; but nought the prince replies;<br/>
Full on his sire he roll'd his ardent eyes:<br/>
Impatient straight to flesh his virgin-sword;<br/>
From the wise chief he waits the deathful word.<br/>
Nigh in her bright alcove, the pensive queen<br/>
To see the circle sate, of all unseen.<br/>
Sated at length they rise, and bid prepare<br/>
An eve-repast, with equal cost and care:<br/>
But vengeful Pallas, with preventing speed,<br/>
A feast proportion'd to their crimes decreed;<br/>
A feast of death, the feasters doom'd to bleed!

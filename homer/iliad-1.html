<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book I</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring<br/>
Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!<br/>
That wrath which hurl'd to Pluto's gloomy reign<br/>
The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;<br/>
Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,<br/>
Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.<br/>
Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,<br/>
Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Declare, O Muse! in what ill-fated hour<br/>
Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power<br/>
Latona's son a dire contagion spread,<br/>
And heap'd the camp with mountains of the dead;<br/>
The king of men his reverent priest defied,<br/>
And for the king's offence the people died.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain<br/>
His captive daughter from the victor's chain.<br/>
Suppliant the venerable father stands;<br/>
Apollo's awful ensigns grace his hands:<br/>
By these he begs; and lowly bending down,<br/>
Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown.<br/>
He sued to all, but chief implored for grace<br/>
The brother-kings, of Atreus' royal race<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crown'd,<br/>
And Troy's proud walls lie level with the ground.<br/>
May Jove restore you when your toils are o'er<br/>
Safe to the pleasures of your native shore.<br/>
But, oh! relieve a wretched parent's pain,<br/>
And give Chryseis to these arms again;<br/>
If mercy fail, yet let my presents move,<br/>
And dread avenging Phoebus, son of Jove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,<br/>
The priest to reverence, and release the fair.<br/>
Not so Atrides; he, with kingly pride,<br/>
Repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,<br/>
Nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains:<br/>
Hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod,<br/>
Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.<br/>
Mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain;<br/>
And prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain;<br/>
Till time shall rifle every youthful grace,<br/>
And age dismiss her from my cold embrace,<br/>
In daily labours of the loom employ'd,<br/>
Or doom'd to deck the bed she once enjoy'd.<br/>
Hence then; to Argos shall the maid retire,<br/>
Far from her native soil and weeping sire."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The trembling priest along the shore return'd,<br/>
And in the anguish of a father mourn'd.<br/>
Disconsolate, not daring to complain,<br/>
Silent he wander'd by the sounding main;<br/>
Till, safe at distance, to his god he prays,<br/>
The god who darts around the world his rays.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O Smintheus! sprung from fair Latona's line,<br/>
Thou guardian power of Cilla the divine,<br/>
Thou source of light! whom Tenedos adores,<br/>
And whose bright presence gilds thy Chrysa's shores.<br/>
If e'er with wreaths I hung thy sacred fane,<br/>
Or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain;<br/>
God of the silver bow! thy shafts employ,<br/>
Avenge thy servant, and the Greeks destroy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus Chryses pray'd.—the favouring power attends,<br/>
And from Olympus' lofty tops descends.<br/>
Bent was his bow, the Grecian hearts to wound;<br/>
Fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound.<br/>
Breathing revenge, a sudden night he spread,<br/>
And gloomy darkness roll'd about his head.<br/>
The fleet in view, he twang'd his deadly bow,<br/>
And hissing fly the feather'd fates below.<br/>
On mules and dogs the infection first began;<br/>
And last, the vengeful arrows fix'd in man.<br/>
For nine long nights, through all the dusky air,<br/>
The pyres, thick-flaming, shot a dismal glare.<br/>
But ere the tenth revolving day was run,<br/>
Inspired by Juno, Thetis' godlike son<br/>
Convened to council all the Grecian train;<br/>
For much the goddess mourn'd her heroes slain.<br/>
The assembly seated, rising o'er the rest,<br/>
Achilles thus the king of men address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Why leave we not the fatal Trojan shore,<br/>
And measure back the seas we cross'd before?<br/>
The plague destroying whom the sword would spare,<br/>
'Tis time to save the few remains of war.<br/>
But let some prophet, or some sacred sage,<br/>
Explore the cause of great Apollo's rage;<br/>
Or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove<br/>
By mystic dreams, for dreams descend from Jove.<br/>
If broken vows this heavy curse have laid,<br/>
Let altars smoke, and hecatombs be paid.<br/>
So Heaven, atoned, shall dying Greece restore,<br/>
And Phoebus dart his burning shafts no more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and sat: when Chalcas thus replied;<br/>
Chalcas the wise, the Grecian priest and guide,<br/>
That sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,<br/>
The past, the present, and the future knew:<br/>
Uprising slow, the venerable sage<br/>
Thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Beloved of Jove, Achilles! would'st thou know<br/>
Why angry Phoebus bends his fatal bow?<br/>
First give thy faith, and plight a prince's word<br/>
Of sure protection, by thy power and sword:<br/>
For I must speak what wisdom would conceal,<br/>
And truths, invidious to the great, reveal,<br/>
Bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,<br/>
Instruct a monarch where his error lies;<br/>
For though we deem the short-lived fury past,<br/>
'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last."<br/>
To whom Pelides:—"From thy inmost soul<br/>
Speak what thou know'st, and speak without control.<br/>
E'en by that god I swear who rules the day,<br/>
To whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.<br/>
And whose bless'd oracles thy lips declare;<br/>
Long as Achilles breathes this vital air,<br/>
No daring Greek, of all the numerous band,<br/>
Against his priest shall lift an impious hand;<br/>
Not e'en the chief by whom our hosts are led,<br/>
The king of kings, shall touch that sacred head."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Encouraged thus, the blameless man replies:<br/>
"Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,<br/>
But he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,<br/>
Apollo's vengeance for his injured priest.<br/>
Nor will the god's awaken'd fury cease,<br/>
But plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,<br/>
Till the great king, without a ransom paid,<br/>
To her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.<br/>
Perhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,<br/>
The priest may pardon, and the god may spare."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The prophet spoke: when with a gloomy frown<br/>
The monarch started from his shining throne;<br/>
Black choler fill'd his breast that boil'd with ire,<br/>
And from his eye-balls flash'd the living fire:<br/>
"Augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,<br/>
Prophet of plagues, for ever boding ill!<br/>
Still must that tongue some wounding message bring,<br/>
And still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?<br/>
For this are Phoebus' oracles explored,<br/>
To teach the Greeks to murmur at their lord?<br/>
For this with falsehood is my honour stain'd,<br/>
Is heaven offended, and a priest profaned;<br/>
Because my prize, my beauteous maid, I hold,<br/>
And heavenly charms prefer to proffer'd gold?<br/>
A maid, unmatch'd in manners as in face,<br/>
Skill'd in each art, and crown'd with every grace;<br/>
Not half so dear were Clytaemnestra's charms,<br/>
When first her blooming beauties bless'd my arms.<br/>
Yet, if the gods demand her, let her sail;<br/>
Our cares are only for the public weal:<br/>
Let me be deem'd the hateful cause of all,<br/>
And suffer, rather than my people fall.<br/>
The prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,<br/>
So dearly valued, and so justly mine.<br/>
But since for common good I yield the fair,<br/>
My private loss let grateful Greece repair;<br/>
Nor unrewarded let your prince complain,<br/>
That he alone has fought and bled in vain."<br/>
"Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),<br/>
Fond of the power, but fonder of the prize!<br/>
Would'st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,<br/>
The due reward of many a well-fought field?<br/>
</p>
<p>
The spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,<br/>
We share with justice, as with toil we gain;<br/>
But to resume whate'er thy avarice craves<br/>
(That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.<br/>
Yet if our chief for plunder only fight,<br/>
The spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite,<br/>
Whene'er, by Jove's decree, our conquering powers<br/>
Shall humble to the dust her lofty towers."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus the king: "Shall I my prize resign<br/>
With tame content, and thou possess'd of thine?<br/>
Great as thou art, and like a god in fight,<br/>
Think not to rob me of a soldier's right.<br/>
At thy demand shall I restore the maid?<br/>
First let the just equivalent be paid;<br/>
Such as a king might ask; and let it be<br/>
A treasure worthy her, and worthy me.<br/>
Or grant me this, or with a monarch's claim<br/>
This hand shall seize some other captive dame.<br/>
The mighty Ajax shall his prize resign;<br/>
Ulysses' spoils, or even thy own, be mine.<br/>
The man who suffers, loudly may complain;<br/>
And rage he may, but he shall rage in vain.<br/>
But this when time requires.—It now remains<br/>
We launch a bark to plough the watery plains,<br/>
And waft the sacrifice to Chrysa's shores,<br/>
With chosen pilots, and with labouring oars.<br/>
Soon shall the fair the sable ship ascend,<br/>
And some deputed prince the charge attend:<br/>
This Creta's king, or Ajax shall fulfil,<br/>
Or wise Ulysses see perform'd our will;<br/>
Or, if our royal pleasure shall ordain,<br/>
Achilles' self conduct her o'er the main;<br/>
Let fierce Achilles, dreadful in his rage,<br/>
The god propitiate, and the pest assuage."<br/>
</p>
<p>
At this, Pelides, frowning stern, replied:<br/>
"O tyrant, arm'd with insolence and pride!<br/>
Inglorious slave to interest, ever join'd<br/>
With fraud, unworthy of a royal mind!<br/>
What generous Greek, obedient to thy word,<br/>
Shall form an ambush, or shall lift the sword?<br/>
What cause have I to war at thy decree?<br/>
The distant Trojans never injured me;<br/>
To Phthia's realms no hostile troops they led:<br/>
Safe in her vales my warlike coursers fed;<br/>
Far hence removed, the hoarse-resounding main,<br/>
And walls of rocks, secure my native reign,<br/>
Whose fruitful soil luxuriant harvests grace,<br/>
Rich in her fruits, and in her martial race.<br/>
Hither we sail'd, a voluntary throng,<br/>
To avenge a private, not a public wrong:<br/>
What else to Troy the assembled nations draws,<br/>
But thine, ungrateful, and thy brother's cause?<br/>
Is this the pay our blood and toils deserve;<br/>
Disgraced and injured by the man we serve?<br/>
And darest thou threat to snatch my prize away,<br/>
Due to the deeds of many a dreadful day?<br/>
A prize as small, O tyrant! match'd with thine,<br/>
As thy own actions if compared to mine.<br/>
Thine in each conquest is the wealthy prey,<br/>
Though mine the sweat and danger of the day.<br/>
Some trivial present to my ships I bear:<br/>
Or barren praises pay the wounds of war.<br/>
But know, proud monarch, I'm thy slave no more;<br/>
My fleet shall waft me to Thessalia's shore:<br/>
Left by Achilles on the Trojan plain,<br/>
What spoils, what conquests, shall Atrides gain?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
To this the king: "Fly, mighty warrior! fly;<br/>
Thy aid we need not, and thy threats defy.<br/>
There want not chiefs in such a cause to fight,<br/>
And Jove himself shall guard a monarch's right.<br/>
Of all the kings (the god's distinguish'd care)<br/>
To power superior none such hatred bear:<br/>
Strife and debate thy restless soul employ,<br/>
And wars and horrors are thy savage joy,<br/>
If thou hast strength, 'twas Heaven that strength bestow'd;<br/>
For know, vain man! thy valour is from God.<br/>
Haste, launch thy vessels, fly with speed away;<br/>
Rule thy own realms with arbitrary sway;<br/>
I heed thee not, but prize at equal rate<br/>
Thy short-lived friendship, and thy groundless hate.<br/>
Go, threat thy earth-born Myrmidons:—but here<br/>
'Tis mine to threaten, prince, and thine to fear.<br/>
Know, if the god the beauteous dame demand,<br/>
My bark shall waft her to her native land;<br/>
But then prepare, imperious prince! prepare,<br/>
Fierce as thou art, to yield thy captive fair:<br/>
Even in thy tent I'll seize the blooming prize,<br/>
Thy loved Briseis with the radiant eyes.<br/>
Hence shalt thou prove my might, and curse the hour<br/>
Thou stood'st a rival of imperial power;<br/>
And hence, to all our hosts it shall be known,<br/>
That kings are subject to the gods alone."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Achilles heard, with grief and rage oppress'd,<br/>
His heart swell'd high, and labour'd in his breast;<br/>
Distracting thoughts by turns his bosom ruled;<br/>
Now fired by wrath, and now by reason cool'd:<br/>
That prompts his hand to draw the deadly sword,<br/>
Force through the Greeks, and pierce their haughty lord;<br/>
This whispers soft his vengeance to control,<br/>
And calm the rising tempest of his soul.<br/>
Just as in anguish of suspense he stay'd,<br/>
While half unsheathed appear'd the glittering blade,<br/>
Minerva swift descended from above,<br/>
Sent by the sister and the wife of Jove<br/>
(For both the princes claim'd her equal care);<br/>
Behind she stood, and by the golden hair<br/>
Achilles seized; to him alone confess'd;<br/>
A sable cloud conceal'd her from the rest.<br/>
He sees, and sudden to the goddess cries,<br/>
Known by the flames that sparkle from her eyes:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Descends Minerva, in her guardian care,<br/>
A heavenly witness of the wrongs I bear<br/>
From Atreus' son?—Then let those eyes that view<br/>
The daring crime, behold the vengeance too."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Forbear (the progeny of Jove replies)<br/>
To calm thy fury I forsake the skies:<br/>
Let great Achilles, to the gods resign'd,<br/>
To reason yield the empire o'er his mind.<br/>
By awful Juno this command is given;<br/>
The king and you are both the care of heaven.<br/>
The force of keen reproaches let him feel;<br/>
But sheathe, obedient, thy revenging steel.<br/>
For I pronounce (and trust a heavenly power)<br/>
Thy injured honour has its fated hour,<br/>
When the proud monarch shall thy arms implore,<br/>
And bribe thy friendship with a boundless store.<br/>
Then let revenge no longer bear the sway;<br/>
Command thy passions, and the gods obey."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To her Pelides:—"With regardful ear,<br/>
'Tis just, O goddess! I thy dictates hear.<br/>
Hard as it is, my vengeance I suppress:<br/>
Those who revere the gods the gods will bless."<br/>
He said, observant of the blue-eyed maid;<br/>
Then in the sheath return'd the shining blade.<br/>
The goddess swift to high Olympus flies,<br/>
And joins the sacred senate of the skies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor yet the rage his boiling breast forsook,<br/>
Which thus redoubling on Atrides broke:<br/>
"O monster! mix'd of insolence and fear,<br/>
Thou dog in forehead, but in heart a deer!<br/>
When wert thou known in ambush'd fights to dare,<br/>
Or nobly face the horrid front of war?<br/>
'Tis ours, the chance of fighting fields to try;<br/>
Thine to look on, and bid the valiant die:<br/>
So much 'tis safer through the camp to go,<br/>
And rob a subject, than despoil a foe.<br/>
Scourge of thy people, violent and base!<br/>
Sent in Jove's anger on a slavish race;<br/>
Who, lost to sense of generous freedom past,<br/>
Are tamed to wrongs;—or this had been thy last.<br/>
Now by this sacred sceptre hear me swear,<br/>
Which never more shall leaves or blossoms bear,<br/>
Which sever'd from the trunk (as I from thee)<br/>
On the bare mountains left its parent tree;<br/>
This sceptre, form'd by temper'd steel to prove<br/>
An ensign of the delegates of Jove,<br/>
From whom the power of laws and justice springs<br/>
(Tremendous oath! inviolate to kings);<br/>
By this I swear:—when bleeding Greece again<br/>
Shall call Achilles, she shall call in vain.<br/>
When, flush'd with slaughter, Hector comes to spread<br/>
The purpled shore with mountains of the dead,<br/>
Then shall thou mourn the affront thy madness gave,<br/>
Forced to deplore when impotent to save:<br/>
Then rage in bitterness of soul to know<br/>
This act has made the bravest Greek thy foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; and furious hurl'd against the ground<br/>
His sceptre starr'd with golden studs around:<br/>
Then sternly silent sat. With like disdain<br/>
The raging king return'd his frowns again.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To calm their passion with the words of age,<br/>
Slow from his seat arose the Pylian sage,<br/>
Experienced Nestor, in persuasion skill'd;<br/>
Words, sweet as honey, from his lips distill'd:<br/>
Two generations now had pass'd away,<br/>
Wise by his rules, and happy by his sway;<br/>
Two ages o'er his native realm he reign'd,<br/>
And now the example of the third remain'd.<br/>
All view'd with awe the venerable man;<br/>
Who thus with mild benevolence began:—<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What shame, what woe is this to Greece! what joy<br/>
To Troy's proud monarch, and the friends of Troy!<br/>
That adverse gods commit to stern debate<br/>
The best, the bravest, of the Grecian state.<br/>
Young as ye are, this youthful heat restrain,<br/>
Nor think your Nestor's years and wisdom vain.<br/>
A godlike race of heroes once I knew,<br/>
Such as no more these aged eyes shall view!<br/>
Lives there a chief to match Pirithous' fame,<br/>
Dryas the bold, or Ceneus' deathless name;<br/>
Theseus, endued with more than mortal might,<br/>
Or Polyphemus, like the gods in fight?<br/>
With these of old, to toils of battle bred,<br/>
In early youth my hardy days I led;<br/>
Fired with the thirst which virtuous envy breeds,<br/>
And smit with love of honourable deeds,<br/>
Strongest of men, they pierced the mountain boar,<br/>
Ranged the wild deserts red with monsters' gore,<br/>
And from their hills the shaggy Centaurs tore:<br/>
Yet these with soft persuasive arts I sway'd;<br/>
When Nestor spoke, they listen'd and obey'd.<br/>
If in my youth, even these esteem'd me wise;<br/>
Do you, young warriors, hear my age advise.<br/>
Atrides, seize not on the beauteous slave;<br/>
That prize the Greeks by common suffrage gave:<br/>
Nor thou, Achilles, treat our prince with pride;<br/>
Let kings be just, and sovereign power preside.<br/>
Thee, the first honours of the war adorn,<br/>
Like gods in strength, and of a goddess born;<br/>
Him, awful majesty exalts above<br/>
The powers of earth, and sceptred sons of Jove.<br/>
Let both unite with well-consenting mind,<br/>
So shall authority with strength be join'd.<br/>
Leave me, O king! to calm Achilles' rage;<br/>
Rule thou thyself, as more advanced in age.<br/>
Forbid it, gods! Achilles should be lost,<br/>
The pride of Greece, and bulwark of our host."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, he ceased. The king of men replies:<br/>
"Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.<br/>
But that imperious, that unconquer'd soul,<br/>
No laws can limit, no respect control.<br/>
Before his pride must his superiors fall;<br/>
His word the law, and he the lord of all?<br/>
Him must our hosts, our chiefs, ourself obey?<br/>
What king can bear a rival in his sway?<br/>
Grant that the gods his matchless force have given;<br/>
Has foul reproach a privilege from heaven?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here on the monarch's speech Achilles broke,<br/>
And furious, thus, and interrupting spoke:<br/>
"Tyrant, I well deserved thy galling chain,<br/>
To live thy slave, and still to serve in vain,<br/>
Should I submit to each unjust decree:—<br/>
Command thy vassals, but command not me.<br/>
Seize on Briseis, whom the Grecians doom'd<br/>
My prize of war, yet tamely see resumed;<br/>
And seize secure; no more Achilles draws<br/>
His conquering sword in any woman's cause.<br/>
The gods command me to forgive the past:<br/>
But let this first invasion be the last:<br/>
For know, thy blood, when next thou darest invade,<br/>
Shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade."<br/>
</p>
<p>
At this they ceased: the stern debate expired:<br/>
The chiefs in sullen majesty retired.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Achilles with Patroclus took his way<br/>
Where near his tents his hollow vessels lay.<br/>
Meantime Atrides launch'd with numerous oars<br/>
A well-rigg'd ship for Chrysa's sacred shores:<br/>
High on the deck was fair Chryseis placed,<br/>
And sage Ulysses with the conduct graced:<br/>
Safe in her sides the hecatomb they stow'd,<br/>
Then swiftly sailing, cut the liquid road.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The host to expiate next the king prepares,<br/>
With pure lustrations, and with solemn prayers.<br/>
Wash'd by the briny wave, the pious train<br/>
Are cleansed; and cast the ablutions in the main.<br/>
Along the shore whole hecatombs were laid,<br/>
And bulls and goats to Phoebus' altars paid;<br/>
The sable fumes in curling spires arise,<br/>
And waft their grateful odours to the skies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The army thus in sacred rites engaged,<br/>
Atrides still with deep resentment raged.<br/>
To wait his will two sacred heralds stood,<br/>
Talthybius and Eurybates the good.<br/>
"Haste to the fierce Achilles' tent (he cries),<br/>
Thence bear Briseis as our royal prize:<br/>
Submit he must; or if they will not part,<br/>
Ourself in arms shall tear her from his heart."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The unwilling heralds act their lord's commands;<br/>
Pensive they walk along the barren sands:<br/>
Arrived, the hero in his tent they find,<br/>
With gloomy aspect on his arm reclined.<br/>
At awful distance long they silent stand,<br/>
Loth to advance, and speak their hard command;<br/>
Decent confusion! This the godlike man<br/>
Perceived, and thus with accent mild began:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"With leave and honour enter our abodes,<br/>
Ye sacred ministers of men and gods!<br/>
I know your message; by constraint you came;<br/>
Not you, but your imperious lord I blame.<br/>
Patroclus, haste, the fair Briseis bring;<br/>
Conduct my captive to the haughty king.<br/>
But witness, heralds, and proclaim my vow,<br/>
Witness to gods above, and men below!<br/>
But first, and loudest, to your prince declare<br/>
(That lawless tyrant whose commands you bear),<br/>
Unmoved as death Achilles shall remain,<br/>
Though prostrate Greece shall bleed at every vein:<br/>
The raging chief in frantic passion lost,<br/>
Blind to himself, and useless to his host,<br/>
Unskill'd to judge the future by the past,<br/>
In blood and slaughter shall repent at last."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Patroclus now the unwilling beauty brought;<br/>
She, in soft sorrows, and in pensive thought,<br/>
Pass'd silent, as the heralds held her hand,<br/>
And oft look'd back, slow-moving o'er the strand.<br/>
Not so his loss the fierce Achilles bore;<br/>
But sad, retiring to the sounding shore,<br/>
O'er the wild margin of the deep he hung,<br/>
That kindred deep from whence his mother sprung:<br/>
There bathed in tears of anger and disdain,<br/>
Thus loud lamented to the stormy main:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O parent goddess! since in early bloom<br/>
Thy son must fall, by too severe a doom;<br/>
Sure to so short a race of glory born,<br/>
Great Jove in justice should this span adorn:<br/>
Honour and fame at least the thunderer owed;<br/>
And ill he pays the promise of a god,<br/>
If yon proud monarch thus thy son defies,<br/>
Obscures my glories, and resumes my prize."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Far from the deep recesses of the main,<br/>
Where aged Ocean holds his watery reign,<br/>
The goddess-mother heard. The waves divide;<br/>
And like a mist she rose above the tide;<br/>
Beheld him mourning on the naked shores,<br/>
And thus the sorrows of his soul explores.<br/>
"Why grieves my son? Thy anguish let me share;<br/>
Reveal the cause, and trust a parent's care."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He deeply sighing said: "To tell my woe<br/>
Is but to mention what too well you know.<br/>
From Thebe, sacred to Apollo's name<br/>
(Aetion's realm), our conquering army came,<br/>
With treasure loaded and triumphant spoils,<br/>
Whose just division crown'd the soldier's toils;<br/>
But bright Chryseis, heavenly prize! was led,<br/>
By vote selected, to the general's bed.<br/>
The priest of Phoebus sought by gifts to gain<br/>
His beauteous daughter from the victor's chain;<br/>
The fleet he reach'd, and, lowly bending down,<br/>
Held forth the sceptre and the laurel crown,<br/>
Intreating all; but chief implored for grace<br/>
The brother-kings of Atreus' royal race.<br/>
The generous Greeks their joint consent declare,<br/>
The priest to reverence, and release the fair;<br/>
Not so Atrides: he, with wonted pride,<br/>
The sire insulted, and his gifts denied:<br/>
The insulted sire (his god's peculiar care)<br/>
To Phoebus pray'd, and Phoebus heard the prayer:<br/>
A dreadful plague ensues: the avenging darts<br/>
Incessant fly, and pierce the Grecian hearts.<br/>
A prophet then, inspired by heaven, arose,<br/>
And points the crime, and thence derives the woes:<br/>
Myself the first the assembled chiefs incline<br/>
To avert the vengeance of the power divine;<br/>
Then rising in his wrath, the monarch storm'd;<br/>
Incensed he threaten'd, and his threats perform'd:<br/>
The fair Chryseis to her sire was sent,<br/>
With offer'd gifts to make the god relent;<br/>
But now he seized Briseis' heavenly charms,<br/>
And of my valour's prize defrauds my arms,<br/>
Defrauds the votes of all the Grecian train;<br/>
And service, faith, and justice, plead in vain.<br/>
But, goddess! thou thy suppliant son attend.<br/>
To high Olympus' shining court ascend,<br/>
Urge all the ties to former service owed,<br/>
And sue for vengeance to the thundering god.<br/>
Oft hast thou triumph'd in the glorious boast,<br/>
That thou stood'st forth of all the ethereal host,<br/>
When bold rebellion shook the realms above,<br/>
The undaunted guard of cloud-compelling Jove:<br/>
When the bright partner of his awful reign,<br/>
The warlike maid, and monarch of the main,<br/>
The traitor-gods, by mad ambition driven,<br/>
Durst threat with chains the omnipotence of Heaven.<br/>
Then, call'd by thee, the monster Titan came<br/>
(Whom gods Briareus, men Ægeon name),<br/>
Through wondering skies enormous stalk'd along;<br/>
Not he that shakes the solid earth so strong:<br/>
With giant-pride at Jove's high throne he stands,<br/>
And brandish'd round him all his hundred hands:<br/>
The affrighted gods confess'd their awful lord,<br/>
They dropp'd the fetters, trembled, and adored.<br/>
This, goddess, this to his remembrance call,<br/>
Embrace his knees, at his tribunal fall;<br/>
Conjure him far to drive the Grecian train,<br/>
To hurl them headlong to their fleet and main,<br/>
To heap the shores with copious death, and bring<br/>
The Greeks to know the curse of such a king.<br/>
Let Agamemnon lift his haughty head<br/>
O'er all his wide dominion of the dead,<br/>
And mourn in blood that e'er he durst disgrace<br/>
The boldest warrior of the Grecian race."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Unhappy son! (fair Thetis thus replies,<br/>
While tears celestial trickle from her eyes)<br/>
Why have I borne thee with a mother's throes,<br/>
To Fates averse, and nursed for future woes?<br/>
So short a space the light of heaven to view!<br/>
So short a space! and fill'd with sorrow too!<br/>
O might a parent's careful wish prevail,<br/>
Far, far from Ilion should thy vessels sail,<br/>
And thou, from camps remote, the danger shun<br/>
Which now, alas! too nearly threats my son.<br/>
Yet (what I can) to move thy suit I'll go<br/>
To great Olympus crown'd with fleecy snow.<br/>
Meantime, secure within thy ships, from far<br/>
Behold the field, not mingle in the war.<br/>
The sire of gods and all the ethereal train,<br/>
On the warm limits of the farthest main,<br/>
Now mix with mortals, nor disdain to grace<br/>
The feasts of Æthiopia's blameless race,<br/>
Twelve days the powers indulge the genial rite,<br/>
Returning with the twelfth revolving light.<br/>
Then will I mount the brazen dome, and move<br/>
The high tribunal of immortal Jove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The goddess spoke: the rolling waves unclose;<br/>
Then down the steep she plunged from whence she rose,<br/>
And left him sorrowing on the lonely coast,<br/>
In wild resentment for the fair he lost.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In Chrysa's port now sage Ulysses rode;<br/>
Beneath the deck the destined victims stow'd:<br/>
The sails they furl'd, they lash the mast aside,<br/>
And dropp'd their anchors, and the pinnace tied.<br/>
Next on the shore their hecatomb they land;<br/>
Chryseis last descending on the strand.<br/>
Her, thus returning from the furrow'd main,<br/>
Ulysses led to Phoebus' sacred fane;<br/>
Where at his solemn altar, as the maid<br/>
He gave to Chryses, thus the hero said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hail, reverend priest! to Phoebus' awful dome<br/>
A suppliant I from great Atrides come:<br/>
Unransom'd, here receive the spotless fair;<br/>
Accept the hecatomb the Greeks prepare;<br/>
And may thy god who scatters darts around,<br/>
Atoned by sacrifice, desist to wound."<br/>
</p>
<p>
At this, the sire embraced the maid again,<br/>
So sadly lost, so lately sought in vain.<br/>
Then near the altar of the darting king,<br/>
Disposed in rank their hecatomb they bring;<br/>
With water purify their hands, and take<br/>
The sacred offering of the salted cake;<br/>
While thus with arms devoutly raised in air,<br/>
And solemn voice, the priest directs his prayer:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"God of the silver bow, thy ear incline,<br/>
Whose power incircles Cilla the divine;<br/>
Whose sacred eye thy Tenedos surveys,<br/>
And gilds fair Chrysa with distinguish'd rays!<br/>
If, fired to vengeance at thy priest's request,<br/>
Thy direful darts inflict the raging pest:<br/>
Once more attend! avert the wasteful woe,<br/>
And smile propitious, and unbend thy bow."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So Chryses pray'd. Apollo heard his prayer:<br/>
And now the Greeks their hecatomb prepare;<br/>
Between their horns the salted barley threw,<br/>
And, with their heads to heaven, the victims slew:<br/>
The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide;<br/>
The thighs, selected to the gods, divide:<br/>
On these, in double cauls involved with art,<br/>
The choicest morsels lay from every part.<br/>
The priest himself before his altar stands,<br/>
And burns the offering with his holy hands.<br/>
Pours the black wine, and sees the flames aspire;<br/>
The youth with instruments surround the fire:<br/>
The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress'd,<br/>
The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest:<br/>
Then spread the tables, the repast prepare;<br/>
Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.<br/>
When now the rage of hunger was repress'd,<br/>
With pure libations they conclude the feast;<br/>
The youths with wine the copious goblets crown'd,<br/>
And, pleased, dispense the flowing bowls around;<br/>
With hymns divine the joyous banquet ends,<br/>
The paeans lengthen'd till the sun descends:<br/>
The Greeks, restored, the grateful notes prolong;<br/>
Apollo listens, and approves the song.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Twas night; the chiefs beside their vessel lie,<br/>
Till rosy morn had purpled o'er the sky:<br/>
Then launch, and hoist the mast: indulgent gales,<br/>
Supplied by Phoebus, fill the swelling sails;<br/>
The milk-white canvas bellying as they blow,<br/>
The parted ocean foams and roars below:<br/>
Above the bounding billows swift they flew,<br/>
Till now the Grecian camp appear'd in view.<br/>
Far on the beach they haul their bark to land,<br/>
(The crooked keel divides the yellow sand,)<br/>
Then part, where stretch'd along the winding bay,<br/>
The ships and tents in mingled prospect lay.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But raging still, amidst his navy sat<br/>
The stern Achilles, stedfast in his hate;<br/>
Nor mix'd in combat, nor in council join'd;<br/>
But wasting cares lay heavy on his mind:<br/>
In his black thoughts revenge and slaughter roll,<br/>
And scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Twelve days were past, and now the dawning light<br/>
The gods had summon'd to the Olympian height:<br/>
Jove, first ascending from the watery bowers,<br/>
Leads the long order of ethereal powers.<br/>
When, like the morning-mist in early day,<br/>
Rose from the flood the daughter of the sea:<br/>
And to the seats divine her flight address'd.<br/>
There, far apart, and high above the rest,<br/>
The thunderer sat; where old Olympus shrouds<br/>
His hundred heads in heaven, and props the clouds.<br/>
Suppliant the goddess stood: one hand she placed<br/>
Beneath his beard, and one his knees embraced.<br/>
"If e'er, O father of the gods! (she said)<br/>
My words could please thee, or my actions aid,<br/>
Some marks of honour on my son bestow,<br/>
And pay in glory what in life you owe.<br/>
Fame is at least by heavenly promise due<br/>
To life so short, and now dishonour'd too.<br/>
Avenge this wrong, O ever just and wise!<br/>
Let Greece be humbled, and the Trojans rise;<br/>
Till the proud king and all the Achaian race<br/>
Shall heap with honours him they now disgrace."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus Thetis spoke; but Jove in silence held<br/>
The sacred counsels of his breast conceal'd.<br/>
Not so repulsed, the goddess closer press'd,<br/>
Still grasp'd his knees, and urged the dear request.<br/>
"O sire of gods and men! thy suppliant hear;<br/>
Refuse, or grant; for what has Jove to fear?<br/>
Or oh! declare, of all the powers above,<br/>
Is wretched Thetis least the care of Jove?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
She said; and, sighing, thus the god replies,<br/>
Who rolls the thunder o'er the vaulted skies:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What hast thou ask'd? ah, why should Jove engage<br/>
In foreign contests and domestic rage,<br/>
The gods' complaints, and Juno's fierce alarms,<br/>
While I, too partial, aid the Trojan arms?<br/>
Go, lest the haughty partner of my sway<br/>
With jealous eyes thy close access survey;<br/>
But part in peace, secure thy prayer is sped:<br/>
Witness the sacred honours of our head,<br/>
The nod that ratifies the will divine,<br/>
The faithful, fix'd, irrevocable sign;<br/>
This seals thy suit, and this fulfils thy vows—"<br/>
He spoke, and awful bends his sable brows,<br/>
Shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod,<br/>
The stamp of fate and sanction of the god:<br/>
High heaven with trembling the dread signal took,<br/>
And all Olympus to the centre shook.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift to the seas profound the goddess flies,<br/>
Jove to his starry mansions in the skies.<br/>
The shining synod of the immortals wait<br/>
The coming god, and from their thrones of state<br/>
Arising silent, wrapp'd in holy fear,<br/>
Before the majesty of heaven appear.<br/>
Trembling they stand, while Jove assumes the throne,<br/>
All, but the god's imperious queen alone:<br/>
Late had she view'd the silver-footed dame,<br/>
And all her passions kindled into flame.<br/>
"Say, artful manager of heaven (she cries),<br/>
Who now partakes the secrets of the skies?<br/>
Thy Juno knows not the decrees of fate,<br/>
In vain the partner of imperial state.<br/>
What favourite goddess then those cares divides,<br/>
Which Jove in prudence from his consort hides?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
To this the thunderer: "Seek not thou to find<br/>
The sacred counsels of almighty mind:<br/>
Involved in darkness lies the great decree,<br/>
Nor can the depths of fate be pierced by thee.<br/>
What fits thy knowledge, thou the first shalt know;<br/>
The first of gods above, and men below;<br/>
But thou, nor they, shall search the thoughts that roll<br/>
Deep in the close recesses of my soul."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Full on the sire the goddess of the skies<br/>
Roll'd the large orbs of her majestic eyes,<br/>
And thus return'd:—"Austere Saturnius, say,<br/>
From whence this wrath, or who controls thy sway?<br/>
Thy boundless will, for me, remains in force,<br/>
And all thy counsels take the destined course.<br/>
But 'tis for Greece I fear: for late was seen,<br/>
In close consult, the silver-footed queen.<br/>
Jove to his Thetis nothing could deny,<br/>
Nor was the signal vain that shook the sky.<br/>
What fatal favour has the goddess won,<br/>
To grace her fierce, inexorable son?<br/>
Perhaps in Grecian blood to drench the plain,<br/>
And glut his vengeance with my people slain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus the god: "O restless fate of pride,<br/>
That strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide;<br/>
Vain is the search, presumptuous and abhorr'd,<br/>
Anxious to thee, and odious to thy lord.<br/>
Let this suffice: the immutable decree<br/>
No force can shake: what is, that ought to be.<br/>
Goddess, submit; nor dare our will withstand,<br/>
But dread the power of this avenging hand:<br/>
The united strength of all the gods above<br/>
In vain resists the omnipotence of Jove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The thunderer spoke, nor durst the queen reply;<br/>
A reverent horror silenced all the sky.<br/>
The feast disturb'd, with sorrow Vulcan saw<br/>
His mother menaced, and the gods in awe;<br/>
Peace at his heart, and pleasure his design,<br/>
Thus interposed the architect divine:<br/>
"The wretched quarrels of the mortal state<br/>
Are far unworthy, gods! of your debate:<br/>
Let men their days in senseless strife employ,<br/>
We, in eternal peace and constant joy.<br/>
Thou, goddess-mother, with our sire comply,<br/>
Nor break the sacred union of the sky:<br/>
Lest, roused to rage, he shake the bless'd abodes,<br/>
Launch the red lightning, and dethrone the gods.<br/>
If you submit, the thunderer stands appeased;<br/>
The gracious power is willing to be pleased."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus Vulcan spoke: and rising with a bound,<br/>
The double bowl with sparkling nectar crown'd,<br/>
Which held to Juno in a cheerful way,<br/>
"Goddess (he cried), be patient and obey.<br/>
Dear as you are, if Jove his arm extend,<br/>
I can but grieve, unable to defend.<br/>
What god so daring in your aid to move,<br/>
Or lift his hand against the force of Jove?<br/>
Once in your cause I felt his matchless might,<br/>
Hurl'd headlong down from the ethereal height;<br/>
Toss'd all the day in rapid circles round,<br/>
Nor till the sun descended touch'd the ground.<br/>
Breathless I fell, in giddy motion lost;<br/>
The Sinthians raised me on the Lemnian coast;<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and to her hands the goblet heaved,<br/>
Which, with a smile, the white-arm'd queen received<br/>
Then, to the rest he fill'd; and in his turn,<br/>
Each to his lips applied the nectar'd urn,<br/>
Vulcan with awkward grace his office plies,<br/>
And unextinguish'd laughter shakes the skies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus the blest gods the genial day prolong,<br/>
In feasts ambrosial, and celestial song.<br/>
Apollo tuned the lyre; the Muses round<br/>
With voice alternate aid the silver sound.<br/>
Meantime the radiant sun to mortal sight<br/>
Descending swift, roll'd down the rapid light:<br/>
Then to their starry domes the gods depart,<br/>
The shining monuments of Vulcan's art:<br/>
Jove on his couch reclined his awful head,<br/>
And Juno slumber'd on the golden bed.<br/>

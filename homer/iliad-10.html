<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book X</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
All night the chiefs before their vessels lay,<br/>
And lost in sleep the labours of the day:<br/>
All but the king: with various thoughts oppress'd,<br/>
His country's cares lay rolling in his breast.<br/>
As when by lightnings Jove's ethereal power<br/>
Foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,<br/>
Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,<br/>
Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar;<br/>
By fits one flash succeeds as one expires,<br/>
And heaven flames thick with momentary fires:<br/>
So bursting frequent from Atrides' breast,<br/>
Sighs following sighs his inward fears confess'd.<br/>
Now o'er the fields, dejected, he surveys<br/>
From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;<br/>
Hears in the passing wind their music blow,<br/>
And marks distinct the voices of the foe.<br/>
Now looking backwards to the fleet and coast,<br/>
Anxious he sorrows for the endangered host.<br/>
He rends his hair, in sacrifice to Jove,<br/>
And sues to him that ever lives above:<br/>
Inly he groans; while glory and despair<br/>
Divide his heart, and wage a double war.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;<br/>
To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,<br/>
With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate<br/>
What yet remains to save the afflicted state.<br/>
He rose, and first he cast his mantle round,<br/>
Next on his feet the shining sandals bound;<br/>
A lion's yellow spoils his back conceal'd;<br/>
His warlike hand a pointed javelin held.<br/>
Meanwhile his brother, press'd with equal woes,<br/>
Alike denied the gifts of soft repose,<br/>
Laments for Greece, that in his cause before<br/>
So much had suffer'd and must suffer more.<br/>
A leopard's spotted hide his shoulders spread:<br/>
A brazen helmet glitter'd on his head:<br/>
Thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went<br/>
To wake Atrides in the royal tent.<br/>
Already waked, Atrides he descried,<br/>
His armour buckling at his vessel's side.<br/>
Joyful they met; the Spartan thus begun:<br/>
"Why puts my brother his bright armour on?<br/>
Sends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,<br/>
To try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?<br/>
But say, what hero shall sustain that task?<br/>
Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask;<br/>
Guideless, alone, through night's dark shade to go,<br/>
And midst a hostile camp explore the foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the king: "In such distress we stand,<br/>
No vulgar counsel our affairs demand;<br/>
Greece to preserve, is now no easy part,<br/>
But asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.<br/>
For Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,<br/>
And bows his head to Hector's sacrifice.<br/>
What eye has witness'd, or what ear believed,<br/>
In one great day, by one great arm achieved,<br/>
Such wondrous deeds as Hector's hand has done,<br/>
And we beheld, the last revolving sun?<br/>
What honours the beloved of Jove adorn!<br/>
Sprung from no god, and of no goddess born;<br/>
Yet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,<br/>
And curse the battle where their fathers fell.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,<br/>
There call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;<br/>
Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair;<br/>
To keep the guards on duty be his care,<br/>
(For Nestor's influence best that quarter guides,<br/>
Whose son with Merion, o'er the watch presides.")<br/>
To whom the Spartan: "These thy orders borne,<br/>
Say, shall I stay, or with despatch return?"<br/>
"There shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)<br/>
Else may we miss to meet, without a guide,<br/>
The paths so many, and the camp so wide.<br/>
Still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,<br/>
Urge by their fathers' fame their future praise.<br/>
Forget we now our state and lofty birth;<br/>
Not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.<br/>
To labour is the lot of man below;<br/>
And when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, each parted to his several cares:<br/>
The king to Nestor's sable ship repairs;<br/>
The sage protector of the Greeks he found<br/>
Stretch'd in his bed with all his arms around;<br/>
The various-colour'd scarf, the shield he rears,<br/>
The shining helmet, and the pointed spears;<br/>
The dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage,<br/>
That, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.<br/>
Then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,<br/>
The hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,<br/>
While others sleep, thus range the camp alone;<br/>
Seek'st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?<br/>
Stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin'd,)<br/>
Pride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!<br/>
Lo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,<br/>
The unhappy general of the Grecian bands,<br/>
Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,<br/>
And woes, that only with his life shall end!<br/>
Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,<br/>
And scarce my heart support its load of pain.<br/>
No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,<br/>
Confused, and sad, I wander thus alone,<br/>
With fears distracted, with no fix'd design;<br/>
And all my people's miseries are mine.<br/>
If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,<br/>
(Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)<br/>
Impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;<br/>
Now let us jointly to the trench descend,<br/>
At every gate the fainting guard excite,<br/>
Tired with the toils of day and watch of night;<br/>
Else may the sudden foe our works invade,<br/>
So near, and favour'd by the gloomy shade."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To him thus Nestor: "Trust the powers above,<br/>
Nor think proud Hector's hopes confirm'd by Jove:<br/>
How ill agree the views of vain mankind,<br/>
And the wise counsels of the eternal mind!<br/>
Audacious Hector, if the gods ordain<br/>
That great Achilles rise and rage again,<br/>
What toils attend thee, and what woes remain!<br/>
Lo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;<br/>
The care is next our other chiefs to raise:<br/>
Ulysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;<br/>
Meges for strength, Oileus famed for speed.<br/>
Some other be despatch'd of nimbler feet,<br/>
To those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,<br/>
Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.<br/>
To rouse the Spartan I myself decree;<br/>
Dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,<br/>
Yet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share<br/>
With his great brother in his martial care:<br/>
Him it behoved to every chief to sue,<br/>
Preventing every part perform'd by you;<br/>
For strong necessity our toils demands,<br/>
Claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the king: "With reverence we allow<br/>
Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:<br/>
My generous brother is of gentle kind,<br/>
He seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;<br/>
Through too much deference to our sovereign sway,<br/>
Content to follow when we lead the way:<br/>
But now, our ills industrious to prevent,<br/>
Long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.<br/>
The chiefs you named, already at his call,<br/>
Prepare to meet us near the navy-wall;<br/>
Assembling there, between the trench and gates,<br/>
Near the night-guards, our chosen council waits."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,<br/>
For great examples justify command."<br/>
With that, the venerable warrior rose;<br/>
The shining greaves his manly legs enclose;<br/>
His purple mantle golden buckles join'd,<br/>
Warm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.<br/>
Then rushing from his tent, he snatch'd in haste<br/>
His steely lance, that lighten'd as he pass'd.<br/>
The camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,<br/>
Stopp'd at Ulysses' tent, and call'd aloud.<br/>
Ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,<br/>
Awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.<br/>
"What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,<br/>
Thus leads you wandering in the silent night?"<br/>
"O prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)<br/>
Wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:<br/>
Whatever means of safety can be sought,<br/>
Whatever counsels can inspire our thought,<br/>
Whatever methods, or to fly or fight;<br/>
All, all depend on this important night!"<br/>
He heard, return'd, and took his painted shield;<br/>
Then join'd the chiefs, and follow'd through the field.<br/>
Without his tent, bold Diomed they found,<br/>
All sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:<br/>
Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,<br/>
His head reclining on his bossy shield.<br/>
A wood of spears stood by, that, fix'd upright,<br/>
Shot from their flashing points a quivering light.<br/>
A bull's black hide composed the hero's bed;<br/>
A splendid carpet roll'd beneath his head.<br/>
Then, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes<br/>
The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong<br/>
Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.<br/>
But sleep'st thou now, when from yon hill the foe<br/>
Hangs o'er the fleet, and shades our walls below?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
At this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;<br/>
The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:<br/>
"Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,<br/>
Though years and honours bid thee seek repose,<br/>
Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;<br/>
Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake."<br/>
"My friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;<br/>
These toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;<br/>
Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire<br/>
To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:<br/>
But now the last despair surrounds our host;<br/>
No hour must pass, no moment must be lost;<br/>
Each single Greek, in this conclusive strife,<br/>
Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:<br/>
Yet, if my years thy kind regard engage,<br/>
Employ thy youth as I employ my age;<br/>
Succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;<br/>
He serves me most, who serves his country best."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, the hero o'er his shoulders flung<br/>
A lion's spoils, that to his ankles hung;<br/>
Then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.<br/>
Meges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,<br/>
The warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;<br/>
A wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:<br/>
The unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,<br/>
And, couching close, repel invading sleep.<br/>
So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,<br/>
With toil protected from the prowling train;<br/>
When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,<br/>
Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold:<br/>
Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;<br/>
Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear<br/>
Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,<br/>
Watch every side, and turn to every sound.<br/>
Thus watch'd the Grecians, cautious of surprise,<br/>
Each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:<br/>
Each step of passing feet increased the affright;<br/>
And hostile Troy was ever full in sight.<br/>
Nestor with joy the wakeful band survey'd,<br/>
And thus accosted through the gloomy shade.<br/>
"'Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ;<br/>
Else must our host become the scorn of Troy.<br/>
Watch thus, and Greece shall live." The hero said;<br/>
Then o'er the trench the following chieftains led.<br/>
His son, and godlike Merion, march'd behind<br/>
(For these the princes to their council join'd).<br/>
The trenches pass'd, the assembled kings around<br/>
In silent state the consistory crown'd.<br/>
A place there was, yet undefiled with gore,<br/>
The spot where Hector stopp'd his rage before;<br/>
When night descending, from his vengeful hand<br/>
Reprieved the relics of the Grecian band:<br/>
(The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,<br/>
And all his progress mark'd by heaps of dead:)<br/>
There sat the mournful kings: when Neleus' son,<br/>
The council opening, in these words begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,<br/>
His life to hazard, and his country save?<br/>
Lives there a man, who singly dares to go<br/>
To yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?<br/>
Or favour'd by the night approach so near,<br/>
Their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?<br/>
If to besiege our navies they prepare,<br/>
Or Troy once more must be the seat of war?<br/>
This could he learn, and to our peers recite,<br/>
And pass unharm'd the dangers of the night;<br/>
What fame were his through all succeeding days,<br/>
While Phoebus shines, or men have tongues to praise!<br/>
What gifts his grateful country would bestow!<br/>
What must not Greece to her deliverer owe?<br/>
A sable ewe each leader should provide,<br/>
With each a sable lambkin by her side;<br/>
At every rite his share should be increased,<br/>
And his the foremost honours of the feast."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,<br/>
Tydides spoke&mdash;"The man you seek is here.<br/>
Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,<br/>
Some god within commands, and I obey.<br/>
But let some other chosen warrior join,<br/>
To raise my hopes, and second my design.<br/>
By mutual confidence and mutual aid,<br/>
Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made;<br/>
The wise new prudence from the wise acquire,<br/>
And one brave hero fans another's fire."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Contending leaders at the word arose;<br/>
Each generous breast with emulation glows;<br/>
So brave a task each Ajax strove to share,<br/>
Bold Merion strove, and Nestor's valiant heir;<br/>
The Spartan wish'd the second place to gain,<br/>
And great Ulysses wish'd, nor wish'd in vain.<br/>
Then thus the king of men the contest ends:<br/>
"Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,<br/>
Undaunted Diomed! what chief to join<br/>
In this great enterprise, is only thine.<br/>
Just be thy choice, without affection made;<br/>
To birth, or office, no respect be paid;<br/>
Let worth determine here." The monarch spake,<br/>
And inly trembled for his brother's sake.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin'd)<br/>
My choice declares the impulse of my mind.<br/>
How can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands<br/>
To lend his counsels and assist our hands?<br/>
A chief, whose safety is Minerva's care;<br/>
So famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:<br/>
Bless'd in his conduct, I no aid require;<br/>
Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"It fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,<br/>
(Replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:<br/>
Praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,<br/>
Are lost on hearers that our merits know.<br/>
But let us haste&mdash;Night rolls the hours away,<br/>
The reddening orient shows the coming day,<br/>
The stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,<br/>
And of night's empire but a third remains."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus having spoke, with generous ardour press'd,<br/>
In arms terrific their huge limbs they dress'd.<br/>
A two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,<br/>
And ample buckler, to Tydides gave:<br/>
Then in a leathern helm he cased his head,<br/>
Short of its crest, and with no plume o'erspread:<br/>
(Such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)<br/>
No spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.<br/>
Next him Ulysses took a shining sword,<br/>
A bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:<br/>
A well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,<br/>
(Thy gift, Meriones,) his temples crown'd;<br/>
Soft wool within; without, in order spread,<br/>
A boar's white teeth grinn'd horrid o'er his head.<br/>
This from Amyntor, rich Ormenus' son,<br/>
Autolycus by fraudful rapine won,<br/>
And gave Amphidamas; from him the prize<br/>
Molus received, the pledge of social ties;<br/>
The helmet next by Merion was possess'd,<br/>
And now Ulysses' thoughtful temples press'd.<br/>
Thus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,<br/>
And dark through paths oblique their progress take.<br/>
Just then, in sign she favour'd their intent,<br/>
A long-wing'd heron great Minerva sent:<br/>
This, though surrounding shades obscured their view,<br/>
By the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.<br/>
As from the right she soar'd, Ulysses pray'd,<br/>
Hail'd the glad omen, and address'd the maid:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O daughter of that god whose arm can wield<br/>
The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield!<br/>
O thou! for ever present in my way,<br/>
Who all my motions, all my toils survey!<br/>
Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,<br/>
Safe by thy succour to our ships convey'd,<br/>
And let some deed this signal night adorn,<br/>
To claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then godlike Diomed preferr'd his prayer:<br/>
"Daughter of Jove, unconquer'd Pallas! hear.<br/>
Great queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,<br/>
As thou defend'st the sire, defend the son.<br/>
When on Æsopus' banks the banded powers<br/>
Of Greece he left, and sought the Theban towers,<br/>
Peace was his charge; received with peaceful show,<br/>
He went a legate, but return'd a foe:<br/>
Then help'd by thee, and cover'd by thy shield,<br/>
He fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.<br/>
So now be present, O celestial maid!<br/>
So still continue to the race thine aid!<br/>
A youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,<br/>
Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,<br/>
With ample forehead, and with spreading horns,<br/>
Whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns."<br/>
The heroes pray'd, and Pallas from the skies<br/>
Accords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.<br/>
Now, like two lions panting for the prey,<br/>
With dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,<br/>
Through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,<br/>
Through dust, through blood, o'er arms, and hills of slain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor less bold Hector, and the sons of Troy,<br/>
On high designs the wakeful hours employ;<br/>
The assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;<br/>
Who thus the counsels of his breast proposed:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What glorious man, for high attempts prepared,<br/>
Dares greatly venture for a rich reward?<br/>
Of yonder fleet a bold discovery make,<br/>
What watch they keep, and what resolves they take?<br/>
If now subdued they meditate their flight,<br/>
And, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?<br/>
His be the chariot that shall please him most,<br/>
Of all the plunder of the vanquish'd host;<br/>
His the fair steeds that all the rest excel,<br/>
And his the glory to have served so well."<br/>
</p>
<p>
A youth there was among the tribes of Troy,<br/>
Dolon his name, Eumedes' only boy,<br/>
(Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)<br/>
Rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;<br/>
Not bless'd by nature with the charms of face,<br/>
But swift of foot, and matchless in the race.<br/>
"Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meet<br/>
This high achievement, and explore the fleet:<br/>
But first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,<br/>
And swear to grant me the demanded prize;<br/>
The immortal coursers, and the glittering car,<br/>
That bear Pelides through the ranks of war.<br/>
Encouraged thus, no idle scout I go,<br/>
Fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,<br/>
Even to the royal tent pursue my way,<br/>
And all their counsels, all their aims betray."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,<br/>
Attesting thus the monarch of the sky:<br/>
"Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!<br/>
Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:<br/>
By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,<br/>
And him alone the immortal steeds adorn."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus Hector swore: the gods were call'd in vain,<br/>
But the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:<br/>
Across his back the bended bow he flung,<br/>
A wolf's grey hide around his shoulders hung,<br/>
A ferret's downy fur his helmet lined,<br/>
And in his hand a pointed javelin shined.<br/>
Then (never to return) he sought the shore,<br/>
And trod the path his feet must tread no more.<br/>
Scarce had he pass'd the steeds and Trojan throng,<br/>
(Still bending forward as he coursed along,)<br/>
When, on the hollow way, the approaching tread<br/>
Ulysses mark'd, and thus to Diomed;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,<br/>
Moving this way, or hastening to the fleet;<br/>
Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;<br/>
Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.<br/>
Yet let him pass, and win a little space;<br/>
Then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.<br/>
But if too swift of foot he flies before,<br/>
Confine his course along the fleet and shore,<br/>
Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,<br/>
And intercept his hoped return to Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With that they stepp'd aside, and stoop'd their head,<br/>
(As Dolon pass'd,) behind a heap of dead:<br/>
Along the path the spy unwary flew;<br/>
Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.<br/>
So distant they, and such the space between,<br/>
As when two teams of mules divide the green,<br/>
(To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)<br/>
When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.<br/>
Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass'd;<br/>
Hector (he thought) had sent, and check'd his haste,<br/>
Till scarce at distance of a javelin's throw,<br/>
No voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.<br/>
As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;<br/>
Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;<br/>
Now lost, now seen, they intercept his way,<br/>
And from the herd still turn the flying prey:<br/>
So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;<br/>
So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.<br/>
Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,<br/>
And mingles with the guards that watch the walls;<br/>
When brave Tydides stopp'd; a gen'rous thought<br/>
(Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,<br/>
Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance,<br/>
And snatch the glory from his lifted lance.<br/>
Then thus aloud: "Whoe'er thou art, remain;<br/>
This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain."<br/>
He said, and high in air the weapon cast,<br/>
Which wilful err'd, and o'er his shoulder pass'd;<br/>
Then fix'd in earth. Against the trembling wood<br/>
The wretch stood propp'd, and quiver'd as he stood;<br/>
A sudden palsy seized his turning head;<br/>
His loose teeth chatter'd, and his colour fled;<br/>
The panting warriors seize him as he stands,<br/>
And with unmanly tears his life demands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O spare my youth, and for the breath I owe,<br/>
Large gifts of price my father shall bestow:<br/>
Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,<br/>
And steel well-temper'd and refulgent gold."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom Ulysses made this wise reply:<br/>
"Whoe'er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.<br/>
What moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,<br/>
To roam the silent fields in dead of night?<br/>
Cam'st thou the secrets of our camp to find,<br/>
By Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?<br/>
Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,<br/>
Through heaps of carnage, to despoil the dead?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus pale Dolon, with a fearful look:<br/>
(Still, as he spoke, his limbs with horror shook:)<br/>
"Hither I came, by Hector's words deceived;<br/>
Much did he promise, rashly I believed:<br/>
No less a bribe than great Achilles' car,<br/>
And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,<br/>
Urged me, unwilling, this attempt to make;<br/>
To learn what counsels, what resolves you take:<br/>
If now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,<br/>
And, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,<br/>
(Ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies,)<br/>
Far other rulers those proud steeds demand,<br/>
And scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;<br/>
Even great Achilles scarce their rage can tame,<br/>
Achilles sprung from an immortal dame.<br/>
But say, be faithful, and the truth recite!<br/>
Where lies encamp'd the Trojan chief to-night?<br/>
Where stand his coursers? in what quarter sleep<br/>
Their other princes? tell what watch they keep:<br/>
Say, since this conquest, what their counsels are;<br/>
Or here to combat, from their city far,<br/>
Or back to Ilion's walls transfer the war?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ulysses thus, and thus Eumedes' son:<br/>
"What Dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own.<br/>
Hector, the peers assembling in his tent,<br/>
A council holds at Ilus' monument.<br/>
No certain guards the nightly watch partake;<br/>
Where'er yon fires ascend, the Trojans wake:<br/>
Anxious for Troy, the guard the natives keep;<br/>
Safe in their cares, the auxiliar forces sleep,<br/>
Whose wives and infants, from the danger far,<br/>
Discharge their souls of half the fears of war."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then sleep those aids among the Trojan train,<br/>
(Inquired the chief,) or scattered o'er the plain?"<br/>
To whom the spy: "Their powers they thus dispose<br/>
The Paeons, dreadful with their bended bows,<br/>
The Carians, Caucons, the Pelasgian host,<br/>
And Leleges, encamp along the coast.<br/>
Not distant far, lie higher on the land<br/>
The Lycian, Mysian, and Maeonian band,<br/>
And Phrygia's horse, by Thymbras' ancient wall;<br/>
The Thracians utmost, and apart from all.<br/>
These Troy but lately to her succour won,<br/>
Led on by Rhesus, great Eioneus' son:<br/>
I saw his coursers in proud triumph go,<br/>
Swift as the wind, and white as winter-snow;<br/>
Rich silver plates his shining car infold;<br/>
His solid arms, refulgent, flame with gold;<br/>
No mortal shoulders suit the glorious load,<br/>
Celestial panoply, to grace a god!<br/>
Let me, unhappy, to your fleet be borne,<br/>
Or leave me here, a captive's fate to mourn,<br/>
In cruel chains, till your return reveal<br/>
The truth or falsehood of the news I tell."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To this Tydides, with a gloomy frown:<br/>
"Think not to live, though all the truth be shown:<br/>
Shall we dismiss thee, in some future strife<br/>
To risk more bravely thy now forfeit life?<br/>
Or that again our camps thou may'st explore?<br/>
No&mdash;once a traitor, thou betray'st no more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sternly he spoke, and as the wretch prepared<br/>
With humble blandishment to stroke his beard,<br/>
Like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew,<br/>
Divides the neck, and cuts the nerves in two;<br/>
One instant snatch'd his trembling soul to hell,<br/>
The head, yet speaking, mutter'd as it fell.<br/>
The furry helmet from his brow they tear,<br/>
The wolf's grey hide, the unbended bow and spear;<br/>
These great Ulysses lifting to the skies,<br/>
To favouring Pallas dedicates the prize:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Great queen of arms, receive this hostile spoil,<br/>
And let the Thracian steeds reward our toil;<br/>
Thee, first of all the heavenly host, we praise;<br/>
O speed our labours, and direct our ways!"<br/>
This said, the spoils, with dropping gore defaced,<br/>
High on a spreading tamarisk he placed;<br/>
Then heap'd with reeds and gathered boughs the plain,<br/>
To guide their footsteps to the place again.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through the still night they cross the devious fields,<br/>
Slippery with blood, o'er arms and heaps of shields,<br/>
Arriving where the Thracian squadrons lay,<br/>
And eased in sleep the labours of the day.<br/>
Ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band:<br/>
The horses yoked beside each warrior stand.<br/>
Their arms in order on the ground reclined,<br/>
Through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined:<br/>
Amidst lay Rhesus, stretch'd in sleep profound,<br/>
And the white steeds behind his chariot bound.<br/>
The welcome sight Ulysses first descries,<br/>
And points to Diomed the tempting prize.<br/>
"The man, the coursers, and the car behold!<br/>
Described by Dolon, with the arms of gold.<br/>
Now, brave Tydides! now thy courage try,<br/>
Approach the chariot, and the steeds untie;<br/>
Or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds,<br/>
Urge thou the slaughter, while I seize the steeds."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pallas (this said) her hero's bosom warms,<br/>
Breathed in his heart, and strung his nervous arms;<br/>
Where'er he pass'd, a purple stream pursued<br/>
His thirsty falchion, fat with hostile blood,<br/>
Bathed all his footsteps, dyed the fields with gore,<br/>
And a low groan remurmur'd through the shore.<br/>
So the grim lion, from his nightly den,<br/>
O'erleaps the fences, and invades the pen,<br/>
On sheep or goats, resistless in his way,<br/>
He falls, and foaming rends the guardless prey;<br/>
Nor stopp'd the fury of his vengeful hand,<br/>
Till twelve lay breathless of the Thracian band.<br/>
Ulysses following, as his partner slew,<br/>
Back by the foot each slaughter'd warrior drew;<br/>
The milk-white coursers studious to convey<br/>
Safe to the ships, he wisely cleared the way:<br/>
Lest the fierce steeds, not yet to battles bred,<br/>
Should start, and tremble at the heaps of dead.<br/>
Now twelve despatch'd, the monarch last they found;<br/>
Tydides' falchion fix'd him to the ground.<br/>
Just then a deathful dream Minerva sent,<br/>
A warlike form appear'd before his tent,<br/>
Whose visionary steel his bosom tore:<br/>
So dream'd the monarch, and awaked no more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ulysses now the snowy steeds detains,<br/>
And leads them, fasten'd by the silver reins;<br/>
These, with his bow unbent, he lash'd along;<br/>
(The scourge forgot, on Rhesus' chariot hung;)<br/>
Then gave his friend the signal to retire;<br/>
But him, new dangers, new achievements fire;<br/>
Doubtful he stood, or with his reeking blade<br/>
To send more heroes to the infernal shade,<br/>
Drag off the car where Rhesus' armour lay,<br/>
Or heave with manly force, and lift away.<br/>
While unresolved the son of Tydeus stands,<br/>
Pallas appears, and thus her chief commands:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Enough, my son; from further slaughter cease,<br/>
Regard thy safety, and depart in peace;<br/>
Haste to the ships, the gotten spoils enjoy,<br/>
Nor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The voice divine confess'd the martial maid;<br/>
In haste he mounted, and her word obey'd;<br/>
The coursers fly before Ulysses' bow,<br/>
Swift as the wind, and white as winter-snow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Not unobserved they pass'd: the god of light<br/>
Had watch'd his Troy, and mark'd Minerva's flight,<br/>
Saw Tydeus' son with heavenly succour bless'd,<br/>
And vengeful anger fill'd his sacred breast.<br/>
Swift to the Trojan camp descends the power,<br/>
And wakes Hippocoon in the morning-hour;<br/>
(On Rhesus' side accustom'd to attend,<br/>
A faithful kinsman, and instructive friend;)<br/>
He rose, and saw the field deform'd with blood,<br/>
An empty space where late the coursers stood,<br/>
The yet-warm Thracians panting on the coast;<br/>
For each he wept, but for his Rhesus most:<br/>
Now while on Rhesus' name he calls in vain,<br/>
The gathering tumult spreads o'er all the plain;<br/>
On heaps the Trojans rush, with wild affright,<br/>
And wondering view the slaughters of the night.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the chiefs, arriving at the shade<br/>
Where late the spoils of Hector's spy were laid,<br/>
Ulysses stopp'd; to him Tydides bore<br/>
The trophy, dropping yet with Dolon's gore:<br/>
Then mounts again; again their nimbler feet<br/>
The coursers ply, and thunder towards the fleet.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Old Nestor first perceived the approaching sound,<br/>
Bespeaking thus the Grecian peers around:<br/>
"Methinks the noise of trampling steeds I hear,<br/>
Thickening this way, and gathering on my ear;<br/>
Perhaps some horses of the Trojan breed<br/>
(So may, ye gods! my pious hopes succeed)<br/>
The great Tydides and Ulysses bear,<br/>
Return'd triumphant with this prize of war.<br/>
Yet much I fear (ah, may that fear be vain!)<br/>
The chiefs outnumber'd by the Trojan train;<br/>
Perhaps, even now pursued, they seek the shore;<br/>
Or, oh! perhaps those heroes are no more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Scarce had he spoke, when, lo! the chiefs appear,<br/>
And spring to earth; the Greeks dismiss their fear:<br/>
With words of friendship and extended hands<br/>
They greet the kings; and Nestor first demands:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Say thou, whose praises all our host proclaim,<br/>
Thou living glory of the Grecian name!<br/>
Say whence these coursers? by what chance bestow'd,<br/>
The spoil of foes, or present of a god?<br/>
Not those fair steeds, so radiant and so gay,<br/>
That draw the burning chariot of the day.<br/>
Old as I am, to age I scorn to yield,<br/>
And daily mingle in the martial field;<br/>
But sure till now no coursers struck my sight<br/>
Like these, conspicuous through the ranks of fight.<br/>
Some god, I deem, conferred the glorious prize,<br/>
Bless'd as ye are, and favourites of the skies;<br/>
The care of him who bids the thunder roar,<br/>
And her, whose fury bathes the world with gore."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Father! not so, (sage Ithacus rejoin'd,)<br/>
The gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind.<br/>
Of Thracian lineage are the steeds ye view,<br/>
Whose hostile king the brave Tydides slew;<br/>
Sleeping he died, with all his guards around,<br/>
And twelve beside lay gasping on the ground.<br/>
These other spoils from conquer'd Dolon came,<br/>
A wretch, whose swiftness was his only fame;<br/>
By Hector sent our forces to explore,<br/>
He now lies headless on the sandy shore."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then o'er the trench the bounding coursers flew;<br/>
The joyful Greeks with loud acclaim pursue.<br/>
Straight to Tydides' high pavilion borne,<br/>
The matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn:<br/>
The neighing coursers their new fellows greet,<br/>
And the full racks are heap'd with generous wheat.<br/>
But Dolon's armour, to his ships convey'd,<br/>
High on the painted stern Ulysses laid,<br/>
A trophy destin'd to the blue-eyed maid.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain<br/>
They cleanse their bodies in the neighb'ring main:<br/>
Then in the polished bath, refresh'd from toil,<br/>
Their joints they supple with dissolving oil,<br/>
In due repast indulge the genial hour,<br/>
And first to Pallas the libations pour:<br/>
They sit, rejoicing in her aid divine,<br/>
And the crown'd goblet foams with floods of wine.<br/>

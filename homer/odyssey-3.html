<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book IIII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
The sacred sun, above the waters raised,<br/>
Through heaven's eternal brazen portals blazed;<br/>
And wide o'er earth diffused his cheering ray,<br/>
To gods and men to give the golden day.<br/>
Now on the coast of Pyle the vessel falls,<br/>
Before old Neleus' venerable walls.<br/>
There suppliant to the monarch of the flood,<br/>
At nine green theatres the Pylians stood,<br/>
Each held five hundred (a deputed train),<br/>
At each, nine oxen on the sand lay slain.<br/>
They taste the entrails, and the altars load<br/>
With smoking thighs, an offering to the god.<br/>
Full for the port the Ithacensians stand,<br/>
And furl their sails, and issue on the land.<br/>
Telemachus already press'd the shore;<br/>
Not first, the power of wisdom march'd before,<br/>
And ere the sacrificing throng he join'd,<br/>
Admonish'd thus his well-attending mind:
</p>
<p>
"Proceed, my son! this youthful shame expel;<br/>
An honest business never blush to tell.<br/>
To learn what fates thy wretched sire detain,<br/>
We pass'd the wide immeasurable main.<br/>
Meet then the senior far renown'd for sense<br/>
With reverend awe, but decent confidence:<br/>
Urge him with truth to frame his fair replies;<br/>
And sure he will; for wisdom never lies."
</p>
<p>
"Oh tell me, Mentor! tell me, faithful guide<br/>
(The youth with prudent modesty replied),<br/>
How shall I meet, or how accost the sage,<br/>
Unskill'd in speech, nor yet mature of age?<br/>
Awful th'approach, and hard the task appears,<br/>
To question wisely men of riper years."
</p>
<p>
To whom the martial goddess thus rejoin'd:<br/>
"Search, for some thoughts, thy own suggesting mind;<br/>
And others, dictated by heavenly power,<br/>
Shall rise spontaneous in the needful hour.<br/>
For nought unprosperous shall thy ways attend,<br/>
Born with good omens, and with heaven thy friend."
</p>
<p>
She spoke, and led the way with swiftest speed;<br/>
As swift, the youth pursued the way she led;<br/>
and join'd the band before the sacred fire,<br/>
Where sate, encompass'd with his sons, the sire.<br/>
The youth of Pylos, some on pointed wood<br/>
Transfix'd the fragments, some prepared the food:<br/>
In friendly throngs they gather to embrace<br/>
Their unknown guests, and at the banquet place,<br/>
Pisistratus was first to grasp their hands,<br/>
And spread soft hides upon the yellow sands;<br/>
Along the shore the illustrious pair he led,<br/>
Where Nestor sate with youthful Thrasymed,<br/>
To each a portion of the feast he bore,<br/>
And held the golden goblet foaming o'er;<br/>
Then first approaching to the elder guest,<br/>
The latent goddess in these words address'd:<br/>
"Whoe'er thou art, whom fortune brings to keep<br/>
These rites of Neptune, monarch of the deep,<br/>
Thee first it fits, O stranger! to prepare<br/>
The due libation and the solemn prayer;<br/>
Then give thy friend to shed the sacred wine;<br/>
Though much thy younger, and his years like mine,<br/>
He too, I deem, implores the power divine;<br/>
For all mankind alike require their grace,<br/>
All born to want; a miserable race!"<br/>
He spake, and to her hand preferr'd the bowl;<br/>
A secret pleasure touch'd Athena's soul,<br/>
To see the preference due to sacred age<br/>
Regarded ever by the just and sage.<br/>
Of Ocean's king she then implores the grace.<br/>
"O thou! whose arms this ample globe embrace,<br/>
Fulfil our wish, and let thy glory shine<br/>
On Nestor first, and Nestor's royal line;<br/>
Next grant the Pylian states their just desires,<br/>
Pleased with their hecatomb's ascending fires;<br/>
Last, deign Telemachus and me to bless,<br/>
And crown our voyage with desired success."
</p>
<p>
Thus she: and having paid the rite divine,<br/>
Gave to Ulysses' son the rosy wine.<br/>
Suppliant he pray'd. And now the victims dress'd<br/>
They draw, divide, and celebrate the feast.<br/>
The banquet done, the narrative old man,<br/>
Thus mild, the pleasing conference began:
</p>
<p>
"Now gentle guests! the genial banquet o'er,<br/>
It fits to ask ye, what your native shore,<br/>
And whence your race? on what adventure say,<br/>
Thus far you wander through the watery way?<br/>
Relate if business, or the thirst of gain,<br/>
Engage your journey o'er the pathless main<br/>
Where savage pirates seek through seas unknown<br/>
The lives of others, venturous of their own."
</p>
<p>
Urged by the precepts by the goddess given,<br/>
And fill'd with confidence infused from Heaven,<br/>
The youth, whom Pallas destined to be wise<br/>
And famed among the sons of men, replies:<br/>
"Inquir'st thou, father! from what coast we came?<br/>
(Oh grace and glory of the Grecian name!)<br/>
From where high Ithaca o'erlooks the floods,<br/>
Brown with o'er-arching shades and pendent woods<br/>
Us to these shores our filial duty draws,<br/>
A private sorrow, not a public cause.<br/>
My sire I seek, where'er the voice of fame<br/>
Has told the glories of his noble name,<br/>
The great Ulysses; famed from shore to shore<br/>
For valour much, for hardy suffering more.<br/>
Long time with thee before proud Ilion's wall<br/>
In arms he fought; with thee beheld her fall.<br/>
Of all the chiefs, this hero's fate alone<br/>
Has Jove reserved, unheard of, and unknown;<br/>
Whether in fields by hostile fury slain,<br/>
Or sunk by tempests in the gulfy main?<br/>
Of this to learn, oppress'd with tender fears,<br/>
Lo, at thy knee his suppliant son appears.<br/>
If or thy certain eye, or curious ear,<br/>
Have learnt his fate, the whole dark story clear<br/>
And, oh! whate'er Heaven destined to betide,<br/>
Let neither flattery soothe, nor pity hide.<br/>
Prepared I stand: he was but born to try<br/>
The lot of man; to suffer, and to die.<br/>
Oh then, if ever through the ten years' war<br/>
The wise, the good Ulysses claim'd thy care;<br/>
If e'er he join'd thy council, or thy sword,<br/>
True in his deed, and constant to his word;<br/>
Far as thy mind through backward time can see<br/>
Search all thy stores of faithful memory:<br/>
'Tis sacred truth I ask, and ask of thee."
</p>
<p>
To him experienced Nestor thus rejoin'd:<br/>
"O friend! what sorrows dost thou bring to mind!<br/>
Shall I the long, laborious scene review,<br/>
And open all the wounds of Greece anew?<br/>
What toils by sea! where dark in quest of prey<br/>
Dauntless we roved; Achilles led the way;<br/>
What toils by land! where mix'd in fatal fight<br/>
Such numbers fell, such heroes sunk to night;<br/>
There Ajax great, Achilles there the brave,<br/>
There wise Patroclus, fill an early grave:<br/>
There, too, my son&mdash;ah, once my best delight<br/>
Once swift of foot, and terrible in fight;<br/>
In whom stern courage with soft virtue join'd<br/>
A faultless body and a blameless mind;<br/>
Antilochus&mdash;What more can I relate?<br/>
How trace the tedious series of our fate?<br/>
Not added years on years my task could close,<br/>
The long historian of my country's woes;<br/>
Back to thy native islands might'st thou sail,<br/>
And leave half-heard the melancholy tale.<br/>
Nine painful years on that detested shore;<br/>
What stratagems we form'd, what toils we bore!<br/>
Still labouring on, till scarce at last we found<br/>
Great Jove propitious, and our conquest crown'd.<br/>
Far o'er the rest thy mighty father shined,<br/>
In wit, in prudence, and in force of mind.<br/>
Art thou the son of that illustrious sire?<br/>
With joy I grasp thee, and with love admire.<br/>
So like your voices, and your words so wise,<br/>
Who finds thee younger must consult his eyes.<br/>
Thy sire and I were one; nor varied aught<br/>
In public sentence, or in private thought;<br/>
Alike to council or the assembly came,<br/>
With equal souls, and sentiments the same.<br/>
But when (by wisdom won) proud Ilion burn'd,<br/>
And in their ships the conquering Greeks return'd,<br/>
'Twas God's high will the victors to divide,<br/>
And turn the event, confounding human pride;<br/>
Some he destroy'd, some scatter'd as the dust<br/>
(Not all were prudent, and not all were just).<br/>
Then Discord, sent by Pallas from above,<br/>
Stern daughter of the great avenger Jove,<br/>
The brother-kings inspired with fell debate;<br/>
Who call'd to council all the Achaian state,<br/>
But call'd untimely (not the sacred rite<br/>
Observed, nor heedful of the setting light,<br/>
Nor herald sword the session to proclaim),<br/>
Sour with debauch, a reeling tribe they came.<br/>
To these the cause of meeting they explain,<br/>
And Menelaus moves to cross the main;<br/>
Not so the king of men: he will'd to stay,<br/>
The sacred rites and hecatombs to pay,<br/>
And calm Minerva's wrath. Oh blind to fate!<br/>
The gods not lightly change their love, or hate.<br/>
With ireful taunts each other they oppose,<br/>
Till in loud tumult all the Greeks arose.<br/>
Now different counsels every breast divide,<br/>
Each burns with rancour to the adverse side;<br/>
The unquiet night strange projects entertain'd<br/>
(So Jove, that urged us to our fate, ordain'd).<br/>
We with the rising morn our ships unmoor'd,<br/>
And brought our captives and our stores aboard;<br/>
But half the people with respect obey'd<br/>
The king of men, and at his bidding stay'd.<br/>
Now on the wings of winds our course we keep<br/>
(For God had smooth'd the waters of the deep);<br/>
For Tenedos we spread our eager oars,<br/>
There land, and pay due victims to the powers;<br/>
To bless our safe return, we join in prayer;<br/>
But angry Jove dispersed our vows in air,<br/>
And raised new discord. Then (so Heaven decreed)<br/>
Ulysses first and Nestor disagreed!<br/>
Wise as he was, by various counsels sway'd,<br/>
He there, though late, to please the monarch, stay'd.<br/>
But I, determined, stem the foamy floods,<br/>
Warn'd of the coming fury of the gods.<br/>
With us, Tydides fear'd, and urged his haste:<br/>
And Menelaus came, but came the last,<br/>
He join'd our vessels in the Lesbian bay,<br/>
While yet we doubted of our watery way;<br/>
If to the right to urge the pilot's toil<br/>
(The safer road), beside the Psyrian isle;<br/>
Or the straight course to rocky Chios plough,<br/>
And anchor under Mimas' shaggy brow?<br/>
We sought direction of the power divine:<br/>
The god propitious gave the guiding sign;<br/>
Through the mid seas he bid our navy steer,<br/>
And in Euboea shun the woes we fear.<br/>
The whistling winds already waked the sky;<br/>
Before the whistling winds the vessels fly,<br/>
With rapid swiftness cut the liquid way,<br/>
And reach Gerestus at the point of day.<br/>
There hecatombs of bulls, to Neptune slain,<br/>
High-flaming please the monarch of the main.<br/>
The fourth day shone, when all their labours o'er,<br/>
Tydides' vessels touched the wish'd-for shore.<br/>
But I to Pylos scud before the gales,<br/>
The god still breathing on my swelling sails;<br/>
Separate from all, I safely landed here;<br/>
Their fates or fortunes never reach'd my ear.<br/>
Yet what I learn'd, attend; as here I sat,<br/>
And ask'd each voyager each hero's fate;<br/>
Curious to know, and willing to relate.
</p>
<p>
"Safe reach'd the Myrmidons their native land,<br/>
Beneath Achilles' warlike son's command.<br/>
Those, whom the heir of great Apollo's art,<br/>
Brave Philoctetes, taught to wing the dart;<br/>
And those whom Idomen from Ilion's plain<br/>
Had led, securely cross'd the dreadful main<br/>
How Agamemnon touch'd his Argive coast,<br/>
And how his life by fraud and force he lost,<br/>
And how the murderer, paid his forfeit breath;<br/>
What lands so distant from that scene of death<br/>
But trembling heard the fame? and heard, admire.<br/>
How well the son appeased his slaughter'd sire!<br/>
Ev'n to the unhappy, that unjustly bleed,<br/>
Heaven gives posterity, to avenge the deed.<br/>
So fell Ægysthus; and mayest thou, my friend,<br/>
(On whom the virtues of thy sire descend,)<br/>
Make future times thy equal act adore,<br/>
And be what brave Orestes was before!"
</p>
<p>
The prudent youth replied: "O thou the grace<br/>
And lasting glory of the Grecian race!<br/>
Just was the vengeance, and to latest days<br/>
Shall long posterity resound the praise.<br/>
Some god this arm with equal prowess bless!<br/>
And the proud suitors shall its force confess;<br/>
Injurious men! who while my soul is sore<br/>
Of fresh affronts, are meditating more.<br/>
But Heaven denies this honour to my hand,<br/>
Nor shall my father repossess the land;<br/>
The father's fortune never to return,<br/>
And the sad son's to softer and to mourn!"<br/>
Thus he; and Nestor took the word: "My son,<br/>
Is it then true, as distant rumours run,<br/>
That crowds of rivals for thy mother's charms<br/>
Thy palace fill with insults and alarms?<br/>
Say, is the fault, through tame submission, thine?<br/>
Or leagued against thee, do thy people join,<br/>
Moved by some oracle, or voice divine?<br/>
And yet who knows, but ripening lies in fate<br/>
An hour of vengeance for the afflicted state;<br/>
When great Ulysses shall suppress these harms,<br/>
Ulysses singly, or all Greece in arms.<br/>
But if Athena, war's triumphant maid,<br/>
The happy son will as the father aid,<br/>
(Whose fame and safety was her constant care<br/>
In every danger and in every war:<br/>
Never on man did heavenly favour shine<br/>
With rays so strong, distinguish'd and divine,<br/>
As those with which Minerva mark'd thy sire)<br/>
So might she love thee, so thy soul inspire!<br/>
Soon should their hopes in humble dust be laid,<br/>
And long oblivion of the bridal bed."
</p>
<p>
"Ah! no such hope (the prince with sighs replies)<br/>
Can touch my breast; that blessing Heaven denies.<br/>
Ev'n by celestial favour were it given,<br/>
Fortune or fate would cross the will of Heaven."
</p>
<p>
"What words are these, and what imprudence thine?<br/>
(Thus interposed the martial maid divine)<br/>
Forgetful youth! but know, the Power above<br/>
With ease can save each object of his love;<br/>
Wide as his will, extends his boundless grace;<br/>
Nor lost in time nor circumscribed by place.<br/>
Happier his lot, who, many sorrows pass'd,<br/>
Long labouring gains his natal shore at last;<br/>
Than who, too speedy, hastes to end his life<br/>
By some stern ruffian, or adulterous wife.<br/>
Death only is the lot which none can miss,<br/>
And all is possible to Heaven but this.<br/>
The best, the dearest favourite of the sky,<br/>
Must taste that cup, for man is born to die."
</p>
<p>
Thus check'd, replied Ulysses' prudent heir:<br/>
"Mentor, no more&mdash;the mournful thought forbear;<br/>
For he no more must draw his country's breath,<br/>
Already snatch'd by fate, and the black doom of death!<br/>
Pass we to other subjects; and engage<br/>
On themes remote the venerable sage<br/>
(Who thrice has seen the perishable kind<br/>
Of men decay, and through three ages shined<br/>
Like gods majestic, and like gods in mind);<br/>
For much he knows, and just conclusions draws,<br/>
From various precedents, and various laws.<br/>
O son of Neleus! awful Nestor, tell<br/>
How he, the mighty Agamemnon, fell;<br/>
By what strange fraud Ægysthus wrought, relate<br/>
(By force he could not) such a hero's fate?<br/>
Live Menelaus not in Greece? or where<br/>
Was then the martial brother's pious care?<br/>
Condemn'd perhaps some foreign shore to tread;<br/>
Or sure Ægysthus had not dared the deed."
</p>
<p>
To whom the full of days: Illustrious youth,<br/>
Attend (though partly thou hast guess'd) the truth.<br/>
For had the martial Menelaus found<br/>
The ruffian breathing yet on Argive ground;<br/>
Nor earth had bid his carcase from the skies,<br/>
Nor Grecian virgins shriek'd his obsequies,<br/>
But fowls obscene dismember'd his remains,<br/>
And dogs had torn him on the naked plains.<br/>
While us the works of bloody Mars employ'd,<br/>
The wanton youth inglorious peace enjoy'd:<br/>
He stretch'd at ease in Argos' calm recess<br/>
(Whose stately steeds luxuriant pastures bless),<br/>
With flattery's insinuating art<br/>
Soothed the frail queen, and poison'd all her heart.<br/>
At first, with worthy shame and decent pride,<br/>
The royal dame his lawless suit denied.<br/>
For virtue's image yet possess'd her mind.<br/>
Taught by a master of the tuneful kind;<br/>
Atrides, parting for the Trojan war,<br/>
Consign'd the youthful consort to his care.<br/>
True to his charge, the bard preserved her long<br/>
In honour's limits; such the power of song.<br/>
But when the gods these objects of their hate<br/>
Dragg'd to destruction by the links of fate;<br/>
The bard they banish'd from his native soil,<br/>
And left all helpless in a desert isle;<br/>
There he, the sweetest of the sacred train,<br/>
Sung dying to the rocks, but sung in vain.<br/>
Then virtue was no more; her guard away,<br/>
She fell, to lust a voluntary prey.<br/>
Even to the temple stalk'd the adulterous spouse,<br/>
With impious thanks, and mockery of the vows,<br/>
With images, with garments, and with gold;<br/>
And odorous fumes from loaded altars roll'd.
</p>
<p>
"Meantime from flaming Troy we cut the way<br/>
With Menelaus, through the curling sea.<br/>
But when to Sunium's sacred point we came,<br/>
Crown'd with the temple of the Athenian dame;<br/>
Atride's pilot, Phrontes, there expired<br/>
(Phrontes, of all the songs of men admired<br/>
To steer the bounding bark with steady toil,<br/>
When the storm thickens, and the billows boil);<br/>
While yet he exercised the steerman's art,<br/>
Apollo touch'd him with his gentle dart;<br/>
Even with the rudder in his hand, he fell.<br/>
To pay whole honours to the shades of hell,<br/>
We check'd our haste, by pious office bound,<br/>
And laid our old companion in the ground.<br/>
And now the rites discharged, our course we keep<br/>
Far on the gloomy bosom of the deep:<br/>
Soon as Malae's misty tops arise,<br/>
Sudden the Thunderer blackens all the skies,<br/>
And the winds whistle, and the surges roll<br/>
Mountains on mountains, and obscure the pole.<br/>
The tempest scatters, and divides our fleet;<br/>
Part, the storm urges on the coast of Crete,<br/>
Where winding round the rich Cydonian plain,<br/>
The streams of Jardan issue to the main.<br/>
There stands a rock, high, eminent and steep,<br/>
Whose shaggy brow o'erhangs the shady deep,<br/>
And views Gortyna on the western side;<br/>
On this rough Auster drove the impetuous tide:<br/>
With broken force the billows roll'd away,<br/>
And heaved the fleet into the neighb'ring bay.<br/>
Thus saved from death, they gain'd the Phaæstan shores,<br/>
With shatter'd vessels and disabled oars;<br/>
But five tall barks the winds and water toss'd,<br/>
Far from their fellows, on the Ægyptian coast.<br/>
There wander'd Menelaus through foreign shores<br/>
Amassing gold, and gathering naval stores;<br/>
While cursed Ægysthus the detested deed<br/>
By fraud fulfilled, and his great brother bled.<br/>
Seven years, the traitor rich Mycenae sway'd,<br/>
And his stern rule the groaning land obey'd;<br/>
The eighth, from Athens to his realm restored,<br/>
Orestes brandish'd the avenging sword,<br/>
Slew the dire pair, and gave to funeral flame<br/>
The vile assassin and adulterous dame.<br/>
That day, ere yet the bloody triumphs cease,<br/>
Return'd Atrides to the coast of Greece,<br/>
And safe to Argos port his navy brought,<br/>
With gifts of price and ponderous treasure fraught.<br/>
Hence warn'd, my son, beware! nor idly stand<br/>
Too long a stranger to thy native land;<br/>
Lest heedless absence wear thy wealth away,<br/>
While lawless feasters in thy palace away;<br/>
Perhaps may seize thy realm, and share the spoil;<br/>
And though return, with disappointed toil,<br/>
From thy vain journey, to a rifled isle.<br/>
However, my friend, indulge one labour more,<br/>
And seek Atrides on the Spartan shore.<br/>
He, wandering long a wider circle made,<br/>
And many-languaged nations has survey'd:<br/>
And measured tracks unknown to other ships,<br/>
Amid the monstrous wonders of the deeps,<br/>
(A length of ocean and unbounded sky.<br/>
Which scarce the sea-fowl in a year o'erfly);<br/>
Go then; to Sparta take the watery way,<br/>
Thy ship and sailors but for orders stay;<br/>
Or, if my land then choose thy course to bend,<br/>
My steeds, my chariots, and my songs, attend;<br/>
Thee to Atrides they shall safe convey,<br/>
Guides of thy road, companions of thy way.<br/>
Urge him with truth to frame his wise replies,<br/>
And sure he will; for Menelaus is wise."<br/>
Thus while he speaks the ruddy sun descends,<br/>
And twilight grey her evening shade extends.<br/>
Then thus the blue-eyed maid: "O full of days!<br/>
Wise are thy words, and just are all thy ways.<br/>
Now immolate the tongues, and mix the wine,<br/>
Sacred to Neptune and the powers divine,<br/>
The lamp of day is quench'd beneath the deep,<br/>
And soft approach the balmy hours of sleep;<br/>
Nor fits it to prolong the heavenly feast,<br/>
Timeless, indecent, but retire to rest."
</p>
<p>
So spake Jove's daughter, the celestial maid,<br/>
The sober train attended and obey'd.<br/>
The sacred heralds on their hands around<br/>
Pour'd the full urns; the youths the goblets crown'd;<br/>
From bowl to bowl the homely beverage flows;<br/>
While to the final sacrifice they rose.<br/>
The tongues they cast upon the fragrant flame,<br/>
And pour, above, the consecrated stream.<br/>
And now, their thirst by copious draughts allay'd,<br/>
The youthful hero and the Athenian maid<br/>
Propose departure from the finish'd rite,<br/>
And in their hollow bark to pass the night;<br/>
But this hospitable sage denied,<br/>
"Forbid it, Jove! and all the gods! (he cried),<br/>
Thus from my walls and the much-loved son to send<br/>
Of such a hero, and of such a friend!<br/>
Me, as some needy peasant, would ye leave,<br/>
Whom Heaven denies the blessing to relieve?<br/>
Me would ye leave, who boast imperial sway,<br/>
When beds of royal state invite your stay?<br/>
No&mdash;long as life this mortal shall inspire,<br/>
Or as my children imitate their sire.<br/>
Here shall the wandering stranger find his home,<br/>
And hospitable rites adorn the dome."
</p>
<p>
"Well hast thou spoke (the blue-eyed maid replies),<br/>
Beloved old man! benevolent as wise.<br/>
Be the kind dictates of thy heart obey'd,<br/>
And let thy words Telemachus persuade:<br/>
He to thy palace shall thy steps pursue;<br/>
I to the ship, to give the orders due,<br/>
Prescribe directions and confirm the crew.<br/>
For I alone sustain their naval cares,<br/>
Who boast experience from these silver hairs;<br/>
All youths the rest, whom to this journey move<br/>
Like years, like tempers, and their prince's love<br/>
There in the vessel shall I pass the night;<br/>
And, soon as morning paints the fields of light,<br/>
I go to challenge from the Caucons bold<br/>
A debt, contracted in the days of old,<br/>
But this, thy guest, received with friendly care<br/>
Let thy strong coursers swift to Sparta bear;<br/>
Prepare thy chariot at the dawn of day,<br/>
And be thy son companion of his way."
</p>
<p>
Then, turning with the word, Minerva flies,<br/>
And soars an eagle through the liquid skies.<br/>
Vision divine! the throng'd spectators gaze<br/>
In holy wonder fix'd, and still amaze.<br/>
But chief the reverend sage admired; he took<br/>
The hand of young Telemachus, and spoke:<br/>
"Oh, happy youth! and favoured of the skies,<br/>
Distinguished care of guardian deities!<br/>
Whose early years for future worth engage,<br/>
No vulgar manhood, no ignoble age.<br/>
For lo! none other of the course above,<br/>
Then she, the daughter of almighty Jove,<br/>
Pallas herself, the war-triumphant maid;<br/>
Confess'd is thine, as once thy father's aid.<br/>
So guide me, goddess! so propitious shine<br/>
On me, my consort, and my royal line!<br/>
A yearling bullock to thy name shall smoke,<br/>
Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,<br/>
With ample forehead, and yet tender horns,<br/>
Whose budding honours ductile gold adorns."
</p>
<p>
Submissive thus the hoary sire preferr'd<br/>
His holy vow: the favouring goddess heard.<br/>
Then, slowly rising, o'er the sandy space<br/>
Precedes the father, follow'd by his race,<br/>
(A long procession) timely marching home<br/>
In comely order to the regal dome.<br/>
There when arrived, on thrones around him placed,<br/>
His sons and grandsons the wide circle graced.<br/>
To these the hospitable sage, in sign<br/>
Of social welcome, mix'd the racy wine<br/>
(Late from the mellowing cask restored to light,<br/>
By ten long years refined, and rosy bright).<br/>
To Pallas high the foaming bowl he crown'd,<br/>
And sprinkled large libations on the ground.<br/>
Each drinks a full oblivion of his cares,<br/>
And to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs.<br/>
Deep in a rich alcove the prince was laid,<br/>
And slept beneath the pompous colonnade;<br/>
Fast by his side Pisistratus was spread<br/>
(In age his equal) on a splendid bed:<br/>
But in an inner court, securely closed,<br/>
The reverend Nestor and his queen reposed.
</p>
<p>
When now Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br/>
With rosy lustre purpled o'er the lawn,<br/>
The old man early rose, walk'd forth, and sate<br/>
On polish'd stone before his palace gate;<br/>
With unguents smooth the lucid marble shone,<br/>
Where ancient Neleus sate, a rustic throne;<br/>
But he descending to the infernal shade,<br/>
Sage Nestor fill'd it, and the sceptre sway'd.<br/>
His sons around him mild obeisance pay,<br/>
And duteous take the orders of the day.<br/>
First Echephron and Stratius quit their bed;<br/>
Then Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymed;<br/>
The last Pisistratus arose from rest:<br/>
They came, and near him placed the stranger-guest.<br/>
To these the senior thus declared his will:<br/>
"My sons! the dictates of your sire fulfil.<br/>
To Pallas, first of gods, prepare the feast,<br/>
Who graced our rites, a more than mortal guest<br/>
Let one, despatchful, bid some swain to lead<br/>
A well-fed bullock from the grassy mead;<br/>
One seek the harbour where the vessels moor,<br/>
And bring thy friends, Telemachus! ashore<br/>
(Leave only two the galley to attend);<br/>
Another Laerceus must we send,<br/>
Artist devine, whose skilful hands infold<br/>
The victim's horn with circumfusile gold.<br/>
The rest may here the pious duty share,<br/>
And bid the handmaids for the feast prepare,<br/>
The seats to range, the fragrant wood to bring,<br/>
And limpid waters from the living spring."
</p>
<p>
He said, and busy each his care bestow'd;<br/>
Already at the gates the bullock low'd,<br/>
Already came the Ithacensian crew,<br/>
The dexterous smith the tools already drew;<br/>
His ponderous hammer and his anvil sound,<br/>
And the strong tongs to turn the metal round.<br/>
Nor was Minerva absent from the rite,<br/>
She view'd her honours, and enjoyed the sight,<br/>
With reverend hand the king presents the gold,<br/>
Which round the intorted horns the gilder roll'd.<br/>
So wrought as Pallas might with pride behold.<br/>
Young Aretus from forth his bridal bower<br/>
Brought the full laver, o'er their hands to pour,<br/>
And canisters of consecrated flour.<br/>
Stratius and Echephron the victim led;<br/>
The axe was held by warlike Thrasymed,<br/>
In act to strike; before him Perseus stood,<br/>
The vase extending to receive the blood.<br/>
The king himself initiates to the power:<br/>
Scatters with quivering hand the sacred flour,<br/>
And the stream sprinkles; from the curling brows<br/>
The hair collected in the fire he throws.<br/>
Soon as due vows on every part were paid,<br/>
And sacred wheat upon the victim laid,<br/>
Strong Thrasymed discharged the speeding blow<br/>
Full on his neck, and cut the nerves in two.<br/>
Down sunk the heavy beast; the females round<br/>
Maids, wives, and matrons, mix a shrilling sound.<br/>
Nor scorned the queen the holy choir to join<br/>
(The first born she, of old Clymenus' line:<br/>
In youth by Nestor loved, of spotless fame.<br/>
And loved in age, Eurydice her name).<br/>
From earth they rear him, struggling now with death;<br/>
And Nestor's youngest stops the vents of breath.<br/>
The soul for ever flies; on all sides round<br/>
Streams the black blood, and smokes upon the ground<br/>
The beast they then divide and disunite<br/>
The ribs and limbs, observant of the rite:<br/>
On these, in double cauls involved with art,<br/>
The choicest morsels lay from every part.<br/>
The sacred sage before his altar stands,<br/>
Turns the burnt offering with his holy hands,<br/>
And pours the wine, and bids the flames aspire;<br/>
The youth with instruments surround the fire.<br/>
The thighs now sacrificed, and entrails dress'd,<br/>
The assistants part, transfix, and broil the rest<br/>
While these officious tend the rites divine,<br/>
The last fair branch of the Nestorean line,<br/>
Sweet Polycaste, took the pleasing toil<br/>
To bathe the prince, and pour the fragrant oil.<br/>
O'er his fair limbs a flowery vest he threw,<br/>
And issued, like a god, to mortal view.<br/>
His former seat beside the king he found<br/>
(His people's father with his peers around);<br/>
All placed at ease the holy banquet join,<br/>
And in the dazzling goblet laughs the wine.
</p>
<p>
The rage of thirst and hunger now suppress'd,<br/>
The monarch turns him to his royal guest;<br/>
And for the promised journey bids prepare<br/>
The smooth hair'd horses, and the rapid car.<br/>
Observant of his word, the word scarce spoke,<br/>
The sons obey, and join them to the yoke.<br/>
Then bread and wine a ready handmaid brings,<br/>
And presents, such as suit the state of kings.<br/>
The glittering seat Telemachus ascends;<br/>
His faithful guide Pisistratus attends;<br/>
With hasty hand the ruling reins he drew;<br/>
He lash'd the coursers, and the coursers flew.<br/>
Beneath the bounding yoke alike they hold<br/>
Their equal pace, and smoked along the field.<br/>
The towers of Pylos sink, its views decay,<br/>
Fields after fields fly back, till close of day;<br/>
Then sunk the sun, and darken'd all the way.
</p>
<p>
To Pherae now, Diocleus' stately seat<br/>
(Of Alpheus' race), the weary youths retreat.<br/>
His house affords the hospitable rite,<br/>
And pleased they sleep (the blessing of the night).<br/>
But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br/>
With rosy lustre purpled o'er the lawn,<br/>
Again they mount, their journey to renew,<br/>
And from the sounding portico they flew.<br/>
Along the waving fields their way they hold<br/>
The fields receding as their chariot roll'd;<br/>
Then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light,<br/>
And o'er the shaded landscape rush'd the night.

<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XXII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Then fierce the hero o'er the threshold strode;<br/>
Stripp'd of his rags, he blazed out like a god.<br/>
Full in their face the lifted bow he bore,<br/>
And quiver'd deaths, a formidable store;<br/>
Before his feet the rattling shower he threw,<br/>
And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew:
</p>
<p>
"One venturous game this hand hath won to-day,<br/>
Another, princes! yet remains to play;<br/>
Another mark our arrow must attain.<br/>
Ph≈ìbus, assist! nor be the labour vain."<br/>
Swift as the word the parting arrow sings,<br/>
And bears thy fate, Antinous, on its wings:<br/>
Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul!<br/>
High in his hands he rear'd the golden bowl!<br/>
E'en then to drain it lengthen'd out his breath;<br/>
Changed to the deep, the bitter draught of death:<br/>
For fate who fear'd amidst a feastful band?<br/>
And fate to numbers, by a single hand?<br/>
Full through his throat Ulysses' weapon pass'd,<br/>
And pierced his neck. He falls, and breathes his last.<br/>
The tumbling goblet the wide floor o'erflows,<br/>
A stream of gore burst spouting from his nose;<br/>
Grim in convulsive agonies be sprawls:<br/>
Before him spurn'd the loaded table falls,<br/>
And spreads the pavement with a mingled flood<br/>
Of floating meats, and wine, and human blood.<br/>
Amazed, confounded, as they saw him fall,<br/>
Up rose the throngs tumultuous round the hall:<br/>
O'er all the dome they cast a haggard eye,<br/>
Each look'd for arms&mdash;in vain; no arms were nigh:<br/>
"Aim'st thou at princes? (all amazed they said;)<br/>
Thy last of games unhappy hast thou play'd;<br/>
Thy erring shaft has made our bravest bleed,<br/>
And death, unlucky guest, attends thy deed.<br/>
Vultures shall tear thee." Thus incensed they spoke,<br/>
While each to chance ascribed the wondrous stroke:<br/>
Blind as they were: for death e'en now invades<br/>
His destined prey, and wraps them all in shades.<br/>
Then, grimly frowning, with a dreadful look,<br/>
That wither'd all their hearts, Ulysses spoke:
</p>
<p>
"Dogs, ye have had your day! ye fear'd no more<br/>
Ulysses vengeful from the Trojan shore;<br/>
While, to your lust and spoil a guardless prey,<br/>
Our house, our wealth, our helpless handmaids lay:<br/>
Not so content, with bolder frenzy fired,<br/>
E'en to our bed presumptuous you aspired:<br/>
Laws or divine or human fail'd to move,<br/>
Or shame of men, or dread of gods above;<br/>
Heedless alike of infamy or praise,<br/>
Or Fame's eternal voice in future days;<br/>
The hour of vengeance, wretches, now is come;<br/>
Impending fate is yours, and instant doom."
</p>
<p>
Thus dreadful he. Confused the suitors stood,<br/>
From their pale cheeks recedes the flying blood:<br/>
Trembling they sought their guilty heads to hide.<br/>
Alone the bold Eurymachus replied:
</p>
<p>
"If, as thy words import (he thus began),<br/>
Ulysses lives, and thou the mighty man,<br/>
Great are thy wrongs, and much hast thou sustain'd<br/>
In thy spoil'd palace, and exhausted land;<br/>
The cause and author of those guilty deeds,<br/>
Lo! at thy feet unjust Antinous bleeds<br/>
Not love, but wild ambition was his guide;<br/>
To slay thy son, thy kingdom to divide,<br/>
These were his aims; but juster Jove denied.<br/>
Since cold in death the offender lies, oh spare<br/>
Thy suppliant people, and receive their prayer!<br/>
Brass, gold, and treasures, shall the spoil defray,<br/>
Two hundred oxen every prince shall pay:<br/>
The waste of years refunded in a day.<br/>
Till then thy wrath is just." Ulysses burn'd<br/>
With high disdain, and sternly thus return'd:
</p>
<p>
"All, all the treasure that enrich'd our throne<br/>
Before your rapines, join'd with all your own,<br/>
If offer'd, vainly should for mercy call;<br/>
'Tis you that offer, and I scorn them all;<br/>
Your blood is my demand, your lives the prize,<br/>
Till pale as yonder wretch each suitor lies.<br/>
Hence with those coward terms; or fight or fly;<br/>
This choice is left you, to resist or die:<br/>
And die I trust ye shall." He sternly spoke:<br/>
With guilty fears the pale assembly shook.<br/>
Alone Eurymachus exhorts the train:<br/>
"Yon archer, comrades, will not shoot in vain;<br/>
But from the threshold shall his darts be sped,<br/>
(Whoe'er he be), till every prince lie dead?<br/>
Be mindful of yourselves, draw forth your swords,<br/>
And to his shafts obtend these ample boards<br/>
(So need compels). Then, all united, strive<br/>
The bold invader from his post to drive:<br/>
The city roused shall to our rescue haste,<br/>
And this mad archer soon have shot his last."
</p>
<p>
Swift as he spoke, he drew his traitor sword,<br/>
And like a lion rush'd against his lord:<br/>
The wary chief the rushing foe repress'd,<br/>
Who met the point and forced it in his breast:<br/>
His falling hand deserts the lifted sword,<br/>
And prone he falls extended o'er the board!<br/>
Before him wide, in mix'd effusion roll<br/>
The untasted viands, and the jovial bowl.<br/>
Full through his liver pass'd the mortal wound,<br/>
With dying rage his forehead beats the ground;<br/>
He spurn'd the seat with fury as he fell,<br/>
And the fierce soul to darkness dived, and hell.<br/>
Next bold Amphinomus his arm extends<br/>
To force the pass; the godlike man defends.<br/>
Thy spear, Telemachus, prevents the attack,<br/>
The brazen weapon driving through his back.<br/>
Thence through his breast its bloody passage tore;<br/>
Flat falls he thundering on the marble floor,<br/>
And his crush'd forehead marks the stone with gore.<br/>
He left his javelin in the dead, for fear<br/>
The long encumbrance of the weighty spear<br/>
To the fierce foe advantage might afford,<br/>
To rush between and use the shorten'd sword.<br/>
With speedy ardour to his sire he flies,<br/>
And, "Arm, great father! arm (in haste he cries).<br/>
Lo, hence I run for other arms to wield,<br/>
For missive javelins, and for helm and shield;<br/>
Fast by our side let either faithful swain<br/>
In arms attend us, and their part sustain."
</p>
<p>
"Haste, and return (Ulysses made reply)<br/>
While yet the auxiliar shafts this hand supply;<br/>
Lest thus alone, encounter'd by an host,<br/>
Driven from the gate, the important pass be lost."
</p>
<p>
With speed Telemachus obeys, and flies<br/>
Where piled in heaps the royal armour lies;<br/>
Four brazen helmets, eight refulgent spears,<br/>
And four broad bucklers to his sire he bears:<br/>
At once in brazen panoply they shone.<br/>
At once each servant braced his armour on;<br/>
Around their king a faithful guard they stand.<br/>
While yet each shaft flew deathful from his hand:<br/>
Chief after chief expired at every wound,<br/>
And swell'd the bleeding mountain on the ground.<br/>
Soon as his store of flying fates was spent.<br/>
Against the wall he set the bow unbent;<br/>
And now his shoulders bear the massy shield,<br/>
And now his hands two beamy javelins wield:<br/>
He frowns beneath his nodding plume, that play'd<br/>
O'er the high crest, and cast a dreadful shade.
</p>
<p>
There stood a window near, whence looking down<br/>
From o'er the porch appear'd the subject town.<br/>
A double strength of valves secured the place,<br/>
A high and narrow, but the only pass:<br/>
The cautious king, with all-preventing care,<br/>
To guard that outlet, placed Eumaeus there;<br/>
When Agelaus thus: "Has none the sense<br/>
To mount yon window, and alarm from thence<br/>
The neighbour-town? the town shall force the door,<br/>
And this bold archer soon shall shoot no more."<br/>
Melanthius then: "That outlet to the gate<br/>
So near adjoins, that one may guard the strait.<br/>
But other methods of defence remain;<br/>
Myself with arms can furnish all the train;<br/>
Stores from the royal magazine I bring,<br/>
And their own darts shall pierce the prince and king."
</p>
<p>
He said; and mounting up the lofty stairs,<br/>
Twelve shields, twelve lances, and twelve helmets bears:<br/>
All arm, and sudden round the hall appears<br/>
A blaze of bucklers, and a wood of spears.
</p>
<p>
The hero stands oppress'd with mighty woe,<br/>
On every side he sees the labour grow;<br/>
"Oh cursed event! and oh unlook'd for aid!<br/>
Melanthius or the women have betray'd&mdash;<br/>
Oh my dear son!"&mdash;The father with a sigh<br/>
Then ceased; the filial virtue made reply;
</p>
<p>
"Falsehood is folly, and 'tis just to own<br/>
The fault committed: this was mine alone;<br/>
My haste neglected yonder door to bar,<br/>
And hence the villain has supplied their war.<br/>
Run, good Eumaeus, then, and (what before<br/>
I thoughtless err'd in) well secure that door:<br/>
Learn, if by female fraud this deed were done,<br/>
Or (as my thought misgives) by Dolius' son."
</p>
<p>
While yet they spoke, in quest of arms again<br/>
To the high chamber stole the faithless swain,<br/>
Not unobserved. Eumaeus watchful eyed,<br/>
And thus address'd Ulysses near his side:
</p>
<p>
"The miscreant we suspected takes that way;<br/>
Him, if this arm be powerful, shall I slay?<br/>
Or drive him hither, to receive the meed<br/>
From thy own hand, of this detested deed?"
</p>
<p>
"Not so (replied Ulysses); leave him there,<br/>
For us sufficient is another care;<br/>
Within the structure of this palace wall<br/>
To keep enclosed his masters till they fall.<br/>
Go you, and seize the felon; backward bind<br/>
His arms and legs, and fix a plank behind:<br/>
On this his body by strong cords extend,<br/>
And on a column near the roof suspend:<br/>
So studied tortures his vile days shall end."
</p>
<p>
The ready swains obey'd with joyful haste,<br/>
Behind the felon unperceived they pass'd,<br/>
As round the room in quest of arms he goes<br/>
(The half-shut door conceal'd his lurking foes):<br/>
One hand sustain'd a helm, and one the shield<br/>
Which old Laertes wont in youth to wield,<br/>
Cover'd with dust, with dryness chapp'd and worn,<br/>
The brass corroded, and the leather torn.<br/>
Thus laden, o'er the threshold as he stepp'd,<br/>
Fierce on the villain from each side they leap'd,<br/>
Back by the hair the trembling dastard drew,<br/>
And down reluctant on the pavement threw.<br/>
Active and pleased the zealous swains fulfil<br/>
At every point their master's rigid will;<br/>
First, fast behind, his hands and feet they bound,<br/>
Then straighten'd cords involved his body round;<br/>
So drawn aloft, athwart the column tied,<br/>
The howling felon swung from side to side.
</p>
<p>
Eumaeus scoffing then with keen disdain:<br/>
"There pass thy pleasing night, O gentle swain!<br/>
On that soft pillow, from that envied height,<br/>
First may'st thou see the springing dawn of light;<br/>
So timely rise, when morning streaks the east,<br/>
To drive thy victims to the suitors' feast."
</p>
<p>
This said, they, left him, tortured as he lay,<br/>
Secured the door, and hasty strode away:<br/>
Each, breathing death, resumed his dangerous post<br/>
Near great Ulysses; four against an host,<br/>
When lo! descending to her hero's aid,<br/>
Jove's daughter, Pallas, War's triumphant maid:<br/>
In Mentor's friendly form she join'd his side:<br/>
Ulysses saw, and thus with transport cried:
</p>
<p>
"Come, ever welcome, and thy succour lend;<br/>
O every sacred name in one, my friend!<br/>
Early we loved, and long our loves have grown;<br/>
Whate'er through life's whole series I have done,<br/>
Or good, or grateful, now to mind recall,<br/>
And, aiding this one hour, repay it all."
</p>
<p>
Thus he; but pleasing hopes his bosom warm<br/>
Of Pallas latent in the friendly form.<br/>
The adverse host the phantom-warrior eyed,<br/>
And first, loud-threatening, Agelaus cried:
</p>
<p>
"Mentor, beware, nor let that tongue persuade<br/>
Thy frantic arm to lend Ulysses aid;<br/>
Our force successful shall our threat make good,<br/>
And with the sire and son commix thy blood.<br/>
What hopest thou here? Thee first the sword shall slay,<br/>
Then lop thy whole posterity away;<br/>
Far hence thy banish'd consort shall we send;<br/>
With his thy forfeit lands and treasures blend;<br/>
Thus, and thus only, shalt thou join thy friend."
</p>
<p>
His barbarous insult even the goddess fires,<br/>
Who thus the warrior to revenge inspires:
</p>
<p>
"Art thou Ulysses? where then shall we find<br/>
The patient body and the constant mind?<br/>
That courage, once the Trojans' daily dread,<br/>
Known nine long years, and felt by heroes dead?<br/>
And where that conduct, which revenged the lust<br/>
Of Priam's race, and laid proud Troy in dust?<br/>
If this, when Helen was the cause, were done;<br/>
What for thy country now, thy queen, thy son?<br/>
Rise then in combat, at my side attend;<br/>
Observe what vigour gratitude can lend,<br/>
And foes how weak, opposed against a friend!"
</p>
<p>
She spoke; but willing longer to survey<br/>
The sire and son's great acts withheld the day!<br/>
By farther toils decreed the brave to try,<br/>
And level poised the wings of victory;<br/>
Then with a change of form eludes their sight,<br/>
Perch'd like a swallow on a rafter's height,<br/>
And unperceived enjoys the rising fight.
</p>
<p>
Damastor's son, bold Agelaus, leads,<br/>
The guilty war, Eurynomus succeeds;<br/>
With these, Pisander, great Polyctor's son,<br/>
Sage Polybus, and stern Amphimedon,<br/>
With Demoptolemus: these six survive:<br/>
The best of all the shafts had left alive.<br/>
Amidst the carnage, desperate as they stand,<br/>
Thus Agelaus roused the lagging band:
</p>
<p>
"The hour has come, when yon fierce man no more<br/>
With bleeding princes shall bestrew the floor;<br/>
Lo! Mentor leaves him with an empty boast;<br/>
The four remain, but four against an host.<br/>
Let each at once discharge the deadly dart,<br/>
One sure of six shall reach Ulysses' heart:<br/>
The rest must perish, their great leader slain:<br/>
Thus shall one stroke the glory lost regain."
</p>
<p>
Then all at once their mingled lances threw,<br/>
And thirsty all of one man's blood they flew;<br/>
In vain! Minerva turned them with her breath,<br/>
And scattered short, or wide, the points of death!<br/>
With deaden'd sound one on the threshold falls,<br/>
One strikes the gate, one rings against the walls:<br/>
The storm passed innocent. The godlike man<br/>
Now loftier trod, and dreadful thus began:<br/>
"'Tis now (brave friends) our turn, at once to throw,<br/>
(So speed them Heaven) our javelins at the foe.<br/>
That impious race to all their past misdeeds<br/>
Would add our blood, injustice still proceeds."
</p>
<p>
He spoke: at once their fiery lances flew:<br/>
Great Demoptolemus Ulysses slew;<br/>
Euryades received the prince's dart;<br/>
The goatherd's quiver'd in Pisander's heart;<br/>
Fierce Elatus by thine, Eumaeus, falls;<br/>
Their fall in thunder echoes round the walls.<br/>
The rest retreat: the victors now advance,<br/>
Each from the dead resumes his bloody lance.<br/>
Again the foe discharge the steely shower;<br/>
Again made frustrate by the virgin-power.<br/>
Some, turn'd by Pallas, on the threshold fall,<br/>
Some wound the gate, some ring against the wall;<br/>
Some weak, or ponderous with the brazen head,<br/>
Drop harmless on the pavement, sounding dead.
</p>
<p>
Then bold Amphimedon his javelin cast:<br/>
Thy hand, Telemachus, it lightly razed:<br/>
And from Ctesippus' arm the spear elanced:<br/>
On good Eumaeus' shield and shoulder glanced;<br/>
Not lessened of their force (so light the wound)<br/>
Each sung along and dropped upon the ground.<br/>
Fate doom'd thee next, Eurydamus, to bear,<br/>
Thy death ennobled by Ulysses' spear.<br/>
By the bold son Amphimedon was slain,<br/>
And Polybus renown'd, the faithful swain.<br/>
Pierced through the breast the rude Ctesippus bled,<br/>
And thus Philaetius gloried o'er the dead:
</p>
<p>
"There end thy pompous vaunts and high disdain;<br/>
O sharp in scandal, voluble and vain!<br/>
How weak is mortal pride! To Heaven alone<br/>
The event of actions and our fates are known:<br/>
Scoffer, behold what gratitude we bear:<br/>
The victim's heel is answered with this spear."
</p>
<p>
Ulysses brandish'd high his vengeful steel,<br/>
And Damastorides that instant fell:<br/>
Fast by Leocritus expiring lay,<br/>
The prince's javelin tore its bloody way<br/>
Through all his bowels: down he tumbled prone,<br/>
His batter'd front and brains besmear the stone.
</p>
<p>
Now Pallas shines confess'd; aloft she spreads<br/>
The arm of vengeance o'er their guilty heads:<br/>
The dreadful aegis blazes in their eye:<br/>
Amazed they see, they tremble, and they fly:<br/>
Confused, distracted, through the rooms they fling:<br/>
Like oxen madden'd by the breeze's sting,<br/>
When sultry days, and long, succeed the gentle spring,<br/>
Not half so keen fierce vultures of the chase<br/>
Stoop from the mountains on the feather'd race,<br/>
When, the wide field extended snares beset,<br/>
With conscious dread they shun the quivering net:<br/>
No help, no flight; but wounded every way,<br/>
Headlong they drop; the fowlers seize their prey.<br/>
On all sides thus they double wound on wound,<br/>
In prostrate heaps the wretches beat the ground,<br/>
Unmanly shrieks precede each dying groan,<br/>
And a red deluge floats the reeking stone.
</p>
<p>
Leiodes first before the victor falls:<br/>
The wretched augur thus for mercy calls:<br/>
"Oh gracious hear, nor let thy suppliant bleed;<br/>
Still undishonoured, or by word or deed,<br/>
Thy house, for me remains; by me repress'd<br/>
Full oft was check'd the injustice of the rest:<br/>
Averse they heard me when I counselled well,<br/>
Their hearts were harden'd, and they justly fell.<br/>
O spare an augur's consecrated head,<br/>
Nor add the blameless to the guilty dead."
</p>
<p>
"Priest as thou art! for that detested band<br/>
Thy lying prophecies deceived the land;<br/>
Against Ulysses have thy vows been made,<br/>
For them thy daily orisons were paid:<br/>
Yet more, e'en to our bed thy pride aspires:<br/>
One common crime one common fate requires."
</p>
<p>
Thus speaking, from the ground the sword he took<br/>
Which Agelaus' dying hand forsook:<br/>
Full through his neck the weighty falchion sped;<br/>
Along the pavement roll'd the muttering head.
</p>
<p>
Phemius alone the hand of vengeance spared,<br/>
Phemius the sweet, the heaven-instructed bard.<br/>
Beside the gate the reverend minstrel stands;<br/>
The lyre now silent trembling in his hands;<br/>
Dubious to supplicate the chief, or fly<br/>
To Jove's inviolable altar nigh,<br/>
Where oft Laertes holy vows had paid,<br/>
And oft Ulysses smoking victims laid.<br/>
His honour'd harp with care he first set down,<br/>
Between the laver and the silver throne;<br/>
Then prostrate stretch'd before the dreadful man,<br/>
Persuasive thus, with accent soft began:
</p>
<p>
"O king! to mercy be thy soul inclined,<br/>
And spare the poet's ever-gentle kind.<br/>
A deed like this thy future fame would wrong,<br/>
For dear to gods and men is sacred song.<br/>
Self-taught I sing; by Heaven, and Heaven alone,<br/>
The genuine seeds of poesy are sown:<br/>
And (what the gods bestow) the lofty lay<br/>
To gods alone and godlike worth we pay.<br/>
Save then the poet, and thyself reward!<br/>
'Tis thine to merit, mine is to record.<br/>
That here I sung, was force, and not desire;<br/>
This hand reluctant touch'd the warbling wire;<br/>
And let thy son attest, nor sordid pay,<br/>
Nor servile flattery, stain'd the moral lay."
</p>
<p>
The moving words Telemachus attends,<br/>
His sire approaches, and the bard defends.<br/>
"O mix not, father, with those impious dead<br/>
The man divine! forbear that sacred head;<br/>
Medon, the herald, too, our arms may spare,<br/>
Medon, who made my infancy his care;<br/>
If yet he breathes, permit thy son to give<br/>
Thus much to gratitude, and bid him live."
</p>
<p>
Beneath a table, trembling with dismay,<br/>
Couch'd close to earth, unhappy Medon lay,<br/>
Wrapp'd in a new-slain ox's ample hide;<br/>
Swift at the word he cast his screen aside,<br/>
Sprung to the prince, embraced his knee with tears,<br/>
And thus with grateful voice address'd his ears
</p>
<p>
"O prince! O friend! lo, here thy Medon stands<br/>
Ah stop the hero's unresisted hands,<br/>
Incensed too justly by that impious brood,<br/>
Whose guilty glories now are set in blood."<br/>
To whom Ulysses with a pleasing eye:
</p>
<p>
"Be bold, on friendship and my son rely;<br/>
Live, an example for the world to read,<br/>
How much more safe the good than evil deed:<br/>
Thou, with the heaven-taught bard, in peace resort<br/>
From blood and carnage to yon open court:<br/>
Me other work requires." With timorous awe<br/>
From the dire scene the exempted two withdraw,<br/>
Scarce sure of life, look round, and trembling move<br/>
To the bright altars of Protector Jove.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Ulysses search'd the dome, to find<br/>
If yet there live of all the offending kind.<br/>
Not one! complete the bloody tale he found,<br/>
All steep'd in blood, all gasping on the ground.<br/>
So, when by hollow shores the fisher-train<br/>
Sweep with their arching nets the roaring main,<br/>
And scarce the meshy toils the copious draught contain,<br/>
All naked of their element, and bare,<br/>
The fishes pant, and gasp in thinner air;<br/>
Wide o'er the sands are spread the stiffening prey,<br/>
Till the warm sun exhales their soul away.
</p>
<p>
And now the king commands his son to call<br/>
Old Euryclea to the deathful hall:<br/>
The son observant not a moment stays;<br/>
The aged governess with speed obeys;<br/>
The sounding portals instant they display;<br/>
The matron moves, the prince directs the way.<br/>
On heaps of death the stern Ulysses stood,<br/>
All black with dust, and cover'd thick with blood.<br/>
So the grim lion from the slaughter comes,<br/>
Dreadful he glares, and terribly he foams,<br/>
His breast with marks of carnage painted o'er,<br/>
His jaws all dropping with the bull's black gore.
</p>
<p>
Soon as her eyes the welcome object met,<br/>
The guilty fall'n, the mighty deed complete;<br/>
A scream of joy her feeble voice essay'd;<br/>
The hero check'd her, and composedly said.
</p>
<p>
"Woman, experienced as thou art, control<br/>
Indecent joy, and feast thy secret soul.<br/>
To insult the dead is cruel and unjust;<br/>
Fate and their crime have sunk them to the dust.<br/>
Nor heeded these the censure of mankind,<br/>
The good and bad were equal in their mind<br/>
Justly the price of worthlessness they paid,<br/>
And each now wails an unlamented shade.<br/>
But thou sincere! O Euryclea, say,<br/>
What maids dishonour us, and what obey?"
</p>
<p>
Then she: "In these thy kingly walls remain<br/>
(My son) full fifty of the handmaid train,<br/>
Taught by my care to cull the fleece or weave,<br/>
And servitude with pleasing tasks deceive;<br/>
Of these, twice six pursue their wicked way,<br/>
Nor me, nor chaste Penelope obey;<br/>
Nor fits it that Telemachus command<br/>
(Young as he is) his mother's female band.<br/>
Hence to the upper chambers let me fly<br/>
Where slumbers soft now close the royal eye;<br/>
There wake her with the news"&mdash;the matron cried.<br/>
"Not so (Ulysses, more sedate, replied),<br/>
Bring first the crew who wrought these guilty deeds."<br/>
In haste the matron parts: the king proceeds;<br/>
"Now to dispose the dead, the care remains<br/>
To you, my son, and you, my faithfull swains;<br/>
The offending females to that task we doom,<br/>
To wash, to scent, and purify the room;<br/>
These (every table cleansed, and every throne,<br/>
And all the melancholy labour done)<br/>
Drive to yon court, without the palace wall,<br/>
There the revenging sword shall smite them all;<br/>
So with the suitors let them mix in dust,<br/>
Stretch'd in a long oblivion of their lust."<br/>
He said: the lamentable train appear,<br/>
Each vents a groan, and drops a tender tear;<br/>
Each heaved her mournful burden, and beneath<br/>
The porch deposed the ghastly heap of death.<br/>
The chief severe, compelling each to move,<br/>
Urged the dire task imperious from above;<br/>
With thirsty sponge they rub the tables o'er<br/>
(The swains unite their toil); the walls, the floor,<br/>
Wash'd with the effusive wave, are purged of gore.<br/>
Once more the palace set in fair array,<br/>
To the base court the females take their way;<br/>
There compass'd close between the dome and wall<br/>
(Their life's last scene) they trembling wait their fall.
</p>
<p>
Then thus the prince: "To these shall we afford<br/>
A fate so pure as by the martial sword?<br/>
To these, the nightly prostitutes to shame,<br/>
And base revilers of our house and name?"
</p>
<p>
Thus speaking, on the circling wall he strung<br/>
A ship's tough cable from a column hung;<br/>
Near the high top he strain'd it strongly round,<br/>
Whence no contending foot could reach the ground.<br/>
Their heads above connected in a row,<br/>
They beat the air with quivering feet below:<br/>
Thus on some tree hung struggling in the snare,<br/>
The doves or thrushes flap their wings in air.<br/>
Soon fled the soul impure, and left behind<br/>
The empty corse to waver with the wind.
</p>
<p>
Then forth they led Melanthius, and began<br/>
Their bloody work; they lopp'd away the man,<br/>
Morsel for dogs! then trimm'd with brazen shears<br/>
The wretch, and shorten'd of his nose and ears;<br/>
His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel:<br/>
He roar'd, and torments gave his soul to hell.<br/>
They wash, and to Ulysses take their way:<br/>
So ends the bloody business of the day.
</p>
<p>
To Euryclea then address'd the king:<br/>
"Bring hither fire, and hither sulphur bring,<br/>
To purge the palace: then the queen attend,<br/>
And let her with her matron-train descend;<br/>
The matron-train, with all the virgin-band,<br/>
Assemble here, to learn their lord's command."
</p>
<p>
Then Euryclea: "Joyful I obey,<br/>
But cast those mean dishonest rags away;<br/>
Permit me first the royal robes to bring:<br/>
Ill suits this garb the shoulders of a king."<br/>
"Bring sulphur straight, and fire" (the monarch cries).<br/>
She hears, and at the word obedient flies.<br/>
With fire and sulphur, cure of noxious fumes,<br/>
He purged the walls, and blood-polluted rooms.<br/>
Again the matron springs with eager pace,<br/>
And spreads her lord's return from place to place.<br/>
They hear, rush forth, and instant round him stand,<br/>
A gazing throng, a torch in every hand.<br/>
They saw, they knew him, and with fond embrace<br/>
Each humbly kiss'd his knee, or hand, or face;<br/>
He knows them all, in all such truth appears,<br/>
E'en he indulges the sweet joy of tears.

<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XIX</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Consulting secret with the blue-eyed maid,<br/>
Still in the dome divine Ulysses stay'd:<br/>
Revenge mature for act inflamed his breast;<br/>
And thus the son the fervent sire address'd:
</p>
<p>
"Instant convey those steely stores of war<br/>
To distant rooms, disposed with secret care:<br/>
The cause demanded by the suitor-train,<br/>
To soothe their fears, a specious reason feign:<br/>
Say, since Ulysses left his natal coast,<br/>
Obscene with smoke, their beamy lustre lost,<br/>
His arms deform the roof they wont adorn:<br/>
From the glad walls inglorious lumber torn.<br/>
Suggest, that Jove the peaceful thought inspired,<br/>
Lest they, by sight of swords to fury fired,<br/>
Dishonest wounds, or violence of soul,<br/>
Defame the bridal feast and friendly bowl."
</p>
<p>
The prince, obedient to the sage command,<br/>
To Euryclea thus: "The female band<br/>
In their apartments keep; secure the doors;<br/>
These swarthy arms among the covert stores<br/>
Are seemlier hid; my thoughtless youth they blame,<br/>
Imbrown'd with vapour of the smouldering flame."
</p>
<p>
"In happier hour (pleased Euryclea cries),<br/>
Tutour'd by early woes, grow early wise;<br/>
Inspect with sharpen'd sight, and frugal care,<br/>
Your patrimonial wealth, a prudent heir.<br/>
But who the lighted taper will provide<br/>
(The female train retired) your toils to guide?"
</p>
<p>
"Without infringing hospitable right,<br/>
This guest (he cried) shall bear the guiding light:<br/>
I cheer no lazy vagrants with repast;<br/>
They share the meal that earn it ere they taste."
</p>
<p>
He said: from female ken she straight secures<br/>
The purposed deed, and guards the bolted doors:<br/>
Auxiliar to his son, Ulysses bears<br/>
The plumy-crested helms and pointed spears,<br/>
With shields indented deep in glorious wars.<br/>
Minerva viewless on her charge attends,<br/>
And with her golden lamp his toil befriends.<br/>
Not such the sickly beams, which unsincere<br/>
Gild the gross vapour of this nether sphere!<br/>
A present deity the prince confess'd,<br/>
And wrapp'd with ecstasy the sire address'd:
</p>
<p>
"What miracle thus dazzles with surprise!<br/>
Distinct in rows the radiant columns rise;<br/>
The walls, where'er my wondering sight I turn,<br/>
And roofs, amidst a blaze of glory burn!<br/>
Some visitant of pure ethereal race<br/>
With his bright presence deigns the dome to grace."
</p>
<p>
"Be calm (replies the sire); to none impart,<br/>
But oft revolve the vision in thy heart:<br/>
Celestials, mantled in excess of light,<br/>
Can visit unapproach'd by mortal sight.<br/>
Seek thou repose: whilst here I sole remain,<br/>
To explore the conduct of the female train:<br/>
The pensive queen, perchance, desires to know<br/>
The series of my toils, to soothe her woe."
</p>
<p>
With tapers flaming day his train attends,<br/>
His bright alcove the obsequious youth ascends:<br/>
Soft slumberous shades his drooping eyelids close,<br/>
Till on her eastern throne Aurora glows.
</p>
<p>
Whilst, forming plans of death, Ulysses stay'd,<br/>
In counsel secret with the martial maid,<br/>
Attendant nymphs in beauteous order wait<br/>
The queen, descending from her bower of state.<br/>
Her cheeks the warmer blush of Venus wear,<br/>
Chasten'd with coy Diana's pensive air.<br/>
An ivory seat with silver ringlets graced,<br/>
By famed Icmalius wrought, the menials placed:<br/>
With ivory silver'd thick the footstool shone,<br/>
O'er which the panther's various hide was thrown.<br/>
The sovereign seat with graceful air she press'd;<br/>
To different tasks their toil the nymphs address'd:<br/>
The golden goblets some, and some restored<br/>
From stains of luxury the polish'd board:<br/>
These to remove the expiring embers came,<br/>
While those with unctuous fir foment the flame.
</p>
<p>
'Twas then Melantho with imperious mien<br/>
Renew'd the attack, incontinent of spleen:<br/>
"Avaunt (she cried), offensive to my sight!<br/>
Deem not in ambush here to lurk by night,<br/>
Into the woman-state asquint to pry;<br/>
A day-devourer, and an evening spy!<br/>
Vagrant, begone! before this blazing brand<br/>
Shall urge"&mdash;and waved it hissing in her hand.
</p>
<p>
The insulted hero rolls his wrathful eyes<br/>
And "Why so turbulent of soul? (he cries;)<br/>
Can these lean shrivell'd limbs, unnerved with age,<br/>
These poor but honest rags, enkindle rage?<br/>
In crowds, we wear the badge of hungry fate:<br/>
And beg, degraded from superior state!<br/>
Constrain'd a rent-charge on the rich I live;<br/>
Reduced to crave the good I once could give:<br/>
A palace, wealth, and slaves, I late possess'd,<br/>
And all that makes the great be call'd the bless'd:<br/>
My gate, an emblem of my open soul,<br/>
Embraced the poor, and dealt a bounteous dole.<br/>
Scorn not the sad reverse, injurious maid!<br/>
'Tis Jove's high will, and be his will obey'd!<br/>
Nor think thyself exempt: that rosy prime<br/>
Must share the general doom of withering time:<br/>
To some new channel soon the changeful tide<br/>
Of royal grace the offended queen may guide;<br/>
And her loved lord unplume thy towering pride.<br/>
Or, were he dead, 'tis wisdom to beware:<br/>
Sweet blooms the prince beneath Apollo's care;<br/>
Your deeds with quick impartial eye surveys,<br/>
Potent to punish what he cannot praise."
</p>
<p>
Her keen reproach had reach'd the sovereign's ear:<br/>
"Loquacious insolent! (she cries,) forbear;<br/>
To thee the purpose of my soul I told;<br/>
Venial discourse, unblamed, with him to hold;<br/>
The storied labours of my wandering lord,<br/>
To soothe my grief he haply may record:<br/>
Yet him, my guest, thy venom'd rage hath stung;<br/>
Thy head shall pay the forfeit of thy tongue!<br/>
But thou on whom my palace cares depend,<br/>
Eurynome, regard the stranger-friend:<br/>
A seat, soft spread with furry spoils, prepare;<br/>
Due-distant for us both to speak, and hear."
</p>
<p>
The menial fair obeys with duteous haste:<br/>
A seat adorn'd with furry spoils she placed:<br/>
Due-distant for discourse the hero sate;<br/>
When thus the sovereign from her chair of state:
</p>
<p>
"Reveal, obsequious to my first demand,<br/>
Thy name, thy lineage, and thy natal land."
</p>
<p>
He thus: "O queen! whose far-resounding fame<br/>
Is bounded only by the starry frame,<br/>
Consummate pattern of imperial sway,<br/>
Whose pious rule a warlike race obey!<br/>
In wavy gold thy summer vales are dress'd;<br/>
Thy autumns bind with copious fruit oppress'd:<br/>
With flocks and herds each grassy plain is stored;<br/>
And fish of every fin thy seas afford:<br/>
Their affluent joys the grateful realms confess;<br/>
And bless the power that still delights to bless,<br/>
Gracious permit this prayer, imperial dame!<br/>
Forbear to know my lineage, or my name:<br/>
Urge not this breast to heave, these eyes to weep;<br/>
In sweet oblivion let my sorrows sleep!<br/>
My woes awaked, will violate your ear,<br/>
And to this gay censorious train appear<br/>
A whiny vapour melting in a tear."
</p>
<p>
"Their gifts the gods resumed (the queen rejoin'd),<br/>
Exterior grace, and energy of mind,<br/>
When the dear partner of my nuptial joy,<br/>
Auxiliar troops combined, to conquer Troy.<br/>
My lord's protecting hand alone would raise<br/>
My drooping verdure, and extend my praise!<br/>
Peers from the distant Samian shore resort:<br/>
Here with Dulichians join'd, besiege the court:<br/>
Zacynthus, green with ever-shady groves,<br/>
And Ithaca, presumptuous, boast their loves:<br/>
Obtruding on my choice a second lord,<br/>
They press the Hymenaean rite abhorr'd.<br/>
Misrule thus mingling with domestic cares,<br/>
I live regardless of my state affairs;<br/>
Receive no stranger-guest, no poor relieve;<br/>
But ever for my lord in secret grieve!&mdash;<br/>
This art, instinct by some celestial power,<br/>
I tried, elusive of the bridal hour:
</p>
<p>
"'Ye peers, (I cry,) who press to gain a heart,<br/>
Where dead Ulysses claims no future part;<br/>
Rebate your loves, each rival suit suspend,<br/>
Till this funeral web my labours end:<br/>
Cease, till to good Laertes I bequeath<br/>
A pall of state, the ornament of death.<br/>
For when to fate he bows, each Grecian dame<br/>
With just reproach were licensed to defame,<br/>
Should he, long honour'd in supreme command,<br/>
Want the last duties of a daughter's hand.'<br/>
The fiction pleased; their loves I long elude;<br/>
The night still ravell'd what the day renew'd:<br/>
Three years successful in my heart conceal'd,<br/>
My ineffectual fraud the fourth reveal'd:<br/>
Befriended by my own domestic spies,<br/>
The woof unwrought the suitor-train surprise.<br/>
From nuptial rites they now no more recede,<br/>
And fear forbids to falsify the brede.<br/>
My anxious parents urge a speedy choice,<br/>
And to their suffrage gain the filial voice.<br/>
For rule mature, Telemachus deplores<br/>
His dome dishonour'd, and exhausted stores&mdash;<br/>
But, stranger! as thy days seem full of fate,<br/>
Divide discourse, in turn thy birth relate:<br/>
Thy port asserts thee of distinguish'd race;<br/>
No poor unfather'd product of disgrace."
</p>
<p>
"Princess! (he cries,) renew'd by your command,<br/>
The dear remembrance of my native land<br/>
Of secret grief unseals the fruitful source;<br/>
Fond tears repeat their long-forgotten course!<br/>
So pays the wretch whom fate constrains to roam,<br/>
The dues of nature to his natal home!&mdash;<br/>
But inward on my soul let sorrow prey,<br/>
Your sovereign will my duty bids obey.
</p>
<p>
"Crete awes the circling waves, a fruitful soil!<br/>
And ninety cities crown the sea-born isle:<br/>
Mix'd with her genuine sons, adopted names<br/>
In various tongues avow their various claims:<br/>
Cydonians, dreadful with the bended yew,<br/>
And bold Pelasgi boast a native's due:<br/>
The Dorians, plumed amid the files of war,<br/>
Her foodful glebe with fierce Achaians share;<br/>
Cnossus, her capital of high command;<br/>
Where sceptred Minos with impartial hand<br/>
Divided right: each ninth revolving year,<br/>
By Jove received in council to confer.<br/>
His son Deucalion bore successive sway:<br/>
His son, who gave me first to view the day!<br/>
The royal bed an elder issue bless'd,<br/>
Idomeneus whom Ilion fields attest<br/>
Of matchless deeds: untrain'd to martial toil,<br/>
I lived inglorious in my native isle,<br/>
Studious of peace, and Æthon is my name.<br/>
'Twas then to Crete the great Ulysses came.<br/>
For elemental war, and wintry Jove,<br/>
From Malea's gusty cape his navy drove<br/>
To bright Lucina's fane; the shelfy coast<br/>
Where loud Amnisus in the deep is lost.<br/>
His vessels moor'd (an incommodious port!)<br/>
The hero speeded to the Cnossian court:<br/>
Ardent the partner of his arms to find,<br/>
In leagues of long commutual friendship join'd.<br/>
Vain hope! ten suns had warm'd the western strand<br/>
Since my brave brother, with his Cretan band,<br/>
Had sail'd for Troy: but to the genial feast<br/>
My honour'd roof received the royal guest:<br/>
Beeves for his train the Cnossian peers assign,<br/>
A public treat, with jars of generous wine.<br/>
Twelve days while Boreas vex'd the aërial space,<br/>
My hospitable dome he deign'd to grace:<br/>
And when the north had ceased the stormy roar,<br/>
He wing'd his voyage to the Phrygian shore."
</p>
<p>
Thus the fam'd hero, perfected in wiles,<br/>
With fair similitude of truth beguiles<br/>
The queen's attentive ear: dissolved in woe,<br/>
From her bright eyes the tears unbounded flow,<br/>
As snows collected on the mountain freeze;<br/>
When milder regions breathe a vernal breeze,<br/>
The fleecy pile obeys the whispering gales,<br/>
Ends in a stream, and murmurs through the vales:<br/>
So, melting with the pleasing tale he told,<br/>
Down her fair cheek the copious torrent roll'd:<br/>
She to her present lord laments him lost,<br/>
And views that object which she wants the most,<br/>
Withering at heart to see the weeping fair,<br/>
His eyes look stern, and cast a gloomy stare;<br/>
Of horn the stiff relentless balls appear,<br/>
Or globes of iron fix'd in either sphere;<br/>
Firm wisdom interdicts the softening tear.<br/>
A speechless interval of grief ensues,<br/>
Till thus the queen the tender theme renews.
</p>
<p>
"Stranger! that e'er thy hospitable roof<br/>
Ulysses graced, confirm by faithful proof;<br/>
Delineate to my view my warlike lord,<br/>
His form, his habit, and his train record."
</p>
<p>
"'Tis hard (he cries,) to bring to sudden sight<br/>
Ideas that have wing'd their distant flight;<br/>
Rare on the mind those images are traced,<br/>
Whose footsteps twenty winters have defaced:<br/>
But what I can, receive.&mdash;In ample mode,<br/>
A robe of military purple flow'd<br/>
O'er all his frame: illustrious on his breast,<br/>
The double-clasping gold the king confess'd.<br/>
In the rich woof a hound, mosaic drawn,<br/>
Bore on full stretch, and seized a dappled fawn;<br/>
Deep in the neck his fangs indent their hold;<br/>
They pant and struggle in the moving gold.<br/>
Fine as a filmy web beneath it shone<br/>
A vest, that dazzled like a cloudless sun:<br/>
The female train who round him throng'd to gaze,<br/>
In silent wonder sigh'd unwilling praise.<br/>
A sabre, when the warrior press'd to part,<br/>
I gave, enamell'd with Vulcanian art:<br/>
A mantle purple-tinged, and radiant vest,<br/>
Dimension'd equal to his size, express'd<br/>
Affection grateful to my honour'd guest.<br/>
A favourite herald in his train I knew,<br/>
His visage solemn, sad of sable hue:<br/>
Short woolly curls o'erfleeced his bending head,<br/>
O'er which a promontory shoulder spread;<br/>
Eurybates; in whose large soul alone<br/>
Ulysses view'd an image of his own."
</p>
<p>
His speech the tempest of her grief restored;<br/>
In all he told she recognized her lord:<br/>
But when the storm was spent in plenteous showers,<br/>
A pause inspiriting her languish'd powers,<br/>
"O thou, (she cried,) whom first inclement Fate<br/>
Made welcome to my hospitable gate;<br/>
With all thy wants the name of poor shall end:<br/>
Henceforth live honour'd, my domestic friend!<br/>
The vest much envied on your native coast,<br/>
And regal robe with figured gold emboss'd,<br/>
In happier hours my artful hand employ'd,<br/>
When my loved lord this blissful bower enjoy'd:<br/>
The fall of Troy erroneous and forlorn<br/>
Doom'd to survive, and never to return!"
</p>
<p>
Then he, with pity touch'd: "O royal dame!<br/>
Your ever-anxious mind, and beauteous frame,<br/>
From the devouring rage of grief reclaim.<br/>
I not the fondness of your soul reprove<br/>
For such a lord! who crown'd your virgin love<br/>
With the dear blessing of a fair increase;<br/>
Himself adorn'd with more than mortal grace:<br/>
Yet while I speak the mighty woe suspend;<br/>
Truth forms my tale; to pleasing truth attend.<br/>
The royal object of your dearest care<br/>
Breathes in no distant clime the vital air:<br/>
In rich Thesprotia, and the nearer bound<br/>
Of Thessaly, his name I heard renown'd:<br/>
Without retinue, to that friendly shore<br/>
Welcomed with gifts of price, a sumless store!<br/>
His sacrilegious train, who dared to prey<br/>
On herds devoted to the god of day,<br/>
Were doom'd by Jove, and Phœbus' just decree,<br/>
To perish in the rough Trinacrian sea.<br/>
To better fate the blameless chief ordain'd,<br/>
A floating fragment of the wreck regain'd,<br/>
And rode the storm; till, by the billows toss'd,<br/>
He landed on the fair Phæacian coast.<br/>
That race who emulate the life of gods,<br/>
Receive him joyous to their bless'd abodes;<br/>
Large gifts confer, a ready sail command,<br/>
To speed his voyage to the Grecian strand.<br/>
But your wise lord (in whose capacious soul<br/>
High schemes of power in just succession roll)<br/>
His Ithaca refused from favouring Fate,<br/>
Till copious wealth might guard his regal state.<br/>
Phedon the fact affirm'd, whose sovereign sway<br/>
Thesprotian tribes, a duteous race, obey;<br/>
And bade the gods this added truth attest<br/>
(While pure libations crown'd the genial feast),<br/>
That anchor'd in his port the vessels stand,<br/>
To waft the hero to his natal land.<br/>
I for Dulichium urge the watery way,<br/>
But first the Ulyssean wealth survey:<br/>
So rich the value of a store so vast<br/>
Demands the pomp of centuries to waste!<br/>
The darling object of your royal love<br/>
Was journey'd thence to Dodonean Jove;<br/>
By the sure precept of the sylvan shrine,<br/>
To form the conduct of his great design;<br/>
Irresolute of soul, his state to shroud<br/>
In dark disguise, or come, a king avow'd!<br/>
Thus lives your lord; nor longer doom'd to roam;<br/>
Soon will he grace this dear paternal dome.<br/>
By Jove, the source of good, supreme in power!<br/>
By the bless'd genius of this friendly bower!<br/>
I ratify my speech, before the sun<br/>
His annual longitude of heaven shall run;<br/>
When the pale empress of yon starry train<br/>
In the next month renews her faded wane,<br/>
Ulysses will assert his rightful reign."
</p>
<p>
"What thanks! what boon! (replied the queen), are due,<br/>
When time shall prove the storied blessing true!<br/>
My lord's return should fate no more retard,<br/>
Envy shall sicken at thy vast reward.<br/>
But my prophetic fears, alas! presage<br/>
The wounds of Destiny's relentless rage.<br/>
I long must weep, nor will Ulysses come,<br/>
With royal gifts to send you honour'd home!&mdash;<br/>
Your other task, ye menial train forbear:<br/>
Now wash the stranger, and the bed prepare:<br/>
With splendid palls the downy fleece adorn:<br/>
Uprising early with the purple morn.<br/>
His sinews, shrunk with age, and stiff with toil,<br/>
In the warm bath foment with fragrant oil.<br/>
Then with Telemachus the social feast<br/>
Partaking free, my soul invited guest;<br/>
Whoe'er neglects to pay distinction due,<br/>
The breach of hospitable right may rue.<br/>
The vulgar of my sex I most exceed<br/>
In real fame, when most humane my deed;<br/>
And vainly to the praise of queen aspire,<br/>
If, stranger! I permit that mean attire<br/>
Beneath the feastful bower. A narrow space<br/>
Confines the circle of our destin'd race;<br/>
'Tis ours with good the scanty round to grace.<br/>
Those who to cruel wrong their state abuse,<br/>
Dreaded in life the mutter'd curse pursues;<br/>
By death disrobed of all their savage powers,<br/>
Then, licensed rage her hateful prey devours.<br/>
But he whose inborn worth his acts commend,<br/>
Of gentle soul, to human race a friend;<br/>
The wretched he relieves diffuse his fame,<br/>
And distant tongues extol the patron-name."
</p>
<p>
"Princess? (he cried) in vain your bounties flow<br/>
On me, confirm'd and obstinate in woe.<br/>
When my loved Crete received my final view,<br/>
And from my weeping eyes her cliffs withdrew;<br/>
These tatter'd weeds (my decent robes resign'd)<br/>
I chose, the livery of a woful mind!<br/>
Nor will my heart-corroding care abate<br/>
With splendid palls, and canopies of state:<br/>
Low-couch'd on earth, the gift of sleep I scorn,<br/>
And catch the glances of the waking morn.<br/>
The delicacy of your courtly train<br/>
To wash a wretched wanderer would disdain;<br/>
But if, in tract of long experience tried,<br/>
And sad similitude of woes allied,<br/>
Some wretch reluctant views aërial light,<br/>
To her mean hand assign the friendly rite."
</p>
<p>
Pleased with his wise reply, the queen rejoin'd:<br/>
"Such gentle manners, and so sage a mind,<br/>
In all who graced this hospitable bower<br/>
I ne'er discerned, before this social hour.<br/>
Such servant as your humble choice requires,<br/>
To light received the lord of my desires,<br/>
New from the birth; and with a mother's hand<br/>
His tender bloom to manly growth sustain'd:<br/>
Of matchless prudence, and a duteous mind;<br/>
Though now to life's extremest verge declined,<br/>
Of strength superior to the toil design'd&mdash;<br/>
Rise, Euryclea! with officious care<br/>
For the poor friend the cleansing bath prepare:<br/>
This debt his correspondent fortunes claim,<br/>
Too like Ulysses, and perhaps the same!<br/>
Thus old with woes my fancy paints him now!<br/>
For age untimely marks the careful brow."
</p>
<p>
Instant, obsequious to the mild command,<br/>
Sad Euryclea rose: with trembling hand<br/>
She veils the torrent of her tearful eyes;<br/>
And thus impassion'd to herself replies:
</p>
<p>
"Son of my love, and monarch of my cares,<br/>
What pangs for thee this wretched bosom bears!<br/>
Are thus by Jove who constant beg his aid<br/>
With pious deed, and pure devotion, paid?<br/>
He never dared defraud the sacred fane<br/>
Of perfect hecatombs in order slain:<br/>
There oft implored his tutelary power,<br/>
Long to protract the sad sepulchral hour;<br/>
That, form'd for empire with paternal care,<br/>
His realm might recognize an equal heir.<br/>
O destined head! The pious vows are lost;<br/>
His God forgets him on a foreign coast!&mdash;<br/>
Perhaps, like thee, poor guest! in wanton pride<br/>
The rich insult him, and the young deride!<br/>
Conscious of worth reviled, thy generous mind<br/>
The friendly rite of purity declined;<br/>
My will concurring with my queen's command,<br/>
Accept the bath from this obsequious hand.<br/>
A strong emotion shakes my anguish'd breast:<br/>
In thy whole form Ulysses seems express'd;<br/>
Of all the wretched harboured on our coast,<br/>
None imaged e'er like thee my master lost."
</p>
<p>
Thus half-discover'd through the dark disguise,<br/>
With cool composure feign'd, the chief replies:<br/>
"You join your suffrage to the public vote;<br/>
The same you think have all beholders thought."
</p>
<p>
He said: replenish'd from the purest springs,<br/>
The laver straight with busy care she brings:<br/>
In the deep vase, that shone like burnish'd gold,<br/>
The boiling fluid temperates the cold.<br/>
Meantime revolving in his thoughtful mind<br/>
The scar, with which his manly knee was sign'd;<br/>
His face averting from the crackling blaze,<br/>
His shoulders intercept the unfriendly rays:<br/>
Thus cautious in the obscure he hoped to fly<br/>
The curious search of Euryclea's eye.<br/>
Cautious in vain! nor ceased the dame to find<br/>
This scar with which his manly knee was sign'd.
</p>
<p>
This on Parnassus (combating the boar)<br/>
With glancing rage the tusky savage tore.<br/>
Attended by his brave maternal race,<br/>
His grandsire sent him to the sylvan chase,<br/>
Autolycus the bold (a mighty name<br/>
For spotless faith and deeds of martial fame:<br/>
Hermes, his patron god, those gifts bestow'd,<br/>
Whose shrine with weanling lambs he wont to load).<br/>
His course to Ithaca this hero sped,<br/>
When the first product of Laertes' bed<br/>
Was now disclosed to birth: the banquet ends,<br/>
When Euryclea from the queen descends,<br/>
And to his fond embrace the babe commends:<br/>
"Receive (she cries) your royal daughter's son;<br/>
And name the blessing that your prayers have won."<br/>
Then thus the hoary chief: "My victor arms<br/>
Have awed the realms around with dire alarms:<br/>
A sure memorial of my dreaded fame<br/>
The boy shall bear; Ulysses be his name!<br/>
And when with filial love the youth shall come<br/>
To view his mother's soil, my Delphic dome<br/>
With gifts of price shall send him joyous home."<br/>
Lured with the promised boon, when youthful prime<br/>
Ended in man, his mother's natal clime<br/>
Ulysses sought; with fond affection dear<br/>
Amphitea's arms received the royal heir:<br/>
Her ancient lord an equal joy possess'd;<br/>
Instant he bade prepare the genial feast:<br/>
A steer to form the sumptuous banquet bled,<br/>
Whose stately growth five flowery summers fed:<br/>
His sons divide, and roast with artful care<br/>
The limbs; then all the tasteful viands share.<br/>
Nor ceased discourse (the banquet of the soul),<br/>
Till Phœbus wheeling to the western goal<br/>
Resign'd the skies, and night involved the pole.<br/>
Their drooping eyes the slumberous shade oppress'd,<br/>
Sated they rose, and all retired to rest.
</p>
<p>
Soon as the morn, new-robed in purple light,<br/>
Pierced with her golden shafts the rear of night,<br/>
Ulysses, and his brave maternal race,<br/>
The young Autolyci, essay the chase.<br/>
Parnassus, thick perplex'd with horrid shades,<br/>
With deep-mouth'd hounds the hunter-troop invades;<br/>
What time the sun, from ocean's peaceful stream,<br/>
Darts o'er the lawn his horizontal beam.<br/>
The pack impatient snuff the tainted gale;<br/>
The thorny wilds the woodmen fierce assail:<br/>
And, foremost of the train, his cornel spear<br/>
Ulysses waved, to rouse the savage war.<br/>
Deep in the rough recesses of the wood,<br/>
A lofty copse, the growth of ages, stood;<br/>
Nor winter's boreal blast, nor thunderous shower,<br/>
Nor solar ray, could pierce the shady bower.<br/>
With wither'd foliage strew'd, a heapy store!<br/>
The warm pavilion of a dreadful boar.<br/>
Roused by the hounds' and hunters' mingling cries,<br/>
The savage from his leafy shelter flies;<br/>
With fiery glare his sanguine eye-balls shine,<br/>
And bristles high impale his horrid chine.<br/>
Young Ithacus advanced, defies the foe,<br/>
Poising his lifted lance in act to throw;<br/>
The savage renders vain the wound decreed,<br/>
And springs impetuous with opponent speed!<br/>
His tusks oblique he aim'd, the knee to gore;<br/>
Aslope they glanced, the sinewy fibres tore,<br/>
And bared the bone; Ulysses undismay'd,<br/>
Soon with redoubled force the wound repaid;<br/>
To the right shoulder-joint the spear applied,<br/>
His further flank with streaming purple dyed:<br/>
On earth he rushed with agonizing pain;<br/>
With joy and vast surprise, the applauding train<br/>
View'd his enormous bulk extended on the plain.<br/>
With bandage firm Ulysses' knee they bound;<br/>
Then, chanting mystic lays, the closing wound<br/>
Of sacred melody confess'd the force;<br/>
The tides of life regain'd their azure course.<br/>
Then back they led the youth with loud acclaim;<br/>
Autolycus, enamoured with his fame,<br/>
Confirm'd the cure; and from the Delphic dome<br/>
With added gifts return'd him glorious home.<br/>
He safe at Ithaca with joy received,<br/>
Relates the chase, and early praise achieved.
</p>
<p>
Deep o'er his knee inseam'd remain'd the scar;<br/>
Which noted token of the woodland war<br/>
When Euryclea found, the ablution ceased:<br/>
Down dropp'd the leg, from her slack hand released;<br/>
The mingled fluids from the base redound;<br/>
The vase reclining floats the floor around!<br/>
Smiles dew'd with tears the pleasing strife express'd<br/>
Of grief and joy, alternate in her breast.<br/>
Her fluttering words in melting murmurs died;<br/>
At length abrupt&mdash;"My son!&mdash;my king!"&mdash;she cried.<br/>
His neck with fond embrace infolding fast,<br/>
Full on the queen her raptured eye she cast<br/>
Ardent to speak the monarch safe restored:<br/>
But, studious to conceal her royal lord,<br/>
Minerva fix'd her mind on views remote,<br/>
And from the present bliss abstracts her thought.<br/>
His hand to Euryclea's mouth applied,<br/>
"Art thou foredoom'd my pest? (the hero cried:)<br/>
Thy milky founts my infant lips have drain'd;<br/>
And have the Fates thy babbling age ordain'd<br/>
To violate the life thy youth sustain'd?<br/>
An exile have I told, with weeping eyes,<br/>
Full twenty annual suns in distant skies;<br/>
At length return'd, some god inspires thy breast<br/>
To know thy king, and here I stand confess'd.<br/>
This heaven-discover'd truth to thee consign'd,<br/>
Reserve the treasure of thy inmost mind:<br/>
Else, if the gods my vengeful arm sustain,<br/>
And prostrate to my sword the suitor-train;<br/>
With their lewd mates, thy undistinguish'd age<br/>
Shall bleed a victim to vindictive rage."
</p>
<p>
Then thus rejoin'd the dame, devoid of fear:<br/>
"What words, my son, have passed thy lips severe?<br/>
Deep in my soul the trust shall lodge secured;<br/>
With ribs of steel, and marble heart, immured.<br/>
When Heaven, auspicious to thy right avow'd,<br/>
Shall prostrate to thy sword the suitor-crowd,<br/>
The deeds I'll blazon of the menial fair;<br/>
The lewd to death devote, the virtuous spare."
</p>
<p>
"Thy aid avails me not (the chief replied);<br/>
My own experience shall their doom decide:<br/>
A witness-judge precludes a long appeal:<br/>
Suffice it then thy monarch to conceal."
</p>
<p>
He said: obsequious, with redoubled pace,<br/>
She to the fount conveys the exhausted vase:<br/>
The bath renew'd, she ends the pleasing toil<br/>
With plenteous unction of ambrosial oil.<br/>
Adjusting to his limbs the tatter'd vest,<br/>
His former seat received the stranger guest;<br/>
Whom thus with pensive air the queen addressed:
</p>
<p>
"Though night, dissolving grief in grateful ease,<br/>
Your drooping eyes with soft impression seize;<br/>
Awhile, reluctant to her pleasing force,<br/>
Suspend the restful hour with sweet discourse.<br/>
The day (ne'er brighten'd with a beam of joy!)<br/>
My menials, and domestic cares employ;<br/>
And, unattended by sincere repose,<br/>
The night assists my ever-wakeful woes;<br/>
When nature's hush'd beneath her brooding shade,<br/>
My echoing griefs the starry vault invade.<br/>
As when the months are clad in flowery green,<br/>
Sad Philomel, in bowery shades unseen,<br/>
To vernal airs attunes her varied strains;<br/>
And Itylus sounds warbling o'er the plains;<br/>
Young Itylus, his parents' darling joy!<br/>
Whom chance misled the mother to destroy;<br/>
Now doom'd a wakeful bird to wail the beauteous boy.<br/>
So in nocturnal solitude forlorn,<br/>
A sad variety of woes I mourn!<br/>
My mind, reflective, in a thorny maze<br/>
Devious from care to care incessant strays.<br/>
Now, wavering doubt succeeds to long despair;<br/>
Shall I my virgin nuptial vow revere;<br/>
And, joining to my son's my menial train,<br/>
Partake his counsels, and assist his reign?<br/>
Or, since, mature in manhood, he deplores<br/>
His dome dishonour'd, and exhausted stores;<br/>
Shall I, reluctant! to his will accord;<br/>
And from the peers select the noblest lord;<br/>
So by my choice avow'd, at length decide<br/>
These wasteful love-debates, a mourning bride!<br/>
A visionary thought I'll now relate;<br/>
Illustrate, if you know, the shadow'd fate:
</p>
<p>
"A team of twenty geese (a snow-white train!)<br/>
Fed near the limpid lake with golden grain,<br/>
Amuse my pensive hours. The bird of Jove<br/>
Fierce from his mountain-eyrie downward drove;<br/>
Each favourite fowl he pounced with deathful sway,<br/>
And back triumphant wing'd his airy way.<br/>
My pitying eyes effused a plenteous stream,<br/>
To view their death thus imaged in a dream;<br/>
With tender sympathy to soothe my soul,<br/>
A troop of matrons, fancy-form'd, condole.<br/>
But whilst with grief and rage my bosom burn'd,<br/>
Sudden the tyrant of the skies returned;<br/>
Perch'd on the battlements he thus began<br/>
(In form an eagle, but in voice a man):<br/>
`O queen! no vulgar vision of the sky<br/>
I come, prophetic of approaching joy;<br/>
View in this plumy form thy victor-lord;<br/>
The geese (a glutton race) by thee deplored,<br/>
Portend the suitors fated to my sword.'<br/>
This said, the pleasing feather'd omen ceased.<br/>
When from the downy bands of sleep released,<br/>
Fast by the limpid lake my swan-like train<br/>
I found, insatiate of the golden grain."
</p>
<p>
"The vision self-explain'd (the chief replies)<br/>
Sincere reveals the sanction of the skies;<br/>
Ulysses speaks his own return decreed;<br/>
And by his sword the suitors sure to bleed."
</p>
<p>
"Hard is the task, and rare," (the queen rejoin'd,)<br/>
Impending destinies in dreams to find;<br/>
Immured within the silent bower of sleep,<br/>
Two portals firm the various phantoms keep;<br/>
Of ivory one; whence flit, to mock the brain,<br/>
Of winged lies a light fantastic train;<br/>
The gate opposed pellucid valves adorn,<br/>
And columns fair incased with polish'd horn;<br/>
Where images of truth for passage wait,<br/>
With visions manifest of future fate.<br/>
Not to this troop, I fear, that phantom soar'd,<br/>
Which spoke Ulysses to this realm restored;<br/>
Delusive semblance!-but my remnant life<br/>
Heaven shall determine in a gameful strife;<br/>
With that famed bow Ulysses taught to bend,<br/>
For me the rival archers shall contend.<br/>
As on the listed field he used to place<br/>
Six beams, opposed to six in equal space;<br/>
Elanced afar by his unerring art,<br/>
Sure through six circlets flew the whizzing dart.<br/>
So, when the sun restores the purple day,<br/>
Their strength and skill the suitors shall assay;<br/>
To him the spousal honour is decreed,<br/>
Who through the rings directs the feather'd reed.<br/>
Torn from these walls (where long the kinder powers<br/>
With joy and pomp have wing'd my youthful hours!)<br/>
On this poor breast no dawn of bliss shall beam;<br/>
The pleasure past supplies a copious theme<br/>
For many a dreary thought, and many a doleful dream!"
</p>
<p>
"Propose the sportive lot (the chief replies),<br/>
Nor dread to name yourself the bowyer's prize;<br/>
Ulysses will surprise the unfinish'd game,<br/>
Avow'd, and falsify the suitors' claim."
</p>
<p>
To whom with grace serene the queen rejoin'd:<br/>
"In all thy speech what pleasing force I find!<br/>
O'er my suspended woe thy words prevail;<br/>
I part reluctant from the pleasing tale,<br/>
But Heaven, that knows what all terrestrials need,<br/>
Repose to night, and toil to day decreed;<br/>
Grateful vicissitudes! yet me withdrawn,<br/>
Wakeful to weep and watch the tardy dawn<br/>
Establish'd use enjoins; to rest and joy<br/>
Estranged, since dear Ulysses sail'd to Troy!<br/>
Meantime instructed is the menial tribe<br/>
Your couch to fashion as yourself prescribe."
</p>
<p>
Thus affable, her bower the queen ascends;<br/>
The sovereign step a beauteous train attends;<br/>
There imaged to her soul Ulysses rose;<br/>
Down her pale cheek new-streaming sorrow flows;<br/>
Till soft oblivious shade Minerva spread,<br/>
And o'er her eyes ambrosial slumber shed.

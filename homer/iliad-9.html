<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book IX</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Thus joyful Troy maintain'd the watch of night;<br/>
While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,<br/>
And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,<br/>
Sat on each face, and sadden'd every heart.<br/>
As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,<br/>
A double tempest of the west and north<br/>
Swells o'er the sea, from Thracia's frozen shore,<br/>
Heaps waves on waves, and bids the Ægean roar:<br/>
This way and that the boiling deeps are toss'd:<br/>
Such various passions urged the troubled host,<br/>
Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest;<br/>
Superior sorrows swell'd his royal breast;<br/>
Himself his orders to the heralds bears,<br/>
To bid to council all the Grecian peers,<br/>
But bid in whispers: these surround their chief,<br/>
In solemn sadness and majestic grief.<br/>
The king amidst the mournful circle rose:<br/>
Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.<br/>
So silent fountains, from a rock's tall head,<br/>
In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.<br/>
With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress'd;<br/>
Words, mix'd with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader's care;<br/>
Fellows in arms and princes of the war!<br/>
Of partial Jove too justly we complain,<br/>
And heavenly oracles believed in vain.<br/>
A safe return was promised to our toils,<br/>
With conquest honour'd and enrich'd with spoils:<br/>
Now shameful flight alone can save the host;<br/>
Our wealth, our people, and our glory lost.<br/>
So Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!<br/>
Jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,<br/>
Who shakes the feeble props of human trust,<br/>
And towers and armies humbles to the dust.<br/>
Haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,<br/>
Haste to the joys our native country yields;<br/>
Spread all your canvas, all your oars employ,<br/>
Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: deep silence held the Grecian band;<br/>
Silent, unmov'd in dire dismay they stand;<br/>
A pensive scene! till Tydeus' warlike son<br/>
Roll'd on the king his eyes, and thus begun:<br/>
"When kings advise us to renounce our fame,<br/>
First let him speak who first has suffer'd shame.<br/>
If I oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,<br/>
The laws of council bid my tongue be bold.<br/>
Thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,<br/>
Durst brand my courage, and defame my might:<br/>
Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear'd,<br/>
The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.<br/>
The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,<br/>
The gods have made thee but by halves a king:<br/>
They gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;<br/>
They gave dominion o'er the seas and land;<br/>
The noblest power that might the world control<br/>
They gave thee not—a brave and virtuous soul.<br/>
Is this a general's voice, that would suggest<br/>
Fears like his own to every Grecian breast?<br/>
Confiding in our want of worth, he stands;<br/>
And if we fly, 'tis what our king commands.<br/>
Go thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain;<br/>
Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main;<br/>
A noble care the Grecians shall employ,<br/>
To combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.<br/>
Here Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire,<br/>
Myself shall stay, till Troy or I expire;<br/>
Myself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;<br/>
God bade us fight, and 'twas with God we came."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He ceased; the Greeks loud acclamations raise,<br/>
And voice to voice resounds Tydides' praise.<br/>
Wise Nestor then his reverend figure rear'd;<br/>
He spoke: the host in still attention heard:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O truly great! in whom the gods have join'd<br/>
Such strength of body with such force of mind:<br/>
In conduct, as in courage, you excel,<br/>
Still first to act what you advise so well.<br/>
These wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves,<br/>
Applauding Greece with common voice approves.<br/>
Kings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth:<br/>
And blame even kings with praise, because with truth.<br/>
And yet those years that since thy birth have run<br/>
Would hardly style thee Nestor's youngest son.<br/>
Then let me add what yet remains behind,<br/>
A thought unfinish'd in that generous mind;<br/>
Age bids me speak! nor shall the advice I bring<br/>
Distaste the people, or offend the king:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Cursed is the man, and void of law and right,<br/>
Unworthy property, unworthy light,<br/>
Unfit for public rule, or private care,<br/>
That wretch, that monster, who delights in war;<br/>
Whose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,<br/>
To tear his country, and his kind destroy!<br/>
This night, refresh and fortify thy train;<br/>
Between the trench and wall let guards remain:<br/>
Be that the duty of the young and bold;<br/>
But thou, O king, to council call the old;<br/>
Great is thy sway, and weighty are thy cares;<br/>
Thy high commands must spirit all our wars.<br/>
With Thracian wines recruit thy honour'd guests,<br/>
For happy counsels flow from sober feasts.<br/>
Wise, weighty counsels aid a state distress'd,<br/>
And such a monarch as can choose the best.<br/>
See what a blaze from hostile tents aspires,<br/>
How near our fleet approach the Trojan fires!<br/>
Who can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?<br/>
What eye beholds them, and can close to-night?<br/>
This dreadful interval determines all;<br/>
To-morrow, Troy must flame, or Greece must fall."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus spoke the hoary sage: the rest obey;<br/>
Swift through the gates the guards direct their way.<br/>
His son was first to pass the lofty mound,<br/>
The generous Thrasymed, in arms renown'd:<br/>
Next him, Ascalaphus, Ialmen, stood,<br/>
The double offspring of the warrior-god:<br/>
Deipyrus, Aphareus, Merion join,<br/>
And Lycomed of Creon's noble line.<br/>
Seven were the leaders of the nightly bands,<br/>
And each bold chief a hundred spears commands.<br/>
The fires they light, to short repasts they fall,<br/>
Some line the trench, and others man the wall.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The king of men, on public counsels bent,<br/>
Convened the princes in his ample tent,<br/>
Each seized a portion of the kingly feast,<br/>
But stay'd his hand when thirst and hunger ceased.<br/>
Then Nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved,<br/>
And slowly rising, thus the council moved.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Monarch of nations! whose superior sway<br/>
Assembled states, and lords of earth obey,<br/>
The laws and sceptres to thy hand are given,<br/>
And millions own the care of thee and Heaven.<br/>
O king! the counsels of my age attend;<br/>
With thee my cares begin, with thee must end.<br/>
Thee, prince! it fits alike to speak and hear,<br/>
Pronounce with judgment, with regard give ear,<br/>
To see no wholesome motion be withstood,<br/>
And ratify the best for public good.<br/>
Nor, though a meaner give advice, repine,<br/>
But follow it, and make the wisdom thine.<br/>
Hear then a thought, not now conceived in haste,<br/>
At once my present judgment and my past.<br/>
When from Pelides' tent you forced the maid,<br/>
I first opposed, and faithful, durst dissuade;<br/>
But bold of soul, when headlong fury fired,<br/>
You wronged the man, by men and gods admired:<br/>
Now seek some means his fatal wrath to end,<br/>
With prayers to move him, or with gifts to bend."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the king. "With justice hast thou shown<br/>
A prince's faults, and I with reason own.<br/>
That happy man, whom Jove still honours most,<br/>
Is more than armies, and himself a host.<br/>
Bless'd in his love, this wondrous hero stands;<br/>
Heaven fights his war, and humbles all our bands.<br/>
Fain would my heart, which err'd through frantic rage,<br/>
The wrathful chief and angry gods assuage.<br/>
If gifts immense his mighty soul can bow,<br/>
Hear, all ye Greeks, and witness what I vow.<br/>
Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,<br/>
And twice ten vases of refulgent mould:<br/>
Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame<br/>
Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;<br/>
Twelve steeds unmatch'd in fleetness and in force,<br/>
And still victorious in the dusty course;<br/>
(Rich were the man whose ample stores exceed<br/>
The prizes purchased by their winged speed;)<br/>
Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,<br/>
Skill'd in each art, unmatch'd in form divine,<br/>
The same I chose for more than vulgar charms,<br/>
When Lesbos sank beneath the hero's arms:<br/>
All these, to buy his friendship, shall be paid,<br/>
And join'd with these the long-contested maid;<br/>
With all her charms, Briseis I resign,<br/>
And solemn swear those charms were never mine;<br/>
Untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,<br/>
Pure from my arms, and guiltless of my loves,<br/>
These instant shall be his; and if the powers<br/>
Give to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers,<br/>
Then shall he store (when Greece the spoil divides)<br/>
With gold and brass his loaded navy's sides:<br/>
Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race<br/>
With copious love shall crown his warm embrace,<br/>
Such as himself will choose; who yield to none,<br/>
Or yield to Helen's heavenly charms alone.<br/>
Yet hear me further: when our wars are o'er,<br/>
If safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore,<br/>
There shall he live my son, our honours share,<br/>
And with Orestes' self divide my care.<br/>
Yet more—three daughters in my court are bred,<br/>
And each well worthy of a royal bed;<br/>
Laodice and Iphigenia fair,<br/>
And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair;<br/>
Her let him choose whom most his eyes approve,<br/>
I ask no presents, no reward for love:<br/>
Myself will give the dower; so vast a store<br/>
As never father gave a child before.<br/>
Seven ample cities shall confess his sway,<br/>
Him Enope, and Pherae him obey,<br/>
Cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,<br/>
And sacred Pedasus for vines renown'd;<br/>
Æpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,<br/>
And rich Antheia with her flowery fields:<br/>
The whole extent to Pylos' sandy plain,<br/>
Along the verdant margin of the main.<br/>
There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;<br/>
Bold are the men, and generous is the soil;<br/>
There shall he reign, with power and justice crown'd,<br/>
And rule the tributary realms around.<br/>
All this I give, his vengeance to control,<br/>
And sure all this may move his mighty soul.<br/>
Pluto, the grisly god, who never spares,<br/>
Who feels no mercy, and who hears no prayers,<br/>
Lives dark and dreadful in deep hell's abodes,<br/>
And mortals hate him, as the worst of gods.<br/>
Great though he be, it fits him to obey,<br/>
Since more than his my years, and more my sway."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The monarch thus. The reverend Nestor then:<br/>
"Great Agamemnon! glorious king of men!<br/>
Such are thy offers as a prince may take,<br/>
And such as fits a generous king to make.<br/>
Let chosen delegates this hour be sent<br/>
(Myself will name them) to Pelides' tent.<br/>
Let Phoenix lead, revered for hoary age,<br/>
Great Ajax next, and Ithacus the sage.<br/>
Yet more to sanctify the word you send,<br/>
Let Hodius and Eurybates attend.<br/>
Now pray to Jove to grant what Greece demands;<br/>
Pray in deep silence, and with purest hands."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; and all approved. The heralds bring<br/>
The cleansing water from the living spring.<br/>
The youth with wine the sacred goblets crown'd,<br/>
And large libations drench'd the sands around.<br/>
The rite perform'd, the chiefs their thirst allay,<br/>
Then from the royal tent they take their way;<br/>
Wise Nestor turns on each his careful eye,<br/>
Forbids to offend, instructs them to apply;<br/>
Much he advised them all, Ulysses most,<br/>
To deprecate the chief, and save the host.<br/>
Through the still night they march, and hear the roar<br/>
Of murmuring billows on the sounding shore.<br/>
To Neptune, ruler of the seas profound,<br/>
Whose liquid arms the mighty globe surround,<br/>
They pour forth vows, their embassy to bless,<br/>
And calm the rage of stern Æacides.<br/>
And now, arrived, where on the sandy bay<br/>
The Myrmidonian tents and vessels lay;<br/>
Amused at ease, the godlike man they found,<br/>
Pleased with the solemn harp's harmonious sound.<br/>
(The well wrought harp from conquered Thebae came;<br/>
Of polish'd silver was its costly frame.)<br/>
With this he soothes his angry soul, and sings<br/>
The immortal deeds of heroes and of kings.<br/>
Patroclus only of the royal train,<br/>
Placed in his tent, attends the lofty strain:<br/>
Full opposite he sat, and listen'd long,<br/>
In silence waiting till he ceased the song.<br/>
Unseen the Grecian embassy proceeds<br/>
To his high tent; the great Ulysses leads.<br/>
Achilles starting, as the chiefs he spied,<br/>
Leap'd from his seat, and laid the harp aside.<br/>
With like surprise arose Menoetius' son:<br/>
Pelides grasp'd their hands, and thus begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Princes, all hail! whatever brought you here.<br/>
Or strong necessity, or urgent fear;<br/>
Welcome, though Greeks! for not as foes ye came;<br/>
To me more dear than all that bear the name."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With that, the chiefs beneath his roof he led,<br/>
And placed in seats with purple carpets spread.<br/>
Then thus—"Patroclus, crown a larger bowl,<br/>
Mix purer wine, and open every soul.<br/>
Of all the warriors yonder host can send,<br/>
Thy friend most honours these, and these thy friend."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: Patroclus o'er the blazing fire<br/>
Heaps in a brazen vase three chines entire:<br/>
The brazen vase Automedon sustains,<br/>
Which flesh of porker, sheep, and goat contains.<br/>
Achilles at the genial feast presides,<br/>
The parts transfixes, and with skill divides.<br/>
Meanwhile Patroclus sweats, the fire to raise;<br/>
The tent is brighten'd with the rising blaze:<br/>
Then, when the languid flames at length subside,<br/>
He strows a bed of glowing embers wide,<br/>
Above the coals the smoking fragments turns<br/>
And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns;<br/>
With bread the glittering canisters they load,<br/>
Which round the board Menoetius' son bestow'd;<br/>
Himself, opposed to Ulysses full in sight,<br/>
Each portion parts, and orders every rite.<br/>
The first fat offering to the immortals due,<br/>
Amidst the greedy flames Patroclus threw;<br/>
Then each, indulging in the social feast,<br/>
His thirst and hunger soberly repress'd.<br/>
That done, to Phoenix Ajax gave the sign:<br/>
Not unperceived; Ulysses crown'd with wine<br/>
The foaming bowl, and instant thus began,<br/>
His speech addressing to the godlike man.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Health to Achilles! happy are thy guests!<br/>
Not those more honour'd whom Atrides feasts:<br/>
Though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards,<br/>
That, Agamemnon's regal tent affords;<br/>
But greater cares sit heavy on our souls,<br/>
Nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls.<br/>
What scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear!<br/>
The dead we mourn, and for the living fear;<br/>
Greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands,<br/>
And owns no help but from thy saving hands:<br/>
Troy and her aids for ready vengeance call;<br/>
Their threatening tents already shade our wall:<br/>
Hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim,<br/>
And point at every ship their vengeful flame!<br/>
For them the father of the gods declares,<br/>
Theirs are his omens, and his thunder theirs.<br/>
See, full of Jove, avenging Hector rise!<br/>
See! heaven and earth the raging chief defies;<br/>
What fury in his breast, what lightning in his eyes!<br/>
He waits but for the morn, to sink in flame<br/>
The ships, the Greeks, and all the Grecian name.<br/>
Heavens! how my country's woes distract my mind,<br/>
Lest Fate accomplish all his rage design'd!<br/>
And must we, gods! our heads inglorious lay<br/>
In Trojan dust, and this the fatal day?<br/>
Return, Achilles: oh return, though late,<br/>
To save thy Greeks, and stop the course of Fate;<br/>
If in that heart or grief or courage lies,<br/>
Rise to redeem; ah, yet to conquer, rise!<br/>
The day may come, when, all our warriors slain,<br/>
That heart shall melt, that courage rise in vain:<br/>
Regard in time, O prince divinely brave!<br/>
Those wholesome counsels which thy father gave.<br/>
When Peleus in his aged arms embraced<br/>
His parting son, these accents were his last:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"‘My child! with strength, with glory, and success,<br/>
Thy arms may Juno and Minerva bless!<br/>
Trust that to Heaven: but thou, thy cares engage<br/>
To calm thy passions, and subdue thy rage:<br/>
From gentler manners let thy glory grow,<br/>
And shun contention, the sure source of woe;<br/>
That young and old may in thy praise combine,<br/>
The virtues of humanity be thine—'<br/>
This now-despised advice thy father gave;<br/>
Ah! check thy anger; and be truly brave.<br/>
If thou wilt yield to great Atrides' prayers,<br/>
Gifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares;<br/>
If not—but hear me, while I number o'er<br/>
The proffer'd presents, an exhaustless store.<br/>
Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,<br/>
And twice ten vases of refulgent mould;<br/>
Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame<br/>
Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;<br/>
Twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force,<br/>
And still victorious in the dusty course;<br/>
(Rich were the man, whose ample stores exceed<br/>
The prizes purchased by their winged speed;)<br/>
Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,<br/>
Skill'd in each art, unmatch'd in form divine,<br/>
The same he chose for more than vulgar charms,<br/>
When Lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms.<br/>
All these, to buy thy friendship shall be paid,<br/>
And, join'd with these, the long-contested maid;<br/>
With all her charms, Briseis he'll resign,<br/>
And solemn swear those charms were only thine;<br/>
Untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,<br/>
Pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.<br/>
These instant shall be thine; and if the powers<br/>
Give to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers,<br/>
Then shalt thou store (when Greece the spoil divides)<br/>
With gold and brass thy loaded navy's sides.<br/>
Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race<br/>
With copious love shall crown thy warm embrace;<br/>
Such as thyself shall chose; who yield to none,<br/>
Or yield to Helen's heavenly charms alone.<br/>
Yet hear me further: when our wars are o'er,<br/>
If safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore,<br/>
There shalt thou live his son, his honour share,<br/>
And with Orestes' self divide his care.<br/>
Yet more—three daughters in his court are bred,<br/>
And each well worthy of a royal bed:<br/>
Laodice and Iphigenia fair,<br/>
And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair:<br/>
Her shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve;<br/>
He asks no presents, no reward for love:<br/>
Himself will give the dower; so vast a store<br/>
As never father gave a child before.<br/>
Seven ample cities shall confess thy sway,<br/>
The Enope and Pherae thee obey,<br/>
Cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,<br/>
And sacred Pedasus, for vines renown'd:<br/>
Æpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,<br/>
And rich Antheia with her flowery fields;<br/>
The whole extent to Pylos' sandy plain,<br/>
Along the verdant margin of the main.<br/>
There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;<br/>
Bold are the men, and generous is the soil.<br/>
There shalt thou reign, with power and justice crown'd,<br/>
And rule the tributary realms around.<br/>
Such are the proffers which this day we bring,<br/>
Such the repentance of a suppliant king.<br/>
But if all this, relentless, thou disdain,<br/>
If honour and if interest plead in vain,<br/>
Yet some redress to suppliant Greece afford,<br/>
And be, amongst her guardian gods, adored.<br/>
If no regard thy suffering country claim,<br/>
Hear thy own glory, and the voice of fame:<br/>
For now that chief, whose unresisted ire<br/>
Made nations tremble, and whole hosts retire,<br/>
Proud Hector, now, the unequal fight demands,<br/>
And only triumphs to deserve thy hands."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus the goddess-born: "Ulysses, hear<br/>
A faithful speech, that knows nor art nor fear;<br/>
What in my secret soul is understood,<br/>
My tongue shall utter, and my deeds make good.<br/>
Let Greece then know, my purpose I retain:<br/>
Nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.<br/>
Who dares think one thing, and another tell,<br/>
My heart detests him as the gates of hell.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then thus in short my fix'd resolves attend,<br/>
Which nor Atrides nor his Greeks can bend;<br/>
Long toils, long perils in their cause I bore,<br/>
But now the unfruitful glories charm no more.<br/>
Fight or not fight, a like reward we claim,<br/>
The wretch and hero find their prize the same.<br/>
Alike regretted in the dust he lies,<br/>
Who yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.<br/>
Of all my dangers, all my glorious pains,<br/>
A life of labours, lo! what fruit remains?<br/>
As the bold bird her helpless young attends,<br/>
From danger guards them, and from want defends;<br/>
In search of prey she wings the spacious air,<br/>
And with the untasted food supplies her care:<br/>
For thankless Greece such hardships have I braved,<br/>
Her wives, her infants, by my labours saved;<br/>
Long sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood,<br/>
And sweat laborious days in dust and blood.<br/>
I sack'd twelve ample cities on the main,<br/>
And twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain:<br/>
Then at Atrides' haughty feet were laid<br/>
The wealth I gathered, and the spoils I made.<br/>
Your mighty monarch these in peace possess'd;<br/>
Some few my soldiers had, himself the rest.<br/>
Some present, too, to every prince was paid;<br/>
And every prince enjoys the gift he made:<br/>
I only must refund, of all his train;<br/>
See what pre-eminence our merits gain!<br/>
My spoil alone his greedy soul delights:<br/>
My spouse alone must bless his lustful nights:<br/>
The woman, let him (as he may) enjoy;<br/>
But what's the quarrel, then, of Greece to Troy?<br/>
What to these shores the assembled nations draws,<br/>
What calls for vengeance but a woman's cause?<br/>
Are fair endowments and a beauteous face<br/>
Beloved by none but those of Atreus' race?<br/>
The wife whom choice and passion doth approve,<br/>
Sure every wise and worthy man will love.<br/>
Nor did my fair one less distinction claim;<br/>
Slave as she was, my soul adored the dame.<br/>
Wrong'd in my love, all proffers I disdain;<br/>
Deceived for once, I trust not kings again.<br/>
Ye have my answer—what remains to do,<br/>
Your king, Ulysses, may consult with you.<br/>
What needs he the defence this arm can make?<br/>
Has he not walls no human force can shake?<br/>
Has he not fenced his guarded navy round<br/>
With piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?<br/>
And will not these (the wonders he has done)<br/>
Repel the rage of Priam's single son?<br/>
There was a time ('twas when for Greece I fought)<br/>
When Hector's prowess no such wonders wrought;<br/>
He kept the verge of Troy, nor dared to wait<br/>
Achilles' fury at the Scaean gate;<br/>
He tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.<br/>
But now those ancient enmities are o'er;<br/>
To-morrow we the favouring gods implore;<br/>
Then shall you see our parting vessels crown'd,<br/>
And hear with oars the Hellespont resound.<br/>
The third day hence shall Pythia greet our sails,<br/>
If mighty Neptune send propitious gales;<br/>
Pythia to her Achilles shall restore<br/>
The wealth he left for this detested shore:<br/>
Thither the spoils of this long war shall pass,<br/>
The ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass:<br/>
My beauteous captives thither I'll convey,<br/>
And all that rests of my unravish'd prey.<br/>
One only valued gift your tyrant gave,<br/>
And that resumed—the fair Lyrnessian slave.<br/>
Then tell him: loud, that all the Greeks may hear,<br/>
And learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear;<br/>
(For arm'd in impudence, mankind he braves,<br/>
And meditates new cheats on all his slaves;<br/>
Though shameless as he is, to face these eyes<br/>
Is what he dares not: if he dares he dies;)<br/>
Tell him, all terms, all commerce I decline,<br/>
Nor share his council, nor his battle join;<br/>
For once deceiv'd, was his; but twice were mine,<br/>
No—let the stupid prince, whom Jove deprives<br/>
Of sense and justice, run where frenzy drives;<br/>
His gifts are hateful: kings of such a kind<br/>
Stand but as slaves before a noble mind,<br/>
Not though he proffer'd all himself possess'd,<br/>
And all his rapine could from others wrest:<br/>
Not all the golden tides of wealth that crown<br/>
The many-peopled Orchomenian town;<br/>
Not all proud Thebes' unrivall'd walls contain,<br/>
The world's great empress on the Egyptian plain<br/>
(That spreads her conquests o'er a thousand states,<br/>
And pours her heroes through a hundred gates,<br/>
Two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars<br/>
From each wide portal issuing to the wars);<br/>
Though bribes were heap'd on bribes, in number more<br/>
Than dust in fields, or sands along the shore;<br/>
Should all these offers for my friendship call,<br/>
'Tis he that offers, and I scorn them all.<br/>
Atrides' daughter never shall be led<br/>
(An ill-match'd consort) to Achilles' bed;<br/>
Like golden Venus though she charm'd the heart,<br/>
And vied with Pallas in the works of art;<br/>
Some greater Greek let those high nuptials grace,<br/>
I hate alliance with a tyrant's race.<br/>
If heaven restore me to my realms with life,<br/>
The reverend Peleus shall elect my wife;<br/>
Thessalian nymphs there are of form divine,<br/>
And kings that sue to mix their blood with mine.<br/>
Bless'd in kind love, my years shall glide away,<br/>
Content with just hereditary sway;<br/>
There, deaf for ever to the martial strife,<br/>
Enjoy the dear prerogative of life.<br/>
Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold.<br/>
Not all Apollo's Pythian treasures hold,<br/>
Or Troy once held, in peace and pride of sway,<br/>
Can bribe the poor possession of a day!<br/>
Lost herds and treasures we by arms regain,<br/>
And steeds unrivall'd on the dusty plain:<br/>
But from our lips the vital spirit fled,<br/>
Returns no more to wake the silent dead.<br/>
My fates long since by Thetis were disclosed,<br/>
And each alternate, life or fame, proposed;<br/>
Here, if I stay, before the Trojan town,<br/>
Short is my date, but deathless my renown:<br/>
If I return, I quit immortal praise<br/>
For years on years, and long-extended days.<br/>
Convinced, though late, I find my fond mistake,<br/>
And warn the Greeks the wiser choice to make;<br/>
To quit these shores, their native seats enjoy,<br/>
Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.<br/>
Jove's arm display'd asserts her from the skies!<br/>
Her hearts are strengthen'd, and her glories rise.<br/>
Go then to Greece, report our fix'd design;<br/>
Bid all your counsels, all your armies join,<br/>
Let all your forces, all your arts conspire,<br/>
To save the ships, the troops, the chiefs, from fire.<br/>
One stratagem has fail'd, and others will:<br/>
Ye find, Achilles is unconquer'd still.<br/>
Go then—digest my message as ye may—<br/>
But here this night let reverend Phoenix stay:<br/>
His tedious toils and hoary hairs demand<br/>
A peaceful death in Pythia's friendly land.<br/>
But whether he remain or sail with me,<br/>
His age be sacred, and his will be free."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The son of Peleus ceased: the chiefs around<br/>
In silence wrapt, in consternation drown'd,<br/>
Attend the stern reply. Then Phoenix rose;<br/>
(Down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows;)<br/>
And while the fate of suffering Greece he mourn'd,<br/>
With accent weak these tender words return'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Divine Achilles! wilt thou then retire,<br/>
And leave our hosts in blood, our fleets on fire?<br/>
If wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind,<br/>
How shall thy friend, thy Phoenix, stay behind?<br/>
The royal Peleus, when from Pythia's coast<br/>
He sent thee early to the Achaian host;<br/>
Thy youth as then in sage debates unskill'd,<br/>
And new to perils of the direful field:<br/>
He bade me teach thee all the ways of war,<br/>
To shine in councils, and in camps to dare.<br/>
Never, ah, never let me leave thy side!<br/>
No time shall part us, and no fate divide,<br/>
Not though the god, that breathed my life, restore<br/>
The bloom I boasted, and the port I bore,<br/>
When Greece of old beheld my youthful flames<br/>
(Delightful Greece, the land of lovely dames),<br/>
My father faithless to my mother's arms,<br/>
Old as he was, adored a stranger's charms.<br/>
I tried what youth could do (at her desire)<br/>
To win the damsel, and prevent my sire.<br/>
My sire with curses loads my hated head,<br/>
And cries, ‘Ye furies! barren be his bed.'<br/>
Infernal Jove, the vengeful fiends below,<br/>
And ruthless Proserpine, confirm'd his vow.<br/>
Despair and grief distract my labouring mind!<br/>
Gods! what a crime my impious heart design'd!<br/>
I thought (but some kind god that thought suppress'd)<br/>
To plunge the poniard in my father's breast;<br/>
Then meditate my flight: my friends in vain<br/>
With prayers entreat me, and with force detain.<br/>
On fat of rams, black bulls, and brawny swine,<br/>
They daily feast, with draughts of fragrant wine;<br/>
Strong guards they placed, and watch'd nine nights entire;<br/>
The roofs and porches flamed with constant fire.<br/>
The tenth, I forced the gates, unseen of all:<br/>
And, favour'd by the night, o'erleap'd the wall,<br/>
My travels thence through spacious Greece extend;<br/>
In Phthia's court at last my labours end.<br/>
Your sire received me, as his son caress'd,<br/>
With gifts enrich'd, and with possessions bless'd.<br/>
The strong Dolopians thenceforth own'd my reign,<br/>
And all the coast that runs along the main.<br/>
By love to thee his bounties I repaid,<br/>
And early wisdom to thy soul convey'd:<br/>
Great as thou art, my lessons made thee brave:<br/>
A child I took thee, but a hero gave.<br/>
Thy infant breast a like affection show'd;<br/>
Still in my arms (an ever-pleasing load)<br/>
Or at my knee, by Phoenix wouldst thou stand;<br/>
No food was grateful but from Phoenix' hand.<br/>
I pass my watchings o'er thy helpless years,<br/>
The tender labours, the compliant cares,<br/>
The gods (I thought) reversed their hard decree,<br/>
And Phoenix felt a father's joys in thee:<br/>
Thy growing virtues justified my cares,<br/>
And promised comfort to my silver hairs.<br/>
Now be thy rage, thy fatal rage, resign'd;<br/>
A cruel heart ill suits a manly mind:<br/>
The gods (the only great, and only wise)<br/>
Are moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice;<br/>
Offending man their high compassion wins,<br/>
And daily prayers atone for daily sins.<br/>
Prayers are Jove's daughters, of celestial race,<br/>
Lame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face;<br/>
With humble mien, and with dejected eyes,<br/>
Constant they follow, where injustice flies.<br/>
Injustice swift, erect, and unconfined,<br/>
Sweeps the wide earth, and tramples o'er mankind,<br/>
While Prayers, to heal her wrongs, move slow behind.<br/>
Who hears these daughters of almighty Jove,<br/>
For him they mediate to the throne above:<br/>
When man rejects the humble suit they make,<br/>
The sire revenges for the daughters' sake;<br/>
From Jove commission'd, fierce injustice then<br/>
Descends to punish unrelenting men.<br/>
O let not headlong passion bear the sway<br/>
These reconciling goddesses obey:<br/>
Due honours to the seed of Jove belong,<br/>
Due honours calm the fierce, and bend the strong.<br/>
Were these not paid thee by the terms we bring,<br/>
Were rage still harbour'd in the haughty king;<br/>
Nor Greece nor all her fortunes should engage<br/>
Thy friend to plead against so just a rage.<br/>
But since what honour asks the general sends,<br/>
And sends by those whom most thy heart commends;<br/>
The best and noblest of the Grecian train;<br/>
Permit not these to sue, and sue in vain!<br/>
Let me (my son) an ancient fact unfold,<br/>
A great example drawn from times of old;<br/>
Hear what our fathers were, and what their praise,<br/>
Who conquer'd their revenge in former days.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Where Calydon on rocky mountains stands<br/>
Once fought the Ætolian and Curetian bands;<br/>
To guard it those; to conquer, these advance;<br/>
And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.<br/>
The silver Cynthia bade contention rise,<br/>
In vengeance of neglected sacrifice;<br/>
On OEneus fields she sent a monstrous boar,<br/>
That levell'd harvests, and whole forests tore:<br/>
This beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)<br/>
Great Meleager stretch'd along the plain,<br/>
Then, for his spoils, a new debate arose,<br/>
The neighbour nations thence commencing foes.<br/>
Strong as they were, the bold Curetes fail'd,<br/>
While Meleager's thundering arm prevail'd:<br/>
Till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast<br/>
(For rage invades the wisest and the best).<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Cursed by Althaea, to his wrath he yields,<br/>
And in his wife's embrace forgets the fields.<br/>
(She from Marpessa sprung, divinely fair,<br/>
And matchless Idas, more than man in war:<br/>
The god of day adored the mother's charms;<br/>
Against the god the father bent his arms:<br/>
The afflicted pair, their sorrows to proclaim,<br/>
From Cleopatra changed their daughter's name,<br/>
And call'd Alcyone; a name to show<br/>
The father's grief, the mourning mother's woe.)<br/>
To her the chief retired from stern debate,<br/>
But found no peace from fierce Althaea's hate:<br/>
Althaea's hate the unhappy warrior drew,<br/>
Whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew;<br/>
She beat the ground, and call'd the powers beneath<br/>
On her own son to wreak her brother's death;<br/>
Hell heard her curses from the realms profound,<br/>
And the red fiends that walk the nightly round.<br/>
In vain Ætolia her deliverer waits,<br/>
War shakes her walls, and thunders at her gates.<br/>
She sent ambassadors, a chosen band,<br/>
Priests of the gods, and elders of the land;<br/>
Besought the chief to save the sinking state:<br/>
Their prayers were urgent, and their proffers great:<br/>
(Full fifty acres of the richest ground,<br/>
Half pasture green, and half with vineyards crown'd:)<br/>
His suppliant father, aged OEneus, came;<br/>
His sisters follow'd; even the vengeful dame,<br/>
Althaea, sues; his friends before him fall:<br/>
He stands relentless, and rejects them all.<br/>
Meanwhile the victor's shouts ascend the skies;<br/>
The walls are scaled; the rolling flames arise;<br/>
At length his wife (a form divine) appears,<br/>
With piercing cries, and supplicating tears;<br/>
She paints the horrors of a conquer'd town,<br/>
The heroes slain, the palaces o'erthrown,<br/>
The matrons ravish'd, the whole race enslaved:<br/>
The warrior heard, he vanquish'd, and he saved.<br/>
The Ætolians, long disdain'd, now took their turn,<br/>
And left the chief their broken faith to mourn.<br/>
Learn hence, betimes to curb pernicious ire,<br/>
Nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire;<br/>
Accept the presents; draw thy conquering sword;<br/>
And be amongst our guardian gods adored."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus he: the stern Achilles thus replied:<br/>
"My second father, and my reverend guide:<br/>
Thy friend, believe me, no such gifts demands,<br/>
And asks no honours from a mortal's hands;<br/>
Jove honours me, and favours my designs;<br/>
His pleasure guides me, and his will confines;<br/>
And here I stay (if such his high behest)<br/>
While life's warm spirit beats within my breast.<br/>
Yet hear one word, and lodge it in thy heart:<br/>
No more molest me on Atrides' part:<br/>
Is it for him these tears are taught to flow,<br/>
For him these sorrows? for my mortal foe?<br/>
A generous friendship no cold medium knows,<br/>
Burns with one love, with one resentment glows;<br/>
One should our interests and our passions be;<br/>
My friend must hate the man that injures me.<br/>
Do this, my Phoenix, 'tis a generous part;<br/>
And share my realms, my honours, and my heart.<br/>
Let these return: our voyage, or our stay,<br/>
Rest undetermined till the dawning day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He ceased; then order'd for the sage's bed<br/>
A warmer couch with numerous carpets spread.<br/>
With that, stern Ajax his long silence broke,<br/>
And thus, impatient, to Ulysses spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hence let us go—why waste we time in vain?<br/>
See what effect our low submissions gain!<br/>
Liked or not liked, his words we must relate,<br/>
The Greeks expect them, and our heroes wait.<br/>
Proud as he is, that iron heart retains<br/>
Its stubborn purpose, and his friends disdains.<br/>
Stern and unpitying! if a brother bleed,<br/>
On just atonement, we remit the deed;<br/>
A sire the slaughter of his son forgives;<br/>
The price of blood discharged, the murderer lives:<br/>
The haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign,<br/>
And gifts can conquer every soul but thine.<br/>
The gods that unrelenting breast have steel'd,<br/>
And cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield.<br/>
One woman-slave was ravish'd from thy arms:<br/>
Lo, seven are offer'd, and of equal charms.<br/>
Then hear, Achilles! be of better mind;<br/>
Revere thy roof, and to thy guests be kind;<br/>
And know the men of all the Grecian host,<br/>
Who honour worth, and prize thy valour most."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O soul of battles, and thy people's guide!<br/>
(To Ajax thus the first of Greeks replied)<br/>
Well hast thou spoke; but at the tyrant's name<br/>
My rage rekindles, and my soul's on flame:<br/>
'Tis just resentment, and becomes the brave:<br/>
Disgraced, dishonour'd, like the vilest slave!<br/>
Return, then, heroes! and our answer bear,<br/>
The glorious combat is no more my care;<br/>
Not till, amidst yon sinking navy slain,<br/>
The blood of Greeks shall dye the sable main;<br/>
Not till the flames, by Hector's fury thrown,<br/>
Consume your vessels, and approach my own;<br/>
Just there, the impetuous homicide shall stand,<br/>
There cease his battle, and there feel our hand."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, each prince a double goblet crown'd,<br/>
And cast a large libation on the ground;<br/>
Then to their vessels, through the gloomy shades,<br/>
The chiefs return; divine Ulysses leads.<br/>
Meantime Achilles' slaves prepared a bed,<br/>
With fleeces, carpets, and soft linen spread:<br/>
There, till the sacred morn restored the day,<br/>
In slumber sweet the reverend Phoenix lay.<br/>
But in his inner tent, an ampler space,<br/>
Achilles slept; and in his warm embrace<br/>
Fair Diomede of the Lesbian race.<br/>
Last, for Patroclus was the couch prepared,<br/>
Whose nightly joys the beauteous Iphis shared;<br/>
Achilles to his friend consign'd her charms<br/>
When Scyros fell before his conquering arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now the elected chiefs whom Greece had sent,<br/>
Pass'd through the hosts, and reach'd the royal tent.<br/>
Then rising all, with goblets in their hands,<br/>
The peers and leaders of the Achaian bands<br/>
Hail'd their return: Atrides first begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Say what success? divine Laertes' son!<br/>
Achilles' high resolves declare to all:<br/>
Returns the chief, or must our navy fall?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Great king of nations! (Ithacus replied)<br/>
Fix'd is his wrath, unconquer'd is his pride;<br/>
He slights thy friendship, thy proposals scorns,<br/>
And, thus implored, with fiercer fury burns.<br/>
To save our army, and our fleets to free,<br/>
Is not his care; but left to Greece and thee.<br/>
Your eyes shall view, when morning paints the sky,<br/>
Beneath his oars the whitening billows fly;<br/>
Us too he bids our oars and sails employ,<br/>
Nor hope the fall of heaven-protected Troy;<br/>
For Jove o'ershades her with his arm divine,<br/>
Inspires her war, and bids her glory shine.<br/>
Such was his word: what further he declared,<br/>
These sacred heralds and great Ajax heard.<br/>
But Phoenix in his tent the chief retains,<br/>
Safe to transport him to his native plains<br/>
When morning dawns; if other he decree,<br/>
His age is sacred, and his choice is free."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ulysses ceased: the great Achaian host,<br/>
With sorrow seized, in consternation lost,<br/>
Attend the stern reply. Tydides broke<br/>
The general silence, and undaunted spoke.<br/>
"Why should we gifts to proud Achilles send,<br/>
Or strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend?<br/>
His country's woes he glories to deride,<br/>
And prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride.<br/>
Be the fierce impulse of his rage obey'd,<br/>
Our battles let him or desert or aid;<br/>
Then let him arm when Jove or he think fit:<br/>
That, to his madness, or to Heaven commit:<br/>
What for ourselves we can, is always ours;<br/>
This night, let due repast refresh our powers;<br/>
(For strength consists in spirits and in blood,<br/>
And those are owed to generous wine and food;)<br/>
But when the rosy messenger of day<br/>
Strikes the blue mountains with her golden ray,<br/>
Ranged at the ships, let all our squadrons shine<br/>
In flaming arms, a long-extended line:<br/>
In the dread front let great Atrides stand,<br/>
The first in danger, as in high command."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Shouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise,<br/>
Then each to Heaven the due libations pays;<br/>
Till sleep, descending o'er the tents, bestows<br/>
The grateful blessings of desired repose.<br/>

<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book V</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
But Pallas now Tydides' soul inspires,<br/>
Fills with her force, and warms with all her fires,<br/>
Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise,<br/>
And crown her hero with distinguish'd praise.<br/>
High on his helm celestial lightnings play,<br/>
His beamy shield emits a living ray;<br/>
The unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,<br/>
Like the red star that fires the autumnal skies,<br/>
When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,<br/>
And, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.<br/>
Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow'd,<br/>
Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow'd:<br/>
Onward she drives him, furious to engage,<br/>
Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The sons of Dares first the combat sought,<br/>
A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;<br/>
In Vulcan's fane the father's days were led,<br/>
The sons to toils of glorious battle bred;<br/>
These singled from their troops the fight maintain,<br/>
These, from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.<br/>
Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,<br/>
And first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear,<br/>
Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,<br/>
And spent in empty air its erring force.<br/>
Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,<br/>
But pierced his breast, and stretch'd him on the plain.<br/>
Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,<br/>
Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.<br/>
And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid,<br/>
He too had sunk to death's eternal shade;<br/>
But in a smoky cloud the god of fire<br/>
Preserved the son, in pity to the sire.<br/>
The steeds and chariot, to the navy led,<br/>
Increased the spoils of gallant Diomed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew,<br/>
Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view;<br/>
When by the blood-stain'd hand Minerva press'd<br/>
The god of battles, and this speech address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,<br/>
Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!<br/>
Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;<br/>
And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide:<br/>
While we from interdicted fields retire,<br/>
Nor tempt the wrath of heaven's avenging sire."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Her words allay the impetuous warrior's heat,<br/>
The god of arms and martial maid retreat;<br/>
Removed from fight, on Xanthus' flowery bounds<br/>
They sat, and listen'd to the dying sounds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,<br/>
And some bold chieftain every leader slew:<br/>
First Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,<br/>
His death ennobled by Atrides' hand:<br/>
</p>
<p>
As he to flight his wheeling car address'd,<br/>
The speedy javelin drove from back to breast.<br/>
In dust the mighty Halizonian lay,<br/>
His arms resound, the spirit wings its way.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thy fate was next, O Phaestus! doom'd to feel<br/>
The great Idomeneus' protended steel;<br/>
Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy)<br/>
From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.<br/>
The Cretan javelin reach'd him from afar,<br/>
And pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;<br/>
Back from the car he tumbles to the ground,<br/>
And everlasting shades his eyes surround.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,<br/>
In woods and wilds to wound the savage race;<br/>
Diana taught him all her sylvan arts,<br/>
To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:<br/>
But vainly here Diana's arts he tries,<br/>
The fatal lance arrests him as he flies;<br/>
From Menelaus' arm the weapon sent,<br/>
Through his broad back and heaving bosom went:<br/>
Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,<br/>
His brazen armour rings against the ground.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next artful Phereclus untimely fell;<br/>
Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.<br/>
Thy father's skill, O Phereclus! was thine,<br/>
The graceful fabric and the fair design;<br/>
For loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart<br/>
To him the shipwright's and the builder's art.<br/>
Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,<br/>
The fatal cause of all his country's woes;<br/>
But he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,<br/>
Nor saw his country's peril, nor his own.<br/>
The hapless artist, while confused he fled,<br/>
The spear of Merion mingled with the dead.<br/>
Through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,<br/>
Between the bladder and the bone it pass'd;<br/>
Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,<br/>
And death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From Meges' force the swift Pedaeus fled,<br/>
Antenor's offspring from a foreign bed,<br/>
Whose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair,<br/>
Nursed the young stranger with a mother's care.<br/>
How vain those cares! when Meges in the rear<br/>
Full in his nape infix'd the fatal spear;<br/>
Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,<br/>
And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine,<br/>
Sprung from the brave Dolopion's mighty line,<br/>
Who near adored Scamander made abode,<br/>
Priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.<br/>
On him, amidst the flying numbers found,<br/>
Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;<br/>
On his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,<br/>
Thence glancing downwards, lopp'd his holy hand,<br/>
Which stain'd with sacred blood the blushing sand.<br/>
Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death<br/>
Closed his dim eye, and fate suppress'd his breath.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus toil'd the chiefs, in different parts engaged.<br/>
In every quarter fierce Tydides raged;<br/>
Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,<br/>
Rapt through the ranks he thunders o'er the plain;<br/>
Now here, now there, he darts from place to place,<br/>
Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.<br/>
Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong<br/>
Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,<br/>
Through ruin'd moles the rushing wave resounds,<br/>
O'erwhelm's the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds;<br/>
The yellow harvests of the ripen'd year,<br/>
And flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!<br/>
While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,<br/>
And all the labours of mankind are vain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So raged Tydides, boundless in his ire,<br/>
Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire.<br/>
With grief the leader of the Lycian band<br/>
Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand:<br/>
His bended bow against the chief he drew;<br/>
Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,<br/>
Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,<br/>
Deep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore:<br/>
The rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,<br/>
While the proud archer thus exulting cried:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!<br/>
Lo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds,<br/>
Not long the deathful dart he can sustain;<br/>
Or Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain."<br/>
So spoke he, boastful: but the winged dart<br/>
Stopp'd short of life, and mock'd the shooter's art.<br/>
The wounded chief, behind his car retired,<br/>
The helping hand of Sthenelus required;<br/>
Swift from his seat he leap'd upon the ground,<br/>
And tugg'd the weapon from the gushing wound;<br/>
When thus the king his guardian power address'd,<br/>
The purple current wandering o'er his vest:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O progeny of Jove! unconquer'd maid!<br/>
If e'er my godlike sire deserved thy aid,<br/>
If e'er I felt thee in the fighting field;<br/>
Now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.<br/>
O give my lance to reach the Trojan knight,<br/>
Whose arrow wounds the chief thou guard'st in fight;<br/>
And lay the boaster grovelling on the shore,<br/>
That vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus pray'd Tydides, and Minerva heard,<br/>
His nerves confirm'd, his languid spirits cheer'd;<br/>
He feels each limb with wonted vigour light;<br/>
His beating bosom claim'd the promised fight.<br/>
"Be bold, (she cried), in every combat shine,<br/>
War be thy province, thy protection mine;<br/>
Rush to the fight, and every foe control;<br/>
Wake each paternal virtue in thy soul:<br/>
Strength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me,<br/>
And all thy godlike father breathes in thee;<br/>
Yet more, from mortal mists I purge thy eyes,<br/>
And set to view the warring deities.<br/>
These see thou shun, through all the embattled plain;<br/>
Nor rashly strive where human force is vain.<br/>
If Venus mingle in the martial band,<br/>
Her shalt thou wound: so Pallas gives command."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With that, the blue-eyed virgin wing'd her flight;<br/>
The hero rush'd impetuous to the fight;<br/>
With tenfold ardour now invades the plain,<br/>
Wild with delay, and more enraged by pain.<br/>
As on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls,<br/>
Amidst the field a brindled lion falls;<br/>
If chance some shepherd with a distant dart<br/>
The savage wound, he rouses at the smart,<br/>
He foams, he roars; the shepherd dares not stay,<br/>
But trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey;<br/>
Heaps fall on heaps; he bathes with blood the ground,<br/>
Then leaps victorious o'er the lofty mound.<br/>
Not with less fury stern Tydides flew;<br/>
And two brave leaders at an instant slew;<br/>
Astynous breathless fell, and by his side,<br/>
His people's pastor, good Hypenor, died;<br/>
Astynous' breast the deadly lance receives,<br/>
Hypenor's shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.<br/>
Those slain he left, and sprung with noble rage<br/>
Abas and Polyidus to engage;<br/>
Sons of Eurydamus, who, wise and old,<br/>
Could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold;<br/>
The youths return'd not from the doubtful plain,<br/>
And the sad father tried his arts in vain;<br/>
No mystic dream could make their fates appear,<br/>
Though now determined by Tydides' spear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Young Xanthus next, and Thoon felt his rage;<br/>
The joy and hope of Phaenops' feeble age:<br/>
Vast was his wealth, and these the only heirs<br/>
Of all his labours and a life of cares.<br/>
Cold death o'ertakes them in their blooming years,<br/>
And leaves the father unavailing tears:<br/>
To strangers now descends his heapy store,<br/>
The race forgotten, and the name no more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Two sons of Priam in one chariot ride,<br/>
Glittering in arms, and combat side by side.<br/>
As when the lordly lion seeks his food<br/>
Where grazing heifers range the lonely wood,<br/>
He leaps amidst them with a furious bound,<br/>
Bends their strong necks, and tears them to the ground:<br/>
So from their seats the brother chiefs are torn,<br/>
Their steeds and chariot to the navy borne.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With deep concern divine Æneas view'd<br/>
The foe prevailing, and his friends pursued;<br/>
Through the thick storm of singing spears he flies,<br/>
Exploring Pandarus with careful eyes.<br/>
At length he found Lycaon's mighty son;<br/>
To whom the chief of Venus' race begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Where, Pandarus, are all thy honours now,<br/>
Thy winged arrows and unerring bow,<br/>
Thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall'd fame,<br/>
And boasted glory of the Lycian name?<br/>
O pierce that mortal! if we mortal call<br/>
That wondrous force by which whole armies fall;<br/>
Or god incensed, who quits the distant skies<br/>
To punish Troy for slighted sacrifice;<br/>
(Which, oh avert from our unhappy state!<br/>
For what so dreadful as celestial hate)?<br/>
Whoe'er he be, propitiate Jove with prayer;<br/>
If man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To him the Lycian: "Whom your eyes behold,<br/>
If right I judge, is Diomed the bold:<br/>
Such coursers whirl him o'er the dusty field,<br/>
So towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.<br/>
If 'tis a god, he wears that chief's disguise:<br/>
Or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,<br/>
Involved in clouds, protects him in the fray,<br/>
And turns unseen the frustrate dart away.<br/>
I wing'd an arrow, which not idly fell,<br/>
The stroke had fix'd him to the gates of hell;<br/>
And, but some god, some angry god withstands,<br/>
His fate was due to these unerring hands.<br/>
Skill'd in the bow, on foot I sought the war,<br/>
Nor join'd swift horses to the rapid car.<br/>
Ten polish'd chariots I possess'd at home,<br/>
And still they grace Lycaon's princely dome:<br/>
There veil'd in spacious coverlets they stand;<br/>
And twice ten coursers wait their lord's command.<br/>
The good old warrior bade me trust to these,<br/>
When first for Troy I sail'd the sacred seas;<br/>
In fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,<br/>
And through the ranks of death triumphant ride.<br/>
But vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,<br/>
I heard his counsels with unheedful mind,<br/>
And thought the steeds (your large supplies unknown)<br/>
Might fail of forage in the straiten'd town;<br/>
So took my bow and pointed darts in hand<br/>
And left the chariots in my native land.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Too late, O friend! my rashness I deplore;<br/>
These shafts, once fatal, carry death no more.<br/>
Tydeus' and Atreus' sons their points have found,<br/>
And undissembled gore pursued the wound.<br/>
In vain they bleed: this unavailing bow<br/>
Serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.<br/>
In evil hour these bended horns I strung,<br/>
And seized the quiver where it idly hung.<br/>
Cursed be the fate that sent me to the field<br/>
Without a warrior's arms, the spear and shield!<br/>
If e'er with life I quit the Trojan plain,<br/>
If e'er I see my spouse and sire again,<br/>
This bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,<br/>
Broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the leader of the Dardan race:<br/>
"Be calm, nor Phoebus' honour'd gift disgrace.<br/>
The distant dart be praised, though here we need<br/>
The rushing chariot and the bounding steed.<br/>
Against yon hero let us bend our course,<br/>
And, hand to hand, encounter force with force.<br/>
Now mount my seat, and from the chariot's height<br/>
Observe my father's steeds, renown'd in fight;<br/>
Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,<br/>
To dare the shock, or urge the rapid race;<br/>
Secure with these, through fighting fields we go;<br/>
Or safe to Troy, if Jove assist the foe.<br/>
Haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein;<br/>
The warrior's fury let this arm sustain;<br/>
Or, if to combat thy bold heart incline,<br/>
Take thou the spear, the chariot's care be mine."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O prince! (Lycaon's valiant son replied)<br/>
As thine the steeds, be thine the task to guide.<br/>
The horses, practised to their lord's command,<br/>
Shall bear the rein, and answer to thy hand;<br/>
But, if, unhappy, we desert the fight,<br/>
Thy voice alone can animate their flight;<br/>
Else shall our fates be number'd with the dead,<br/>
And these, the victor's prize, in triumph led.<br/>
Thine be the guidance, then: with spear and shield<br/>
Myself will charge this terror of the field."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now both heroes mount the glittering car;<br/>
The bounding coursers rush amidst the war;<br/>
Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,<br/>
Who thus, alarm'd, to great Tydides cried:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O friend! two chiefs of force immense I see,<br/>
Dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:<br/>
Lo the brave heir of old Lycaon's line,<br/>
And great Æneas, sprung from race divine!<br/>
Enough is given to fame. Ascend thy car!<br/>
And save a life, the bulwark of our war."<br/>
</p>
<p>
At this the hero cast a gloomy look,<br/>
Fix'd on the chief with scorn; and thus he spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?<br/>
Me wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?<br/>
Know, 'tis not honest in my soul to fear,<br/>
Nor was Tydides born to tremble here.<br/>
I hate the cumbrous chariot's slow advance,<br/>
And the long distance of the flying lance;<br/>
But while my nerves are strong, my force entire,<br/>
Thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.<br/>
Nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey<br/>
Those threatening heroes, bear them both away;<br/>
One chief at least beneath this arm shall die;<br/>
So Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.<br/>
But if she dooms, and if no god withstand,<br/>
That both shall fall by one victorious hand,<br/>
Then heed my words: my horses here detain,<br/>
Fix'd to the chariot by the straiten'd rein;<br/>
Swift to Æneas' empty seat proceed,<br/>
And seize the coursers of ethereal breed;<br/>
The race of those, which once the thundering god<br/>
For ravish'd Ganymede on Tros bestow'd,<br/>
The best that e'er on earth's broad surface run,<br/>
Beneath the rising or the setting sun.<br/>
Hence great Anchises stole a breed unknown,<br/>
By mortal mares, from fierce Laomedon:<br/>
Four of this race his ample stalls contain,<br/>
And two transport Æneas o'er the plain.<br/>
These, were the rich immortal prize our own,<br/>
Through the wide world should make our glory known."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,<br/>
And stern Lycaon's warlike race begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Prince, thou art met. Though late in vain assail'd,<br/>
The spear may enter where the arrow fail'd."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung;<br/>
On his broad shield the sounding weapon rung,<br/>
Pierced the tough orb, and in his cuirass hung,<br/>
"He bleeds! the pride of Greece! (the boaster cries,)<br/>
Our triumph now, the mighty warrior lies!"<br/>
"Mistaken vaunter! (Diomed replied;)<br/>
Thy dart has erred, and now my spear be tried;<br/>
Ye 'scape not both; one, headlong from his car,<br/>
With hostile blood shall glut the god of war."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and rising hurl'd his forceful dart,<br/>
Which, driven by Pallas, pierced a vital part;<br/>
Full in his face it enter'd, and betwixt<br/>
The nose and eye-ball the proud Lycian fix'd;<br/>
Crash'd all his jaws, and cleft the tongue within,<br/>
Till the bright point look'd out beneath the chin.<br/>
Headlong he falls, his helmet knocks the ground:<br/>
Earth groans beneath him, and his arms resound;<br/>
The starting coursers tremble with affright;<br/>
The soul indignant seeks the realms of night.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To guard his slaughter'd friend, Æneas flies,<br/>
His spear extending where the carcase lies;<br/>
Watchful he wheels, protects it every way,<br/>
As the grim lion stalks around his prey.<br/>
O'er the fall'n trunk his ample shield display'd,<br/>
He hides the hero with his mighty shade,<br/>
And threats aloud! the Greeks with longing eyes<br/>
Behold at distance, but forbear the prize.<br/>
Then fierce Tydides stoops; and from the fields<br/>
Heaved with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.<br/>
Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,<br/>
Such men as live in these degenerate days:<br/>
He swung it round; and, gathering strength to throw,<br/>
Discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe.<br/>
Where to the hip the inserted thigh unites,<br/>
Full on the bone the pointed marble lights;<br/>
Through both the tendons broke the rugged stone,<br/>
And stripp'd the skin, and crack'd the solid bone.<br/>
Sunk on his knees, and staggering with his pains,<br/>
His falling bulk his bended arm sustains;<br/>
Lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies;<br/>
A sudden cloud comes swimming o'er his eyes.<br/>
There the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway'd,<br/>
Oppress'd had sunk to death's eternal shade,<br/>
But heavenly Venus, mindful of the love<br/>
She bore Anchises in the Idaean grove,<br/>
His danger views with anguish and despair,<br/>
And guards her offspring with a mother's care.<br/>
About her much-loved son her arms she throws,<br/>
Her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows.<br/>
Screen'd from the foe behind her shining veil,<br/>
The swords wave harmless, and the javelins fail;<br/>
Safe through the rushing horse, and feather'd flight<br/>
Of sounding shafts, she bears him from the fight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor Sthenelus, with unassisting hands,<br/>
Remain'd unheedful of his lord's commands:<br/>
His panting steeds, removed from out the war,<br/>
He fix'd with straiten'd traces to the car,<br/>
Next, rushing to the Dardan spoil, detains<br/>
The heavenly coursers with the flowing manes:<br/>
These in proud triumph to the fleet convey'd,<br/>
No longer now a Trojan lord obey'd.<br/>
That charge to bold Deipylus he gave,<br/>
(Whom most he loved, as brave men love the brave,)<br/>
Then mounting on his car, resumed the rein,<br/>
And follow'd where Tydides swept the plain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile (his conquest ravished from his eyes)<br/>
The raging chief in chase of Venus flies:<br/>
No goddess she, commission'd to the field,<br/>
Like Pallas dreadful with her sable shield,<br/>
Or fierce Bellona thundering at the wall,<br/>
While flames ascend, and mighty ruins fall;<br/>
He knew soft combats suit the tender dame,<br/>
New to the field, and still a foe to fame.<br/>
Through breaking ranks his furious course he bends,<br/>
And at the goddess his broad lance extends;<br/>
Through her bright veil the daring weapon drove,<br/>
The ambrosial veil which all the Graces wove;<br/>
Her snowy hand the razing steel profaned,<br/>
And the transparent skin with crimson stain'd,<br/>
From the clear vein a stream immortal flow'd,<br/>
Such stream as issues from a wounded god;<br/>
Pure emanation! uncorrupted flood!<br/>
Unlike our gross, diseased, terrestrial blood:<br/>
(For not the bread of man their life sustains,<br/>
Nor wine's inflaming juice supplies their veins:)<br/>
With tender shrieks the goddess fill'd the place,<br/>
And dropp'd her offspring from her weak embrace.<br/>
Him Phoebus took: he casts a cloud around<br/>
The fainting chief, and wards the mortal wound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies,<br/>
The king insults the goddess as she flies:<br/>
"Ill with Jove's daughter bloody fights agree,<br/>
The field of combat is no scene for thee:<br/>
Go, let thy own soft sex employ thy care,<br/>
Go, lull the coward, or delude the fair.<br/>
Taught by this stroke renounce the war's alarms,<br/>
And learn to tremble at the name of arms."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Tydides thus. The goddess, seized with dread,<br/>
Confused, distracted, from the conflict fled.<br/>
To aid her, swift the winged Iris flew,<br/>
Wrapt in a mist above the warring crew.<br/>
The queen of love with faded charms she found.<br/>
Pale was her cheek, and livid look'd the wound.<br/>
To Mars, who sat remote, they bent their way:<br/>
Far, on the left, with clouds involved he lay;<br/>
Beside him stood his lance, distain'd with gore,<br/>
And, rein'd with gold, his foaming steeds before.<br/>
Low at his knee, she begg'd with streaming eyes<br/>
Her brother's car, to mount the distant skies,<br/>
And show'd the wound by fierce Tydides given,<br/>
A mortal man, who dares encounter heaven.<br/>
Stern Mars attentive hears the queen complain,<br/>
And to her hand commits the golden rein;<br/>
She mounts the seat, oppress'd with silent woe,<br/>
Driven by the goddess of the painted bow.<br/>
The lash resounds, the rapid chariot flies,<br/>
And in a moment scales the lofty skies:<br/>
They stopp'd the car, and there the coursers stood,<br/>
Fed by fair Iris with ambrosial food;<br/>
Before her mother, love's bright queen appears,<br/>
O'erwhelmed with anguish, and dissolved in tears:<br/>
She raised her in her arms, beheld her bleed,<br/>
And ask'd what god had wrought this guilty deed?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then she: "This insult from no god I found,<br/>
An impious mortal gave the daring wound!<br/>
Behold the deed of haughty Diomed!<br/>
'Twas in the son's defence the mother bled.<br/>
The war with Troy no more the Grecians wage;<br/>
But with the gods (the immortal gods) engage."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Dione then: "Thy wrongs with patience bear,<br/>
And share those griefs inferior powers must share:<br/>
Unnumber'd woes mankind from us sustain,<br/>
And men with woes afflict the gods again.<br/>
The mighty Mars in mortal fetters bound,<br/>
And lodged in brazen dungeons underground,<br/>
Full thirteen moons imprison'd roar'd in vain;<br/>
Otus and Ephialtes held the chain:<br/>
Perhaps had perish'd had not Hermes' care<br/>
Restored the groaning god to upper air.<br/>
Great Juno's self has borne her weight of pain,<br/>
The imperial partner of the heavenly reign;<br/>
Amphitryon's son infix'd the deadly dart,<br/>
And fill'd with anguish her immortal heart.<br/>
E'en hell's grim king Alcides' power confess'd,<br/>
The shaft found entrance in his iron breast;<br/>
To Jove's high palace for a cure he fled,<br/>
Pierced in his own dominions of the dead;<br/>
Where Paeon, sprinkling heavenly balm around,<br/>
Assuaged the glowing pangs, and closed the wound.<br/>
Rash, impious man! to stain the bless'd abodes,<br/>
And drench his arrows in the blood of gods!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"But thou (though Pallas urged thy frantic deed),<br/>
Whose spear ill-fated makes a goddess bleed,<br/>
Know thou, whoe'er with heavenly power contends,<br/>
Short is his date, and soon his glory ends;<br/>
From fields of death when late he shall retire,<br/>
No infant on his knees shall call him sire.<br/>
Strong as thou art, some god may yet be found,<br/>
To stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground;<br/>
Thy distant wife, Ægiale the fair,<br/>
Starting from sleep with a distracted air,<br/>
Shall rouse thy slaves, and her lost lord deplore,<br/>
The brave, the great, the glorious now no more!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, she wiped from Venus' wounded palm<br/>
The sacred ichor, and infused the balm.<br/>
Juno and Pallas with a smile survey'd,<br/>
And thus to Jove began the blue-eyed maid:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Permit thy daughter, gracious Jove! to tell<br/>
How this mischance the Cyprian queen befell,<br/>
As late she tried with passion to inflame<br/>
The tender bosom of a Grecian dame;<br/>
Allured the fair, with moving thoughts of joy,<br/>
To quit her country for some youth of Troy;<br/>
The clasping zone, with golden buckles bound,<br/>
Razed her soft hand with this lamented wound."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The sire of gods and men superior smiled,<br/>
And, calling Venus, thus address'd his child:<br/>
"Not these, O daughter are thy proper cares,<br/>
Thee milder arts befit, and softer wars;<br/>
Sweet smiles are thine, and kind endearing charms;<br/>
To Mars and Pallas leave the deeds of arms."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus they in heaven: while on the plain below<br/>
The fierce Tydides charged his Dardan foe,<br/>
Flush'd with celestial blood pursued his way,<br/>
And fearless dared the threatening god of day;<br/>
Already in his hopes he saw him kill'd,<br/>
Though screen'd behind Apollo's mighty shield.<br/>
Thrice rushing furious, at the chief he strook;<br/>
His blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook:<br/>
He tried the fourth: when, breaking from the cloud,<br/>
A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O son of Tydeus, cease! be wise and see<br/>
How vast the difference of the gods and thee;<br/>
Distance immense! between the powers that shine<br/>
Above, eternal, deathless, and divine,<br/>
And mortal man! a wretch of humble birth,<br/>
A short-lived reptile in the dust of earth."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So spoke the god who darts celestial fires:<br/>
He dreads his fury, and some steps retires.<br/>
Then Phoebus bore the chief of Venus' race<br/>
To Troy's high fane, and to his holy place;<br/>
Latona there and Phoebe heal'd the wound,<br/>
With vigour arm'd him, and with glory crown'd.<br/>
This done, the patron of the silver bow<br/>
A phantom raised, the same in shape and show<br/>
With great Æneas; such the form he bore,<br/>
And such in fight the radiant arms he wore.<br/>
Around the spectre bloody wars are waged,<br/>
And Greece and Troy with clashing shields engaged.<br/>
Meantime on Ilion's tower Apollo stood,<br/>
And calling Mars, thus urged the raging god:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Stern power of arms, by whom the mighty fall;<br/>
Who bathest in blood, and shakest the embattled wall,<br/>
Rise in thy wrath! to hell's abhorr'd abodes<br/>
Despatch yon Greek, and vindicate the gods.<br/>
First rosy Venus felt his brutal rage;<br/>
Me next he charged, and dares all heaven engage:<br/>
The wretch would brave high heaven's immortal sire,<br/>
His triple thunder, and his bolts of fire."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The god of battle issues on the plain,<br/>
Stirs all the ranks, and fires the Trojan train;<br/>
In form like Acamas, the Thracian guide,<br/>
Enraged to Troy's retiring chiefs he cried:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"How long, ye sons of Priam! will ye fly,<br/>
And unrevenged see Priam's people die?<br/>
Still unresisted shall the foe destroy,<br/>
And stretch the slaughter to the gates of Troy?<br/>
Lo, brave Æneas sinks beneath his wound,<br/>
Not godlike Hector more in arms renown'd:<br/>
Haste all, and take the generous warrior's part.<br/>
He said;—new courage swell'd each hero's heart.<br/>
Sarpedon first his ardent soul express'd,<br/>
And, turn'd to Hector, these bold words address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Say, chief, is all thy ancient valour lost?<br/>
Where are thy threats, and where thy glorious boast,<br/>
That propp'd alone by Priam's race should stand<br/>
Troy's sacred walls, nor need a foreign hand?<br/>
Now, now thy country calls her wonted friends,<br/>
And the proud vaunt in just derision ends.<br/>
Remote they stand while alien troops engage,<br/>
Like trembling hounds before the lion's rage.<br/>
Far distant hence I held my wide command,<br/>
Where foaming Xanthus laves the Lycian land;<br/>
With ample wealth (the wish of mortals) bless'd,<br/>
A beauteous wife, and infant at her breast;<br/>
With those I left whatever dear could be:<br/>
Greece, if she conquers, nothing wins from me;<br/>
Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer,<br/>
And long to meet this mighty man ye fear;<br/>
While Hector idle stands, nor bids the brave<br/>
Their wives, their infants, and their altars save.<br/>
Haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten'd state,<br/>
Or one vast burst of all-involving fate<br/>
Full o'er your towers shall fall, and sweep away<br/>
Sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish'd prey.<br/>
Rouse all thy Trojans, urge thy aids to fight;<br/>
These claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night;<br/>
With force incessant the brave Greeks oppose;<br/>
Such cares thy friends deserve, and such thy foes."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Stung to the heart the generous Hector hears,<br/>
But just reproof with decent silence bears.<br/>
From his proud car the prince impetuous springs,<br/>
On earth he leaps, his brazen armour rings.<br/>
Two shining spears are brandish'd in his hands;<br/>
Thus arm'd, he animates his drooping bands,<br/>
Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,<br/>
And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.<br/>
They turn, they stand; the Greeks their fury dare,<br/>
Condense their powers, and wait the growing war.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As when, on Ceres' sacred floor, the swain<br/>
Spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain,<br/>
And the light chaff, before the breezes borne,<br/>
Ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn;<br/>
The grey dust, rising with collected winds,<br/>
Drives o'er the barn, and whitens all the hinds:<br/>
So white with dust the Grecian host appears,<br/>
From trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers.<br/>
The dusky clouds from labour'd earth arise,<br/>
And roll in smoking volumes to the skies.<br/>
Mars hovers o'er them with his sable shield,<br/>
And adds new horrors to the darken'd field:<br/>
Pleased with his charge, and ardent to fulfil,<br/>
In Troy's defence, Apollo's heavenly will:<br/>
Soon as from fight the blue-eyed maid retires,<br/>
Each Trojan bosom with new warmth he fires.<br/>
And now the god, from forth his sacred fane,<br/>
Produced Æneas to the shouting train;<br/>
Alive, unharm'd, with all his peers around,<br/>
Erect he stood, and vigorous from his wound:<br/>
Inquiries none they made; the dreadful day<br/>
No pause of words admits, no dull delay;<br/>
Fierce Discord storms, Apollo loud exclaims,<br/>
Fame calls, Mars thunders, and the field's in flames.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Stern Diomed with either Ajax stood,<br/>
And great Ulysses, bathed in hostile blood.<br/>
Embodied close, the labouring Grecian train<br/>
The fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain.<br/>
Unmoved and silent, the whole war they wait<br/>
Serenely dreadful, and as fix'd as fate.<br/>
So when the embattled clouds in dark array,<br/>
Along the skies their gloomy lines display;<br/>
When now the North his boisterous rage has spent,<br/>
And peaceful sleeps the liquid element:<br/>
The low-hung vapours, motionless and still,<br/>
Rest on the summits of the shaded hill;<br/>
Till the mass scatters as the winds arise,<br/>
Dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor was the general wanting to his train;<br/>
From troop to troop he toils through all the plain,<br/>
"Ye Greeks, be men! the charge of battle bear;<br/>
Your brave associates and yourselves revere!<br/>
Let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire,<br/>
And catch from breast to breast the noble fire!<br/>
On valour's side the odds of combat lie,<br/>
The brave live glorious, or lamented die;<br/>
The wretch who trembles in the field of fame,<br/>
Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
These words he seconds with his flying lance,<br/>
To meet whose point was strong Deicoon's chance:<br/>
Æneas' friend, and in his native place<br/>
Honour'd and loved like Priam's royal race:<br/>
Long had he fought the foremost in the field,<br/>
But now the monarch's lance transpierced his shield:<br/>
His shield too weak the furious dart to stay,<br/>
Through his broad belt the weapon forced its way:<br/>
The grisly wound dismiss'd his soul to hell,<br/>
His arms around him rattled as he fell.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then fierce Æneas, brandishing his blade,<br/>
In dust Orsilochus and Crethon laid,<br/>
Whose sire Diocleus, wealthy, brave and great,<br/>
In well-built Pherae held his lofty seat:<br/>
Sprung from Alpheus' plenteous stream, that yields<br/>
Increase of harvests to the Pylian fields.<br/>
He got Orsilochus, Diocleus he,<br/>
And these descended in the third degree.<br/>
Too early expert in the martial toil,<br/>
In sable ships they left their native soil,<br/>
To avenge Atrides: now, untimely slain,<br/>
They fell with glory on the Phrygian plain.<br/>
So two young mountain lions, nursed with blood<br/>
In deep recesses of the gloomy wood,<br/>
Rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll'd<br/>
Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold:<br/>
Till pierced at distance from their native den,<br/>
O'erpowered they fall beneath the force of men.<br/>
Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay,<br/>
Like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.<br/>
Great Menelaus views with pitying eyes,<br/>
Lifts his bright lance, and at the victor flies;<br/>
Mars urged him on; yet, ruthless in his hate,<br/>
The god but urged him to provoke his fate.<br/>
He thus advancing, Nestor's valiant son<br/>
Shakes for his danger, and neglects his own;<br/>
Struck with the thought, should Helen's lord be slain,<br/>
And all his country's glorious labours vain.<br/>
Already met, the threatening heroes stand;<br/>
The spears already tremble in their hand:<br/>
In rush'd Antilochus, his aid to bring,<br/>
And fall or conquer by the Spartan king.<br/>
These seen, the Dardan backward turn'd his course,<br/>
Brave as he was, and shunn'd unequal force.<br/>
The breathless bodies to the Greeks they drew,<br/>
Then mix in combat, and their toils renew.<br/>
</p>
<p>
First, Pylaemenes, great in battle, bled,<br/>
Who sheathed in brass the Paphlagonians led.<br/>
Atrides mark'd him where sublime he stood;<br/>
Fix'd in his throat the javelin drank his blood.<br/>
The faithful Mydon, as he turn'd from fight<br/>
His flying coursers, sunk to endless night;<br/>
A broken rock by Nestor's son was thrown:<br/>
His bended arm received the falling stone;<br/>
From his numb'd hand the ivory-studded reins,<br/>
Dropp'd in the dust, are trail'd along the plains:<br/>
Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound;<br/>
He groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground:<br/>
Deep drove his helmet in the sands, and there<br/>
The head stood fix'd, the quivering legs in air,<br/>
Till trampled flat beneath the coursers' feet:<br/>
The youthful victor mounts his empty seat,<br/>
And bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Great Hector saw, and, raging at the view,<br/>
Pours on the Greeks: the Trojan troops pursue:<br/>
He fires his host with animating cries,<br/>
And brings along the furies of the skies,<br/>
Mars, stern destroyer! and Bellona dread,<br/>
Flame in the front, and thunder at their head:<br/>
This swells the tumult and the rage of fight;<br/>
That shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light.<br/>
Where Hector march'd, the god of battles shined,<br/>
Now storm'd before him, and now raged behind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Tydides paused amidst his full career;<br/>
Then first the hero's manly breast knew fear.<br/>
As when some simple swain his cot forsakes,<br/>
And wide through fens an unknown journey takes:<br/>
If chance a swelling brook his passage stay,<br/>
And foam impervious 'cross the wanderer's way,<br/>
Confused he stops, a length of country pass'd,<br/>
Eyes the rough waves, and tired, returns at last.<br/>
Amazed no less the great Tydides stands:<br/>
He stay'd, and turning thus address'd his bands:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"No wonder, Greeks! that all to Hector yield;<br/>
Secure of favouring gods, he takes the field;<br/>
His strokes they second, and avert our spears.<br/>
Behold where Mars in mortal arms appears!<br/>
Retire then, warriors, but sedate and slow;<br/>
Retire, but with your faces to the foe.<br/>
Trust not too much your unavailing might;<br/>
'Tis not with Troy, but with the gods ye fight."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now near the Greeks the black battalions drew;<br/>
And first two leaders valiant Hector slew:<br/>
His force Anchialus and Mnesthes found,<br/>
In every art of glorious war renown'd;<br/>
In the same car the chiefs to combat ride,<br/>
And fought united, and united died.<br/>
Struck at the sight, the mighty Ajax glows<br/>
With thirst of vengeance, and assaults the foes.<br/>
His massy spear with matchless fury sent,<br/>
Through Amphius' belt and heaving belly went;<br/>
Amphius Apaesus' happy soil possess'd,<br/>
With herds abounding, and with treasure bless'd;<br/>
But fate resistless from his country led<br/>
The chief, to perish at his people's head.<br/>
Shook with his fall his brazen armour rung,<br/>
And fierce, to seize it, conquering Ajax sprung;<br/>
Around his head an iron tempest rain'd;<br/>
A wood of spears his ample shield sustain'd:<br/>
Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press'd,<br/>
And drew his javelin from the bleeding breast:<br/>
He could no more; the showering darts denied<br/>
To spoil his glittering arms, and plumy pride.<br/>
Now foes on foes came pouring on the fields,<br/>
With bristling lances, and compacted shields;<br/>
Till in the steely circle straiten'd round,<br/>
Forced he gives way, and sternly quits the ground.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While thus they strive, Tlepolemus the great,<br/>
Urged by the force of unresisted fate,<br/>
Burns with desire Sarpedon's strength to prove;<br/>
Alcides' offspring meets the son of Jove.<br/>
Sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on.<br/>
Jove's great descendant, and his greater son.<br/>
Prepared for combat, ere the lance he toss'd,<br/>
The daring Rhodian vents his haughty boast:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What brings this Lycian counsellor so far,<br/>
To tremble at our arms, not mix in war!<br/>
Know thy vain self, nor let their flattery move,<br/>
Who style thee son of cloud-compelling Jove.<br/>
How far unlike those chiefs of race divine,<br/>
How vast the difference of their deeds and thine!<br/>
Jove got such heroes as my sire, whose soul<br/>
No fear could daunt, nor earth nor hell control.<br/>
Troy felt his arm, and yon proud ramparts stand<br/>
Raised on the ruins of his vengeful hand:<br/>
With six small ships, and but a slender train,<br/>
He left the town a wide-deserted plain.<br/>
But what art thou, who deedless look'st around,<br/>
While unrevenged thy Lycians bite the ground!<br/>
Small aid to Troy thy feeble force can be;<br/>
But wert thou greater, thou must yield to me.<br/>
Pierced by my spear, to endless darkness go!<br/>
I make this present to the shades below."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The son of Hercules, the Rhodian guide,<br/>
Thus haughty spoke. The Lycian king replied:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thy sire, O prince! o'erturn'd the Trojan state,<br/>
Whose perjured monarch well deserved his fate;<br/>
Those heavenly steeds the hero sought so far,<br/>
False he detain'd, the just reward of war.<br/>
Nor so content, the generous chief defied,<br/>
With base reproaches and unmanly pride.<br/>
But you, unworthy the high race you boast,<br/>
Shall raise my glory when thy own is lost:<br/>
Now meet thy fate, and by Sarpedon slain,<br/>
Add one more ghost to Pluto's gloomy reign."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: both javelins at an instant flew;<br/>
Both struck, both wounded, but Sarpedon's slew:<br/>
Full in the boaster's neck the weapon stood,<br/>
Transfix'd his throat, and drank the vital blood;<br/>
The soul disdainful seeks the caves of night,<br/>
And his seal'd eyes for ever lose the light.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet not in vain, Tlepolemus, was thrown<br/>
Thy angry lance; which piercing to the bone<br/>
Sarpedon's thigh, had robb'd the chief of breath;<br/>
But Jove was present, and forbade the death.<br/>
Borne from the conflict by his Lycian throng,<br/>
The wounded hero dragg'd the lance along.<br/>
(His friends, each busied in his several part,<br/>
Through haste, or danger, had not drawn the dart.)<br/>
The Greeks with slain Tlepolemus retired;<br/>
Whose fall Ulysses view'd, with fury fired;<br/>
Doubtful if Jove's great son he should pursue,<br/>
Or pour his vengeance on the Lycian crew.<br/>
But heaven and fate the first design withstand,<br/>
Nor this great death must grace Ulysses' hand.<br/>
Minerva drives him on the Lycian train;<br/>
Alastor, Cronius, Halius, strew'd the plain,<br/>
Alcander, Prytanis, Noemon fell:<br/>
And numbers more his sword had sent to hell,<br/>
But Hector saw; and, furious at the sight,<br/>
Rush'd terrible amidst the ranks of fight.<br/>
With joy Sarpedon view'd the wish'd relief,<br/>
And, faint, lamenting, thus implored the chief:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O suffer not the foe to bear away<br/>
My helpless corpse, an unassisted prey;<br/>
If I, unbless'd, must see my son no more,<br/>
My much-loved consort, and my native shore,<br/>
Yet let me die in Ilion's sacred wall;<br/>
Troy, in whose cause I fell, shall mourn my fall."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, nor Hector to the chief replies,<br/>
But shakes his plume, and fierce to combat flies;<br/>
Swift as a whirlwind, drives the scattering foes;<br/>
And dyes the ground with purple as he goes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Beneath a beech, Jove's consecrated shade,<br/>
His mournful friends divine Sarpedon laid:<br/>
Brave Pelagon, his favourite chief, was nigh,<br/>
Who wrench'd the javelin from his sinewy thigh.<br/>
The fainting soul stood ready wing'd for flight,<br/>
And o'er his eye-balls swam the shades of night;<br/>
But Boreas rising fresh, with gentle breath,<br/>
Recall'd his spirit from the gates of death.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The generous Greeks recede with tardy pace,<br/>
Though Mars and Hector thunder in their face;<br/>
None turn their backs to mean ignoble flight,<br/>
Slow they retreat, and even retreating fight.<br/>
Who first, who last, by Mars' and Hector's hand,<br/>
Stretch'd in their blood, lay gasping on the sand?<br/>
Tenthras the great, Orestes the renown'd<br/>
For managed steeds, and Trechus press'd the ground;<br/>
Next OEnomaus and OEnops' offspring died;<br/>
Oresbius last fell groaning at their side:<br/>
Oresbius, in his painted mitre gay,<br/>
In fat Boeotia held his wealthy sway,<br/>
Where lakes surround low Hyle's watery plain;<br/>
A prince and people studious of their gain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The carnage Juno from the skies survey'd,<br/>
And touch'd with grief bespoke the blue-eyed maid:<br/>
"Oh, sight accursed! Shall faithless Troy prevail,<br/>
And shall our promise to our people fail?<br/>
How vain the word to Menelaus given<br/>
By Jove's great daughter and the queen of heaven,<br/>
Beneath his arms that Priam's towers should fall,<br/>
If warring gods for ever guard the wall!<br/>
Mars, red with slaughter, aids our hated foes:<br/>
Haste, let us arm, and force with force oppose!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
She spoke; Minerva burns to meet the war:<br/>
And now heaven's empress calls her blazing car.<br/>
At her command rush forth the steeds divine;<br/>
Rich with immortal gold their trappings shine.<br/>
Bright Hebe waits; by Hebe, ever young,<br/>
The whirling wheels are to the chariot hung.<br/>
On the bright axle turns the bidden wheel<br/>
Of sounding brass; the polished axle steel.<br/>
Eight brazen spokes in radiant order flame;<br/>
The circles gold, of uncorrupted frame,<br/>
Such as the heavens produce: and round the gold<br/>
Two brazen rings of work divine were roll'd.<br/>
The bossy naves of sold silver shone;<br/>
Braces of gold suspend the moving throne:<br/>
The car, behind, an arching figure bore;<br/>
The bending concave form'd an arch before.<br/>
Silver the beam, the extended yoke was gold,<br/>
And golden reins the immortal coursers hold.<br/>
Herself, impatient, to the ready car,<br/>
The coursers joins, and breathes revenge and war.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pallas disrobes; her radiant veil untied,<br/>
With flowers adorn'd, with art diversified,<br/>
(The laboured veil her heavenly fingers wove,)<br/>
Flows on the pavement of the court of Jove.<br/>
Now heaven's dread arms her mighty limbs invest,<br/>
Jove's cuirass blazes on her ample breast;<br/>
Deck'd in sad triumph for the mournful field,<br/>
O'er her broad shoulders hangs his horrid shield,<br/>
Dire, black, tremendous! Round the margin roll'd,<br/>
A fringe of serpents hissing guards the gold:<br/>
Here all the terrors of grim War appear,<br/>
Here rages Force, here tremble Flight and Fear,<br/>
Here storm'd Contention, and here Fury frown'd,<br/>
And the dire orb portentous Gorgon crown'd.<br/>
The massy golden helm she next assumes,<br/>
That dreadful nods with four o'ershading plumes;<br/>
So vast, the broad circumference contains<br/>
A hundred armies on a hundred plains.<br/>
The goddess thus the imperial car ascends;<br/>
Shook by her arm the mighty javelin bends,<br/>
Ponderous and huge; that when her fury burns,<br/>
Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift at the scourge the ethereal coursers fly,<br/>
While the smooth chariot cuts the liquid sky.<br/>
Heaven's gates spontaneous open to the powers,<br/>
Heaven's golden gates, kept by the winged Hours;<br/>
Commission'd in alternate watch they stand,<br/>
The sun's bright portals and the skies command,<br/>
Involve in clouds the eternal gates of day,<br/>
Or the dark barrier roll with ease away.<br/>
The sounding hinges ring, on either side<br/>
The gloomy volumes, pierced with light, divide.<br/>
The chariot mounts, where deep in ambient skies,<br/>
Confused, Olympus' hundred heads arise;<br/>
Where far apart the Thunderer fills his throne,<br/>
O'er all the gods superior and alone.<br/>
There with her snowy hand the queen restrains<br/>
The fiery steeds, and thus to Jove complains:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O sire! can no resentment touch thy soul?<br/>
Can Mars rebel, and does no thunder roll?<br/>
What lawless rage on yon forbidden plain,<br/>
What rash destruction! and what heroes slain!<br/>
Venus, and Phoebus with the dreadful bow,<br/>
Smile on the slaughter, and enjoy my woe.<br/>
Mad, furious power! whose unrelenting mind<br/>
No god can govern, and no justice bind.<br/>
Say, mighty father! shall we scourge this pride,<br/>
And drive from fight the impetuous homicide?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom assenting, thus the Thunderer said:<br/>
"Go! and the great Minerva be thy aid.<br/>
To tame the monster-god Minerva knows,<br/>
And oft afflicts his brutal breast with woes."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; Saturnia, ardent to obey,<br/>
Lash'd her white steeds along the aerial way.<br/>
Swift down the steep of heaven the chariot rolls,<br/>
Between the expanded earth and starry poles.<br/>
Far as a shepherd, from some point on high,<br/>
O'er the wide main extends his boundless eye,<br/>
Through such a space of air, with thundering sound,<br/>
At every leap the immortal coursers bound<br/>
Troy now they reach'd and touch'd those banks divine,<br/>
Where silver Simois and Scamander join.<br/>
There Juno stopp'd, and (her fair steeds unloosed)<br/>
Of air condensed a vapour circumfused:<br/>
For these, impregnate with celestial dew,<br/>
On Simois' brink ambrosial herbage grew.<br/>
Thence to relieve the fainting Argive throng,<br/>
Smooth as the sailing doves they glide along.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The best and bravest of the Grecian band<br/>
(A warlike circle) round Tydides stand.<br/>
Such was their look as lions bathed in blood,<br/>
Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.<br/>
Heaven's empress mingles with the mortal crowd,<br/>
And shouts, in Stentor's sounding voice, aloud;<br/>
Stentor the strong, endued with brazen lungs,<br/>
Whose throats surpass'd the force of fifty tongues.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Inglorious Argives! to your race a shame,<br/>
And only men in figure and in name!<br/>
Once from the walls your timorous foes engaged,<br/>
While fierce in war divine Achilles raged;<br/>
Now issuing fearless they possess the plain,<br/>
Now win the shores, and scarce the seas remain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Her speech new fury to their hearts convey'd;<br/>
While near Tydides stood the Athenian maid;<br/>
The king beside his panting steeds she found,<br/>
O'erspent with toil reposing on the ground;<br/>
To cool his glowing wound he sat apart,<br/>
(The wound inflicted by the Lycian dart.)<br/>
Large drops of sweat from all his limbs descend,<br/>
Beneath his ponderous shield his sinews bend,<br/>
Whose ample belt, that o'er his shoulder lay,<br/>
He eased; and wash'd the clotted gore away.<br/>
The goddess leaning o'er the bending yoke,<br/>
Beside his coursers, thus her silence broke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Degenerate prince! and not of Tydeus' kind,<br/>
Whose little body lodged a mighty mind;<br/>
Foremost he press'd in glorious toils to share,<br/>
And scarce refrain'd when I forbade the war.<br/>
Alone, unguarded, once he dared to go,<br/>
And feast, incircled by the Theban foe;<br/>
There braved, and vanquish'd, many a hardy knight;<br/>
Such nerves I gave him, and such force in fight.<br/>
Thou too no less hast been my constant care;<br/>
Thy hands I arm'd, and sent thee forth to war:<br/>
But thee or fear deters, or sloth detains;<br/>
No drop of all thy father warms thy veins."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The chief thus answered mild: "Immortal maid!<br/>
I own thy presence, and confess thy aid.<br/>
Not fear, thou know'st, withholds me from the plains,<br/>
Nor sloth hath seized me, but thy word restrains:<br/>
From warring gods thou bad'st me turn my spear,<br/>
And Venus only found resistance here.<br/>
Hence, goddess! heedful of thy high commands,<br/>
Loth I gave way, and warn'd our Argive bands:<br/>
For Mars, the homicide, these eyes beheld,<br/>
With slaughter red, and raging round the field."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus Minerva:—"Brave Tydides, hear!<br/>
Not Mars himself, nor aught immortal, fear.<br/>
Full on the god impel thy foaming horse:<br/>
Pallas commands, and Pallas lends thee force.<br/>
Rash, furious, blind, from these to those he flies,<br/>
And every side of wavering combat tries;<br/>
Large promise makes, and breaks the promise made:<br/>
Now gives the Grecians, now the Trojans aid."<br/>
</p>
<p>
She said, and to the steeds approaching near,<br/>
Drew from his seat the martial charioteer.<br/>
The vigorous power the trembling car ascends,<br/>
Fierce for revenge; and Diomed attends:<br/>
The groaning axle bent beneath the load;<br/>
So great a hero, and so great a god.<br/>
She snatch'd the reins, she lash'd with all her force,<br/>
And full on Mars impelled the foaming horse:<br/>
But first, to hide her heavenly visage, spread<br/>
Black Orcus' helmet o'er her radiant head.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Just then gigantic Periphas lay slain,<br/>
The strongest warrior of the Ætolian train;<br/>
The god, who slew him, leaves his prostrate prize<br/>
Stretch'd where he fell, and at Tydides flies.<br/>
Now rushing fierce, in equal arms appear<br/>
The daring Greek, the dreadful god of war!<br/>
Full at the chief, above his courser's head,<br/>
From Mars's arm the enormous weapon fled:<br/>
Pallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance<br/>
Far from the car the strong immortal lance.<br/>
Then threw the force of Tydeus' warlike son;<br/>
The javelin hiss'd; the goddess urged it on:<br/>
Where the broad cincture girt his armour round,<br/>
It pierced the god: his groin received the wound.<br/>
From the rent skin the warrior tugs again<br/>
The smoking steel. Mars bellows with the pain:<br/>
Loud as the roar encountering armies yield,<br/>
When shouting millions shake the thundering field.<br/>
Both armies start, and trembling gaze around;<br/>
And earth and heaven re-bellow to the sound.<br/>
As vapours blown by Auster's sultry breath,<br/>
Pregnant with plagues, and shedding seeds of death,<br/>
Beneath the rage of burning Sirius rise,<br/>
Choke the parch'd earth, and blacken all the skies;<br/>
In such a cloud the god from combat driven,<br/>
High o'er the dusky whirlwind scales the heaven.<br/>
Wild with his pain, he sought the bright abodes,<br/>
There sullen sat beneath the sire of gods,<br/>
Show'd the celestial blood, and with a groan<br/>
Thus pour'd his plaints before the immortal throne:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Can Jove, supine, flagitious facts survey,<br/>
And brook the furies of this daring day?<br/>
For mortal men celestial powers engage,<br/>
And gods on gods exert eternal rage:<br/>
From thee, O father! all these ills we bear,<br/>
And thy fell daughter with the shield and spear;<br/>
Thou gavest that fury to the realms of light,<br/>
Pernicious, wild, regardless of the right.<br/>
All heaven beside reveres thy sovereign sway,<br/>
Thy voice we hear, and thy behests obey:<br/>
'Tis hers to offend, and even offending share<br/>
Thy breast, thy counsels, thy distinguish'd care:<br/>
So boundless she, and thou so partial grown,<br/>
Well may we deem the wondrous birth thy own.<br/>
Now frantic Diomed, at her command,<br/>
Against the immortals lifts his raging hand:<br/>
The heavenly Venus first his fury found,<br/>
Me next encountering, me he dared to wound;<br/>
Vanquish'd I fled; even I, the god of fight,<br/>
From mortal madness scarce was saved by flight.<br/>
Else hadst thou seen me sink on yonder plain,<br/>
Heap'd round, and heaving under loads of slain!<br/>
Or pierced with Grecian darts, for ages lie,<br/>
Condemn'd to pain, though fated not to die."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Him thus upbraiding, with a wrathful look<br/>
The lord of thunders view'd, and stern bespoke:<br/>
"To me, perfidious! this lamenting strain?<br/>
Of lawless force shall lawless Mars complain?<br/>
Of all the gods who tread the spangled skies,<br/>
Thou most unjust, most odious in our eyes!<br/>
Inhuman discord is thy dire delight,<br/>
The waste of slaughter, and the rage of fight.<br/>
No bounds, no law, thy fiery temper quells,<br/>
And all thy mother in thy soul rebels.<br/>
In vain our threats, in vain our power we use;<br/>
She gives the example, and her son pursues.<br/>
Yet long the inflicted pangs thou shall not mourn,<br/>
Sprung since thou art from Jove, and heavenly-born.<br/>
Else, singed with lightning, hadst thou hence been thrown,<br/>
Where chain'd on burning rocks the Titans groan."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus he who shakes Olympus with his nod;<br/>
Then gave to Paeon's care the bleeding god.<br/>
With gentle hand the balm he pour'd around,<br/>
And heal'd the immortal flesh, and closed the wound.<br/>
As when the fig's press'd juice, infused in cream,<br/>
To curds coagulates the liquid stream,<br/>
Sudden the fluids fix the parts combined;<br/>
Such, and so soon, the ethereal texture join'd.<br/>
Cleansed from the dust and gore, fair Hebe dress'd<br/>
His mighty limbs in an immortal vest.<br/>
Glorious he sat, in majesty restored,<br/>
Fast by the throne of heaven's superior lord.<br/>
Juno and Pallas mount the bless'd abodes,<br/>
Their task perform'd, and mix among the gods.<br/>

<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XIII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast<br/>
Had fix'd great Hector and his conquering host,<br/>
He left them to the fates, in bloody fray<br/>
To toil and struggle through the well-fought day.<br/>
Then turn'd to Thracia from the field of fight<br/>
Those eyes that shed insufferable light,<br/>
To where the Mysians prove their martial force,<br/>
And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;<br/>
And where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays,<br/>
Renown'd for justice and for length of days;<br/>
Thrice happy race! that, innocent of blood,<br/>
From milk, innoxious, seek their simple food:<br/>
Jove sees delighted; and avoids the scene<br/>
Of guilty Troy, of arms, and dying men:<br/>
No aid, he deems, to either host is given,<br/>
While his high law suspends the powers of Heaven.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meantime the monarch of the watery main<br/>
Observed the Thunderer, nor observed in vain.<br/>
In Samothracia, on a mountain's brow,<br/>
Whose waving woods o'erhung the deeps below,<br/>
He sat; and round him cast his azure eyes<br/>
Where Ida's misty tops confusedly rise;<br/>
Below, fair Ilion's glittering spires were seen;<br/>
The crowded ships and sable seas between.<br/>
There, from the crystal chambers of the main<br/>
Emerged, he sat, and mourn'd his Argives slain.<br/>
At Jove incensed, with grief and fury stung,<br/>
Prone down the rocky steep he rush'd along;<br/>
Fierce as he pass'd, the lofty mountains nod,<br/>
The forest shakes; earth trembled as he trod,<br/>
And felt the footsteps of the immortal god.<br/>
From realm to realm three ample strides he took,<br/>
And, at the fourth, the distant Ægae shook.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Far in the bay his shining palace stands,<br/>
Eternal frame! not raised by mortal hands:<br/>
This having reach'd, his brass-hoof'd steeds he reins,<br/>
Fleet as the winds, and deck'd with golden manes.<br/>
Refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,<br/>
Immortal arms of adamant and gold.<br/>
He mounts the car, the golden scourge applies,<br/>
He sits superior, and the chariot flies:<br/>
His whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep;<br/>
The enormous monsters rolling o'er the deep<br/>
Gambol around him on the watery way,<br/>
And heavy whales in awkward measures play;<br/>
The sea subsiding spreads a level plain,<br/>
Exults, and owns the monarch of the main;<br/>
The parting waves before his coursers fly;<br/>
The wondering waters leave his axle dry.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Deep in the liquid regions lies a cave,<br/>
Between where Tenedos the surges lave,<br/>
And rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave:<br/>
There the great ruler of the azure round<br/>
Stopp'd his swift chariot, and his steeds unbound,<br/>
Fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand,<br/>
And link'd their fetlocks with a golden band,<br/>
Infrangible, immortal: there they stay:<br/>
The father of the floods pursues his way:<br/>
Where, like a tempest, darkening heaven around,<br/>
Or fiery deluge that devours the ground,<br/>
The impatient Trojans, in a gloomy throng,<br/>
Embattled roll'd, as Hector rush'd along:<br/>
To the loud tumult and the barbarous cry<br/>
The heavens re-echo, and the shores reply:<br/>
They vow destruction to the Grecian name,<br/>
And in their hopes the fleets already flame.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But Neptune, rising from the seas profound,<br/>
The god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,<br/>
Now wears a mortal form; like Calchas seen,<br/>
Such his loud voice, and such his manly mien;<br/>
His shouts incessant every Greek inspire,<br/>
But most the Ajaces, adding fire to fire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"'Tis yours, O warriors, all our hopes to raise:<br/>
Oh recollect your ancient worth and praise!<br/>
'Tis yours to save us, if you cease to fear;<br/>
Flight, more than shameful, is destructive here.<br/>
On other works though Troy with fury fall,<br/>
And pour her armies o'er our batter'd wall:<br/>
There Greece has strength: but this, this part o'erthrown,<br/>
Her strength were vain; I dread for you alone:<br/>
Here Hector rages like the force of fire,<br/>
Vaunts of his gods, and calls high Jove his sire:<br/>
If yet some heavenly power your breast excite,<br/>
Breathe in your hearts, and string your arms to fight,<br/>
Greece yet may live, her threaten'd fleet maintain:<br/>
And Hector's force, and Jove's own aid, be vain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then with his sceptre, that the deep controls,<br/>
He touch'd the chiefs, and steel'd their manly souls:<br/>
Strength, not their own, the touch divine imparts,<br/>
Prompts their light limbs, and swells their daring hearts.<br/>
Then, as a falcon from the rocky height,<br/>
Her quarry seen, impetuous at the sight,<br/>
Forth-springing instant, darts herself from high,<br/>
Shoots on the wing, and skims along the sky:<br/>
Such, and so swift, the power of ocean flew;<br/>
The wide horizon shut him from their view.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The inspiring god Oileus' active son<br/>
Perceived the first, and thus to Telamon:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Some god, my friend, some god in human form<br/>
Favouring descends, and wills to stand the storm.<br/>
Not Calchas this, the venerable seer;<br/>
Short as he turned, I saw the power appear:<br/>
I mark'd his parting, and the steps he trod;<br/>
His own bright evidence reveals a god.<br/>
Even now some energy divine I share,<br/>
And seem to walk on wings, and tread in air!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"With equal ardour (Telamon returns)<br/>
My soul is kindled, and my bosom burns;<br/>
New rising spirits all my force alarm,<br/>
Lift each impatient limb, and brace my arm.<br/>
This ready arm, unthinking, shakes the dart;<br/>
The blood pours back, and fortifies my heart:<br/>
Singly, methinks, yon towering chief I meet,<br/>
And stretch the dreadful Hector at my feet."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Full of the god that urged their burning breast,<br/>
The heroes thus their mutual warmth express'd.<br/>
Neptune meanwhile the routed Greeks inspired;<br/>
Who, breathless, pale, with length of labours tired,<br/>
Pant in the ships; while Troy to conquest calls,<br/>
And swarms victorious o'er their yielding walls:<br/>
Trembling before the impending storm they lie,<br/>
While tears of rage stand burning in their eye.<br/>
Greece sunk they thought, and this their fatal hour;<br/>
But breathe new courage as they feel the power.<br/>
Teucer and Leitus first his words excite;<br/>
Then stern Peneleus rises to the fight;<br/>
Thoas, Deipyrus, in arms renown'd,<br/>
And Merion next, the impulsive fury found;<br/>
Last Nestor's son the same bold ardour takes,<br/>
While thus the god the martial fire awakes:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Oh lasting infamy, oh dire disgrace<br/>
To chiefs of vigorous youth, and manly race!<br/>
I trusted in the gods, and you, to see<br/>
Brave Greece victorious, and her navy free:<br/>
Ah, no&mdash;the glorious combat you disclaim,<br/>
And one black day clouds all her former fame.<br/>
Heavens! what a prodigy these eyes survey,<br/>
Unseen, unthought, till this amazing day!<br/>
Fly we at length from Troy's oft-conquer'd bands?<br/>
And falls our fleet by such inglorious hands?<br/>
A rout undisciplined, a straggling train,<br/>
Not born to glories of the dusty plain;<br/>
Like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued,<br/>
A prey to every savage of the wood:<br/>
Shall these, so late who trembled at your name,<br/>
Invade your camps, involve your ships in flame?<br/>
A change so shameful, say, what cause has wrought?<br/>
The soldiers' baseness, or the general's fault?<br/>
Fools! will ye perish for your leader's vice;<br/>
The purchase infamy, and life the price?<br/>
'Tis not your cause, Achilles' injured fame:<br/>
Another's is the crime, but yours the shame.<br/>
Grant that our chief offend through rage or lust,<br/>
Must you be cowards, if your king's unjust?<br/>
Prevent this evil, and your country save:<br/>
Small thought retrieves the spirits of the brave.<br/>
Think, and subdue! on dastards dead to fame<br/>
I waste no anger, for they feel no shame:<br/>
But you, the pride, the flower of all our host,<br/>
My heart weeps blood to see your glory lost!<br/>
Nor deem this day, this battle, all you lose;<br/>
A day more black, a fate more vile, ensues.<br/>
Let each reflect, who prizes fame or breath,<br/>
On endless infamy, on instant death:<br/>
For, lo! the fated time, the appointed shore:<br/>
Hark! the gates burst, the brazen barriers roar!<br/>
Impetuous Hector thunders at the wall;<br/>
The hour, the spot, to conquer, or to fall."<br/>
</p>
<p>
These words the Grecians' fainting hearts inspire,<br/>
And listening armies catch the godlike fire.<br/>
Fix'd at his post was each bold Ajax found,<br/>
With well-ranged squadrons strongly circled round:<br/>
So close their order, so disposed their fight,<br/>
As Pallas' self might view with fix'd delight;<br/>
Or had the god of war inclined his eyes,<br/>
The god of war had own'd a just surprise.<br/>
A chosen phalanx, firm, resolved as fate,<br/>
Descending Hector and his battle wait.<br/>
An iron scene gleams dreadful o'er the fields,<br/>
Armour in armour lock'd, and shields in shields,<br/>
Spears lean on spears, on targets targets throng,<br/>
Helms stuck to helms, and man drove man along.<br/>
The floating plumes unnumber'd wave above,<br/>
As when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove;<br/>
And levell'd at the skies with pointing rays,<br/>
Their brandish'd lances at each motion blaze.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus breathing death, in terrible array,<br/>
The close compacted legions urged their way:<br/>
Fierce they drove on, impatient to destroy;<br/>
Troy charged the first, and Hector first of Troy.<br/>
As from some mountain's craggy forehead torn,<br/>
A rock's round fragment flies, with fury borne,<br/>
(Which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends,)<br/>
Precipitate the ponderous mass descends:<br/>
From steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds;<br/>
At every shock the crackling wood resounds;<br/>
Still gathering force, it smokes; and urged amain,<br/>
Whirls, leaps, and thunders down, impetuous to the plain:<br/>
There stops&mdash;so Hector. Their whole force he proved,<br/>
Resistless when he raged, and, when he stopp'd, unmoved.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On him the war is bent, the darts are shed,<br/>
And all their falchions wave around his head:<br/>
Repulsed he stands, nor from his stand retires;<br/>
But with repeated shouts his army fires.<br/>
"Trojans! be firm; this arm shall make your way<br/>
Through yon square body, and that black array:<br/>
Stand, and my spear shall rout their scattering power,<br/>
Strong as they seem, embattled like a tower;<br/>
For he that Juno's heavenly bosom warms,<br/>
The first of gods, this day inspires our arms."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; and roused the soul in every breast:<br/>
Urged with desire of fame, beyond the rest,<br/>
Forth march'd Deiphobus; but, marching, held<br/>
Before his wary steps his ample shield.<br/>
Bold Merion aim'd a stroke (nor aim'd it wide);<br/>
The glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide;<br/>
But pierced not through: unfaithful to his hand,<br/>
The point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.<br/>
The Trojan warrior, touch'd with timely fear,<br/>
On the raised orb to distance bore the spear.<br/>
The Greek, retreating, mourn'd his frustrate blow,<br/>
And cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe;<br/>
Then to the ships with surly speed he went,<br/>
To seek a surer javelin in his tent.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows,<br/>
The tumult thickens, and the clamour grows.<br/>
By Teucer's arm the warlike Imbrius bleeds,<br/>
The son of Mentor, rich in generous steeds.<br/>
Ere yet to Troy the sons of Greece were led,<br/>
In fair Pedaeus' verdant pastures bred,<br/>
The youth had dwelt, remote from war's alarms,<br/>
And blest in bright Medesicaste's arms:<br/>
(This nymph, the fruit of Priam's ravish'd joy,<br/>
Allied the warrior to the house of Troy:)<br/>
To Troy, when glory call'd his arms, he came,<br/>
And match'd the bravest of her chiefs in fame:<br/>
With Priam's sons, a guardian of the throne,<br/>
He lived, beloved and honour'd as his own.<br/>
Him Teucer pierced between the throat and ear:<br/>
He groans beneath the Telamonian spear.<br/>
As from some far-seen mountain's airy crown,<br/>
Subdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down,<br/>
And soils its verdant tresses on the ground;<br/>
So falls the youth; his arms the fall resound.<br/>
Then Teucer rushing to despoil the dead,<br/>
From Hector's hand a shining javelin fled:<br/>
He saw, and shunn'd the death; the forceful dart<br/>
Sung on, and pierced Amphimachus's heart,<br/>
Cteatus' son, of Neptune's forceful line;<br/>
Vain was his courage, and his race divine!<br/>
Prostrate he falls; his clanging arms resound,<br/>
And his broad buckler thunders on the ground.<br/>
To seize his beamy helm the victor flies,<br/>
And just had fastened on the dazzling prize,<br/>
When Ajax' manly arm a javelin flung;<br/>
Full on the shield's round boss the weapon rung;<br/>
He felt the shock, nor more was doom'd to feel,<br/>
Secure in mail, and sheath'd in shining steel.<br/>
Repulsed he yields; the victor Greeks obtain<br/>
The spoils contested, and bear off the slain.<br/>
Between the leaders of the Athenian line,<br/>
(Stichius the brave, Menestheus the divine,)<br/>
Deplored Amphimachus, sad object! lies;<br/>
Imbrius remains the fierce Ajaces' prize.<br/>
As two grim lions bear across the lawn,<br/>
Snatch'd from devouring hounds, a slaughter'd fawn.<br/>
In their fell jaws high-lifting through the wood,<br/>
And sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood;<br/>
So these, the chief: great Ajax from the dead<br/>
Strips his bright arms; Oileus lops his head:<br/>
Toss'd like a ball, and whirl'd in air away,<br/>
At Hector's feet the gory visage lay.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The god of ocean, fired with stern disdain,<br/>
And pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain,<br/>
Inspires the Grecian hearts, confirms their hands,<br/>
And breathes destruction on the Trojan bands.<br/>
Swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet,<br/>
He finds the lance-famed Idomen of Crete,<br/>
His pensive brow the generous care express'd<br/>
With which a wounded soldier touch'd his breast,<br/>
Whom in the chance of war a javelin tore,<br/>
And his sad comrades from the battle bore;<br/>
Him to the surgeons of the camp he sent:<br/>
That office paid, he issued from his tent<br/>
Fierce for the fight: to whom the god begun,<br/>
In Thoas' voice, Andraemon's valiant son,<br/>
Who ruled where Calydon's white rocks arise,<br/>
And Pleuron's chalky cliffs emblaze the skies:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Where's now the imperious vaunt, the daring boast,<br/>
Of Greece victorious, and proud Ilion lost?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the king: "On Greece no blame be thrown;<br/>
Arms are her trade, and war is all her own.<br/>
Her hardy heroes from the well-fought plains<br/>
Nor fear withholds, nor shameful sloth detains:<br/>
'Tis heaven, alas! and Jove's all-powerful doom,<br/>
That far, far distant from our native home<br/>
Wills us to fall inglorious! Oh, my friend!<br/>
Once foremost in the fight, still prone to lend<br/>
Or arms or counsels, now perform thy best,<br/>
And what thou canst not singly, urge the rest."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus he: and thus the god whose force can make<br/>
The solid globe's eternal basis shake:<br/>
"Ah! never may he see his native land,<br/>
But feed the vultures on this hateful strand,<br/>
Who seeks ignobly in his ships to stay,<br/>
Nor dares to combat on this signal day!<br/>
For this, behold! in horrid arms I shine,<br/>
And urge thy soul to rival acts with mine.<br/>
Together let us battle on the plain;<br/>
Two, not the worst; nor even this succour vain:<br/>
Not vain the weakest, if their force unite;<br/>
But ours, the bravest have confess'd in fight."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, he rushes where the combat burns;<br/>
Swift to his tent the Cretan king returns:<br/>
From thence, two javelins glittering in his hand,<br/>
And clad in arms that lighten'd all the strand,<br/>
Fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove,<br/>
Like lightning bursting from the arm of Jove,<br/>
Which to pale man the wrath of heaven declares,<br/>
Or terrifies the offending world with wars;<br/>
In streamy sparkles, kindling all the skies,<br/>
From pole to pole the trail of glory flies:<br/>
Thus his bright armour o'er the dazzled throng<br/>
Gleam'd dreadful, as the monarch flash'd along.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Him, near his tent, Meriones attends;<br/>
Whom thus he questions: "Ever best of friends!<br/>
O say, in every art of battle skill'd,<br/>
What holds thy courage from so brave a field?<br/>
On some important message art thou bound,<br/>
Or bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound?<br/>
Inglorious here, my soul abhors to stay,<br/>
And glows with prospects of th' approaching day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O prince! (Meriones replies) whose care<br/>
Leads forth the embattled sons of Crete to war;<br/>
This speaks my grief: this headless lance I wield;<br/>
The rest lies rooted in a Trojan shield."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the Cretan: "Enter, and receive<br/>
The wonted weapons; those my tent can give;<br/>
Spears I have store, (and Trojan lances all,)<br/>
That shed a lustre round the illumined wall,<br/>
Though I, disdainful of the distant war,<br/>
Nor trust the dart, nor aim the uncertain spear,<br/>
Yet hand to hand I fight, and spoil the slain;<br/>
And thence these trophies, and these arms I gain.<br/>
Enter, and see on heaps the helmets roll'd,<br/>
And high-hung spears, and shields that flame with gold."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Nor vain (said Merion) are our martial toils;<br/>
We too can boast of no ignoble spoils:<br/>
But those my ship contains; whence distant far,<br/>
I fight conspicuous in the van of war,<br/>
What need I more? If any Greek there be<br/>
Who knows not Merion, I appeal to thee."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To this, Idomeneus: "The fields of fight<br/>
Have proved thy valour, and unconquer'd might:<br/>
And were some ambush for the foes design'd,<br/>
Even there thy courage would not lag behind:<br/>
In that sharp service, singled from the rest,<br/>
The fear of each, or valour, stands confess'd.<br/>
No force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;<br/>
He shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:<br/>
A dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;<br/>
Against his bosom beats his quivering heart;<br/>
Terror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;<br/>
With chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,<br/>
And looks a bloodless image of despair!<br/>
Not so the brave&mdash;still dauntless, still the same,<br/>
Unchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:<br/>
Composed his thought, determined is his eye,<br/>
And fix'd his soul, to conquer or to die:<br/>
If aught disturb the tenour of his breast,<br/>
'Tis but the wish to strike before the rest.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"In such assays thy blameless worth is known,<br/>
And every art of dangerous war thy own.<br/>
By chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,<br/>
Those wounds were glorious all, and all before;<br/>
Such as may teach, 'twas still thy brave delight<br/>
T'oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.<br/>
But why, like infants, cold to honour's charms,<br/>
Stand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?<br/>
Go&mdash;from my conquer'd spears the choicest take,<br/>
And to their owners send them nobly back."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift at the word bold Merion snatch'd a spear<br/>
And, breathing slaughter, follow'd to the war.<br/>
So Mars armipotent invades the plain,<br/>
(The wide destroyer of the race of man,)<br/>
Terror, his best-beloved son, attends his course,<br/>
Arm'd with stern boldness, and enormous force;<br/>
The pride of haughty warriors to confound,<br/>
And lay the strength of tyrants on the ground:<br/>
From Thrace they fly, call'd to the dire alarms<br/>
Of warring Phlegyans, and Ephyrian arms;<br/>
Invoked by both, relentless they dispose,<br/>
To these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.<br/>
So march'd the leaders of the Cretan train,<br/>
And their bright arms shot horror o'er the plain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then first spake Merion: "Shall we join the right,<br/>
Or combat in the centre of the fight?<br/>
Or to the left our wonted succour lend?<br/>
Hazard and fame all parts alike attend."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Not in the centre (Idomen replied:)<br/>
Our ablest chieftains the main battle guide;<br/>
Each godlike Ajax makes that post his care,<br/>
And gallant Teucer deals destruction there,<br/>
Skill'd or with shafts to gall the distant field,<br/>
Or bear close battle on the sounding shield.<br/>
These can the rage of haughty Hector tame:<br/>
Safe in their arms, the navy fears no flame,<br/>
Till Jove himself descends, his bolts to shed,<br/>
And hurl the blazing ruin at our head.<br/>
Great must he be, of more than human birth,<br/>
Nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.<br/>
Him neither rocks can crush, nor steel can wound,<br/>
Whom Ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.<br/>
In standing fight he mates Achilles' force,<br/>
Excell'd alone in swiftness in the course.<br/>
Then to the left our ready arms apply,<br/>
And live with glory, or with glory die."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: and Merion to th' appointed place,<br/>
Fierce as the god of battles, urged his pace.<br/>
Soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld<br/>
Rush like a fiery torrent o'er the field,<br/>
Their force embodied in a tide they pour;<br/>
The rising combat sounds along the shore.<br/>
As warring winds, in Sirius' sultry reign,<br/>
From different quarters sweep the sandy plain;<br/>
On every side the dusty whirlwinds rise,<br/>
And the dry fields are lifted to the skies:<br/>
Thus by despair, hope, rage, together driven,<br/>
Met the black hosts, and, meeting, darken'd heaven.<br/>
All dreadful glared the iron face of war,<br/>
Bristled with upright spears, that flash'd afar;<br/>
Dire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields,<br/>
And polish'd arms emblazed the flaming fields:<br/>
Tremendous scene! that general horror gave,<br/>
But touch'd with joy the bosoms of the brave.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Saturn's great sons in fierce contention vied,<br/>
And crowds of heroes in their anger died.<br/>
The sire of earth and heaven, by Thetis won<br/>
To crown with glory Peleus' godlike son,<br/>
Will'd not destruction to the Grecian powers,<br/>
But spared awhile the destined Trojan towers;<br/>
While Neptune, rising from his azure main,<br/>
Warr'd on the king of heaven with stern disdain,<br/>
And breathed revenge, and fired the Grecian train.<br/>
Gods of one source, of one ethereal race,<br/>
Alike divine, and heaven their native place;<br/>
But Jove the greater; first-born of the skies,<br/>
And more than men, or gods, supremely wise.<br/>
For this, of Jove's superior might afraid,<br/>
Neptune in human form conceal'd his aid.<br/>
These powers enfold the Greek and Trojan train<br/>
In war and discord's adamantine chain,<br/>
Indissolubly strong: the fatal tie<br/>
Is stretch'd on both, and close compell'd they die.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Dreadful in arms, and grown in combats grey,<br/>
The bold Idomeneus controls the day.<br/>
First by his hand Othryoneus was slain,<br/>
Swell'd with false hopes, with mad ambition vain;<br/>
Call'd by the voice of war to martial fame,<br/>
From high Cabesus' distant walls he came;<br/>
Cassandra's love he sought, with boasts of power,<br/>
And promised conquest was the proffer'd dower.<br/>
The king consented, by his vaunts abused;<br/>
The king consented, but the fates refused.<br/>
Proud of himself, and of the imagined bride,<br/>
The field he measured with a larger stride.<br/>
Him as he stalk'd, the Cretan javelin found;<br/>
Vain was his breastplate to repel the wound:<br/>
His dream of glory lost, he plunged to hell;<br/>
His arms resounded as the boaster fell.<br/>
The great Idomeneus bestrides the dead;<br/>
"And thus (he cries) behold thy promise sped!<br/>
Such is the help thy arms to Ilion bring,<br/>
And such the contract of the Phrygian king!<br/>
Our offers now, illustrious prince! receive;<br/>
For such an aid what will not Argos give?<br/>
To conquer Troy, with ours thy forces join,<br/>
And count Atrides' fairest daughter thine.<br/>
Meantime, on further methods to advise,<br/>
Come, follow to the fleet thy new allies;<br/>
There hear what Greece has on her part to say."<br/>
He spoke, and dragg'd the gory corse away.<br/>
This Asius view'd, unable to contain,<br/>
Before his chariot warring on the plain:<br/>
(His crowded coursers, to his squire consign'd,<br/>
Impatient panted on his neck behind:)<br/>
To vengeance rising with a sudden spring,<br/>
He hoped the conquest of the Cretan king.<br/>
The wary Cretan, as his foe drew near,<br/>
Full on his throat discharged the forceful spear:<br/>
Beneath the chin the point was seen to glide,<br/>
And glitter'd, extant at the further side.<br/>
As when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,<br/>
Or pine, fit mast for some great admiral,<br/>
Groans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,<br/>
Then spreads a length of ruin o'er the ground:<br/>
So sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day,<br/>
And stretch'd before his much-loved coursers lay.<br/>
He grinds the dust distain'd with streaming gore,<br/>
And, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.<br/>
Deprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,<br/>
Stands all aghast his trembling charioteer,<br/>
Nor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,<br/>
But falls transfix'd, an unresisting prey:<br/>
Pierced by Antilochus, he pants beneath<br/>
The stately car, and labours out his breath.<br/>
Thus Asius' steeds (their mighty master gone)<br/>
Remain the prize of Nestor's youthful son.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Stabb'd at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh,<br/>
And made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.<br/>
The Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance<br/>
From his slope shield the disappointed lance.<br/>
Beneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,<br/>
Thick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,<br/>
On his raised arm by two strong braces stay'd,)<br/>
He lay collected in defensive shade.<br/>
O'er his safe head the javelin idly sung,<br/>
And on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.<br/>
Even then the spear the vigorous arm confess'd,<br/>
And pierced, obliquely, king Hypsenor's breast:<br/>
Warm'd in his liver, to the ground it bore<br/>
The chief, his people's guardian now no more!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Not unattended (the proud Trojan cries)<br/>
Nor unrevenged, lamented Asius lies:<br/>
For thee, through hell's black portals stand display'd,<br/>
This mate shall joy thy melancholy shade."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Heart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,<br/>
Touch'd every Greek, but Nestor's son the most.<br/>
Grieved as he was, his pious arms attend,<br/>
And his broad buckler shields his slaughter'd friend:<br/>
Till sad Mecistheus and Alastor bore<br/>
His honour'd body to the tented shore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor yet from fight Idomeneus withdraws;<br/>
Resolved to perish in his country's cause,<br/>
Or find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom<br/>
To wail his fate in death's eternal gloom.<br/>
He sees Alcathous in the front aspire:<br/>
Great Æsyetes was the hero's sire;<br/>
His spouse Hippodame, divinely fair,<br/>
Anchises' eldest hope, and darling care:<br/>
Who charm'd her parents' and her husband's heart<br/>
With beauty, sense, and every work of art:<br/>
He once of Ilion's youth the loveliest boy,<br/>
The fairest she of all the fair of Troy.<br/>
By Neptune now the hapless hero dies,<br/>
Who covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes,<br/>
And fetters every limb: yet bent to meet<br/>
His fate he stands; nor shuns the lance of Crete.<br/>
Fix'd as some column, or deep-rooted oak,<br/>
While the winds sleep; his breast received the stroke.<br/>
Before the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,<br/>
Long used to ward the death in fighting fields.<br/>
The riven armour sends a jarring sound;<br/>
His labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,<br/>
The long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound;<br/>
Fast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,<br/>
Life's purple tide impetuous gush'd away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Idomen, insulting o'er the slain:<br/>
"Behold, Deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain:<br/>
See! on one Greek three Trojan ghosts attend;<br/>
This, my third victim, to the shades I send.<br/>
Approaching now thy boasted might approve,<br/>
And try the prowess of the seed of Jove.<br/>
From Jove, enamour'd of a mortal dame,<br/>
Great Minos, guardian of his country, came:<br/>
Deucalion, blameless prince, was Minos' heir;<br/>
His first-born I, the third from Jupiter:<br/>
O'er spacious Crete, and her bold sons, I reign,<br/>
And thence my ships transport me through the main:<br/>
Lord of a host, o'er all my host I shine,<br/>
A scourge to thee, thy father, and thy line."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Trojan heard; uncertain or to meet,<br/>
Alone, with venturous arms the king of Crete,<br/>
Or seek auxiliar force; at length decreed<br/>
To call some hero to partake the deed,<br/>
Forthwith Æneas rises to his thought:<br/>
For him in Troy's remotest lines he sought,<br/>
Where he, incensed at partial Priam, stands,<br/>
And sees superior posts in meaner hands.<br/>
To him, ambitious of so great an aid,<br/>
The bold Deiphobus approach'd, and said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Now, Trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,<br/>
If e'er thy bosom felt fair honour's charms.<br/>
Alcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend;<br/>
Come, and the warrior's loved remains defend.<br/>
Beneath his cares thy early youth was train'd,<br/>
One table fed you, and one roof contain'd.<br/>
This deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe;<br/>
Haste, and revenge it on th' insulting foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Æneas heard, and for a space resign'd<br/>
To tender pity all his manly mind;<br/>
Then rising in his rage, he burns to fight:<br/>
The Greek awaits him with collected might.<br/>
As the fell boar, on some rough mountain's head,<br/>
Arm'd with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,<br/>
When the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,<br/>
Attends the tumult, and expects the war;<br/>
O'er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;<br/>
Fires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,<br/>
His foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;<br/>
But most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:<br/>
So stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,<br/>
And met the Trojan with a lowering look.<br/>
Antilochus, Deipyrus, were near,<br/>
The youthful offspring of the god of war,<br/>
Merion, and Aphareus, in field renown'd:<br/>
To these the warrior sent his voice around.<br/>
"Fellows in arms! your timely aid unite;<br/>
Lo, great Æneas rushes to the fight:<br/>
Sprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;<br/>
He fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.<br/>
Else should this hand, this hour decide the strife,<br/>
The great dispute, of glory, or of life."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey'd;<br/>
Their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade<br/>
Around the chief. Æneas too demands<br/>
Th' assisting forces of his native bands;<br/>
Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;<br/>
(Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)<br/>
In order follow all th' embodied train,<br/>
Like Ida's flocks proceeding o'er the plain;<br/>
Before his fleecy care, erect and bold,<br/>
Stalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.<br/>
With joy the swain surveys them, as he leads<br/>
To the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:<br/>
So joys Æneas, as his native band<br/>
Moves on in rank, and stretches o'er the land.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Round dread Alcathous now the battle rose;<br/>
On every side the steely circle grows;<br/>
Now batter'd breast-plates and hack'd helmets ring,<br/>
And o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.<br/>
Above the rest, two towering chiefs appear,<br/>
There great Idomeneus, Æneas here.<br/>
Like gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,<br/>
And burn'd to drench the ground with mutual blood.<br/>
The Trojan weapon whizz'd along in air;<br/>
The Cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear:<br/>
Sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood<br/>
Stuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood.<br/>
But OEnomas received the Cretan's stroke;<br/>
The forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,<br/>
It ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound,<br/>
And roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.<br/>
Stretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath,<br/>
And, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.<br/>
The victor from his breast the weapon tears;<br/>
His spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.<br/>
Though now unfit an active war to wage,<br/>
Heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,<br/>
His listless limbs unable for the course,<br/>
In standing fight he yet maintains his force;<br/>
Till faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,<br/>
His tired slow steps he drags from off the field.<br/>
Deiphobus beheld him as he pass'd,<br/>
And, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:<br/>
The javelin err'd, but held its course along,<br/>
And pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:<br/>
The son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,<br/>
And gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his wound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor knew the furious father of his fall;<br/>
High-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,<br/>
On golden clouds th' immortal synod sate;<br/>
Detain'd from bloody war by Jove and Fate.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now, where in dust the breathless hero lay,<br/>
For slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,<br/>
Deiphobus to seize his helmet flies,<br/>
And from his temples rends the glittering prize;<br/>
Valiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,<br/>
And on his loaded arm discharged his spear:<br/>
He drops the weight, disabled with the pain;<br/>
The hollow helmet rings against the plain.<br/>
Swift as a vulture leaping on his prey,<br/>
From his torn arm the Grecian rent away<br/>
The reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends.<br/>
His wounded brother good Polites tends;<br/>
Around his waist his pious arms he threw,<br/>
And from the rage of battle gently drew:<br/>
Him his swift coursers, on his splendid car,<br/>
Rapt from the lessening thunder of the war;<br/>
To Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,<br/>
And sprinkling, as he pass'd, the sands with gore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,<br/>
Heaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.<br/>
Bold Aphareus by great Æneas bled;<br/>
As toward the chief he turn'd his daring head,<br/>
He pierced his throat; the bending head, depress'd<br/>
Beneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;<br/>
His shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies,<br/>
And everlasting slumber seals his eyes.<br/>
Antilochus, as Thoon turn'd him round,<br/>
Transpierced his back with a dishonest wound:<br/>
The hollow vein, that to the neck extends<br/>
Along the chine, his eager javelin rends:<br/>
Supine he falls, and to his social train<br/>
Spreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.<br/>
Thv exulting victor, leaping where he lay,<br/>
From his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;<br/>
His time observed; for closed by foes around,<br/>
On all sides thick the peals of arms resound.<br/>
His shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains,<br/>
But he impervious and untouch'd remains.<br/>
(Great Neptune's care preserved from hostile rage<br/>
This youth, the joy of Nestor's glorious age.)<br/>
In arms intrepid, with the first he fought,<br/>
Faced every foe, and every danger sought;<br/>
His winged lance, resistless as the wind,<br/>
Obeys each motion of the master's mind!<br/>
Restless it flies, impatient to be free,<br/>
And meditates the distant enemy.<br/>
The son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,<br/>
And struck his target with the brazen spear<br/>
Fierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,<br/>
And blunts the javelin of th' eluded foe:<br/>
In the broad buckler half the weapon stood,<br/>
Splinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood.<br/>
Disarm'd, he mingled in the Trojan crew;<br/>
But Merion's spear o'ertook him as he flew,<br/>
Deep in the belly's rim an entrance found,<br/>
Where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.<br/>
Bending he fell, and doubled to the ground,<br/>
Lay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,<br/>
While death's strong pangs distend his labouring side,<br/>
His bulk enormous on the field displays;<br/>
His heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.<br/>
The spear the conqueror from his body drew,<br/>
And death's dim shadows swarm before his view.<br/>
Next brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:<br/>
King Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,<br/>
And smote his temples with an arm so strong,<br/>
The helm fell off, and roll'd amid the throng:<br/>
There for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;<br/>
For dark in death the godlike owner lies!<br/>
Raging with grief, great Menelaus burns,<br/>
And fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:<br/>
That shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;<br/>
And this stood adverse with the bended bow:<br/>
Full on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,<br/>
But harmless bounded from the plated steel.<br/>
As on some ample barn's well harden'd floor,<br/>
(The winds collected at each open door,)<br/>
While the broad fan with force is whirl'd around,<br/>
Light leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:<br/>
So from the steel that guards Atrides' heart,<br/>
Repell'd to distance flies the bounding dart.<br/>
Atrides, watchful of the unwary foe,<br/>
Pierced with his lance the hand that grasp'd the bow.<br/>
And nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand<br/>
Trail'd the long lance that mark'd with blood the sand:<br/>
But good Agenor gently from the wound<br/>
The spear solicits, and the bandage bound;<br/>
A sling's soft wool, snatch'd from a soldier's side,<br/>
At once the tent and ligature supplied.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Behold! Pisander, urged by fate's decree,<br/>
Springs through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,<br/>
Great Menelaus! to enchance thy fame:<br/>
High-towering in the front, the warrior came.<br/>
First the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown;<br/>
The lance far distant by the winds was blown.<br/>
Nor pierced Pisander through Atrides' shield:<br/>
Pisander's spear fell shiver'd on the field.<br/>
Not so discouraged, to the future blind,<br/>
Vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;<br/>
Dauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord<br/>
Like lightning brandish'd his far beaming sword.<br/>
His left arm high opposed the shining shield:<br/>
His right beneath, the cover'd pole-axe held;<br/>
(An olive's cloudy grain the handle made,<br/>
Distinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)<br/>
This on the helm discharged a noble blow;<br/>
The plume dropp'd nodding to the plain below,<br/>
Shorn from the crest. Atrides waved his steel:<br/>
Deep through his front the weighty falchion fell;<br/>
The crashing bones before its force gave way;<br/>
In dust and blood the groaning hero lay:<br/>
Forced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,<br/>
The clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.<br/>
And fierce Atrides spurn'd him as he bled,<br/>
Tore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;<br/>
O race perfidious, who delight in war!<br/>
Already noble deeds ye have perform'd;<br/>
A princess raped transcends a navy storm'd:<br/>
In such bold feats your impious might approve,<br/>
Without th' assistance, or the fear of Jove.<br/>
The violated rites, the ravish'd dame;<br/>
Our heroes slaughter'd and our ships on flame,<br/>
Crimes heap'd on crimes, shall bend your glory down,<br/>
And whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.<br/>
O thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,<br/>
Above the thought of man, supremely wise!<br/>
If from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,<br/>
From whence this favour to an impious foe?<br/>
A godless crew, abandon'd and unjust,<br/>
Still breathing rapine, violence, and lust?<br/>
The best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;<br/>
Sleep's balmy blessing, love's endearing joy;<br/>
The feast, the dance; whate'er mankind desire,<br/>
Even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.<br/>
But Troy for ever reaps a dire delight<br/>
In thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)<br/>
The bloody armour, which his train received:<br/>
Then sudden mix'd among the warring crew,<br/>
And the bold son of Pylaemenes slew.<br/>
Harpalion had through Asia travell'd far,<br/>
Following his martial father to the war:<br/>
Through filial love he left his native shore,<br/>
Never, ah, never to behold it more!<br/>
His unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling<br/>
Against the target of the Spartan king;<br/>
Thus of his lance disarm'd, from death he flies,<br/>
And turns around his apprehensive eyes.<br/>
Him, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,<br/>
The shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.<br/>
Beneath the bone the glancing point descends,<br/>
And, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:<br/>
Sunk in his sad companions' arms he lay,<br/>
And in short pantings sobb'd his soul away;<br/>
(Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)<br/>
While life's red torrent gush'd from out the wound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Him on his car the Paphlagonian train<br/>
In slow procession bore from off the plain.<br/>
The pensive father, father now no more!<br/>
Attends the mournful pomp along the shore;<br/>
And unavailing tears profusely shed;<br/>
And, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Paris from far the moving sight beheld,<br/>
With pity soften'd and with fury swell'd:<br/>
His honour'd host, a youth of matchless grace,<br/>
And loved of all the Paphlagonian race!<br/>
With his full strength he bent his angry bow,<br/>
And wing'd the feather'd vengeance at the foe.<br/>
A chief there was, the brave Euchenor named,<br/>
For riches much, and more for virtue famed.<br/>
Who held his seat in Corinth's stately town;<br/>
Polydus' son, a seer of old renown.<br/>
Oft had the father told his early doom,<br/>
By arms abroad, or slow disease at home:<br/>
He climb'd his vessel, prodigal of breath,<br/>
And chose the certain glorious path to death.<br/>
Beneath his ear the pointed arrow went;<br/>
The soul came issuing at the narrow vent:<br/>
His limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,<br/>
And everlasting darkness shades him round.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor knew great Hector how his legions yield,<br/>
(Wrapp'd in the cloud and tumult of the field:)<br/>
Wide on the left the force of Greece commands,<br/>
And conquest hovers o'er th' Achaian bands;<br/>
With such a tide superior virtue sway'd,<br/>
And he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.<br/>
But in the centre Hector fix'd remain'd,<br/>
Where first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain'd;<br/>
There, on the margin of the hoary deep,<br/>
(Their naval station where the Ajaces keep.<br/>
And where low walls confine the beating tides,<br/>
Whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides;<br/>
Where late in fight both foot and horse engaged,<br/>
And all the thunder of the battle raged,)<br/>
There join'd, the whole Boeotian strength remains,<br/>
The proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains,<br/>
Locrians and Phthians, and th' Epaean force;<br/>
But join'd, repel not Hector's fiery course.<br/>
The flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led;<br/>
Bias and great Menestheus at their head:<br/>
Meges the strong the Epaean bands controll'd,<br/>
And Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold:<br/>
The Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might,<br/>
And brave Podarces, active in the fight.<br/>
This drew from Phylacus his noble line;<br/>
Iphiclus' son: and that (Oileus) thine:<br/>
(Young Ajax' brother, by a stolen embrace;<br/>
He dwelt far distant from his native place,<br/>
By his fierce step-dame from his father's reign<br/>
Expell'd and exiled for her brother slain:)<br/>
These rule the Phthians, and their arms employ,<br/>
Mix'd with Boeotians, on the shores of Troy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now side by side, with like unwearied care,<br/>
Each Ajax laboured through the field of war:<br/>
So when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,<br/>
Force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,<br/>
Join'd to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,<br/>
And trace large furrows with the shining share;<br/>
O'er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,<br/>
And streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.<br/>
A train of heroes followed through the field,<br/>
Who bore by turns great Ajax' sevenfold shield;<br/>
Whene'er he breathed, remissive of his might,<br/>
Tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.<br/>
No following troops his brave associate grace:<br/>
In close engagement an unpractised race,<br/>
The Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,<br/>
Nor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;<br/>
But skill'd from far the flying shaft to wing,<br/>
Or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,<br/>
Dexterous with these they aim a certain wound,<br/>
Or fell the distant warrior to the ground.<br/>
Thus in the van the Telamonian train,<br/>
Throng'd in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:<br/>
Far in the rear the Locrian archers lie,<br/>
Whose stones and arrows intercept the sky,<br/>
The mingled tempest on the foes they pour;<br/>
Troy's scattering orders open to the shower.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now had the Greeks eternal fame acquired,<br/>
And the gall'd Ilians to their walls retired;<br/>
But sage Polydamas, discreetly brave,<br/>
Address'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Though great in all, thou seem'st averse to lend<br/>
Impartial audience to a faithful friend;<br/>
To gods and men thy matchless worth is known,<br/>
And every art of glorious war thy own;<br/>
But in cool thought and counsel to excel,<br/>
How widely differs this from warring well!<br/>
Content with what the bounteous gods have given,<br/>
Seek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven.<br/>
To some the powers of bloody war belong,<br/>
To some sweet music and the charm of song;<br/>
To few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign'd<br/>
A wise, extensive, all-considering mind;<br/>
Their guardians these, the nations round confess,<br/>
And towns and empires for their safety bless.<br/>
If Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,<br/>
Attend, O Hector! what I judge the best,<br/>
See, as thou mov'st, on dangers dangers spread,<br/>
And war's whole fury burns around thy head.<br/>
Behold! distress'd within yon hostile wall,<br/>
How many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!<br/>
What troops, out-number'd, scarce the war maintain!<br/>
And what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!<br/>
Here cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings<br/>
Convoked to council, weigh the sum of things.<br/>
Whether (the gods succeeding our desires)<br/>
To yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;<br/>
Or quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,<br/>
Contented with the conquest of the day.<br/>
I fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,<br/>
Pay the large debt of last revolving sun;<br/>
Achilles, great Achilles, yet remains<br/>
On yonder decks, and yet o'erlooks the plains!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,<br/>
Leap'd from his chariot on the trembling ground;<br/>
Swift as he leap'd his clanging arms resound.<br/>
"To guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,<br/>
And here detain the scatter'd youth of Troy;<br/>
Where yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,<br/>
And hasten back to end the doubtful day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, the towering chief prepares to go,<br/>
Shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,<br/>
And seems a moving mountain topp'd with snow.<br/>
Through all his host, inspiring force, he flies,<br/>
And bids anew the martial thunder rise.<br/>
To Panthus' son, at Hector's high command<br/>
Haste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:<br/>
But round the battlements, and round the plain,<br/>
For many a chief he look'd, but look'd in vain;<br/>
Deiphobus, nor Helenus the seer,<br/>
Nor Asius' son, nor Asius' self appear:<br/>
For these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,<br/>
Some cold in death, some groaning on the ground;<br/>
Some low in dust, (a mournful object) lay;<br/>
High on the wall some breathed their souls away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Far on the left, amid the throng he found<br/>
(Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around)<br/>
The graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved,<br/>
Opprobrious thus, th' impatient chief reproved:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankind,<br/>
As smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!<br/>
Where is Deiphobus, where Asius gone?<br/>
The godlike father, and th' intrepid son?<br/>
The force of Helenus, dispensing fate;<br/>
And great Othryoneus, so fear'd of late?<br/>
Black fate hang's o'er thee from th' avenging gods,<br/>
Imperial Troy from her foundations nods;<br/>
Whelm'd in thy country's ruin shalt thou fall,<br/>
And one devouring vengeance swallow all."<br/>
</p>
<p>
When Paris thus: "My brother and my friend,<br/>
Thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend,<br/>
In other battles I deserved thy blame,<br/>
Though then not deedless, nor unknown to fame:<br/>
But since yon rampart by thy arms lay low,<br/>
I scatter'd slaughter from my fatal bow.<br/>
The chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain;<br/>
Of all those heroes, two alone remain;<br/>
Deiphobus, and Helenus the seer,<br/>
Each now disabled by a hostile spear.<br/>
Go then, successful, where thy soul inspires:<br/>
This heart and hand shall second all thy fires:<br/>
What with this arm I can, prepare to know,<br/>
Till death for death be paid, and blow for blow.<br/>
But 'tis not ours, with forces not our own<br/>
To combat: strength is of the gods alone."<br/>
These words the hero's angry mind assuage:<br/>
Then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage.<br/>
Around Polydamas, distain'd with blood,<br/>
Cebrion, Phalces, stern Orthaeus stood,<br/>
Palmus, with Polypoetes the divine,<br/>
And two bold brothers of Hippotion's line<br/>
(Who reach'd fair Ilion, from Ascania far,<br/>
The former day; the next engaged in war).<br/>
As when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs,<br/>
That bears Jove's thunder on its dreadful wings,<br/>
Wide o'er the blasted fields the tempest sweeps;<br/>
Then, gather'd, settles on the hoary deeps;<br/>
The afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar;<br/>
The waves behind impel the waves before,<br/>
Wide rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the shore:<br/>
Thus rank on rank, the thick battalions throng,<br/>
Chief urged on chief, and man drove man along.<br/>
Far o'er the plains, in dreadful order bright,<br/>
The brazen arms reflect a beamy light:<br/>
Full in the blazing van great Hector shined,<br/>
Like Mars commission'd to confound mankind.<br/>
Before him flaming his enormous shield,<br/>
Like the broad sun, illumined all the field;<br/>
His nodding helm emits a streamy ray;<br/>
His piercing eyes through all the battle stray,<br/>
And, while beneath his targe he flash'd along,<br/>
Shot terrors round, that wither'd e'en the strong.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus stalk'd he, dreadful; death was in his look:<br/>
Whole nations fear'd; but not an Argive shook.<br/>
The towering Ajax, with an ample stride,<br/>
Advanced the first, and thus the chief defied:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hector! come on; thy empty threats forbear;<br/>
'Tis not thy arm, 'tis thundering Jove we fear:<br/>
The skill of war to us not idly given,<br/>
Lo! Greece is humbled, not by Troy, but Heaven.<br/>
Vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts,<br/>
To force our fleet: the Greeks have hands and hearts.<br/>
Long ere in flames our lofty navy fall,<br/>
Your boasted city, and your god-built wall,<br/>
Shall sink beneath us, smoking on the ground;<br/>
And spread a long unmeasured ruin round.<br/>
The time shall come, when, chased along the plain,<br/>
Even thou shalt call on Jove, and call in vain;<br/>
Even thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course,<br/>
The wings of falcons for thy flying horse;<br/>
Shalt run, forgetful of a warrior's fame,<br/>
While clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame."<br/>
</p>
<p>
As thus he spoke, behold, in open view,<br/>
On sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.<br/>
To Jove's glad omen all the Grecians rise,<br/>
And hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies:<br/>
Far-echoing clamours bound from side to side;<br/>
They ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"From whence this menace, this insulting strain?<br/>
Enormous boaster! doom'd to vaunt in vain.<br/>
So may the gods on Hector life bestow,<br/>
(Not that short life which mortals lead below,<br/>
But such as those of Jove's high lineage born,<br/>
The blue-eyed maid, or he that gilds the morn,)<br/>
As this decisive day shall end the fame<br/>
Of Greece, and Argos be no more a name.<br/>
And thou, imperious! if thy madness wait<br/>
The lance of Hector, thou shalt meet thy fate:<br/>
That giant-corse, extended on the shore,<br/>
Shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; and like a lion stalk'd along:<br/>
With shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,<br/>
Sent from his following host: the Grecian train<br/>
With answering thunders fill'd the echoing plain;<br/>
A shout that tore heaven's concave, and, above,<br/>
Shook the fix'd splendours of the throne of Jove.<br/>

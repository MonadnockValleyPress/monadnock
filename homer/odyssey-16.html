<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XVI</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Soon as the morning blush'd along the plains,<br/>
Ulysses, and the monarch of the swains,<br/>
Awake the sleeping fires, their meals prepare,<br/>
And forth to pasture send the bristly care.<br/>
The prince's near approach the dogs descry,<br/>
And fawning round his feet confess their joy.<br/>
Their gentle blandishment the king survey'd,<br/>
Heard his resounding step, and instant said:
</p>
<p>
"Some well-known friend, Eumaeus, bends this way;<br/>
His steps I hear; the dogs familiar play."
</p>
<p>
While yet he spoke, the prince advancing drew<br/>
Nigh to the lodge, and now appear'd in view.<br/>
Transported from his seat Eumaeus sprung,<br/>
Dropp'd the full bowl, and round his bosom hung;<br/>
Kissing his cheek, his hand, while from his eye<br/>
The tears rain'd copious in a shower of joy,<br/>
As some fond sire who ten long winters grieves,<br/>
From foreign climes an only son receives<br/>
(Child of his age), with strong paternal joy,<br/>
Forward he springs, and clasps the favourite boy:<br/>
So round the youth his arms Eumaeus spread,<br/>
As if the grave had given him from the dead.
</p>
<p>
"And is it thou? my ever-dear delight!<br/>
Oh, art thou come to bless my longing sight?<br/>
Never, I never hoped to view this day,<br/>
When o'er the waves you plough'd the desperate way.<br/>
Enter, my child! Beyond my hopes restored,<br/>
Oh give these eyes to feast upon their lord.<br/>
Enter, oh seldom seen! for lawless powers<br/>
Too much detain thee from these sylvan bowers,"<br/>
The prince replied: "Eumaeus, I obey;<br/>
To seek thee, friend, I hither took my way.<br/>
But say, if in the court the queen reside<br/>
Severely chaste, or if commenced a bride?"
</p>
<p>
Thus he; and thus the monarch of the swains:<br/>
"Severely chaste Penelope remains;<br/>
But, lost to every joy, she wastes the day<br/>
In tedious cares, and weeps the night away."
</p>
<p>
He ended, and (receiving as they pass<br/>
The javelin pointed with a star of brass),<br/>
They reach'd the dome; the dome with marble shined.<br/>
His seat Ulysses to the prince resign'd.<br/>
"Not so (exclaims the prince with decent grace)<br/>
For me, this house shall find an humbler place:<br/>
To usurp the honours due to silver hairs<br/>
And reverend strangers modest youth forbears."<br/>
Instant the swain the spoils of beasts supplies,<br/>
And bids the rural throne with osiers rise.<br/>
There sate the prince: the feast Eumaeus spread,<br/>
And heap'd the shining canisters with bread.<br/>
Thick o'er the board the plenteous viands lay,<br/>
The frugal remnants of the former day.<br/>
Then in a bowl he tempers generous wines,<br/>
Around whose verge a mimic ivy twines.<br/>
And now, the rage of thirst and hunger fled,<br/>
Thus young Ulysses to Eumaeus said:
</p>
<p>
"Whence, father, from what shore this stranger, say?<br/>
What vessel bore him o'er the watery way?<br/>
To human step our land impervious lies,<br/>
And round the coast circumfluent oceans rise."
</p>
<p>
The swain returns: "A tale of sorrows hear:<br/>
In spacious Crete he drew his natal air;<br/>
Long doom'd to wander o'er the land and main,<br/>
For Heaven has wove his thread of life with pain.<br/>
Half breathless 'scaping to the land he flew<br/>
From Thesprot mariners, a murderous crew.<br/>
To thee, my son, the suppliant I resign;<br/>
I gave him my protection, grant him thine."
</p>
<p>
"Hard task (he cries) thy virtue gives thy friend,<br/>
Willing to aid, unable to defend.<br/>
Can strangers safely in the court reside,<br/>
'Midst the swell'd insolence of lust and pride?<br/>
E'en I unsafe: the queen in doubt to wed,<br/>
Or pay due honours to the nuptial bed.<br/>
Perhaps she weds regardless of her fame,<br/>
Deaf to the mighty Ulyssean name.<br/>
However, stranger! from our grace receive<br/>
Such honours as befit a prince to give;<br/>
Sandals, a sword and robes, respect to prove,<br/>
And safe to sail with ornaments of love.<br/>
Till then, thy guest amid the rural train,<br/>
Far from the court, from danger far, detain.<br/>
'Tis mine with food the hungry to supply,<br/>
And clothe the naked from the inclement sky.<br/>
Here dwell in safety from the suitors' wrongs,<br/>
And the rude insults of ungovern'd tongues.<br/>
For should'st thou suffer, powerless to relieve,<br/>
I must behold it, and can only grieve.<br/>
The brave, encompass'd by an hostile train,<br/>
O'erpower'd by numbers, is but brave in vain."
</p>
<p>
To whom, while anger in his bosom glows,<br/>
With warmth replies the man of mighty woes:<br/>
"Since audience mild is deign'd, permit my tongue<br/>
At once to pity and resent thy wrong.<br/>
My heart weeps blood to see a soul so brave<br/>
Live to base insolence or power a slave,<br/>
But tell me, dost thou, prince, dost thou behold,<br/>
And hear their midnight revels uncontroll'd?<br/>
Say, do thy subjects in bold faction rise,<br/>
Or priests in fabled oracles advise?<br/>
Or are thy brothers, who should aid thy power,<br/>
Turn'd mean deserters in the needful hour?<br/>
Oh that I were from great Ulysses sprung,<br/>
Or that these wither'd nerves like thine were strung,<br/>
Or, heavens! might he return! (and soon appear<br/>
He shall, I trust; a hero scorns despair:)<br/>
Might he return, I yield my life a prey<br/>
To my worst foe, if that avenging day<br/>
Be not their last: but should I lose my life,<br/>
Oppress'd by numbers in the glorious strife,<br/>
I chose the nobler part, and yield my breath,<br/>
Rather than bear dishonor, worse than death;<br/>
Than see the hand of violence invade<br/>
The reverend stranger and the spotless maid;<br/>
Than see the wealth of kings consumed in waste,<br/>
The drunkard's revel, and the gluttons' feast."
</p>
<p>
Thus he, with anger flashing from his eye;<br/>
Sincere the youthful hero made reply:<br/>
"Nor leagued in factious arms my subjects rise,<br/>
Nor priests in fabled oracles advise;<br/>
Nor are my brothers, who should aid my power,<br/>
Turn'd mean deserters in the needful hour.<br/>
Ah me! I boast no brother; heaven's dread King<br/>
Gives from our stock an only branch to spring:<br/>
Alone Laertes reign'd Arcesius' heir,<br/>
Alone Ulysses drew the vital air,<br/>
And I alone the bed connubial graced,<br/>
An unbless'd offspring of a sire unbless'd!<br/>
Each neighbouring realm, conducive to our woe,<br/>
Sends forth her peers, and every peer a foe:<br/>
The court proud Samos and Dulichium fills,<br/>
And lofty Zacinth crown'd with shady hills.<br/>
E'en Ithaca and all her lords invade<br/>
The imperial sceptre, and the regal bed:<br/>
The queen, averse to love, yet awed by power,<br/>
Seems half to yield, yet flies the bridal hour:<br/>
Meantime their licence uncontroll'd I bear;<br/>
E'en now they envy me the vital air:<br/>
But Heaven will sure revenge, and gods there are.
</p>
<p>
"But go Eumaeus! to the queen impart<br/>
Our safe return, and ease a mother's heart.<br/>
Yet secret go; for numerous are my foes,<br/>
And here at least I may in peace repose."
</p>
<p>
To whom the swain: "I hear and I obey:<br/>
But old Laertes weeps his life away,<br/>
And deems thee lost: shall I my speed employ<br/>
To bless his age: a messenger of joy?<br/>
The mournful hour that tore his son away<br/>
Sent the sad sire in solitude to stray;<br/>
Yet busied with his slaves, to ease his woe,<br/>
He dress'd the vine, and bade the garden blow,<br/>
Nor food nor wine refused; but since the day<br/>
That you to Pylos plough'd the watery way,<br/>
Nor wine nor food he tastes; but, sunk in woes,<br/>
Wild springs the vine, no more the garden blows,<br/>
Shut from the walks of men, to pleasure lost,<br/>
Pensive and pale he wanders half a ghost."
</p>
<p>
"Wretched old man! (with tears the prince returns)<br/>
Yet cease to go&mdash;what man so blest but mourns?<br/>
Were every wish indulged by favouring skies,<br/>
This hour should give Ulysses to my eyes.<br/>
But to the queen with speed dispatchful bear,<br/>
Our safe return, and back with speed repair;<br/>
And let some handmaid of her train resort<br/>
To good Laertes in his rural court."
</p>
<p>
While yet he spoke, impatient of delay,<br/>
He braced his sandals on, and strode away:<br/>
Then from the heavens the martial goddess flies<br/>
Through the wild fields of air, and cleaves the skies:<br/>
In form, a virgin in soft beauty's bloom,<br/>
Skill'd in the illustrious labours of the loom.<br/>
Alone to Ithaca she stood display'd,<br/>
But unapparent as a viewless shade<br/>
Escaped Telemachus (the powers above,<br/>
Seen or unseen, o'er earth at pleasure move):<br/>
The dogs intelligent confess'd the tread<br/>
Of power divine, and howling, trembling, fled.<br/>
The goddess, beckoning, waves her deathless hands:<br/>
Dauntless the king before the goddess stands:
</p>
<p>
"Then why (she said), O favour'd of the skies!<br/>
Why to thy godlike son this long disguise?<br/>
Stand forth reveal'd; with him thy cares employ<br/>
Against thy foes; be valiant and destroy!<br/>
Lo! I descend in that avenging hour,<br/>
To combat by thy side, thy guardian power."
</p>
<p>
She said, and o'er him waves her wand of gold<br/>
Imperial robes his manly limbs infold;<br/>
At once with grace divine his frame improves;<br/>
At once with majesty enlarged he moves:<br/>
Youth flush'd his reddening cheek, and from his brows<br/>
A length of hair in sable ringlets flows;<br/>
His blackening chin receives a deeper shade;<br/>
Then from his eyes upsprung the warrior-maid.
</p>
<p>
The hero reascends: the prince o'erawed<br/>
Scarce lifts his eyes, and bows as to a god,<br/>
Then with surprise (surprise chastised by fears):<br/>
"How art thou changed! (he cried)&mdash;a god appears!<br/>
Far other vests thy limbs majestic grace,<br/>
Far other glories lighten from thy face!<br/>
If heaven be thy abode, with pious care,<br/>
Lo! I the ready sacrifice prepare:<br/>
Lo! gifts of labour'd gold adorn thy shrine,<br/>
To win thy grace: O save us, power divine!"
</p>
<p>
"Few are my days (Ulysses made reply),<br/>
Nor I, alas! descendant of the sky.<br/>
I am thy father. O my son! my son!<br/>
That father, for whose sake thy days have run<br/>
One scene of woe! to endless cares consign'd,<br/>
And outraged by the wrongs of base mankind."
</p>
<p>
Then, rushing to his arms, he kiss'd his boy<br/>
With the strong raptures of a parent's joy.<br/>
Tears bathe his cheek, and tears the ground bedew:<br/>
He strain'd him close, as to his breast he grew.<br/>
"Ah me! (exclaims the prince with fond desire)<br/>
Thou art not&mdash;no, thou canst not be my sire.<br/>
Heaven such illusion only can impose,<br/>
By the false joy to aggravate my woes.<br/>
Who but a god can change the general doom,<br/>
And give to wither'd age a youthful bloom!<br/>
Late, worn with years, in weeds obscene you trod;<br/>
Now, clothed in majesty, you move a god!"
</p>
<p>
"Forbear (he cried,) for Heaven reserve that name;<br/>
Give to thy father but a father's claim;<br/>
Other Ulysses shalt thou never see,<br/>
I am Ulysses, I, my son, am he.<br/>
Twice ten sad years o'er earth and ocean toss'd,<br/>
'Tis given at length to view my native coast.<br/>
Pallas, unconquer'd maid, my frame surrounds<br/>
With grace divine: her power admits no bounds;<br/>
She o'er my limbs old age and wrinkles shed;<br/>
Now strong as youth, magnificent I tread.<br/>
The gods with ease frail man depress or raise,<br/>
Exalt the lowly, or the proud debase."
</p>
<p>
He spoke and sate. The prince with transport flew,<br/>
Hung round his neck, while tears his cheek bedew;<br/>
Nor less the father pour'd a social flood;<br/>
They wept abundant, and they wept aloud.<br/>
As the bold eagle with fierce sorrow stung,<br/>
Or parent vulture, mourns her ravish'd young;<br/>
They cry, they scream, their unfledged brood a prey<br/>
To some rude churl, and borne by stealth away:<br/>
So they aloud: and tears in tides had run,<br/>
Their grief unfinish'd with the setting sun;<br/>
But checking the full torrent in its flow,<br/>
The prince thus interrupts the solemn woe.<br/>
"What ship transported thee, O father, say;<br/>
And what bless'd hands have oar'd thee on the way?"
</p>
<p>
"All, all (Ulysses instant made reply),<br/>
I tell thee all, my child, my only joy!<br/>
Phæacians bore me to the port assign'd,<br/>
A nation ever to the stranger kind;<br/>
Wrapp'd in the embrace of sleep, the faithful train<br/>
O'er seas convey'd me to my native reign:<br/>
Embroider'd vestures, gold, and brass, are laid<br/>
Conceal'd in caverns in the sylvan shade.<br/>
Hither, intent the rival rout to slay,<br/>
And plan the scene of death, I bend my way;<br/>
So Pallas wills&mdash;but thou, my son, explain<br/>
The names and numbers of the audacious train;<br/>
'Tis mine to judge if better to employ<br/>
Assistant force, or singly to destroy."
</p>
<p>
"O'er earth (returns the prince) resounds thy name,<br/>
Thy well-tried wisdom, and thy martial fame,<br/>
Yet at thy words I start, in wonder lost;<br/>
Can we engage, not decades but an host?<br/>
Can we alone in furious battle stand,<br/>
Against that numerous and determined band?<br/>
Hear then their numbers; from Dulichium came<br/>
Twice twenty-six, all peers of mighty name.<br/>
Six are their menial train: twice twelve the boast<br/>
Of Samos; twenty from Zacynthus' coast:<br/>
And twelve our country's pride; to these belong<br/>
Medon and Phemius, skill'd in heavenly song.<br/>
Two sewers from day to day the revels wait,<br/>
Exact of taste, and serve the feast in state.<br/>
With such a foe the unequal fight to try,<br/>
Were by false courage unrevenged to die.<br/>
Then what assistant powers you boast relate,<br/>
Ere yet we mingle in the stern debate."
</p>
<p>
"Mark well my voice, (Ulysses straight replies:)<br/>
What need of aids, if favour'd by the skies?<br/>
If shielded to the dreadful fight we move,<br/>
By mighty Pallas, and by thundering Jove?"
</p>
<p>
"Sufficient they (Telemachus rejoin'd)<br/>
Against the banded powers of all mankind:<br/>
They, high enthroned above the rolling clouds,<br/>
Wither the strength of man, and awe the gods."
</p>
<p>
"Such aids expect (he cries,) when strong in might<br/>
We rise terrific to the task of fight.<br/>
But thou, when morn salutes the aërial plain,<br/>
The court revisit and the lawless train:<br/>
Me thither in disguise Eumaeus leads,<br/>
An aged mendicant in tatter'd weeds.<br/>
There, if base scorn insult my reverend age,<br/>
Bear it, my son! repress thy rising rage.<br/>
If outraged, cease that outrage to repel;<br/>
Bear it, my son! howe'er thy heart rebel.<br/>
Yet strive by prayer and counsel to restrain<br/>
Their lawless insults, though thou strive in vain:<br/>
For wicked ears are deaf to wisdom's call,<br/>
And vengeance strikes whom Heaven has doom'd to fall.<br/>
Once more attend: when she whose power inspires<br/>
The thinking mind, my soul to vengeance fires,<br/>
I give the sign: that instant, from beneath,<br/>
Aloft convey the instruments of death,<br/>
Armour and arms; and, if mistrust arise,<br/>
Thus veil the truth in plausible disguise:
</p>
<p>
"'These glittering weapons, ere he sail'd to Troy,<br/>
Ulysses view'd with stern heroic joy:<br/>
Then, beaming o'er the illumined wall they shone;<br/>
Now dust dishonours, all their lustre gone.<br/>
I bear them hence (so Jove my soul inspires),<br/>
From the pollution of the fuming fires;<br/>
Lest when the bowl inflames, in vengeful mood<br/>
Ye rush to arms, and stain the feast with blood:<br/>
Oft ready swords in luckless hour incite<br/>
The hand of wrath, and arm it for the fight.'
</p>
<p>
"Such be the plea, and by the plea deceive:<br/>
For Jove infatuates all, and all believe.<br/>
Yet leave for each of us a sword to wield,<br/>
A pointed javelin, and a fenceful shield.<br/>
But by my blood that in thy bosom glows,<br/>
By that regard a son his father owes;<br/>
The secret, that thy father lives, retain<br/>
Lock'd in thy bosom from the household train;<br/>
Hide it from all; e'en from Eumaeus hide,<br/>
From my dear father, and my dearer bride.<br/>
One care remains, to note the loyal few<br/>
Whose faith yet lasts among the menial crew;<br/>
And noting, ere we rise in vengeance, prove<br/>
Who love his prince; for sure you merit love."
</p>
<p>
To whom the youth: "To emulate, I aim,<br/>
The brave and wise, and my great father's fame.<br/>
But reconsider, since the wisest err,<br/>
Vengeance resolved, 'tis dangerous to defer.<br/>
What length of time must we consume in vain,<br/>
Too curious to explore the menial train!<br/>
While the proud foes, industrious to destroy<br/>
Thy wealth, in riot the delay enjoy.<br/>
Suffice it in this exigence alone<br/>
To mark the damsels that attend the throne:<br/>
Dispersed the youth reside; their faith to prove<br/>
Jove grants henceforth, if thou hast spoke from Jove."
</p>
<p>
While in debate they waste the hours away,<br/>
The associates of the prince repass'd the bay:<br/>
With speed they guide the vessel to the shores;<br/>
With speed debarking land the naval stores:<br/>
Then, faithful to their charge, to Clytius bear,<br/>
And trust the presents to his friendly care.<br/>
Swift to the queen a herald flies to impart<br/>
Her son's return, and ease a parent's heart:<br/>
Lest a sad prey to ever-musing cares,<br/>
Pale grief destroy what time awhile forbears.<br/>
The incautious herald with impatience burns,<br/>
And cries aloud, "Thy son, O queen, returns;"<br/>
Eumaeus sage approach'd the imperial throne,<br/>
And breathed his mandate to her ear alone,<br/>
Then measured back the way. The suitor band,<br/>
Stung to the soul, abash'd, confounded, stand;<br/>
And issuing from the dome, before the gate,<br/>
With clouded looks, a pale assembly sate.
</p>
<p>
At length Eurymachus: "Our hopes are vain;<br/>
Telemachus in triumph sails the main.<br/>
Haste, rear the mast, the swelling shroud display;<br/>
Haste, to our ambush'd friends the news convey!"
</p>
<p>
Scarce had he spake, when, turning to the strand,<br/>
Amphinomus survey'd the associate band;<br/>
Full to the bay within the winding shores<br/>
With gather'd sails they stood, and lifted oars.<br/>
"O friends!" he cried, elate with rising joy,<br/>
"See to the port secure the vessel fly!<br/>
Some god has told them, or themselves survey<br/>
The bark escaped; and measure back their way."
</p>
<p>
Swift at the word descending to the shores,<br/>
They moor the vessel and unlade the stores:<br/>
Then, moving from the strand, apart they sate,<br/>
And full and frequent form'd a dire debate.
</p>
<p>
"Lives then the boy? he lives (Antinous cries),<br/>
The care of gods and favourite of the skies.<br/>
All night we watch'd, till with her orient wheels<br/>
Aurora flamed above the eastern hills,<br/>
And from the lofty brow of rocks by day<br/>
Took in the ocean with a broad survey<br/>
Yet safe he sails; the powers celestial give<br/>
To shun the hidden snares of death, and live.<br/>
But die he shall, and thus condemn'd to bleed,<br/>
Be now the scene of instant death decreed.<br/>
Hope ye success? undaunted crush the foe.<br/>
Is he not wise? know this, and strike the blow.<br/>
Wait ye, till he to arms in council draws<br/>
The Greeks, averse too justly to our cause?<br/>
Strike, ere, the states convened, the foe betray<br/>
Our murderous ambush on the watery way.<br/>
Or choose ye vagrant from their rage to fly,<br/>
Outcasts of earth, to breathe an unknown sky?<br/>
The brave prevent misfortune; then be brave,<br/>
And bury future danger in his grave.<br/>
Returns he? ambush'd we'll his walk invade,<br/>
Or where he hides in solitude and shade;<br/>
And give the palace to the queen a dower,<br/>
Or him she blesses in the bridal hour.<br/>
But if submissive you resign the sway,<br/>
Slaves to a boy, go, flatter and obey.<br/>
Retire we instant to our native reign,<br/>
Nor be the wealth of kings consumed in vain;<br/>
Then wed whom choice approves: the queen be given<br/>
To some blest prince, the prince decreed by Heaven."
</p>
<p>
Abash'd, the suitor train his voice attends;<br/>
Till from his throne Amphinomus ascends,<br/>
Who o'er Dulichium stretch'd his spacious reign,<br/>
A land of plenty, bless'd with every grain:<br/>
Chief of the numbers who the queen address'd,<br/>
And though displeasing, yet displeasing least.<br/>
Soft were his words; his actions wisdom sway'd;<br/>
Graceful awhile he paused, then mildly said:
</p>
<p>
"O friends, forbear! and be the thought withstood:<br/>
'Tis horrible to shed imperial blood!<br/>
Consult we first the all-seeing powers above,<br/>
And the sure oracles of righteous Jove.<br/>
If they assent, e'en by this hand he dies;<br/>
If they forbid, I war not with the skies."
</p>
<p>
He said: the rival train his voice approved,<br/>
And rising instant to the palace moved.<br/>
Arrived, with wild tumultuous noise they sate,<br/>
Recumbent on the shining thrones of state.
</p>
<p>
Then Medon, conscious of their dire debates,<br/>
The murderous counsel to the queen relates.<br/>
Touch'd at the dreadful story, she descends:<br/>
Her hasty steps a damsel train attends.<br/>
Full where the dome its shining valves expands,<br/>
Sudden before the rival powers she stands;<br/>
And, veiling, decent, with a modest shade<br/>
Her cheek, indignant to Antinous said:
</p>
<p>
"O void of faith! of all bad men the worst!<br/>
Renown'd for wisdom, by the abuse accursed!<br/>
Mistaking fame proclaims thy generous mind:<br/>
Thy deeds denote thee of the basest kind.<br/>
Wretch! to destroy a prince that friendship gives,<br/>
While in his guest his murderer he receives;<br/>
Nor dread superior Jove, to whom belong<br/>
The cause of suppliants, and revenge of wrong.<br/>
Hast thou forgot, ungrateful as thou art,<br/>
Who saved thy father with a friendly part?<br/>
Lawless he ravaged with his martial powers<br/>
The Taphian pirates on Thesprotia's shores;<br/>
Enraged, his life, his treasures they demand;<br/>
Ulysses saved him from the avenger's hand.<br/>
And would'st thou evil for his good repay?<br/>
His bed dishonour, and his house betray?<br/>
Afflict his queen, and with a murderous hand<br/>
Destroy his heir!&mdash;but cease, 'tis I command."
</p>
<p>
"Far hence those fears (Eurymachus replied,)<br/>
O prudent princess! bid thy soul confide.<br/>
Breathes there a man who dares that hero slay,<br/>
While I behold the golden light of day?<br/>
No: by the righteous powers of heaven I swear,<br/>
His blood in vengeance smokes upon my spear.<br/>
Ulysses, when my infant days I led,<br/>
With wine sufficed me, and with dainties fed:<br/>
My generous soul abhors the ungrateful part,<br/>
And my friend's son lives nearest to my heart.<br/>
Then fear no mortal arm; if Heaven destroy,<br/>
We must resign: for man is born to die."
</p>
<p>
Thus smooth he ended, yet his death conspired:<br/>
Then sorrowing, with sad step the queen retired,<br/>
With streaming eyes, all comfortless deplored,<br/>
Touch'd with the dear remembrance of her lord:<br/>
Nor ceased till Pallas bids her sorrows fly,<br/>
And in soft slumber seal'd her flowing eye.
</p>
<p>
And now Eumaeus, at the evening hour,<br/>
Came late, returning to his sylvan bower.<br/>
Ulysses and his son had dress'd with art<br/>
A yearling boar, and gave the gods their part.<br/>
Holy repast! That instant from the skies<br/>
The martial goddess to Ulysses flies:<br/>
She waves her golden wand, and reassumes<br/>
From every feature every grace that blooms;<br/>
At once his vestures change; at once she sheds<br/>
Age o'er his limbs, that tremble as he treads:<br/>
Lest to the queen the swain with transport fly,<br/>
Unable to contain the unruly joy;<br/>
When near he drew, the prince breaks forth: "Proclaim<br/>
What tidings, friend? what speaks the voice of fame?<br/>
Say, if the suitors measure back the main,<br/>
Or still in ambush thirst for blood in vain?"
</p>
<p>
"Whether (he cries) they measure back the flood,<br/>
Or still in ambush thirst in vain for blood,<br/>
Escaped my care: where lawless suitors sway,<br/>
Thy mandate borne my soul disdain'd to stay.<br/>
But from the Hermaean height I cast a view,<br/>
Where to the port a bark high-bounding flew;<br/>
Her freight a shining band: with martial air<br/>
Each poised his shield, and each advanced his spear;<br/>
And, if aright these searching eyes survey,<br/>
The eluded suitors stem the watery way."
</p>
<p>
The prince, well pleased to disappoint their wiles,<br/>
Steals on his sire a glance, and secret smiles.<br/>
And now, a short repast prepared, they fed<br/>
Till the keen rage of craving hunger fled:<br/>
Then to repose withdrawn, apart they lay,<br/>
And in soft sleep forgot the cares of day.

<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
"Thus o'er the rolling surge the vessel flies,<br/>
Till from the waves the Ææan hills arise.<br/>
Here the gay Morn resides in radiant bowers,<br/>
Here keeps her revels with the dancing Hours;<br/>
Here Phœbus, rising in the ethereal way,<br/>
Through heaven's bright portals pours the beamy day.<br/>
At once we fix our halsers on the land.<br/>
At once descend, and press the desert sand:<br/>
There, worn and wasted, lose our cares in sleep,<br/>
To the hoarse murmurs of the rolling deep.
</p>
<p>
"Soon as the morn restored the day, we paid<br/>
Sepulchral honours to Elpenor's shade.<br/>
Now by the axe the rushing forest bends,<br/>
And the huge pile along the shore ascends.<br/>
Around we stand, a melancholy train,<br/>
And a loud groan re-echoes from the main.<br/>
Fierce o'er the pyre, by fanning breezes spread,<br/>
The hungry flames devour the silent dead.<br/>
A rising tomb, the silent dead to grace,<br/>
Fast by the roarings of the main we place;<br/>
The rising tomb a lofty column bore,<br/>
And high above it rose the tapering oar.
</p>
<p>
"Meantime the goddess our return survey'd<br/>
From the pale ghosts and hell's tremendous shade.<br/>
Swift she descends: a train of nymphs divine<br/>
Bear the rich viands and the generous wine:<br/>
In act to speak the power of magic stands,<br/>
And graceful thus accosts the listening bands;
</p>
<p>
"'O sons of woe? decreed by adverse fates<br/>
Alive to pass through hell's eternal gates!<br/>
All, soon or late, are doom'd that path to tread;<br/>
More wretched you! twice number'd with the dead!<br/>
This day adjourn your cares, exalt your souls,<br/>
Indulge the taste, and drain the sparkling bowls;<br/>
And when the morn unveils her saffron ray,<br/>
Spread your broad sails, and plough the liquid way:<br/>
Lo, I this night, your faithful guide, explain<br/>
Your woes by land, your dangers on the main.'
</p>
<p>
"The goddess spoke. In feasts we waste the day,<br/>
Till Phœbus downward plunged his burning ray;<br/>
Then sable night ascends, and balmy rest<br/>
Seals every eye, and calms the troubled breast.<br/>
Then curious she commands me to relate<br/>
The dreadful scenes of Pluto's dreary state.<br/>
She sat in silence while the tale I tell,<br/>
The wondrous visions and the laws of hell.
</p>
<p>
"Then thus: 'The lot of man the gods dispose;<br/>
These ills are past: now hear thy future woes<br/>
O prince attend; some favouring power be kind,<br/>
And print the important story on thy mind!
</p>
<p>
"'Next, where the Sirens dwell, you plough the seas;<br/>
Their song is death, and makes destruction please.<br/>
Unblest the man, whom music wins to stay<br/>
Nigh the cursed shore and listen to the lay.<br/>
No more that wretch shall view the joys of life<br/>
His blooming offspring, or his beauteous wife!<br/>
In verdant meads they sport; and wide around<br/>
Lie human bones that whiten all the ground:<br/>
The ground polluted floats with human gore,<br/>
And human carnage taints the dreadful shore<br/>
Fly swift the dangerous coast: let every ear<br/>
Be stopp'd against the song! 'tis death to hear!<br/>
Firm to the mast with chains thyself be bound,<br/>
Nor trust thy virtue to the enchanting sound.<br/>
If, mad with transport, freedom thou demand,<br/>
Be every fetter strain'd, and added band to band.
</p>
<p>
"'These seas o'erpass'd, be wise! but I refrain<br/>
To mark distinct thy voyage o'er the main:<br/>
New horrors rise! let prudence be thy guide,<br/>
And guard thy various passage through the tide.
</p>
<p>
"'High o'er the main two rocks exalt their brow,'<br/>
The boiling billows thundering roll below;<br/>
Through the vast waves the dreadful wonders move,<br/>
Hence named Erratic by the gods above.<br/>
No bird of air, no dove of swiftest wing,<br/>
That bears ambrosia to the ethereal king,<br/>
Shuns the dire rocks: in vain she cuts the skies;<br/>
The dire rocks meet, and crush her as she flies:<br/>
Not the fleet bark, when prosperous breezes play,<br/>
Ploughs o'er that roaring surge its desperate way;<br/>
O'erwhelm'd it sinks: while round a smoke expires,<br/>
And the waves flashing seem to burn with fires.<br/>
Scarce the famed Argo pass'd these raging floods,<br/>
The sacred Argo, fill'd with demigods!<br/>
E'en she had sunk, but Jove's imperial bride<br/>
Wing'd her fleet sail, and push'd her o'er the tide.
</p>
<p>
"'High in the air the rock its summit shrouds<br/>
In brooding tempests, and in rolling clouds;<br/>
Loud storms around, and mists eternal rise,<br/>
Beat its bleak brow, and intercept the skies.<br/>
When all the broad expansion, bright with day,<br/>
Glows with the autumnal or the summer ray,<br/>
The summer and the autumn glow in vain,<br/>
The sky for ever lowers, for ever clouds remain.<br/>
Impervious to the step of man it stands,<br/>
Though borne by twenty feet, though arm'd with twenty hands;<br/>
Smooth as the polish of the mirror rise<br/>
The slippery sides, and shoot into the skies.<br/>
Full in the centre of this rock display'd,<br/>
A yawning cavern casts a dreadful shade:<br/>
Nor the fleet arrow from the twanging bow,<br/>
Sent with full force, could reach the depth below.<br/>
Wide to the west the horrid gulf extends,<br/>
And the dire passage down to hell descends.<br/>
O fly the dreadful sight! expand thy sails,<br/>
Ply the strong oar, and catch the nimble gales;<br/>
Here Scylla bellows from the dire abodes,<br/>
Tremendous pest, abhorr'd by man and gods!<br/>
Hideous her voice, and with less terrors roar<br/>
The whelps of lions in the midnight hour.<br/>
Twelve feet, deform'd and foul, the fiend dispreads;<br/>
Six horrid necks she rears, and six terrific heads;<br/>
Her jaws grin dreadful with three rows of teeth;<br/>
Jaggy they stand, the gaping den of death;<br/>
Her parts obscene the raging billows hide;<br/>
Her bosom terribly o'erlooks the tide.<br/>
When stung with hunger she embroils the flood,<br/>
The sea-dog and the dolphin are her food;<br/>
She makes the huge leviathan her prey,<br/>
And all the monsters of the watery way;<br/>
The swiftest racer of the azure plain<br/>
Here fills her sails, and spreads her oars in vain;<br/>
Fell Scylla rises, in her fury roars,<br/>
At once six mouths expands, at once six men devours.
</p>
<p>
"'Close by, a rock of less enormous height<br/>
Breaks the wild waves, and forms a dangerous strait;<br/>
Full on its crown a fig's green branches rise,<br/>
And shoot a leafy forest to the skies;<br/>
Beneath, Charybdis holds her boisterous reign<br/>
'Midst roaring whirlpools, and absorbs the main;<br/>
Thrice in her gulfs the boiling seas subside,<br/>
Thrice in dire thunders she refunds the tide.<br/>
Oh, if thy vessel plough the direful waves,<br/>
When seas retreating roar within her caves,<br/>
Ye perish all! though he who rules the main<br/>
Lends his strong aid, his aid he lends in vain.<br/>
Ah, shun the horrid gulf! by Scylla fly.<br/>
'Tis better six to lose, than all to die.'
</p>
<p>
"I then: 'O nymph propitious to my prayer,<br/>
Goddess divine, my guardian power, declare,<br/>
Is the foul fiend from human vengeance freed?<br/>
Or, if I rise in arms, can Scylla bleed?'
</p>
<p>
"Then she: 'O worn by toils, O broke in fight,<br/>
Still are new toils and war thy dire delight?<br/>
Will martial flames for ever fire thy mind,<br/>
And never, never be to Heaven resign'd?<br/>
How vain thy efforts to avenge the wrong!<br/>
Deathless the pest! impenetrably strong!<br/>
Furious and fell, tremendous to behold!<br/>
E'en with a look she withers all the bold!<br/>
She mocks the weak attempts of human might;<br/>
Oh, fly her rage! thy conquest is thy flight.<br/>
If but to seize thy arms thou make delay,<br/>
Again thy fury vindicates her prey;<br/>
Her six mouths yawn, and six are snatch'd away.<br/>
From her foul wound Crataeis gave to air<br/>
This dreadful pest! To her direct thy prayer,<br/>
To curb the monster in her dire abodes,<br/>
And guard thee through the tumult of the floods.<br/>
Thence to Trinacria's shore you bend your way,<br/>
Where graze thy herds, illustrious source of day!<br/>
Seven herds, seven flocks enrich the sacred plains,<br/>
Each herd, each flock full fifty heads contains;<br/>
The wondrous kind a length of age survey,<br/>
By breed increase not, nor by death decay.<br/>
Two sister goddesses possess the plain,<br/>
The constant guardian of the woolly train;<br/>
Lampetie fair, and Phaethusa young,<br/>
From Phœbus and the bright Neæra sprung;<br/>
Here, watchful o'er the flocks, in shady bowers<br/>
And flowery meads, they waste the joyous hours.<br/>
Rob not the gods! and so propitious gales<br/>
Attend thy voyage, and impel thy sails;<br/>
But if thy impious hands the flocks destroy,<br/>
The gods, the gods avenge it, and ye die!<br/>
'Tis thine alone (thy friends and navy lost)<br/>
Through tedious toils to view thy native coast.'
</p>
<p>
She ceased: and now arose the morning ray;<br/>
Swift to her dome the goddess held her way.<br/>
Then to my mates I measured back the plain,<br/>
Climb'd the tall bark, and rush'd into the main;<br/>
Then, bending to the stroke, their oars they drew<br/>
To their broad breasts, and swift the galley flew.<br/>
Up sprung a brisker breeze; with freshening gales<br/>
The friendly goddess stretch'd the swelling sails;<br/>
We drop our oars; at ease the pilot guides;<br/>
The vessel light along the level glides.<br/>
When, rising sad and slow, with pensive look,<br/>
Thus to the melancholy train I spoke:
</p>
<p>
"'O friends, oh ever partners of my woes,<br/>
Attend while I what Heaven foredooms disclose.<br/>
Hear all! Fate hangs o'er all; on you it lies<br/>
To live or perish! to be safe, be wise!
</p>
<p>
"'In flowery meads the sportive Sirens play,<br/>
Touch the soft lyre, and tune the vocal lay;<br/>
Me, me alone, with fetters firmly bound,<br/>
The gods allow to hear the dangerous sound.<br/>
Hear and obey; if freedom I demand,<br/>
Be every fetter strain'd, be added band to band.'
</p>
<p>
"While yet I speak the winged galley flies,<br/>
And lo! the Siren shores like mists arise.<br/>
Sunk were at once the winds; the air above,<br/>
And waves below, at once forgot to move;<br/>
Some demon calm'd the air and smooth'd the deep,<br/>
Hush'd the loud winds, and charm'd the waves to sleep.<br/>
Now every sail we furl, each oar we ply;<br/>
Lash'd by the stroke, the frothy waters fly.<br/>
The ductile wax with busy hands I mould,<br/>
And cleft in fragments, and the fragments roll'd;<br/>
The aërial region now grew warm with day,<br/>
The wax dissolved beneath the burning ray;<br/>
Then every ear I barr'd against the strain,<br/>
And from access of frenzy lock'd the brain.<br/>
Now round the masts my mates the fetters roll'd,<br/>
And bound me limb by limb with fold on fold.<br/>
Then bending to the stroke, the active train<br/>
Plunge all at once their oars, and cleave the main.
</p>
<p>
"While to the shore the rapid vessel flies,<br/>
Our swift approach the Siren choir descries;<br/>
Celestial music warbles from their tongue,<br/>
And thus the sweet deluders tune the song:
</p>
<p>
"'Oh stay, O pride of Greece! Ulysses, stay!<br/>
Oh cease thy course, and listen to our lay!<br/>
Blest is the man ordain'd our voice to hear,<br/>
The song instructs the soul, and charms the ear.<br/>
Approach! thy soul shall into raptures rise!<br/>
Approach! and learn new wisdom from the wise!<br/>
We know whate'er the kings of mighty name<br/>
Achieved at Ilion in the field of fame;<br/>
Whate'er beneath the sun's bright journey lies.<br/>
Oh stay, and learn new wisdom from the wise!'
</p>
<p>
"Thus the sweet charmers warbled o'er the main;<br/>
My soul takes wing to meet the heavenly strain;<br/>
I give the sign, and struggle to be free;<br/>
Swift row my mates, and shoot along the sea;<br/>
New chains they add, and rapid urge the way,<br/>
Till, dying off, the distant sounds decay;<br/>
Then scudding swiftly from the dangerous ground,<br/>
The deafen'd ear unlock'd, the chains unbound.
</p>
<p>
"Now all at once tremendous scenes unfold;<br/>
Thunder'd the deeps, the smoky billows roll'd!<br/>
Tumultuous waves embroil the bellowing flood,<br/>
All trembling, deafen'd, and aghast we stood!<br/>
No more the vessel plough'd the dreadful wave,<br/>
Fear seized the mighty, and unnerved the brave;<br/>
Each dropp'd his oar; but swift from man to man<br/>
With looks serene I turn'd, and thus began:<br/>
'O friends! O often tried in adverse storms!<br/>
With ills familiar in more dreadful forms!<br/>
Deep in the dire Cyclopæan den you lay,<br/>
Yet safe return'd&mdash;Ulysses led the way.<br/>
Learn courage hence, and in my care confide;<br/>
Lo! still the same Ulysses is your guide.<br/>
Attend my words! your oars incessant ply;<br/>
Strain every nerve, and bid the vessel fly.<br/>
If from yon jostling rocks and wavy war<br/>
Jove safety grants, he grants it to your care.<br/>
And thou, whose guiding hand directs our way,<br/>
Pilot, attentive listen and obey!<br/>
Bear wide thy course, nor plough those angry waves<br/>
Where rolls yon smoke, yon tumbling ocean raves;<br/>
Steer by the higher rock; lest whirl'd around<br/>
We sink, beneath the circling eddy drown'd.'<br/>
While yet I speak, at once their oars they seize,<br/>
Stretch to the stroke, and brush the working seas.<br/>
Cautious the name of Scylla I suppress'd;<br/>
That dreadful sound had chill'd the boldest breast.
</p>
<p>
"Meantime, forgetful of the voice divine,<br/>
All dreadful bright my limbs in armour shine;<br/>
High on the deck I take my dangerous stand,<br/>
Two glittering javelins lighten in my hand;<br/>
Prepared to whirl the whizzing spear I stay,<br/>
Till the fell fiend arise to seize her prey.<br/>
Around the dungeon, studious to behold<br/>
The hideous pest, my labouring eyes I roll'd;<br/>
In vain! the dismal dungeon, dark as night,<br/>
Veils the dire monster, and confounds the sight.
</p>
<p>
"Now through the rocks, appall'd with deep dismay,<br/>
We bend our course, and stem the desperate way;<br/>
Dire Scylla there a scene of horror forms,<br/>
And here Charybdis fills the deep with storms.<br/>
When the tide rushes from her rumbling caves,<br/>
The rough rock roars, tumultuous boil the waves;<br/>
They toss, they foam, a wild confusion raise,<br/>
Like waters bubbling o'er the fiery blaze;<br/>
Eternal mists obscure the aërial plain,<br/>
And high above the rock she spouts the main;<br/>
When in her gulfs the rushing sea subsides,<br/>
She drains the ocean with the refluent tides;<br/>
The rock re-bellows with a thundering sound;<br/>
Deep, wondrous deep, below appears the ground.
</p>
<p>
"Struck with despair, with trembling hearts we view'd<br/>
The yawning dungeon, and the tumbling flood;<br/>
When lo! fierce Scylla stoop'd to seize her prey,<br/>
Stretch'd her dire jaws, and swept six men away.<br/>
Chiefs of renown! loud-echoing shrieks arise;<br/>
I turn, and view them quivering in the skies;<br/>
They call, and aid with outstretch'd arms implore;<br/>
In vain they call! those arms are stretch'd no more.<br/>
As from some rock that overhangs the flood<br/>
The silent fisher casts the insidious food,<br/>
With fraudful care he waits the finny prize,<br/>
And sudden lifts it quivering to the skies:<br/>
So the foul monster lifts her prey on high,<br/>
So pant the wretches struggling in the sky;<br/>
In the wide dungeon she devours her food,<br/>
And the flesh trembles while she churns the blood.<br/>
Worn as I am with griefs, with care decay'd,<br/>
Never, I never scene so dire survey'd!<br/>
My shivering blood, congeal'd, forgot to flow;<br/>
Aghast I stood, a monument of woe!
</p>
<p>
"Now from the rocks the rapid vessel flies,<br/>
And the hoarse din like distant thunder dies;<br/>
To Sol's bright isle our voyage we pursue,<br/>
And now the glittering mountains rise to view.<br/>
There, sacred to the radiant god of day,<br/>
Graze the fair herds, the flocks promiscuous stray:<br/>
Then suddenly was heard along the main<br/>
To low the ox, to bleat the woolly train.<br/>
Straight to my anxious thoughts the sound convey'd<br/>
The words of Circe and the Theban shade;<br/>
Warn'd by their awful voice these shores to shun,<br/>
With cautious fears oppress'd I thus begun:
</p>
<p>
"'O friends! O ever exercised in care!<br/>
Hear Heaven's commands, and reverence what ye hear!<br/>
To fly these shores the prescient Theban shade<br/>
And Circe warn! Oh be their voice obey'd;<br/>
Some mighty woe relentless Heaven forebodes:<br/>
Fly these dire regions, and revere the gods!'
</p>
<p>
"While yet I spoke, a sudden sorrow ran<br/>
Through every breast, and spread from man to man,<br/>
Till wrathful thus Eurylochus began:
</p>
<p>
"'O cruel thou! some Fury sure has steel'd<br/>
That stubborn soul, by toil untaught to yield!<br/>
From sleep debarr'd, we sink from woes to woes:<br/>
And cruel, enviest thou a short repose?<br/>
Still must we restless rove, new seas explore,<br/>
The sun descending, and so near the shore?<br/>
And lo! the night begins her gloomy reign,<br/>
And doubles all the terrors of the main:<br/>
Oft in the dead of night loud winds arise,<br/>
Lash the wild surge, and bluster in the skies.<br/>
Oh, should the fierce south-west his rage display,<br/>
And toss with rising storms the watery way,<br/>
Though gods descend from heaven's aërial plain<br/>
To lend us aid, the gods descend in vain.<br/>
Then while the night displays her awful shade,<br/>
Sweet time of slumber! be the night obey'd!<br/>
Haste ye to land! and when the morning ray<br/>
Sheds her bright beam, pursue the destined way.'<br/>
A sudden joy in every bosom rose:<br/>
So will'd some demon, minister of woes!
</p>
<p>
"To whom with grief: 'O swift to be undone!<br/>
Constrain'd I act what wisdom bids me shun.<br/>
But yonder herbs and yonder flocks forbear;<br/>
Attest the heavens, and call the gods to hear:<br/>
Content, an innocent repast display,<br/>
By Circe given, and fly the dangerous prey.'
</p>
<p>
"Thus I: and while to shore the vessel flies,<br/>
With hands uplifted they attest the skies:<br/>
Then, where a fountain's gurgling waters play,<br/>
They rush to land, and end in feasts the day:<br/>
They feed; they quaff; and now (their hunger fled)<br/>
Sigh for their friends devour'd, and mourn the dead;<br/>
Nor cease the tears till each in slumber shares<br/>
A sweet forgetfulness of human cares.<br/>
Now far the night advanced her gloomy reign,<br/>
And setting stars roll'd down the azure plain:<br/>
When at the voice of Jove wild whirlwinds rise,<br/>
And clouds and double darkness veil the skies;<br/>
The moon, the stars, the bright ethereal host<br/>
Seem as extinct, and all their splendours lost:<br/>
The furious tempest roars with dreadful sound:<br/>
Air thunders, rolls the ocean, groans the ground.<br/>
All night it raged: when morning rose to land<br/>
We haul'd our bark, and moor'd it on the strand,<br/>
Where in a beauteous grotto's cool recess<br/>
Dance the green Nereids of the neighbouring seas.
</p>
<p>
"There while the wild winds whistled o'er the main,<br/>
Thus careful I address'd the listening train:
</p>
<p>
"'O friends, be wise! nor dare the flocks destroy<br/>
Of these fair pastures: if ye touch, ye die.<br/>
Warn'd by the high command of Heaven, be awed:<br/>
Holy the flocks, and dreadful is the god!<br/>
That god who spreads the radiant beams of light,<br/>
And views wide earth and heaven's unmeasured height.'
</p>
<p>
"And now the moon had run her monthly round,<br/>
The south-east blustering with a dreadful sound:<br/>
Unhurt the beeves, untouch'd the woolly train,<br/>
Low through the grove, or touch the flowery plain:<br/>
Then fail'd our food: then fish we make our prey,<br/>
Or fowl that screaming haunt the watery way.<br/>
Till now from sea or flood no succour found,<br/>
Famine and meagre want besieged us round.<br/>
Pensive and pale from grove to grove I stray'd,<br/>
From the loud storms to find a sylvan shade;<br/>
There o'er my hands the living wave I pour;<br/>
And Heaven and Heaven's immortal thrones implore,<br/>
To calm the roarings of the stormy main,<br/>
And guide me peaceful to my realms again.<br/>
Then o'er my eyes the gods soft slumbers shed,<br/>
While thus Eurylochus arising said:
</p>
<p>
"'O friends, a thousand ways frail mortals lead<br/>
To the cold tomb, and dreadful all to tread;<br/>
But dreadful most, when by a slow decay<br/>
Pale hunger wastes the manly strength away.<br/>
Why cease ye then to implore the powers above,<br/>
And offer hecatombs to thundering Jove?<br/>
Why seize ye not yon beeves, and fleecy prey?<br/>
Arise unanimous; arise and slay!<br/>
And if the gods ordain a safe return,<br/>
To Phœbus shrines shall rise, and altars burn.<br/>
But should the powers that o'er mankind preside<br/>
Decree to plunge us in the whelming tide,<br/>
Better to rush at once to shades below<br/>
Than linger life away, and nourish woe.'
</p>
<p>
"Thus he: the beeves around securely stray,<br/>
When swift to ruin they invade the prey;<br/>
They seize, they kill!&mdash;but for the rite divine.<br/>
The barley fail'd, and for libations wine.<br/>
Swift from the oak they strip the shady pride;<br/>
And verdant leaves the flowery cake supplied.
</p>
<p>
"With prayer they now address the ethereal train,<br/>
Slay the selected beeves, and flay the slain;<br/>
The thighs, with fat involved, divide with art,<br/>
Strew'd o'er with morsels cut from every part.<br/>
Water, instead of wine, is brought in urns,<br/>
And pour'd profanely as the victim burns.<br/>
The thighs thus offer'd, and the entrails dress'd,<br/>
They roast the fragments, and prepare the feast.
</p>
<p>
"'Twas then soft slumber fled my troubled brain;<br/>
Back to the bark I speed along the main.<br/>
When lo! an odour from the feast exhales,<br/>
Spreads o'er the coast and scents the tainted gales;<br/>
A chilly fear congeal'd my vital blood,<br/>
And thus, obtesting Heaven, I mourn'd aloud;
</p>
<p>
"'O sire of men and gods, immortal Jove!<br/>
O all ye blissful powers that reign above!<br/>
Why were my cares beguiled in short repose?<br/>
O fatal slumber, paid with lasting woes!<br/>
A deed so dreadful all the gods alarms,<br/>
Vengeance is on the wing, and Heaven in arms!'
</p>
<p>
"Meantime Lampetie mounts the aërial way,<br/>
And kindles into rage the god of day;
</p>
<p>
"'Vengeance, ye powers (he cries), and then whose hand<br/>
Aims the red bolt, and hurls the writhen brand!<br/>
Slain are those herds which I with pride survey,<br/>
When through the ports of heaven I pour the day,<br/>
Or deep in ocean plunge the burning ray.<br/>
Vengeance, ye gods! or I the skies forego,<br/>
And bear the lamp of heaven to shades below.'
</p>
<p>
"To whom the thundering Power: 'O source of day<br/>
Whose radiant lamp adorns the azure way,<br/>
Still may thy beams through heaven's bright portal rise,<br/>
The joy of earth, the glory of the skies:<br/>
Lo! my red arm I bare, my thunders guide,<br/>
To dash the offenders in the whelming tide.'
</p>
<p>
"To fair Calypso, from the bright abodes,<br/>
Hermes convey'd these counsels of the gods.
</p>
<p>
"Meantime from man to man my tongue exclaims,<br/>
My wrath is kindled, and my soul in flames.<br/>
In vain! I view perform'd the direful deed,<br/>
Beeves, slain in heaps, along the ocean bleed.
</p>
<p>
"Now heaven gave signs of wrath: along the ground<br/>
Crept the raw hides, and with a bellowing sound<br/>
Roar'd the dead limbs; the burning entrails groan'd.<br/>
Six guilty days my wretched mates employ<br/>
In impious feasting, and unhallowed joy;<br/>
The seventh arose, and now the sire of gods<br/>
Rein'd the rough storms; and calm'd the tossing floods:<br/>
With speed the bark we climb; the spacious sails.<br/>
Loosed from the yards invite the impelling gales.<br/>
Past sight of shore, along the surge we bound,<br/>
And all above is sky, and ocean all around;<br/>
When lo! a murky cloud the thunderer forms<br/>
Full o'er our heads, and blackens heaven with storms.<br/>
Night dwells o'er all the deep: and now outflies<br/>
The gloomy west, and whistles in the skies.<br/>
The mountain-billows roar! the furious blast<br/>
Howls o'er the shroud, and rends it from the mast:<br/>
The mast gives way, and, crackling as it bends,<br/>
Tears up the deck; then all at once descends:<br/>
The pilot by the tumbling ruin slain,<br/>
Dash'd from the helm, falls headlong in the main.<br/>
Then Jove in anger bids his thunders roll,<br/>
And forky lightnings flash from pole to pole:<br/>
Fierce at our heads his deadly bolt he aims,<br/>
Red with uncommon wrath, and wrapp'd in flames:<br/>
Full on the bark it fell; now high, now low,<br/>
Toss'd and retoss'd, it reel'd beneath the blow;<br/>
At once into the main the crew it shook:<br/>
Sulphurous odours rose, and smouldering smoke.<br/>
Like fowl that haunt the floods, they sink, they rise,<br/>
Now lost, now seen, with shrieks and dreadful cries;<br/>
And strive to gain the bark, but Jove denies.<br/>
Firm at the helm I stand, when fierce the main<br/>
Rush'd with dire noise, and dash'd the sides in twain;<br/>
Again impetuous drove the furious blast,<br/>
Snapp'd the strong helm, and bore to sea the mast.<br/>
Firm to the mast with cords the helm I bind,<br/>
And ride aloft, to Providence resign'd,<br/>
Through tumbling billows and a war of wind.<br/>
"Now sunk the west, and now a southern breeze,<br/>
More dreadful than the tempest lash'd the seas;<br/>
For on the rocks it bore where Scylla raves,<br/>
And dire Charybdis rolls her thundering waves.<br/>
All night I drove; and at the dawn of day,<br/>
Fast by the rocks beheld the desperate way;<br/>
Just when the sea within her gulfs subsides,<br/>
And in the roaring whirlpools rush the tides,<br/>
Swift from the float I vaulted with a bound,<br/>
The lofty fig-tree seized, and clung around;<br/>
So to the beam the bat tenacious clings,<br/>
And pendent round it clasps his leather wings.<br/>
High in the air the tree its boughs display'd,<br/>
And o'er the dungeon cast a dreadful shade;<br/>
All unsustain'd between the wave and sky,<br/>
Beneath my feet the whirling billows fly.<br/>
What time the judge forsakes the noisy bar<br/>
To take repast, and stills the wordy war,<br/>
Charybdis, rumbling from her inmost caves,<br/>
The mast refunded on her refluent waves.<br/>
Swift from the tree, the floating mass to gain,<br/>
Sudden I dropp'd amidst the flashing main;<br/>
Once more undaunted on the ruin rode,<br/>
And oar'd with labouring arms along the flood.<br/>
Unseen I pass'd by Scylla's dire abodes.<br/>
So Jove decreed (dread sire of men and gods).<br/>
Then nine long days I plow'd the calmer seas,<br/>
Heaved by the surge, and wafted by the breeze.<br/>
Weary and wet the Ogygian shores I gain,<br/>
When the tenth sun descended to the main.<br/>
There, in Calypso's ever-fragrant bowers,<br/>
Refresh'd I lay, and joy beguiled the hours.<br/>
"My following fates to thee, O king, are known,<br/>
And the bright partner of thy royal throne.<br/>
Enough: in misery can words avail?<br/>
And what so tedious as a twice-told tale?"

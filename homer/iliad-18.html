<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XVIII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,<br/>
And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.<br/>
Meanwhile, where Hellespont's broad waters flow,<br/>
Stood Nestor's son, the messenger of woe:<br/>
There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails,<br/>
On hoisted yards extended to the gales;<br/>
Pensive he sat; for all that fate design'd<br/>
Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.<br/>
Thus to his soul he said: "Ah! what constrains<br/>
The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?<br/>
Is this the day, which heaven so long ago<br/>
Ordain'd, to sink me with the weight of woe?<br/>
(So Thetis warn'd;) when by a Trojan hand<br/>
The bravest of the Myrmidonian band<br/>
Should lose the light! Fulfilled is that decree;<br/>
Fallen is the warrior, and Patroclus he!<br/>
In vain I charged him soon to quit the plain,<br/>
And warn'd to shun Hectorean force in vain!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus while he thinks, Antilochus appears,<br/>
And tells the melancholy tale with tears.<br/>
"Sad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear;<br/>
And wretched I, the unwilling messenger!<br/>
Dead is Patroclus! For his corse they fight;<br/>
His naked corse: his arms are Hector's right."<br/>
</p>
<p>
A sudden horror shot through all the chief,<br/>
And wrapp'd his senses in the cloud of grief;<br/>
Cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread<br/>
The scorching ashes o'er his graceful head;<br/>
His purple garments, and his golden hairs,<br/>
Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears;<br/>
On the hard soil his groaning breast he threw,<br/>
And roll'd and grovell'd, as to earth he grew.<br/>
The virgin captives, with disorder'd charms,<br/>
(Won by his own, or by Patroclus' arms,)<br/>
Rush'd from their tents with cries; and gathering round,<br/>
Beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground:<br/>
While Nestor's son sustains a manlier part,<br/>
And mourns the warrior with a warrior's heart;<br/>
Hangs on his arms, amidst his frantic woe,<br/>
And oft prevents the meditated blow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Far in the deep abysses of the main,<br/>
With hoary Nereus, and the watery train,<br/>
The mother-goddess from her crystal throne<br/>
Heard his loud cries, and answer'd groan for groan.<br/>
The circling Nereids with their mistress weep,<br/>
And all the sea-green sisters of the deep.<br/>
Thalia, Glauce (every watery name),<br/>
Nesaea mild, and silver Spio came:<br/>
Cymothoe and Cymodoce were nigh,<br/>
And the blue languish of soft Alia's eye.<br/>
Their locks Actaea and Limnoria rear,<br/>
Then Proto, Doris, Panope appear,<br/>
Thoa, Pherusa, Doto, Melita;<br/>
Agave gentle, and Amphithoe gay:<br/>
Next Callianira, Callianassa show<br/>
Their sister looks; Dexamene the slow,<br/>
And swift Dynamene, now cut the tides:<br/>
Iaera now the verdant wave divides:<br/>
Nemertes with Apseudes lifts the head,<br/>
Bright Galatea quits her pearly bed;<br/>
These Orythia, Clymene, attend,<br/>
Maera, Amphinome, the train extend;<br/>
And black Janira, and Janassa fair,<br/>
And Amatheia with her amber hair.<br/>
All these, and all that deep in ocean held<br/>
Their sacred seats, the glimmering grotto fill'd;<br/>
Each beat her ivory breast with silent woe,<br/>
Till Thetis' sorrows thus began to flow:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hear me, and judge, ye sisters of the main!<br/>
How just a cause has Thetis to complain!<br/>
How wretched, were I mortal, were my fate!<br/>
How more than wretched in the immortal state!<br/>
Sprung from my bed a godlike hero came,<br/>
The bravest far that ever bore the name;<br/>
Like some fair olive, by my careful hand<br/>
He grew, he flourish'd and adorn'd the land<br/>
To Troy I sent him: but the fates ordain<br/>
He never, never must return again.<br/>
So short a space the light of heaven to view,<br/>
So short, alas! and fill'd with anguish too!<br/>
Hear how his sorrows echo through the shore!<br/>
I cannot ease them, but I must deplore;<br/>
I go at least to bear a tender part,<br/>
And mourn my loved-one with a mother's heart."<br/>
</p>
<p>
She said, and left the caverns of the main,<br/>
All bathed in tears; the melancholy train<br/>
Attend her way. Wide-opening part the tides,<br/>
While the long pomp the silver wave divides.<br/>
Approaching now, they touch'd the Trojan land;<br/>
Then, two by two, ascended up the strand.<br/>
The immortal mother, standing close beside<br/>
Her mournful offspring, to his sighs replied;<br/>
Along the coast their mingled clamours ran,<br/>
And thus the silver-footed dame began:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Why mourns my son? thy late preferr'd request<br/>
The god has granted, and the Greeks distress'd:<br/>
Why mourns my son? thy anguish let me share,<br/>
Reveal the cause, and trust a parent's care."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He, deeply groaning—"To this cureless grief,<br/>
Not even the Thunderer's favour brings relief.<br/>
Patroclus—Ah!—say, goddess, can I boast<br/>
A pleasure now? revenge itself is lost;<br/>
Patroclus, loved of all my martial train,<br/>
Beyond mankind, beyond myself is slain!<br/>
Lost are those arms the gods themselves bestow'd<br/>
On Peleus; Hector bears the glorious load.<br/>
Cursed be that day, when all the powers above<br/>
Thy charms submitted to a mortal love:<br/>
O hadst thou still, a sister of the main,<br/>
Pursued the pleasures of the watery reign:<br/>
And happier Peleus, less ambitious, led<br/>
A mortal beauty to his equal bed!<br/>
Ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb<br/>
Had caused such sorrows past, and woes to come.<br/>
For soon, alas! that wretched offspring slain,<br/>
New woes, new sorrows, shall create again.<br/>
'Tis not in fate the alternate now to give;<br/>
Patroclus dead, Achilles hates to live.<br/>
Let me revenge it on proud Hector's heart,<br/>
Let his last spirit smoke upon my dart;<br/>
On these conditions will I breathe: till then,<br/>
I blush to walk among the race of men."<br/>
</p>
<p>
A flood of tears, at this, the goddess shed:<br/>
"Ah then, I see thee dying, see thee dead!<br/>
When Hector falls, thou diest."—"Let Hector die,<br/>
And let me fall! (Achilles made reply)<br/>
Far lies Patroclus from his native plain!<br/>
He fell, and falling, wish'd my aid in vain.<br/>
Ah then, since from this miserable day<br/>
I cast all hope of my return away;<br/>
Since, unrevenged, a hundred ghosts demand<br/>
The fate of Hector from Achilles' hand;<br/>
Since here, for brutal courage far renown'd,<br/>
I live an idle burden to the ground,<br/>
(Others in council famed for nobler skill,<br/>
More useful to preserve, than I to kill,)<br/>
Let me—But oh! ye gracious powers above!<br/>
Wrath and revenge from men and gods remove:<br/>
Far, far too dear to every mortal breast,<br/>
Sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste:<br/>
Gathering like vapours of a noxious kind<br/>
From fiery blood, and darkening all the mind.<br/>
Me Agamemnon urged to deadly hate;<br/>
'Tis past—I quell it; I resign to fate.<br/>
Yes—I will meet the murderer of my friend;<br/>
Or (if the gods ordain it) meet my end.<br/>
The stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun:<br/>
The great Alcides, Jove's unequall'd son,<br/>
To Juno's hate, at length resign'd his breath,<br/>
And sunk the victim of all-conquering death.<br/>
So shall Achilles fall! stretch'd pale and dead,<br/>
No more the Grecian hope, or Trojan dread!<br/>
Let me, this instant, rush into the fields,<br/>
And reap what glory life's short harvest yields.<br/>
Shall I not force some widow'd dame to tear<br/>
With frantic hands her long dishevell'd hair?<br/>
Shall I not force her breast to heave with sighs,<br/>
And the soft tears to trickle from her eyes?<br/>
Yes, I shall give the fair those mournful charms—<br/>
In vain you hold me—Hence! my arms! my arms!—<br/>
Soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide,<br/>
That all shall know Achilles swells the tide."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"My son (coerulean Thetis made reply,<br/>
To fate submitting with a secret sigh,)<br/>
The host to succour, and thy friends to save,<br/>
Is worthy thee; the duty of the brave.<br/>
But canst thou, naked, issue to the plains?<br/>
Thy radiant arms the Trojan foe detains.<br/>
Insulting Hector bears the spoils on high,<br/>
But vainly glories, for his fate is nigh.<br/>
Yet, yet awhile thy generous ardour stay;<br/>
Assured, I meet thee at the dawn of day,<br/>
Charged with refulgent arms (a glorious load),<br/>
Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then turning to the daughters of the main,<br/>
The goddess thus dismiss'd her azure train:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ye sister Nereids! to your deeps descend;<br/>
Haste, and our father's sacred seat attend;<br/>
I go to find the architect divine,<br/>
Where vast Olympus' starry summits shine:<br/>
So tell our hoary sire"—This charge she gave:<br/>
The sea-green sisters plunge beneath the wave:<br/>
Thetis once more ascends the bless'd abodes,<br/>
And treads the brazen threshold of the gods.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now the Greeks from furious Hector's force,<br/>
Urge to broad Hellespont their headlong course;<br/>
Nor yet their chiefs Patroclus' body bore<br/>
Safe through the tempest to the tented shore.<br/>
The horse, the foot, with equal fury join'd,<br/>
Pour'd on the rear, and thunder'd close behind:<br/>
And like a flame through fields of ripen'd corn,<br/>
The rage of Hector o'er the ranks was borne.<br/>
Thrice the slain hero by the foot he drew;<br/>
Thrice to the skies the Trojan clamours flew:<br/>
As oft the Ajaces his assault sustain;<br/>
But check'd, he turns; repuls'd, attacks again.<br/>
With fiercer shouts his lingering troops he fires,<br/>
Nor yields a step, nor from his post retires:<br/>
So watchful shepherds strive to force, in vain,<br/>
The hungry lion from a carcase slain.<br/>
Even yet Patroclus had he borne away,<br/>
And all the glories of the extended day,<br/>
Had not high Juno from the realms of air,<br/>
Secret, despatch'd her trusty messenger.<br/>
The various goddess of the showery bow,<br/>
Shot in a whirlwind to the shore below;<br/>
To great Achilles at his ships she came,<br/>
And thus began the many-colour'd dame:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Rise, son of Peleus! rise, divinely brave!<br/>
Assist the combat, and Patroclus save:<br/>
For him the slaughter to the fleet they spread,<br/>
And fall by mutual wounds around the dead.<br/>
To drag him back to Troy the foe contends:<br/>
Nor with his death the rage of Hector ends:<br/>
A prey to dogs he dooms the corse to lie,<br/>
And marks the place to fix his head on high.<br/>
Rise, and prevent (if yet you think of fame)<br/>
Thy friend's disgrace, thy own eternal shame!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Who sends thee, goddess, from the ethereal skies?"<br/>
Achilles thus. And Iris thus replies:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I come, Pelides! from the queen of Jove,<br/>
The immortal empress of the realms above;<br/>
Unknown to him who sits remote on high,<br/>
Unknown to all the synod of the sky."<br/>
"Thou comest in vain (he cries, with fury warm'd);<br/>
Arms I have none, and can I fight unarm'd?<br/>
Unwilling as I am, of force I stay,<br/>
Till Thetis bring me at the dawn of day<br/>
Vulcanian arms: what other can I wield,<br/>
Except the mighty Telamonian shield?<br/>
That, in my friend's defence, has Ajax spread,<br/>
While his strong lance around him heaps the dead:<br/>
The gallant chief defends Menoetius' son,<br/>
And does what his Achilles should have done."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thy want of arms (said Iris) well we know;<br/>
But though unarm'd, yet clad in terrors, go!<br/>
Let but Achilles o'er yon trench appear,<br/>
Proud Troy shall tremble, and consent to fear;<br/>
Greece from one glance of that tremendous eye<br/>
Shall take new courage, and disdain to fly."<br/>
</p>
<p>
She spoke, and pass'd in air. The hero rose:<br/>
Her aegis Pallas o'er his shoulder throws;<br/>
Around his brows a golden cloud she spread;<br/>
A stream of glory flamed above his head.<br/>
As when from some beleaguer'd town arise<br/>
The smokes, high curling to the shaded skies;<br/>
(Seen from some island, o'er the main afar,<br/>
When men distress'd hang out the sign of war;)<br/>
Soon as the sun in ocean hides his rays,<br/>
Thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze;<br/>
With long-projected beams the seas are bright,<br/>
And heaven's high arch reflects the ruddy light:<br/>
So from Achilles' head the splendours rise,<br/>
Reflecting blaze on blaze against the skies.<br/>
Forth march'd the chief, and distant from the crowd,<br/>
High on the rampart raised his voice aloud;<br/>
With her own shout Minerva swells the sound;<br/>
Troy starts astonish'd, and the shores rebound.<br/>
As the loud trumpet's brazen mouth from far<br/>
With shrilling clangour sounds the alarm of war,<br/>
Struck from the walls, the echoes float on high,<br/>
And the round bulwarks and thick towers reply;<br/>
So high his brazen voice the hero rear'd:<br/>
Hosts dropp'd their arms, and trembled as they heard:<br/>
And back the chariots roll, and coursers bound,<br/>
And steeds and men lie mingled on the ground.<br/>
Aghast they see the living lightnings play,<br/>
And turn their eyeballs from the flashing ray.<br/>
Thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised,<br/>
And thrice they fled, confounded and amazed.<br/>
Twelve in the tumult wedged, untimely rush'd<br/>
On their own spears, by their own chariots crush'd:<br/>
While, shielded from the darts, the Greeks obtain<br/>
The long-contended carcase of the slain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A lofty bier the breathless warrior bears:<br/>
Around, his sad companions melt in tears.<br/>
But chief Achilles, bending down his head,<br/>
Pours unavailing sorrows o'er the dead,<br/>
Whom late triumphant, with his steeds and car,<br/>
He sent refulgent to the field of war;<br/>
(Unhappy change!) now senseless, pale, he found,<br/>
Stretch'd forth, and gash'd with many a gaping wound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meantime, unwearied with his heavenly way,<br/>
In ocean's waves the unwilling light of day<br/>
Quench'd his red orb, at Juno's high command,<br/>
And from their labours eased the Achaian band.<br/>
The frighted Trojans (panting from the war,<br/>
Their steeds unharness'd from the weary car)<br/>
A sudden council call'd: each chief appear'd<br/>
In haste, and standing; for to sit they fear'd.<br/>
'Twas now no season for prolong'd debate;<br/>
They saw Achilles, and in him their fate.<br/>
Silent they stood: Polydamas at last,<br/>
Skill'd to discern the future by the past,<br/>
The son of Panthus, thus express'd his fears<br/>
(The friend of Hector, and of equal years;<br/>
The self-same night to both a being gave,<br/>
One wise in council, one in action brave):<br/>
</p>
<p>
"In free debate, my friends, your sentence speak;<br/>
For me, I move, before the morning break,<br/>
To raise our camp: too dangerous here our post,<br/>
Far from Troy walls, and on a naked coast.<br/>
I deem'd not Greece so dreadful, while engaged<br/>
In mutual feuds her king and hero raged;<br/>
Then, while we hoped our armies might prevail<br/>
We boldly camp'd beside a thousand sail.<br/>
I dread Pelides now: his rage of mind<br/>
Not long continues to the shores confined,<br/>
Nor to the fields, where long in equal fray<br/>
Contending nations won and lost the day;<br/>
For Troy, for Troy, shall henceforth be the strife,<br/>
And the hard contest not for fame, but life.<br/>
Haste then to Ilion, while the favouring night<br/>
Detains these terrors, keeps that arm from fight.<br/>
If but the morrow's sun behold us here,<br/>
That arm, those terrors, we shall feel, not fear;<br/>
And hearts that now disdain, shall leap with joy,<br/>
If heaven permit them then to enter Troy.<br/>
Let not my fatal prophecy be true,<br/>
Nor what I tremble but to think, ensue.<br/>
Whatever be our fate, yet let us try<br/>
What force of thought and reason can supply;<br/>
Let us on counsel for our guard depend;<br/>
The town her gates and bulwarks shall defend.<br/>
When morning dawns, our well-appointed powers,<br/>
Array'd in arms, shall line the lofty towers.<br/>
Let the fierce hero, then, when fury calls,<br/>
Vent his mad vengeance on our rocky walls,<br/>
Or fetch a thousand circles round the plain,<br/>
Till his spent coursers seek the fleet again:<br/>
So may his rage be tired, and labour'd down!<br/>
And dogs shall tear him ere he sack the town."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Return! (said Hector, fired with stern disdain)<br/>
What! coop whole armies in our walls again?<br/>
Was't not enough, ye valiant warriors, say,<br/>
Nine years imprison'd in those towers ye lay?<br/>
Wide o'er the world was Ilion famed of old<br/>
For brass exhaustless, and for mines of gold:<br/>
But while inglorious in her walls we stay'd,<br/>
Sunk were her treasures, and her stores decay'd;<br/>
The Phrygians now her scatter'd spoils enjoy,<br/>
And proud Maeonia wastes the fruits of Troy.<br/>
Great Jove at length my arms to conquest calls,<br/>
And shuts the Grecians in their wooden walls,<br/>
Darest thou dispirit whom the gods incite?<br/>
Flies any Trojan? I shall stop his flight.<br/>
To better counsel then attention lend;<br/>
Take due refreshment, and the watch attend.<br/>
If there be one whose riches cost him care,<br/>
Forth let him bring them for the troops to share;<br/>
'Tis better generously bestow'd on those,<br/>
Than left the plunder of our country's foes.<br/>
Soon as the morn the purple orient warms,<br/>
Fierce on yon navy will we pour our arms.<br/>
If great Achilles rise in all his might,<br/>
His be the danger: I shall stand the fight.<br/>
Honour, ye gods! or let me gain or give;<br/>
And live he glorious, whosoe'er shall live!<br/>
Mars is our common lord, alike to all;<br/>
And oft the victor triumphs, but to fall."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The shouting host in loud applauses join'd;<br/>
So Pallas robb'd the many of their mind;<br/>
To their own sense condemn'd, and left to choose<br/>
The worst advice, the better to refuse.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While the long night extends her sable reign,<br/>
Around Patroclus mourn'd the Grecian train.<br/>
Stern in superior grief Pelides stood;<br/>
Those slaughtering arms, so used to bathe in blood,<br/>
Now clasp his clay-cold limbs: then gushing start<br/>
The tears, and sighs burst from his swelling heart.<br/>
The lion thus, with dreadful anguish stung,<br/>
Roars through the desert, and demands his young;<br/>
When the grim savage, to his rifled den<br/>
Too late returning, snuffs the track of men,<br/>
And o'er the vales and o'er the forest bounds;<br/>
His clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds.<br/>
So grieves Achilles; and, impetuous, vents<br/>
To all his Myrmidons his loud laments.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"In what vain promise, gods! did I engage,<br/>
When to console Menoetius' feeble age,<br/>
I vowed his much-loved offspring to restore,<br/>
Charged with rich spoils, to fair Opuntia's shore?<br/>
But mighty Jove cuts short, with just disdain,<br/>
The long, long views of poor designing man!<br/>
One fate the warrior and the friend shall strike,<br/>
And Troy's black sands must drink our blood alike:<br/>
Me too a wretched mother shall deplore,<br/>
An aged father never see me more!<br/>
Yet, my Patroclus! yet a space I stay,<br/>
Then swift pursue thee on the darksome way.<br/>
Ere thy dear relics in the grave are laid,<br/>
Shall Hector's head be offer'd to thy shade;<br/>
That, with his arms, shall hang before thy shrine;<br/>
And twelve, the noblest of the Trojan line,<br/>
Sacred to vengeance, by this hand expire;<br/>
Their lives effused around thy flaming pyre.<br/>
Thus let me lie till then! thus, closely press'd,<br/>
Bathe thy cold face, and sob upon thy breast!<br/>
While Trojan captives here thy mourners stay,<br/>
Weep all the night and murmur all the day:<br/>
Spoils of my arms, and thine; when, wasting wide,<br/>
Our swords kept time, and conquer'd side by side."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and bade the sad attendants round<br/>
Cleanse the pale corse, and wash each honour'd wound.<br/>
A massy caldron of stupendous frame<br/>
They brought, and placed it o'er the rising flame:<br/>
Then heap'd the lighted wood; the flame divides<br/>
Beneath the vase, and climbs around the sides:<br/>
In its wide womb they pour the rushing stream;<br/>
The boiling water bubbles to the brim.<br/>
The body then they bathe with pious toil,<br/>
Embalm the wounds, anoint the limbs with oil,<br/>
High on a bed of state extended laid,<br/>
And decent cover'd with a linen shade;<br/>
Last o'er the dead the milk-white veil they threw;<br/>
That done, their sorrows and their sighs renew.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile to Juno, in the realms above,<br/>
(His wife and sister,) spoke almighty Jove.<br/>
"At last thy will prevails: great Peleus' son<br/>
Rises in arms: such grace thy Greeks have won.<br/>
Say (for I know not), is their race divine,<br/>
And thou the mother of that martial line?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What words are these? (the imperial dame replies,<br/>
While anger flash'd from her majestic eyes)<br/>
Succour like this a mortal arm might lend,<br/>
And such success mere human wit attend:<br/>
And shall not I, the second power above,<br/>
Heaven's queen, and consort of the thundering Jove,<br/>
Say, shall not I one nation's fate command,<br/>
Not wreak my vengeance on one guilty land?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
So they. Meanwhile the silver-footed dame<br/>
Reach'd the Vulcanian dome, eternal frame!<br/>
High-eminent amid the works divine,<br/>
Where heaven's far-beaming brazen mansions shine.<br/>
There the lame architect the goddess found,<br/>
Obscure in smoke, his forges flaming round,<br/>
While bathed in sweat from fire to fire he flew;<br/>
And puffing loud, the roaring billows blew.<br/>
That day no common task his labour claim'd:<br/>
Full twenty tripods for his hall he framed,<br/>
That placed on living wheels of massy gold,<br/>
(Wondrous to tell,) instinct with spirit roll'd<br/>
From place to place, around the bless'd abodes<br/>
Self-moved, obedient to the beck of gods:<br/>
For their fair handles now, o'erwrought with flowers,<br/>
In moulds prepared, the glowing ore he pours.<br/>
Just as responsive to his thought the frame<br/>
Stood prompt to move, the azure goddess came:<br/>
Charis, his spouse, a grace divinely fair,<br/>
(With purple fillets round her braided hair,)<br/>
Observed her entering; her soft hand she press'd,<br/>
And, smiling, thus the watery queen address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What, goddess! this unusual favour draws?<br/>
All hail, and welcome! whatsoe'er the cause;<br/>
Till now a stranger, in a happy hour<br/>
Approach, and taste the dainties of the bower."<br/>
</p>
<p>
High on a throne, with stars of silver graced,<br/>
And various artifice, the queen she placed;<br/>
A footstool at her feet: then calling, said,<br/>
"Vulcan, draw near, 'tis Thetis asks your aid."<br/>
"Thetis (replied the god) our powers may claim,<br/>
An ever-dear, an ever-honour'd name!<br/>
When my proud mother hurl'd me from the sky,<br/>
(My awkward form, it seems, displeased her eye,)<br/>
She, and Eurynome, my griefs redress'd,<br/>
And soft received me on their silver breast.<br/>
Even then these arts employ'd my infant thought:<br/>
Chains, bracelets, pendants, all their toys, I wrought.<br/>
Nine years kept secret in the dark abode,<br/>
Secure I lay, conceal'd from man and god:<br/>
Deep in a cavern'd rock my days were led;<br/>
The rushing ocean murmur'd o'er my head.<br/>
Now, since her presence glads our mansion, say,<br/>
For such desert what service can I pay?<br/>
Vouchsafe, O Thetis! at our board to share<br/>
The genial rites, and hospitable fare;<br/>
While I the labours of the forge forego,<br/>
And bid the roaring bellows cease to blow."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then from his anvil the lame artist rose;<br/>
Wide with distorted legs oblique he goes,<br/>
And stills the bellows, and (in order laid)<br/>
Locks in their chests his instruments of trade.<br/>
Then with a sponge the sooty workman dress'd<br/>
His brawny arms embrown'd, and hairy breast.<br/>
With his huge sceptre graced, and red attire,<br/>
Came halting forth the sovereign of the fire:<br/>
The monarch's steps two female forms uphold,<br/>
That moved and breathed in animated gold;<br/>
To whom was voice, and sense, and science given<br/>
Of works divine (such wonders are in heaven!)<br/>
On these supported, with unequal gait,<br/>
He reach'd the throne where pensive Thetis sate;<br/>
There placed beside her on the shining frame,<br/>
He thus address'd the silver-footed dame:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thee, welcome, goddess! what occasion calls<br/>
(So long a stranger) to these honour'd walls?<br/>
'Tis thine, fair Thetis, the command to lay,<br/>
And Vulcan's joy and duty to obey."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the mournful mother thus replies:<br/>
(The crystal drops stood trembling in her eyes:)<br/>
"O Vulcan! say, was ever breast divine<br/>
So pierced with sorrows, so o'erwhelm'd as mine?<br/>
Of all the goddesses, did Jove prepare<br/>
For Thetis only such a weight of care?<br/>
I, only I, of all the watery race<br/>
By force subjected to a man's embrace,<br/>
Who, sinking now with age and sorrow, pays<br/>
The mighty fine imposed on length of days.<br/>
Sprung from my bed, a godlike hero came,<br/>
The bravest sure that ever bore the name;<br/>
Like some fair plant beneath my careful hand<br/>
He grew, he flourish'd, and he graced the land:<br/>
To Troy I sent him! but his native shore<br/>
Never, ah never, shall receive him more;<br/>
(Even while he lives, he wastes with secret woe;)<br/>
Nor I, a goddess, can retard the blow!<br/>
Robb'd of the prize the Grecian suffrage gave,<br/>
The king of nations forced his royal slave:<br/>
For this he grieved; and, till the Greeks oppress'd<br/>
Required his arm, he sorrow'd unredress'd.<br/>
Large gifts they promise, and their elders send;<br/>
In vain—he arms not, but permits his friend<br/>
His arms, his steeds, his forces to employ:<br/>
He marches, combats, almost conquers Troy:<br/>
Then slain by Phoebus (Hector had the name)<br/>
At once resigns his armour, life, and fame.<br/>
But thou, in pity, by my prayer be won:<br/>
Grace with immortal arms this short-lived son,<br/>
And to the field in martial pomp restore,<br/>
To shine with glory, till he shines no more!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
To her the artist-god: "Thy griefs resign,<br/>
Secure, what Vulcan can, is ever thine.<br/>
O could I hide him from the Fates, as well,<br/>
Or with these hands the cruel stroke repel,<br/>
As I shall forge most envied arms, the gaze<br/>
Of wondering ages, and the world's amaze!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, the father of the fires<br/>
To the black labours of his forge retires.<br/>
Soon as he bade them blow, the bellows turn'd<br/>
Their iron mouths; and where the furnace burn'd,<br/>
Resounding breathed: at once the blast expires,<br/>
And twenty forges catch at once the fires;<br/>
Just as the god directs, now loud, now low,<br/>
They raise a tempest, or they gently blow;<br/>
In hissing flames huge silver bars are roll'd,<br/>
And stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold;<br/>
Before, deep fix'd, the eternal anvils stand;<br/>
The ponderous hammer loads his better hand,<br/>
His left with tongs turns the vex'd metal round,<br/>
And thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then first he form'd the immense and solid shield;<br/>
Rich various artifice emblazed the field;<br/>
Its utmost verge a threefold circle bound;<br/>
A silver chain suspends the massy round;<br/>
Five ample plates the broad expanse compose,<br/>
And godlike labours on the surface rose.<br/>
There shone the image of the master-mind:<br/>
There earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd;<br/>
The unwearied sun, the moon completely round;<br/>
The starry lights that heaven's high convex crown'd;<br/>
The Pleiads, Hyads, with the northern team;<br/>
And great Orion's more refulgent beam;<br/>
To which, around the axle of the sky,<br/>
The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye,<br/>
Still shines exalted on the ethereal plain,<br/>
Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Two cities radiant on the shield appear,<br/>
The image one of peace, and one of war.<br/>
Here sacred pomp and genial feast delight,<br/>
And solemn dance, and hymeneal rite;<br/>
Along the street the new-made brides are led,<br/>
With torches flaming, to the nuptial bed:<br/>
The youthful dancers in a circle bound<br/>
To the soft flute, and cithern's silver sound:<br/>
Through the fair streets the matrons in a row<br/>
Stand in their porches, and enjoy the show.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There in the forum swarm a numerous train;<br/>
The subject of debate, a townsman slain:<br/>
One pleads the fine discharged, which one denied,<br/>
And bade the public and the laws decide:<br/>
The witness is produced on either hand:<br/>
For this, or that, the partial people stand:<br/>
The appointed heralds still the noisy bands,<br/>
And form a ring, with sceptres in their hands:<br/>
On seats of stone, within the sacred place,<br/>
The reverend elders nodded o'er the case;<br/>
Alternate, each the attesting sceptre took,<br/>
And rising solemn, each his sentence spoke.<br/>
Two golden talents lay amidst, in sight,<br/>
The prize of him who best adjudged the right.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Another part (a prospect differing far)<br/>
Glow'd with refulgent arms, and horrid war.<br/>
Two mighty hosts a leaguer'd town embrace,<br/>
And one would pillage, one would burn the place.<br/>
Meantime the townsmen, arm'd with silent care,<br/>
A secret ambush on the foe prepare:<br/>
Their wives, their children, and the watchful band<br/>
Of trembling parents, on the turrets stand.<br/>
They march; by Pallas and by Mars made bold:<br/>
Gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,<br/>
And gold their armour: these the squadron led,<br/>
August, divine, superior by the head!<br/>
A place for ambush fit they found, and stood,<br/>
Cover'd with shields, beside a silver flood.<br/>
Two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem<br/>
If sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.<br/>
Soon the white flocks proceeded o'er the plains,<br/>
And steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains;<br/>
Behind them piping on their reeds they go,<br/>
Nor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.<br/>
In arms the glittering squadron rising round<br/>
Rush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground;<br/>
Whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,<br/>
And, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains!<br/>
The bellowing oxen the besiegers hear;<br/>
They rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,<br/>
They fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;<br/>
The waving silver seem'd to blush with blood.<br/>
There Tumult, there Contention stood confess'd;<br/>
One rear'd a dagger at a captive's breast;<br/>
One held a living foe, that freshly bled<br/>
With new-made wounds; another dragg'd a dead;<br/>
Now here, now there, the carcases they tore:<br/>
Fate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore.<br/>
And the whole war came out, and met the eye;<br/>
And each bold figure seem'd to live or die.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A field deep furrow'd next the god design'd,<br/>
The third time labour'd by the sweating hind;<br/>
The shining shares full many ploughmen guide,<br/>
And turn their crooked yokes on every side.<br/>
Still as at either end they wheel around,<br/>
The master meets them with his goblet crown'd;<br/>
The hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,<br/>
Then back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:<br/>
Behind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd;<br/>
And sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Another field rose high with waving grain;<br/>
With bended sickles stand the reaper train:<br/>
Here stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found,<br/>
Sheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground.<br/>
With sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;<br/>
The gatherers follow, and collect in bands;<br/>
And last the children, in whose arms are borne<br/>
(Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.<br/>
The rustic monarch of the field descries,<br/>
With silent glee, the heaps around him rise.<br/>
A ready banquet on the turf is laid,<br/>
Beneath an ample oak's expanded shade.<br/>
The victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;<br/>
The reaper's due repast, the woman's care.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,<br/>
Bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;<br/>
A deeper dye the dangling clusters show,<br/>
And curl'd on silver props, in order glow:<br/>
A darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place;<br/>
And pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.<br/>
To this, one pathway gently winding leads,<br/>
Where march a train with baskets on their heads,<br/>
(Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear<br/>
The purple product of the autumnal year.<br/>
To these a youth awakes the warbling strings,<br/>
Whose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;<br/>
In measured dance behind him move the train,<br/>
Tune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here herds of oxen march, erect and bold,<br/>
Rear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,<br/>
And speed to meadows on whose sounding shores<br/>
A rapid torrent through the rushes roars:<br/>
Four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,<br/>
And nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.<br/>
Two lions rushing from the wood appear'd;<br/>
And seized a bull, the master of the herd:<br/>
He roar'd: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;<br/>
They tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.<br/>
The dogs (oft cheer'd in vain) desert the prey,<br/>
Dread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads<br/>
Deep through fair forests, and a length of meads,<br/>
And stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between;<br/>
And fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A figured dance succeeds; such once was seen<br/>
In lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen,<br/>
Form'd by Daedalean art; a comely band<br/>
Of youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.<br/>
The maids in soft simars of linen dress'd;<br/>
The youths all graceful in the glossy vest:<br/>
Of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd;<br/>
Of these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold,<br/>
That glittering gay, from silver belts depend.<br/>
Now all at once they rise, at once descend,<br/>
With well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,<br/>
Confusedly regular, the moving maze:<br/>
Now forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,<br/>
And undistinguish'd blend the flying ring:<br/>
So whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd,<br/>
And, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.<br/>
The gazing multitudes admire around:<br/>
Two active tumblers in the centre bound;<br/>
Now high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:<br/>
And general songs the sprightly revel end.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd<br/>
With his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round:<br/>
In living silver seem'd the waves to roll,<br/>
And beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This done, whate'er a warrior's use requires<br/>
He forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,<br/>
The greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress'd<br/>
With various sculpture, and the golden crest.<br/>
At Thetis' feet the finished labour lay:<br/>
She, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,<br/>
Swift from Olympus' snowy summit flies,<br/>
And bears the blazing present through the skies.<br/>

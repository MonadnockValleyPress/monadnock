<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XV</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound,<br/>
And many a chief lay gasping on the ground:<br/>
Then stopp'd and panted, where the chariots lie<br/>
Fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.<br/>
Meanwhile, awaken'd from his dream of love,<br/>
On Ida's summit sat imperial Jove:<br/>
Round the wide fields he cast a careful view,<br/>
There saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue;<br/>
These proud in arms, those scatter'd o'er the plain<br/>
And, 'midst the war, the monarch of the main.<br/>
Not far, great Hector on the dust he spies,<br/>
(His sad associates round with weeping eyes,)<br/>
Ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath,<br/>
His senses wandering to the verge of death.<br/>
The god beheld him with a pitying look,<br/>
And thus, incensed, to fraudful Juno spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O thou, still adverse to the eternal will,<br/>
For ever studious in promoting ill!<br/>
Thy arts have made the godlike Hector yield,<br/>
And driven his conquering squadrons from the field.<br/>
Canst thou, unhappy in thy wiles, withstand<br/>
Our power immense, and brave the almighty hand?<br/>
Hast thou forgot, when, bound and fix'd on high,<br/>
From the vast concave of the spangled sky,<br/>
I hung thee trembling in a golden chain,<br/>
And all the raging gods opposed in vain?<br/>
Headlong I hurl'd them from the Olympian hall,<br/>
Stunn'd in the whirl, and breathless with the fall.<br/>
For godlike Hercules these deeds were done,<br/>
Nor seem'd the vengeance worthy such a son:<br/>
When, by thy wiles induced, fierce Boreas toss'd<br/>
The shipwreck'd hero on the Coan coast,<br/>
Him through a thousand forms of death I bore,<br/>
And sent to Argos, and his native shore.<br/>
Hear this, remember, and our fury dread,<br/>
Nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head;<br/>
Lest arts and blandishments successless prove,<br/>
Thy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Thunderer spoke: imperial Juno mourn'd,<br/>
And, trembling, these submissive words return'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"By every oath that powers immortal ties,<br/>
The foodful earth and all-infolding skies;<br/>
By thy black waves, tremendous Styx! that flow<br/>
Through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below;<br/>
By the dread honours of thy sacred head,<br/>
And that unbroken vow, our virgin bed!<br/>
Not by my arts the ruler of the main<br/>
Steeps Troy in blood, and ranges round the plain:<br/>
By his own ardour, his own pity sway'd,<br/>
To help his Greeks, he fought and disobey'd:<br/>
Else had thy Juno better counsels given,<br/>
And taught submission to the sire of heaven."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Think'st thou with me? fair empress of the skies!<br/>
(The immortal father with a smile replies;)<br/>
Then soon the haughty sea-god shall obey,<br/>
Nor dare to act but when we point the way.<br/>
If truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim our will<br/>
To yon bright synod on the Olympian hill;<br/>
Our high decree let various Iris know,<br/>
And call the god that bears the silver bow.<br/>
Let her descend, and from the embattled plain<br/>
Command the sea-god to his watery reign:<br/>
While Phoebus hastes great Hector to prepare<br/>
To rise afresh, and once more wake the war:<br/>
His labouring bosom re-inspires with breath,<br/>
And calls his senses from the verge of death.<br/>
Greece chased by Troy, even to Achilles' fleet,<br/>
Shall fall by thousands at the hero's feet.<br/>
He, not untouch'd with pity, to the plain<br/>
Shall send Patroclus, but shall send in vain.<br/>
What youths he slaughters under Ilion's walls!<br/>
Even my loved son, divine Sarpedon, falls!<br/>
Vanquish'd at last by Hector's lance he lies.<br/>
Then, nor till then, shall great Achilles rise:<br/>
And lo! that instant, godlike Hector dies.<br/>
From that great hour the war's whole fortune turns,<br/>
Pallas assists, and lofty Ilion burns.<br/>
Not till that day shall Jove relax his rage,<br/>
Nor one of all the heavenly host engage<br/>
In aid of Greece. The promise of a god<br/>
I gave, and seal'd it with the almighty nod,<br/>
Achilles' glory to the stars to raise;<br/>
Such was our word, and fate the word obeys."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The trembling queen (the almighty order given)<br/>
Swift from the Idaean summit shot to heaven.<br/>
As some wayfaring man, who wanders o'er<br/>
In thought a length of lands he trod before,<br/>
Sends forth his active mind from place to place,<br/>
Joins hill to dale, and measures space with space:<br/>
So swift flew Juno to the bless'd abodes,<br/>
If thought of man can match the speed of gods.<br/>
There sat the powers in awful synod placed;<br/>
They bow'd, and made obeisance as she pass'd<br/>
Through all the brazen dome: with goblets crown'd<br/>
They hail her queen; the nectar streams around.<br/>
Fair Themis first presents the golden bowl,<br/>
And anxious asks what cares disturb her soul?<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the white-arm'd goddess thus replies:<br/>
"Enough thou know'st the tyrant of the skies,<br/>
Severely bent his purpose to fulfil,<br/>
Unmoved his mind, and unrestrain'd his will.<br/>
Go thou, the feasts of heaven attend thy call;<br/>
Bid the crown'd nectar circle round the hall:<br/>
But Jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome<br/>
Such stern decrees, such threaten'd woes to come,<br/>
As soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise,<br/>
And damp the eternal banquets of the skies."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The goddess said, and sullen took her place;<br/>
Black horror sadden'd each celestial face.<br/>
To see the gathering grudge in every breast,<br/>
Smiles on her lips a spleenful joy express'd;<br/>
While on her wrinkled front, and eyebrow bent,<br/>
Sat stedfast care, and lowering discontent.<br/>
Thus she proceedsâ€”"Attend, ye powers above!<br/>
But know, 'tis madness to contest with Jove:<br/>
Supreme he sits; and sees, in pride of sway.<br/>
Your vassal godheads grudgingly obey:<br/>
Fierce in the majesty of power controls;<br/>
Shakes all the thrones of heaven, and bends the poles.<br/>
Submiss, immortals! all he wills, obey:<br/>
And thou, great Mars, begin and show the way.<br/>
Behold Ascalaphus! behold him die,<br/>
But dare not murmur, dare not vent a sigh;<br/>
Thy own loved boasted offspring lies o'erthrown,<br/>
If that loved boasted offspring be thy own."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Stern Mars, with anguish for his slaughter'd son,<br/>
Smote his rebelling breast, and fierce begun:<br/>
"Thus then, immortals! thus shall Mars obey;<br/>
Forgive me, gods, and yield my vengeance way:<br/>
Descending first to yon forbidden plain,<br/>
The god of battles dares avenge the slain;<br/>
Dares, though the thunder bursting o'er my head<br/>
Should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With that he gives command to Fear and Flight<br/>
To join his rapid coursers for the fight:<br/>
Then grim in arms, with hasty vengeance flies;<br/>
Arms that reflect a radiance through the skies.<br/>
And now had Jove, by bold rebellion driven,<br/>
Discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven;<br/>
But Pallas, springing through the bright abode,<br/>
Starts from her azure throne to calm the god.<br/>
Struck for the immortal race with timely fear,<br/>
From frantic Mars she snatch'd the shield and spear;<br/>
Then the huge helmet lifting from his head,<br/>
Thus to the impetuous homicide she said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"By what wild passion, furious! art thou toss'd?<br/>
Striv'st thou with Jove? thou art already lost.<br/>
Shall not the Thunderer's dread command restrain,<br/>
And was imperial Juno heard in vain?<br/>
Back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven,<br/>
And in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?<br/>
Ilion and Greece no more should Jove engage,<br/>
The skies would yield an ampler scene of rage;<br/>
Guilty and guiltless find an equal fate<br/>
And one vast ruin whelm the Olympian state.<br/>
Cease then thy offspring's death unjust to call;<br/>
Heroes as great have died, and yet shall fall.<br/>
Why should heaven's law with foolish man comply<br/>
Exempted from the race ordain'd to die?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
This menace fix'd the warrior to his throne;<br/>
Sullen he sat, and curb'd the rising groan.<br/>
Then Juno call'd (Jove's orders to obey)<br/>
The winged Iris, and the god of day.<br/>
"Go wait the Thunderer's will (Saturnia cried)<br/>
On yon tall summit of the fountful Ide:<br/>
There in the father's awful presence stand,<br/>
Receive, and execute his dread command."<br/>
</p>
<p>
She said, and sat; the god that gilds the day,<br/>
And various Iris, wing their airy way.<br/>
Swift as the wind, to Ida's hills they came,<br/>
(Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game)<br/>
There sat the eternal; he whose nod controls<br/>
The trembling world, and shakes the steady poles.<br/>
Veil'd in a mist of fragrance him they found,<br/>
With clouds of gold and purple circled round.<br/>
Well-pleased the Thunderer saw their earnest care,<br/>
And prompt obedience to the queen of air;<br/>
Then (while a smile serenes his awful brow)<br/>
Commands the goddess of the showery bow:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Iris! descend, and what we here ordain,<br/>
Report to yon mad tyrant of the main.<br/>
Bid him from fight to his own deeps repair,<br/>
Or breathe from slaughter in the fields of air.<br/>
If he refuse, then let him timely weigh<br/>
Our elder birthright, and superior sway.<br/>
How shall his rashness stand the dire alarms,<br/>
If heaven's omnipotence descend in arms?<br/>
Strives he with me, by whom his power was given,<br/>
And is there equal to the lord of heaven?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The all-mighty spoke; the goddess wing'd her flight<br/>
To sacred Ilion from the Idaean height.<br/>
Swift as the rattling hail, or fleecy snows,<br/>
Drive through the skies, when Boreas fiercely blows;<br/>
So from the clouds descending Iris falls,<br/>
And to blue Neptune thus the goddess calls:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Attend the mandate of the sire above!<br/>
In me behold the messenger of Jove:<br/>
He bids thee from forbidden wars repair<br/>
To thine own deeps, or to the fields of air.<br/>
This if refused, he bids thee timely weigh<br/>
His elder birthright, and superior sway.<br/>
How shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms<br/>
If heaven's omnipotence descend in arms?<br/>
Striv'st thou with him by whom all power is given?<br/>
And art thou equal to the lord of heaven?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What means the haughty sovereign of the skies?<br/>
(The king of ocean thus, incensed, replies;)<br/>
Rule as he will his portion'd realms on high;<br/>
No vassal god, nor of his train, am I.<br/>
Three brother deities from Saturn came,<br/>
And ancient Rhea, earth's immortal dame:<br/>
Assign'd by lot, our triple rule we know;<br/>
Infernal Pluto sways the shades below;<br/>
O'er the wide clouds, and o'er the starry plain,<br/>
Ethereal Jove extends his high domain;<br/>
My court beneath the hoary waves I keep,<br/>
And hush the roarings of the sacred deep;<br/>
Olympus, and this earth, in common lie:<br/>
What claim has here the tyrant of the sky?<br/>
Far in the distant clouds let him control,<br/>
And awe the younger brothers of the pole;<br/>
There to his children his commands be given,<br/>
The trembling, servile, second race of heaven."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And must I then (said she), O sire of floods!<br/>
Bear this fierce answer to the king of gods?<br/>
Correct it yet, and change thy rash intent;<br/>
A noble mind disdains not to repent.<br/>
To elder brothers guardian fiends are given,<br/>
To scourge the wretch insulting them and heaven."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Great is the profit (thus the god rejoin'd)<br/>
When ministers are blest with prudent mind:<br/>
Warn'd by thy words, to powerful Jove I yield,<br/>
And quit, though angry, the contended field:<br/>
Not but his threats with justice I disclaim,<br/>
The same our honours, and our birth the same.<br/>
If yet, forgetful of his promise given<br/>
To Hermes, Pallas, and the queen of heaven,<br/>
To favour Ilion, that perfidious place,<br/>
He breaks his faith with half the ethereal race;<br/>
Give him to know, unless the Grecian train<br/>
Lay yon proud structures level with the plain,<br/>
Howe'er the offence by other gods be pass'd,<br/>
The wrath of Neptune shall for ever last."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus speaking, furious from the field he strode,<br/>
And plunged into the bosom of the flood.<br/>
The lord of thunders, from his lofty height<br/>
Beheld, and thus bespoke the source of light:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Behold! the god whose liquid arms are hurl'd<br/>
Around the globe, whose earthquakes rock the world,<br/>
Desists at length his rebel-war to wage,<br/>
Seeks his own seas, and trembles at our rage;<br/>
Else had my wrath, heaven's thrones all shaking round,<br/>
Burn'd to the bottom of his seas profound;<br/>
And all the gods that round old Saturn dwell<br/>
Had heard the thunders to the deeps of hell.<br/>
Well was the crime, and well the vengeance spared;<br/>
Even power immense had found such battle hard.<br/>
Go thou, my son! the trembling Greeks alarm,<br/>
Shake my broad aegis on thy active arm,<br/>
Be godlike Hector thy peculiar care,<br/>
Swell his bold heart, and urge his strength to war:<br/>
Let Ilion conquer, till the Achaian train<br/>
Fly to their ships and Hellespont again:<br/>
Then Greece shall breathe from toils." The godhead said;<br/>
His will divine the son of Jove obey'd.<br/>
Not half so swift the sailing falcon flies,<br/>
That drives a turtle through the liquid skies,<br/>
As Phoebus, shooting from the Idaean brow,<br/>
Glides down the mountain to the plain below.<br/>
There Hector seated by the stream he sees,<br/>
His sense returning with the coming breeze;<br/>
Again his pulses beat, his spirits rise;<br/>
Again his loved companions meet his eyes;<br/>
Jove thinking of his pains, they pass'd away,<br/>
To whom the god who gives the golden day:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Why sits great Hector from the field so far?<br/>
What grief, what wound, withholds thee from the war?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The fainting hero, as the vision bright<br/>
Stood shining o'er him, half unseal'd his sight:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What blest immortal, with commanding breath,<br/>
Thus wakens Hector from the sleep of death?<br/>
Has fame not told, how, while my trusty sword<br/>
Bathed Greece in slaughter, and her battle gored,<br/>
The mighty Ajax with a deadly blow<br/>
Had almost sunk me to the shades below?<br/>
Even yet, methinks, the gliding ghosts I spy,<br/>
And hell's black horrors swim before my eye."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To him Apollo: "Be no more dismay'd;<br/>
See, and be strong! the Thunderer sends thee aid.<br/>
Behold! thy Phoebus shall his arms employ,<br/>
Phoebus, propitious still to thee and Troy.<br/>
Inspire thy warriors then with manly force,<br/>
And to the ships impel thy rapid horse:<br/>
Even I will make thy fiery coursers way,<br/>
And drive the Grecians headlong to the sea."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus to bold Hector spoke the son of Jove,<br/>
And breathed immortal ardour from above.<br/>
As when the pamper'd steed, with reins unbound,<br/>
Breaks from his stall, and pours along the ground;<br/>
With ample strokes he rushes to the flood,<br/>
To bathe his sides, and cool his fiery blood;<br/>
His head, now freed, he tosses to the skies;<br/>
His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies:<br/>
He snuffs the females in the well-known plain,<br/>
And springs, exulting, to his fields again:<br/>
Urged by the voice divine, thus Hector flew,<br/>
Full of the god; and all his hosts pursue.<br/>
As when the force of men and dogs combined<br/>
Invade the mountain goat, or branching hind;<br/>
Far from the hunter's rage secure they lie<br/>
Close in the rock, (not fated yet to die)<br/>
When lo! a lion shoots across the way!<br/>
They fly: at once the chasers and the prey.<br/>
So Greece, that late in conquering troops pursued,<br/>
And mark'd their progress through the ranks in blood,<br/>
Soon as they see the furious chief appear,<br/>
Forget to vanquish, and consent to fear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thoas with grief observed his dreadful course,<br/>
Thoas, the bravest of the Ã†tolian force;<br/>
Skill'd to direct the javelin's distant flight,<br/>
And bold to combat in the standing fight,<br/>
Not more in councils famed for solid sense,<br/>
Than winning words and heavenly eloquence.<br/>
"Gods! what portent (he cried) these eyes invades?<br/>
Lo! Hector rises from the Stygian shades!<br/>
We saw him, late, by thundering Ajax kill'd:<br/>
What god restores him to the frighted field;<br/>
And not content that half of Greece lie slain,<br/>
Pours new destruction on her sons again?<br/>
He comes not, Jove! without thy powerful will;<br/>
Lo! still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!<br/>
Yet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand:<br/>
The Greeks' main body to the fleet command;<br/>
But let the few whom brisker spirits warm,<br/>
Stand the first onset, and provoke the storm.<br/>
Thus point your arms; and when such foes appear,<br/>
Fierce as he is, let Hector learn to fear."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The warrior spoke; the listening Greeks obey,<br/>
Thickening their ranks, and form a deep array.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Each Ajax, Teucer, Merion gave command,<br/>
The valiant leader of the Cretan band;<br/>
And Mars-like Meges: these the chiefs excite,<br/>
Approach the foe, and meet the coming fight.<br/>
Behind, unnumber'd multitudes attend,<br/>
To flank the navy, and the shores defend.<br/>
Full on the front the pressing Trojans bear,<br/>
And Hector first came towering to the war.<br/>
Phoebus himself the rushing battle led;<br/>
A veil of clouds involved his radiant head:<br/>
High held before him, Jove's enormous shield<br/>
Portentous shone, and shaded all the field;<br/>
Vulcan to Jove the immortal gift consign'd,<br/>
To scatter hosts and terrify mankind,<br/>
The Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise<br/>
From different parts, and mingle in the skies.<br/>
Dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,<br/>
And arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;<br/>
These drink the life of generous warriors slain:<br/>
Those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.<br/>
As long as Phoebus bore unmoved the shield,<br/>
Sat doubtful conquest hovering o'er the field;<br/>
But when aloft he shakes it in the skies,<br/>
Shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,<br/>
Deep horror seizes every Grecian breast,<br/>
Their force is humbled, and their fear confess'd.<br/>
So flies a herd of oxen, scatter'd wide,<br/>
No swain to guard them, and no day to guide,<br/>
When two fell lions from the mountain come,<br/>
And spread the carnage through the shady gloom.<br/>
Impending Phoebus pours around them fear,<br/>
And Troy and Hector thunder in the rear.<br/>
Heaps fall on heaps: the slaughter Hector leads,<br/>
First great Arcesilas, then Stichius bleeds;<br/>
One to the bold Boeotians ever dear,<br/>
And one Menestheus' friend and famed compeer.<br/>
Medon and Iasus, Ã†neas sped;<br/>
This sprang from Phelus, and the Athenians led;<br/>
But hapless Medon from Oileus came;<br/>
Him Ajax honour'd with a brother's name,<br/>
Though born of lawless love: from home expell'd,<br/>
A banish'd man, in Phylace he dwell'd,<br/>
Press'd by the vengeance of an angry wife;<br/>
Troy ends at last his labours and his life.<br/>
Mecystes next Polydamas o'erthrew;<br/>
And thee, brave Clonius, great Agenor slew.<br/>
By Paris, Deiochus inglorious dies,<br/>
Pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies.<br/>
Polites' arm laid Echius on the plain;<br/>
Stretch'd on one heap, the victors spoil the slain.<br/>
The Greeks dismay'd, confused, disperse or fall,<br/>
Some seek the trench, some skulk behind the wall.<br/>
While these fly trembling, others pant for breath,<br/>
And o'er the slaughter stalks gigantic death.<br/>
On rush'd bold Hector, gloomy as the night;<br/>
Forbids to plunder, animates the fight,<br/>
Points to the fleet: "For, by the gods! who flies,<br/>
Who dares but linger, by this hand he dies;<br/>
No weeping sister his cold eye shall close,<br/>
No friendly hand his funeral pyre compose.<br/>
Who stops to plunder at this signal hour,<br/>
The birds shall tear him, and the dogs devour."<br/>
Furious he said; the smarting scourge resounds;<br/>
The coursers fly; the smoking chariot bounds;<br/>
The hosts rush on; loud clamours shake the shore;<br/>
The horses thunder, earth and ocean roar!<br/>
Apollo, planted at the trench's bound,<br/>
Push'd at the bank: down sank the enormous mound:<br/>
Roll'd in the ditch the heapy ruin lay;<br/>
A sudden road! a long and ample way.<br/>
O'er the dread fosse (a late impervious space)<br/>
Now steeds, and men, and cars tumultuous pass.<br/>
The wondering crowds the downward level trod;<br/>
Before them flamed the shield, and march'd the god.<br/>
Then with his hand he shook the mighty wall;<br/>
And lo! the turrets nod, the bulwarks fall:<br/>
Easy as when ashore an infant stands,<br/>
And draws imagined houses in the sands;<br/>
The sportive wanton, pleased with some new play,<br/>
Sweeps the slight works and fashion'd domes away:<br/>
Thus vanish'd at thy touch, the towers and walls;<br/>
The toil of thousands in a moment falls.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Grecians gaze around with wild despair,<br/>
Confused, and weary all the powers with prayer:<br/>
Exhort their men, with praises, threats, commands;<br/>
And urge the gods, with voices, eyes, and hands.<br/>
Experienced Nestor chief obtests the skies,<br/>
And weeps his country with a father's eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O Jove! if ever, on his native shore,<br/>
One Greek enrich'd thy shrine with offer'd gore;<br/>
If e'er, in hope our country to behold,<br/>
We paid the fattest firstlings of the fold;<br/>
If e'er thou sign'st our wishes with thy nod:<br/>
Perform the promise of a gracious god!<br/>
This day preserve our navies from the flame,<br/>
And save the relics of the Grecian name."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus prayed the sage: the eternal gave consent,<br/>
And peals of thunder shook the firmament.<br/>
Presumptuous Troy mistook the accepting sign,<br/>
And catch'd new fury at the voice divine.<br/>
As, when black tempests mix the seas and skies,<br/>
The roaring deeps in watery mountains rise,<br/>
Above the sides of some tall ship ascend,<br/>
Its womb they deluge, and its ribs they rend:<br/>
Thus loudly roaring, and o'erpowering all,<br/>
Mount the thick Trojans up the Grecian wall;<br/>
Legions on legions from each side arise:<br/>
Thick sound the keels; the storm of arrows flies.<br/>
Fierce on the ships above, the cars below,<br/>
These wield the mace, and those the javelin throw.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While thus the thunder of the battle raged,<br/>
And labouring armies round the works engaged,<br/>
Still in the tent Patroclus sat to tend<br/>
The good Eurypylus, his wounded friend.<br/>
He sprinkles healing balms, to anguish kind,<br/>
And adds discourse, the medicine of the mind.<br/>
But when he saw, ascending up the fleet,<br/>
Victorious Troy; then, starting from his seat,<br/>
With bitter groans his sorrows he express'd,<br/>
He wrings his hands, he beats his manly breast.<br/>
"Though yet thy state require redress (he cries)<br/>
Depart I must: what horrors strike my eyes!<br/>
Charged with Achilles' high command I go,<br/>
A mournful witness of this scene of woe;<br/>
I haste to urge him by his country's care<br/>
To rise in arms, and shine again in war.<br/>
Perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend;<br/>
The voice is powerful of a faithful friend."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; and, speaking, swifter than the wind<br/>
Sprung from the tent, and left the war behind.<br/>
The embodied Greeks the fierce attack sustain,<br/>
But strive, though numerous, to repulse in vain:<br/>
Nor could the Trojans, through that firm array,<br/>
Force to the fleet and tents the impervious way.<br/>
As when a shipwright, with Palladian art,<br/>
Smooths the rough wood, and levels every part;<br/>
With equal hand he guides his whole design,<br/>
By the just rule, and the directing line:<br/>
The martial leaders, with like skill and care,<br/>
Preserved their line, and equal kept the war.<br/>
Brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried,<br/>
And every ship sustained an equal tide.<br/>
At one proud bark, high-towering o'er the fleet,<br/>
Ajax the great, and godlike Hector meet;<br/>
For one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend,<br/>
Nor this the ships can fire, nor that defend:<br/>
One kept the shore, and one the vessel trod;<br/>
That fix'd as fate, this acted by a god.<br/>
The son of Clytius in his daring hand,<br/>
The deck approaching, shakes a flaming brand;<br/>
But, pierced by Telamon's huge lance, expires:<br/>
Thundering he falls, and drops the extinguish'd fires.<br/>
Great Hector view'd him with a sad survey,<br/>
As stretch'd in dust before the stern he lay.<br/>
"Oh! all of Trojan, all of Lycian race!<br/>
Stand to your arms, maintain this arduous space:<br/>
Lo! where the son of royal Clytius lies;<br/>
Ah, save his arms, secure his obsequies!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, his eager javelin sought the foe:<br/>
But Ajax shunn'd the meditated blow.<br/>
Not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown;<br/>
It stretch'd in dust unhappy Lycophron:<br/>
An exile long, sustain'd at Ajax' board,<br/>
A faithful servant to a foreign lord;<br/>
In peace, and war, for ever at his side,<br/>
Near his loved master, as he lived, he died.<br/>
From the high poop he tumbles on the sand,<br/>
And lies a lifeless load along the land.<br/>
With anguish Ajax views the piercing sight,<br/>
And thus inflames his brother to the fight:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Teucer, behold! extended on the shore<br/>
Our friend, our loved companion! now no more!<br/>
Dear as a parent, with a parent's care<br/>
To fight our wars he left his native air.<br/>
This death deplored, to Hector's rage we owe;<br/>
Revenge, revenge it on the cruel foe.<br/>
Where are those darts on which the fates attend?<br/>
And where the bow which Phoebus taught to bend?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Impatient Teucer, hastening to his aid,<br/>
Before the chief his ample bow display'd;<br/>
The well-stored quiver on his shoulders hung:<br/>
Then hiss'd his arrow, and the bowstring sung.<br/>
Clytus, Pisenor's son, renown'd in fame,<br/>
(To thee, Polydamas! an honour'd name)<br/>
Drove through the thickest of the embattled plains<br/>
The startling steeds, and shook his eager reins.<br/>
As all on glory ran his ardent mind,<br/>
The pointed death arrests him from behind:<br/>
Through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies;<br/>
In youth's first bloom reluctantly he dies.<br/>
Hurl'd from the lofty seat, at distance far,<br/>
The headlong coursers spurn his empty car;<br/>
Till sad Polydamas the steeds restrain'd,<br/>
And gave, Astynous, to thy careful hand;<br/>
Then, fired to vengeance, rush'd amidst the foe:<br/>
Rage edged his sword, and strengthen'd every blow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once more bold Teucer, in his country's cause,<br/>
At Hector's breast a chosen arrow draws:<br/>
And had the weapon found the destined way,<br/>
Thy fall, great Trojan! had renown'd that day.<br/>
But Hector was not doom'd to perish then:<br/>
The all-wise disposer of the fates of men<br/>
(Imperial Jove) his present death withstands;<br/>
Nor was such glory due to Teucer's hands.<br/>
At its full stretch as the tough string he drew,<br/>
Struck by an arm unseen, it burst in two;<br/>
Down dropp'd the bow: the shaft with brazen head<br/>
Fell innocent, and on the dust lay dead.<br/>
The astonish'd archer to great Ajax cries;<br/>
"Some god prevents our destined enterprise:<br/>
Some god, propitious to the Trojan foe,<br/>
Has, from my arm unfailing, struck the bow,<br/>
And broke the nerve my hands had twined with art,<br/>
Strong to impel the flight of many a dart."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Since heaven commands it (Ajax made reply)<br/>
Dismiss the bow, and lay thy arrows by:<br/>
Thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield,<br/>
And quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.<br/>
In the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame,<br/>
Thy brave example shall the rest inflame.<br/>
Fierce as they are, by long successes vain;<br/>
To force our fleet, or even a ship to gain,<br/>
Asks toil, and sweat, and blood: their utmost might<br/>
Shall find its matchâ€”No more: 'tis ours to fight."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Teucer laid his faithless bow aside;<br/>
The fourfold buckler o'er his shoulder tied;<br/>
On his brave head a crested helm he placed,<br/>
With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;<br/>
A dart, whose point with brass refulgent shines,<br/>
The warrior wields; and his great brother joins.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This Hector saw, and thus express'd his joy:<br/>
"Ye troops of Lycia, Dardanus, and Troy!<br/>
Be mindful of yourselves, your ancient fame,<br/>
And spread your glory with the navy's flame.<br/>
Jove is with us; I saw his hand, but now,<br/>
From the proud archer strike his vaunted bow:<br/>
Indulgent Jove! how plain thy favours shine,<br/>
When happy nations bear the marks divine!<br/>
How easy then, to see the sinking state<br/>
Of realms accursed, deserted, reprobate!<br/>
Such is the fate of Greece, and such is ours:<br/>
Behold, ye warriors, and exert your powers.<br/>
Death is the worst; a fate which all must try;<br/>
And for our country, 'tis a bliss to die.<br/>
The gallant man, though slain in fight he be,<br/>
Yet leaves his nation safe, his children free;<br/>
Entails a debt on all the grateful state;<br/>
His own brave friends shall glory in his fate;<br/>
His wife live honour'd, all his race succeed,<br/>
And late posterity enjoy the deed!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
This roused the soul in every Trojan breast:<br/>
The godlike Ajax next his Greeks address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"How long, ye warriors of the Argive race,<br/>
(To generous Argos what a dire disgrace!)<br/>
How long on these cursed confines will ye lie,<br/>
Yet undetermined, or to live or die?<br/>
What hopes remain, what methods to retire,<br/>
If once your vessels catch the Trojan fire?<br/>
Mark how the flames approach, how near they fall,<br/>
How Hector calls, and Troy obeys his call!<br/>
Not to the dance that dreadful voice invites,<br/>
It calls to death, and all the rage of fights.<br/>
'Tis now no time for wisdom or debates;<br/>
To your own hands are trusted all your fates;<br/>
And better far in one decisive strife,<br/>
One day should end our labour or our life,<br/>
Than keep this hard-got inch of barren sands,<br/>
Still press'd, and press'd by such inglorious hands."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The listening Grecians feel their leader's flame,<br/>
And every kindling bosom pants for fame.<br/>
Then mutual slaughters spread on either side;<br/>
By Hector here the Phocian Schedius died;<br/>
There, pierced by Ajax, sunk Laodamas,<br/>
Chief of the foot, of old Antenor's race.<br/>
Polydamas laid Otus on the sand,<br/>
The fierce commander of the Epeian band.<br/>
His lance bold Meges at the victor threw;<br/>
The victor, stooping, from the death withdrew;<br/>
(That valued life, O Phoebus! was thy care)<br/>
But Croesmus' bosom took the flying spear:<br/>
His corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore;<br/>
His radiant arms triumphant Meges bore.<br/>
Dolops, the son of Lampus, rushes on,<br/>
Sprung from the race of old Laomedon,<br/>
And famed for prowess in a well-fought field,<br/>
He pierced the centre of his sounding shield:<br/>
But Meges, Phyleus' ample breastplate wore,<br/>
(Well-known in fight on Selle's winding shore;<br/>
For king Euphetes gave the golden mail,<br/>
Compact, and firm with many a jointed scale)<br/>
Which oft, in cities storm'd, and battles won,<br/>
Had saved the father, and now saves the son.<br/>
Full at the Trojan's head he urged his lance,<br/>
Where the high plumes above the helmet dance,<br/>
New ting'd with Tyrian dye: in dust below,<br/>
Shorn from the crest, the purple honours glow.<br/>
Meantime their fight the Spartan king survey'd,<br/>
And stood by Meges' side a sudden aid.<br/>
Through Dolops' shoulder urged his forceful dart,<br/>
Which held its passage through the panting heart,<br/>
And issued at his breast. With thundering sound<br/>
The warrior falls, extended on the ground.<br/>
In rush the conquering Greeks to spoil the slain:<br/>
But Hector's voice excites his kindred train;<br/>
The hero most, from Hicetaon sprung,<br/>
Fierce Melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.<br/>
He (ere to Troy the Grecians cross'd the main)<br/>
Fed his large oxen on Percote's plain;<br/>
But when oppress'd, his country claim'd his care,<br/>
Return'd to Ilion, and excell'd in war;<br/>
For this, in Priam's court, he held his place,<br/>
Beloved no less than Priam's royal race.<br/>
Him Hector singled, as his troops he led,<br/>
And thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lo, Melanippus! lo, where Dolops lies;<br/>
And is it thus our royal kinsman dies?<br/>
O'ermatch'd he falls; to two at once a prey,<br/>
And lo! they bear the bloody arms away!<br/>
Come onâ€”a distant war no longer wage,<br/>
But hand to hand thy country's foes engage:<br/>
Till Greece at once, and all her glory end;<br/>
Or Ilion from her towery height descend,<br/>
Heaved from the lowest stone; and bury all<br/>
In one sad sepulchre, one common fall."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hector (this said) rush'd forward on the foes:<br/>
With equal ardour Melanippus glows:<br/>
Then Ajax thusâ€”"O Greeks! respect your fame,<br/>
Respect yourselves, and learn an honest shame:<br/>
Let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,<br/>
And catch from breast to breast the noble fire,<br/>
On valour's side the odds of combat lie;<br/>
The brave live glorious, or lamented die;<br/>
The wretch that trembles in the field of fame,<br/>
Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame."<br/>
</p>
<p>
His generous sense he not in vain imparts;<br/>
It sunk, and rooted in the Grecian hearts:<br/>
They join, they throng, they thicken at his call,<br/>
And flank the navy with a brazen wall;<br/>
Shields touching shields, in order blaze above,<br/>
And stop the Trojans, though impell'd by Jove.<br/>
The fiery Spartan first, with loud applause.<br/>
Warms the bold son of Nestor in his cause.<br/>
"Is there (he said) in arms a youth like you,<br/>
So strong to fight, so active to pursue?<br/>
Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?<br/>
Lift the bold lance, and make some Trojan bleed."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; and backward to the lines retired;<br/>
Forth rush'd the youth with martial fury fired,<br/>
Beyond the foremost ranks; his lance he threw,<br/>
And round the black battalions cast his view.<br/>
The troops of Troy recede with sudden fear,<br/>
While the swift javelin hiss'd along in air.<br/>
Advancing Melanippus met the dart<br/>
With his bold breast, and felt it in his heart:<br/>
Thundering he falls; his falling arms resound,<br/>
And his broad buckler rings against the ground.<br/>
The victor leaps upon his prostrate prize:<br/>
Thus on a roe the well-breath'd beagle flies,<br/>
And rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart<br/>
The distant hunter sent into his heart.<br/>
Observing Hector to the rescue flew;<br/>
Bold as he was, Antilochus withdrew.<br/>
So when a savage, ranging o'er the plain,<br/>
Has torn the shepherd's dog, or shepherd's swain,<br/>
While conscious of the deed, he glares around,<br/>
And hears the gathering multitude resound,<br/>
Timely he flies the yet-untasted food,<br/>
And gains the friendly shelter of the wood:<br/>
So fears the youth; all Troy with shouts pursue,<br/>
While stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;<br/>
But enter'd in the Grecian ranks, he turns<br/>
His manly breast, and with new fury burns.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove,<br/>
Fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove:<br/>
The sire of gods, confirming Thetis' prayer,<br/>
The Grecian ardour quench'd in deep despair;<br/>
But lifts to glory Troy's prevailing bands,<br/>
Swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.<br/>
On Ida's top he waits with longing eyes,<br/>
To view the navy blazing to the skies;<br/>
Then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,<br/>
The Trojans fly, and conquer'd Ilion burn.<br/>
These fates revolved in his almighty mind,<br/>
He raises Hector to the work design'd,<br/>
Bids him with more than mortal fury glow,<br/>
And drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.<br/>
So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,<br/>
Shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.<br/>
Not with more rage a conflagration rolls,<br/>
Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.<br/>
He foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow<br/>
Like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:<br/>
The radiant helmet on his temple burns,<br/>
Waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:<br/>
For Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,<br/>
And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.<br/>
Unhappy glories! for his fate was near,<br/>
Due to stern Pallas, and Pelides' spear:<br/>
Yet Jove deferr'd the death he was to pay,<br/>
And gave what fate allow'd, the honours of a day!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes<br/>
Burn at each foe, and single every prize;<br/>
Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,<br/>
He points his ardour, and exerts his might.<br/>
The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,<br/>
On all sides batter'd, yet resists his power:<br/>
So some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main,<br/>
By winds assail'd, by billows beat in vain,<br/>
Unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,<br/>
And sees the watery mountains break below.<br/>
Girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall<br/>
Like fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:<br/>
Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,<br/>
And, swell'd with tempests, on the ship descends;<br/>
White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud<br/>
Howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud:<br/>
Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;<br/>
And instant death on every wave appears.<br/>
So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,<br/>
The chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As when a lion, rushing from his den,<br/>
Amidst the plain of some wide-water'd fen,<br/>
(Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,<br/>
At large expatiate o'er the ranker mead)<br/>
Leaps on the herds before the herdsman's eyes;<br/>
The trembling herdsman far to distance flies;<br/>
Some lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)<br/>
He singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.<br/>
Thus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew<br/>
All Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:<br/>
Mycenian Periphes, a mighty name,<br/>
In wisdom great, in arms well known to fame;<br/>
The minister of stern Eurystheus' ire<br/>
Against Alcides, Copreus was his sire:<br/>
The son redeem'd the honours of the race,<br/>
A son as generous as the sire was base;<br/>
O'er all his country's youth conspicuous far<br/>
In every virtue, or of peace or war:<br/>
But doom'd to Hector's stronger force to yield!<br/>
Against the margin of his ample shield<br/>
He struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;<br/>
Supine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.<br/>
On the fallen chief the invading Trojan press'd,<br/>
And plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.<br/>
His circling friends, who strove to guard too late<br/>
The unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Chased from the foremost line, the Grecian train<br/>
Now man the next, receding toward the main:<br/>
Wedged in one body at the tents they stand,<br/>
Wall'd round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.<br/>
Now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;<br/>
Now fear itself confines them to the fight:<br/>
Man courage breathes in man; but Nestor most<br/>
(The sage preserver of the Grecian host)<br/>
Exhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores;<br/>
And by their parents, by themselves implores.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Oh friends! be men: your generous breasts inflame<br/>
With mutual honour, and with mutual shame!<br/>
Think of your hopes, your fortunes; all the care<br/>
Your wives, your infants, and your parents share:<br/>
Think of each living father's reverend head;<br/>
Think of each ancestor with glory dead;<br/>
Absent, by me they speak, by me they sue,<br/>
They ask their safety, and their fame, from you:<br/>
The gods their fates on this one action lay,<br/>
And all are lost, if you desert the day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and round him breathed heroic fires;<br/>
Minerva seconds what the sage inspires.<br/>
The mist of darkness Jove around them threw<br/>
She clear'd, restoring all the war to view;<br/>
A sudden ray shot beaming o'er the plain,<br/>
And show'd the shores, the navy, and the main:<br/>
Hector they saw, and all who fly, or fight,<br/>
The scene wide-opening to the blaze of light,<br/>
First of the field great Ajax strikes their eyes,<br/>
His port majestic, and his ample size:<br/>
A ponderous mace with studs of iron crown'd,<br/>
Full twenty cubits long, he swings around;<br/>
Nor fights, like others, fix'd to certain stands<br/>
But looks a moving tower above the bands;<br/>
High on the decks with vast gigantic stride,<br/>
The godlike hero stalks from side to side.<br/>
So when a horseman from the watery mead<br/>
(Skill'd in the manage of the bounding steed)<br/>
Drives four fair coursers, practised to obey,<br/>
To some great city through the public way;<br/>
Safe in his art, as side by side they run,<br/>
He shifts his seat, and vaults from one to one;<br/>
And now to this, and now to that he flies;<br/>
Admiring numbers follow with their eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From ship to ship thus Ajax swiftly flew,<br/>
No less the wonder of the warring crew.<br/>
As furious, Hector thunder'd threats aloud,<br/>
And rush'd enraged before the Trojan crowd;<br/>
Then swift invades the ships, whose beaky prores<br/>
Lay rank'd contiguous on the bending shores;<br/>
So the strong eagle from his airy height,<br/>
Who marks the swans' or cranes' embodied flight,<br/>
Stoops down impetuous, while they light for food,<br/>
And, stooping, darkens with his wings the flood.<br/>
Jove leads him on with his almighty hand,<br/>
And breathes fierce spirits in his following band.<br/>
The warring nations meet, the battle roars,<br/>
Thick beats the combat on the sounding prores.<br/>
Thou wouldst have thought, so furious was their fire,<br/>
No force could tame them, and no toil could tire;<br/>
As if new vigour from new fights they won,<br/>
And the long battle was but then begun.<br/>
Greece, yet unconquer'd, kept alive the war,<br/>
Secure of death, confiding in despair:<br/>
Troy in proud hopes already view'd the main<br/>
Bright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain:<br/>
Like strength is felt from hope, and from despair,<br/>
And each contends, as his were all the war.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Twas thou, bold Hector! whose resistless hand<br/>
First seized a ship on that contested strand;<br/>
The same which dead Protesilaus bore,<br/>
The first that touch'd the unhappy Trojan shore:<br/>
For this in arms the warring nations stood,<br/>
And bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood.<br/>
No room to poise the lance or bend the bow;<br/>
But hand to hand, and man to man, they grow:<br/>
Wounded, they wound; and seek each other's hearts<br/>
With falchions, axes, swords, and shorten'd darts.<br/>
The falchions ring, shields rattle, axes sound,<br/>
Swords flash in air, or glitter on the ground;<br/>
With streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed,<br/>
And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Still raging, Hector with his ample hand<br/>
Grasps the high stern, and gives this loud command:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Haste, bring the flames! that toil of ten long years<br/>
Is finished; and the day desired appears!<br/>
This happy day with acclamations greet,<br/>
Bright with destruction of yon hostile fleet.<br/>
The coward-counsels of a timorous throng<br/>
Of reverend dotards check'd our glory long:<br/>
Too long Jove lull'd us with lethargic charms,<br/>
But now in peals of thunder calls to arms:<br/>
In this great day he crowns our full desires,<br/>
Wakes all our force, and seconds all our fires."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spokeâ€”the warriors at his fierce command<br/>
Pour a new deluge on the Grecian band.<br/>
Even Ajax paused, (so thick the javelins fly,)<br/>
Stepp'd back, and doubted or to live or die.<br/>
Yet, where the oars are placed, he stands to wait<br/>
What chief approaching dares attempt his fate:<br/>
Even to the last his naval charge defends,<br/>
Now shakes his spear, now lifts, and now protends;<br/>
Even yet, the Greeks with piercing shouts inspires,<br/>
Amidst attacks, and deaths, and darts, and fires.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O friends! O heroes! names for ever dear,<br/>
Once sons of Mars, and thunderbolts of war!<br/>
Ah! yet be mindful of your old renown,<br/>
Your great forefathers' virtues and your own.<br/>
What aids expect you in this utmost strait?<br/>
What bulwarks rising between you and fate?<br/>
No aids, no bulwarks your retreat attend,<br/>
No friends to help, no city to defend.<br/>
This spot is all you have, to lose or keep;<br/>
There stand the Trojans, and here rolls the deep.<br/>
'Tis hostile ground you tread; your native lands<br/>
Far, far from hence: your fates are in your hands."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Raging he spoke; nor further wastes his breath,<br/>
But turns his javelin to the work of death.<br/>
Whate'er bold Trojan arm'd his daring hands,<br/>
Against the sable ships, with flaming brands,<br/>
So well the chief his naval weapon sped,<br/>
The luckless warrior at his stern lay dead:<br/>
Full twelve, the boldest, in a moment fell,<br/>
Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.<br/>

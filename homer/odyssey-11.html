<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XI</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
"Now to the shores we bend, a mournful train,<br/>
Climb the tall bark, and launch into the main;<br/>
At once the mast we rear, at once unbind<br/>
The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind;<br/>
Then pale and pensive stand, with cares oppress'd,<br/>
And solemn horror saddens every breast.<br/>
A freshening breeze the magic power supplied,<br/>
While the wing'd vessel flew along the tide;<br/>
Our oars we shipp'd; all day the swelling sails<br/>
Full from the guiding pilot catch'd the gales.
</p>
<p>
"Now sunk the sun from his aÃ«rial height,<br/>
And o'er the shaded billows rush'd the night;<br/>
When lo! we reach'd old Ocean's utmost bounds,<br/>
Where rocks control his waves with ever-during mounds.
</p>
<p>
"There in a lonely land, and gloomy cells,<br/>
The dusky nation of Cimmeria dwells;<br/>
The sun ne'er views the uncomfortable seats,<br/>
When radiant he advances, or retreats:<br/>
Unhappy race! whom endless night invades,<br/>
Clouds the dull air, and wraps them round in shades.
</p>
<p>
"The ship we moor on these obscure abodes;<br/>
Disbark the sheep, an offering to the gods;<br/>
And, hellward bending, o'er the beach descry<br/>
The doleful passage to the infernal sky.<br/>
The victims, vow'd to each Tartarian power,<br/>
Eurylochus and Perimedes bore.
</p>
<p>
"Here open'd hell, all hell I here implored,<br/>
And from the scabbard drew the shining sword:<br/>
And trenching the black earth on every side,<br/>
A cavern form'd, a cubit long and wide.<br/>
New wine, with honey-temper'd milk, we bring,<br/>
Then living waters from the crystal spring:<br/>
O'er these was strew'd the consecrated flour,<br/>
And on the surface shone the holy store.
</p>
<p>
"Now the wan shades we hail, the infernal gods,<br/>
To speed our course, and waft us o'er the floods:<br/>
So shall a barren heifer from the stall<br/>
Beneath the knife upon your altars fall;<br/>
So in our palace, at our safe return,<br/>
Rich with unnumber'd gifts the pile shall burn;<br/>
So shall a ram, the largest of the breed,<br/>
Black as these regions, to Tiresias bleed.
</p>
<p>
"Thus solemn rites and holy vows we paid<br/>
To all the phantom-nations of the dead;<br/>
Then died the sheep: a purple torrent flow'd,<br/>
And all the caverns smoked with streaming blood.<br/>
When lo! appear'd along the dusky coasts,<br/>
Thin, airy shoals of visionary ghosts:<br/>
Fair, pensive youths, and soft enamour'd maids;<br/>
And wither'd elders, pale and wrinkled shades;<br/>
Ghastly with wounds the forms of warriors slain<br/>
Stalk'd with majestic port, a martial train:<br/>
These and a thousand more swarm'd o'er the ground,<br/>
And all the dire assembly shriek'd around.<br/>
Astonish'd at the sight, aghast I stood,<br/>
And a cold fear ran shivering through my blood;<br/>
Straight I command the sacrifice to haste,<br/>
Straight the flay'd victims to the flames are cast,<br/>
And mutter'd vows, and mystic song applied<br/>
To grisly Pluto, and his gloomy bride.
</p>
<p>
"Now swift I waved my falchion o'er the blood;<br/>
Back started the pale throngs, and trembling stood,<br/>
Round the black trench the gore untasted flows,<br/>
Till awful from the shades Tiresias rose.
</p>
<p>
"There wandering through the gloom I first survey'd,<br/>
New to the realms of death, Elpenor's shade:<br/>
His cold remains all naked to the sky<br/>
On distant shores unwept, unburied lie.<br/>
Sad at the sight I stand, deep fix'd in woe,<br/>
And ere I spoke the tears began to flow.
</p>
<p>
"'O say what angry power Elpenor led<br/>
To glide in shades, and wander with the dead?<br/>
How could thy soul, by realms and seas disjoin'd,<br/>
Outfly the nimble sail, and leave the lagging wind?
</p>
<p>
"The ghost replied: 'To hell my doom I owe,<br/>
Demons accursed, dire ministers of woe!<br/>
My feet, through wine unfaithful to their weight,<br/>
Betray'd me tumbling from a towery height:<br/>
Staggering I reel'd, and as I reel'd I fell,<br/>
Lux'd the neck-joint&mdash;my soul descends to hell.<br/>
But lend me aid, I now conjure thee lend,<br/>
By the soft tie and sacred name of friend!<br/>
By thy fond consort! by thy father's cares!<br/>
By loved Telemachus' blooming years?<br/>
For well I know that soon the heavenly powers<br/>
Will give thee back to-day, and Circe's shores:<br/>
There pious on my cold remains attend,<br/>
There call to mind thy poor departed friend.<br/>
The tribute of a tear is all I crave,<br/>
And the possession of a peaceful grave.<br/>
But if, unheard, in vain compassion plead,<br/>
Revere the gods. The gods avenge the dead!<br/>
A tomb along the watery margin raise,<br/>
The tomb with manly arms and trophies grace,<br/>
To show posterity Elpenor was.<br/>
There high in air, memorial of my name,<br/>
Fix the smooth oar, and bid me live to fame.'
</p>
<p>
"To whom with tears: 'These rites, O mournful shade,<br/>
Due to thy ghost, shall to thy ghost be paid.'
</p>
<p>
"Still as I spoke the phantom seem'd to moan,<br/>
Tear follow'd tear, and groan succeeded groan.<br/>
But, as my waving sword the blood surrounds,<br/>
The shade withdrew, and mutter'd empty sounds.
</p>
<p>
"There as the wondrous visions I survey'd,<br/>
All pale ascends my royal mother's shade:<br/>
A queen, to Troy she saw our legions pass;<br/>
Now a thin form is all Anticlea was!<br/>
Struck at the sight I melt with filial woe,<br/>
And down my cheek the pious sorrows flow,<br/>
Yet as I shook my falchion o'er the blood,<br/>
Regardless of her son the parent stood.
</p>
<p>
"When lo! the mighty Theban I behold,<br/>
To guide his steps he bore a staff of gold;<br/>
Awful he trod; majestic was his look!<br/>
And from his holy lips these accents broke:
</p>
<p>
"'Why, mortal, wanderest thou from cheerful day,<br/>
To tread the downward, melancholy way?<br/>
What angry gods to these dark regions led<br/>
Thee, yet alive, companion of the dead?<br/>
But sheathe thy poniard, while my tongue relates<br/>
Heaven's steadfast purpose, and thy future fates.'
</p>
<p>
"While yet he spoke, the prophet I obey'd,<br/>
And in the scabbard plunged the glittering blade:<br/>
Eager he quaff'd the gore, and then express'd<br/>
Dark things to come, the counsels of his breast.
</p>
<p>
"Weary of light, Ulysses here explores<br/>
A prosperous voyage to his native shores;<br/>
But know&mdash;by me unerring Fates disclose<br/>
New trains of dangers, and new scenes of woes.<br/>
I see, I see, thy bark by Neptune toss'd,<br/>
For injured Cyclops, and his eyeball lost!<br/>
Yet to thy woes the gods decree an end,<br/>
If Heaven thou please: and how to please attend<br/>
Where on Trinacrian rocks the ocean roars,<br/>
Graze numerous herds along the verdant shores;<br/>
Though hunger press, yet fly the dangerous prey,<br/>
The herds are sacred to the god of day,<br/>
Who all surveys with his extensive eye,<br/>
Above, below, on earth, and in the sky!<br/>
Rob not the god; and so propitious gales<br/>
Attend thy voyage, and impel thy sails:<br/>
But, if his herds ye seize, beneath the waves<br/>
I see thy friends o'erwhelm'd in liquid graves!<br/>
The direful wreck Ulysses scarce survives!<br/>
Ulysses at his country scarce arrives!<br/>
Strangers thy guides! nor there thy labours end;<br/>
New foes arise; domestic ills attend!<br/>
There foul adulterers to thy bride resort,<br/>
And lordly gluttons riot in thy court.<br/>
But vengeance hastes amain! These eyes behold<br/>
The deathful scene, princes on princes roll'd!<br/>
That done, a people far from sea explore,<br/>
Who ne'er knew salt, or heard the billows roar,<br/>
Or saw gay vessel stem the watery plain,<br/>
A painted wonder flying on the main!<br/>
Bear on thy back an oar: with strange amaze<br/>
A shepherd meeting thee, the oar surveys,<br/>
And names a van: there fix it on the plain,<br/>
To calm the god that holds the watery reign;<br/>
A threefold offering to his altar bring,<br/>
A bull, a ram, a boar; and hail the ocean king.<br/>
But home return'd, to each ethereal power<br/>
Slay the due victim in the genial hour:<br/>
So peaceful shalt thou end thy blissful days,<br/>
And steal thyself from life by slow decays:<br/>
Unknown to pain, in age resign thy breath,<br/>
When late stern Neptune points the shaft with death:<br/>
To the dark grave retiring as to rest,<br/>
Thy people blessing, by thy people bless'd!
</p>
<p>
"Unerring truths, O man, my lips relate;<br/>
This is thy life to come, and this is fate.'
</p>
<p>
"To whom unmoved: 'If this the gods prepare,<br/>
What Heaven ordains the wise with courage bear.<br/>
But say, why yonder on the lonely strands,<br/>
Unmindful of her son, Anticlea stands?<br/>
Why to the ground she bends her downcast eye?<br/>
Why is she silent, while her son is nigh?<br/>
The latent cause, O sacred seer, reveal!'
</p>
<p>
"'Nor this (replies the seer) will I conceal.<br/>
Know, to the spectres that thy beverage taste,<br/>
The scenes of life recur, and actions past:<br/>
They, seal'd with truth, return the sure reply;<br/>
The rest, repell'd, a train oblivious fly.'
</p>
<p>
"The phantom-prophet ceased, and sunk from sight,<br/>
To the black palace of eternal night.
</p>
<p>
"Still in the dark abodes of death I stood,<br/>
When near Anticlea moved, and drank the blood.<br/>
Straight all the mother in her soul awakes,<br/>
And, owning her Ulysses, thus she speaks;<br/>
'Comest thou, my son, alive, to realms beneath,<br/>
The dolesome realms of darkness and of death!<br/>
Comest thou alive from pure, ethereal day?<br/>
Dire is the region, dismal is the way!<br/>
Here lakes profound, there floods oppose their waves,<br/>
There the wide sea with all his billows raves!<br/>
Or (since to dust proud Troy submits her towers)<br/>
Comest thou a wanderer from the Phrygian shores?<br/>
Or say, since honour call'd thee to the field,<br/>
Hast thou thy Ithaca, thy bride, beheld?'
</p>
<p>
"'Source of my life,' I cried, 'from earth I fly<br/>
To seek Tiresias in the nether sky,<br/>
To learn my doom; for, toss'd from woe to woe,<br/>
In every land Ulysses finds a foe:<br/>
Nor have these eyes beheld my native shores,<br/>
Since in the dust proud Troy submits her towers.
</p>
<p>
"'But, when thy soul from her sweet mansion fled,<br/>
Say, what distemper gave thee to the dead?<br/>
Has life's fair lamp declined by slow decays,<br/>
Or swift expired it in a sudden blaze?<br/>
Say, if my sire, good old Laertes, lives?<br/>
If yet Telemachus, my son, survives?<br/>
Say, by his rule is my dominion awed,<br/>
Or crush'd by traitors with an iron rod?<br/>
Say, if my spouse maintains her royal trust;<br/>
Though tempted, chaste, and obstinately just?<br/>
Or if no more her absent lord she wails,<br/>
But the false woman o'er the wife prevails?'
</p>
<p>
"Thus I, and thus the parent-shade returns:<br/>
'Thee, ever thee, thy faithful consort mourns:<br/>
Whether the night descends or day prevails,<br/>
Thee she by night, and thee by day bewails.<br/>
Thee in Telemachus thy realm obeys;<br/>
In sacred groves celestial rites he pays,<br/>
And shares the banquet in superior state,<br/>
Graced with such honours as become the great<br/>
Thy sire in solitude foments his care:<br/>
The court is joyless, for thou art not there!<br/>
No costly carpets raise his hoary head,<br/>
No rich embroidery shines to grace his bed;<br/>
Even when keen winter freezes in the skies,<br/>
Rank'd with his slaves, on earth the monarch lies:<br/>
Deep are his sighs, his visage pale, his dress<br/>
The garb of woe and habit of distress.<br/>
And when the autumn takes his annual round,<br/>
The leafy honours scattering on the ground,<br/>
Regardless of his years, abroad he lies,<br/>
His bed the leaves, his canopy the skies.<br/>
Thus cares on cares his painful days consume,<br/>
And bow his age with sorrow to the tomb!
</p>
<p>
"'For thee, my son, I wept my life away;<br/>
For thee through hell's eternal dungeons stray:<br/>
Nor came my fate by lingering pains and slow,<br/>
Nor bent the silver-shafted queen her bow;<br/>
No dire disease bereaved me of my breath;<br/>
Thou, thou, my son, wert my disease and death;<br/>
Unkindly with my love my son conspired,<br/>
For thee I lived, for absent thee expired.'
</p>
<p>
"Thrice in my arms I strove her shade to bind,<br/>
Thrice through my arms she slipp'd like empty wind,<br/>
Or dreams, the vain illusions of the mind.<br/>
Wild with despair, I shed a copious tide<br/>
Of flowing tears, and thus with sighs replied:
</p>
<p>
"'Fliest thou, loved shade, while I thus fondly mourn!<br/>
Turn to my arms, to my embraces turn!<br/>
Is it, ye powers that smile at human harms!<br/>
Too great a bliss to weep within her arms?<br/>
Or has hell's queen an empty image sent,<br/>
That wretched I might e'en my joys lament?'
</p>
<p>
"'O son of woe,' the pensive shade rejoin'd;<br/>
'O most inured to grief of all mankind!<br/>
'Tis not the queen of hell who thee deceives;<br/>
All, all are such, when life the body leaves:<br/>
No more the substance of the man remains,<br/>
Nor bounds the blood along the purple veins:<br/>
These the funereal flames in atoms bear,<br/>
To wander with the wind in empty air:<br/>
While the impassive soul reluctant flies,<br/>
Like a vain dream, to these infernal skies.<br/>
But from the dark dominions speed the way,<br/>
And climb the steep ascent to upper day:<br/>
To thy chaste bride the wondrous story tell,<br/>
The woes, the horrors, and the laws of hell.'
</p>
<p>
"Thus while she spoke, in swarms hell's empress brings<br/>
Daughters and wives of heroes and of kings;<br/>
Thick and more thick they gather round the blood,<br/>
Ghost thronged on ghost (a dire assembly) stood!<br/>
Dauntless my sword I seize: the airy crew,<br/>
Swift as it flash'd along the gloom, withdrew;<br/>
Then shade to shade in mutual forms succeeds,<br/>
Her race recounts, and their illustrious deeds.
</p>
<p>
"Tyro began, whom great Salmoneus bred;<br/>
The royal partner of famed Cretheus' bed.<br/>
For fair Enipeus, as from fruitful urns<br/>
He pours his watery store, the virgin burns;<br/>
Smooth flows the gentle stream with wanton pride,<br/>
And in soft mazes rolls a silver tide.<br/>
As on his banks the maid enamour'd roves,<br/>
The monarch of the deep beholds and loves;<br/>
In her Enipeus' form and borrow'd charms<br/>
The amorous god descends into her arms:<br/>
Around, a spacious arch of waves he throws,<br/>
And high in air the liquid mountain rose;<br/>
Thus in surrounding floods conceal'd, he proves<br/>
The pleasing transport, and completes his loves.<br/>
Then, softly sighing, he the fair address'd,<br/>
And as he spoke her tender hand he press'd.<br/>
'Hail, happy nymph! no vulgar births are owed<br/>
To the prolific raptures of a god:<br/>
Lo! when nine times the moon renews her horn,<br/>
Two brother heroes shall from thee be born;<br/>
Thy early care the future worthies claim,<br/>
To point them to the arduous paths of fame;<br/>
But in thy breast the important truth conceal,<br/>
Nor dare the secret of a god reveal:<br/>
For know, thou Neptune view'st! and at my nod<br/>
Earth trembles, and the waves confess their god.'
</p>
<p>
"He added not, but mounting spurn'd the plain,<br/>
Then plunged into the chambers of the main,
</p>
<p>
"Now in the time's full process forth she brings<br/>
Jove's dread vicegerents in two future kings;<br/>
O'er proud Iolcos Pelias stretch'd his reign,<br/>
And godlike Neleus ruled the Pylian plain:<br/>
Then, fruitful, to her Cretheus' royal bed<br/>
She gallant Pheres and famed Aeson bred;<br/>
From the same fountain Amythaon rose,<br/>
Pleased with the din of scar; and noble shout of foes.
</p>
<p>
"There moved Antiope, with haughty charms,<br/>
Who bless'd the almighty Thunderer in her arms:<br/>
Hence sprung Amphion, hence brave Zethus came,<br/>
Founders of Thebes, and men of mighty name;<br/>
Though bold in open field, they yet surround<br/>
The town with walls, and mound inject on mound;<br/>
Here ramparts stood, there towers rose high in air,<br/>
And here through seven wide portals rush'd the war.
</p>
<p>
"There with soft step the fair Alcmena trod,<br/>
Who bore Alcides to the thundering god:<br/>
And Megara, who charm'd the son of Jove,<br/>
And soften'd his stern soul to tender love.
</p>
<p>
"Sullen and sour, with discontented mien,<br/>
Jocasta frown'd, the incestuous Theban queen;<br/>
With her own son she join'd in nuptial bands,<br/>
Though father's blood imbrued his murderous hands<br/>
The gods and men the dire offence detest,<br/>
The gods with all their furies rend his breast;<br/>
In lofty Thebes he wore the imperial crown,<br/>
A pompous wretch! accursed upon a throne.<br/>
The wife self-murder'd from a beam depends,<br/>
And her foul soul to blackest hell descends;<br/>
Thence to her son the choicest plagues she brings,<br/>
And the fiends haunt him with a thousand stings.
</p>
<p>
"And now the beauteous Chloris I descry,<br/>
A lovely shade, Amphion's youngest joy!<br/>
With gifts unnumber'd Neleus sought her arms,<br/>
Nor paid too dearly for unequall'd charms;<br/>
Great in Orchomenos, in Pylos great,<br/>
He sway'd the sceptre with imperial state.<br/>
Three gallant sons the joyful monarch told,<br/>
Sage Nestor, Periclimenus the bold,<br/>
And Chromius last; but of the softer race,<br/>
One nymph alone, a myracle of grace.<br/>
Kings on their thrones for lovely Pero burn;<br/>
The sire denies, and kings rejected mourn.<br/>
To him alone the beauteous prize he yields,<br/>
Whose arm should ravish from Phylacian fields<br/>
The herds of Iphyclus, detain'd in wrong;<br/>
Wild, furious herds, unconquerably strong!<br/>
This dares a seer, but nought the seer prevails,<br/>
In beauty's cause illustriously he fails;<br/>
Twelve moons the foe the captive youth detains<br/>
In painful dungeons, and coercive chains;<br/>
The foe at last from durance where he lay,<br/>
His heart revering, give him back to day;<br/>
Won by prophetic knowledge, to fulfil<br/>
The steadfast purpose of the Almighty will.
</p>
<p>
"With graceful port advancing now I spied,<br/>
Leda the fair, the godlike Tyndar's bride:<br/>
Hence Pollux sprung, who wields the furious sway<br/>
The deathful gauntlet, matchless in the fray;<br/>
And Castor, glorious on the embattled plain,<br/>
Curbs the proud steeds, reluctant to the rein:<br/>
By turns they visit this ethereal sky,<br/>
And live alternate, and alternate die:<br/>
In hell beneath, on earth, in heaven above,<br/>
Reign the twin-gods, the favourite sons of Jove.
</p>
<p>
"There Ephimedia trod the gloomy plain,<br/>
Who charm'd the monarch of the boundless main:<br/>
Hence Ephialtes, hence stern Otus sprung,<br/>
More fierce than giants, more than giants strong;<br/>
The earth o'erburden'd groan'd beneath their weight,<br/>
None but Orion e'er surpassed their height:<br/>
The wondrous youths had scarce nine winters told,<br/>
When high in air, tremendous to behold,<br/>
Nine ells aloft they rear'd their towering head,<br/>
And full nine cubits broad their shoulders spread.<br/>
Proud of their strength, and more than mortal size,<br/>
The gods they challenge, and affect the skies:<br/>
Heaved on Olympus tottering Ossa stood;<br/>
On Ossa, Pelion nods with all his wood.<br/>
Such were they youths! had they to manhood grown<br/>
Almighty Jove had trembled on his throne,<br/>
But ere the harvest of the beard began<br/>
To bristle on the chin, and promise man,<br/>
His shafts Apollo aim'd; at once they sound,<br/>
And stretch the giant monsters o'er the ground.
</p>
<p>
"There mournful Phaedra with sad Procris moves,<br/>
Both beauteous shades, both hapless in their loves;<br/>
And near them walk'd with solemn pace and slow,<br/>
Sad Adriadne, partner of their woe:<br/>
The royal Minos Ariadne bred,<br/>
She Theseus loved, from Crete with Theseus fled:<br/>
Swift to the Dian isle the hero flies,<br/>
And towards his Athens bears the lovely prize;<br/>
There Bacchus with fierce rage Diana fires,<br/>
The goddess aims her shaft, the nymph expires.
</p>
<p>
"There Clymene and Mera I behold,<br/>
There Eriphyle weeps, who loosely sold<br/>
Her lord, her honour, for the lust of gold.<br/>
But should I all recount, the night would fail,<br/>
Unequal to the melancholy tale:<br/>
And all-composing rest my nature craves,<br/>
Here in the court, or yonder on the waves;<br/>
In you I trust, and in the heavenly powers,<br/>
To land Ulysses on his native shores."
</p>
<p>
He ceased; but left so charming on their ear<br/>
His voice, that listening still they seem'd to hear,<br/>
Till, rising up, Arete silence broke,<br/>
Stretch'd out her snowy hand, and thus she spoke:
</p>
<p>
"What wondrous man heaven sends us in our guest;<br/>
Through all his woes the hero shines confess'd;<br/>
His comely port, his ample frame express<br/>
A manly air, majestic in distress.<br/>
He, as my guest, is my peculiar care:<br/>
You share the pleasure, then in bounty share<br/>
To worth in misery a reverence pay,<br/>
And with a generous hand reward his stay;<br/>
For since kind heaven with wealth our realm has bless'd,<br/>
Give it to heaven by aiding the distress'd."
</p>
<p>
Then sage Echeneus, whose grave reverend brow<br/>
The hand of time had silvered o'er with snow,<br/>
Mature in wisdom rose: "Your words (he cries)<br/>
Demand obedience, for your words are wise.<br/>
But let our king direct the glorious way<br/>
To generous acts; our part is to obey."
</p>
<p>
"While life informs these limbs (the king replied),<br/>
Well to deserve, be all my cares employed:<br/>
But here this night the royal guest detain,<br/>
Till the sun flames along the ethereal plain.<br/>
Be it my task to send with ample stores<br/>
The stranger from our hospitable shores:<br/>
Tread you my steps! 'Tis mine to lead the race,<br/>
The first in glory, as the first in place."
</p>
<p>
To whom the prince: "This night with joy I stay<br/>
O monarch great in virtue as in sway!<br/>
If thou the circling year my stay control,<br/>
To raise a bounty noble as thy soul;<br/>
The circling year I wait, with ampler stores<br/>
And fitter pomp to hail my native shores:<br/>
Then by my realms due homage would be paid;<br/>
For wealthy kings are loyally obeyed!"
</p>
<p>
"O king! for such thou art, and sure thy blood<br/>
Through veins (he cried) of royal fathers flow'd:<br/>
Unlike those vagrants who on falsehood live,<br/>
Skill'd in smooth tales, and artful to deceive;<br/>
Thy better soul abhors the liar's part,<br/>
Wise is thy voice, and noble is thy heart.<br/>
Thy words like music every breast control,<br/>
Steal through the ear, and win upon the soul;<br/>
Soft, as some song divine, thy story flows,<br/>
Nor better could the Muse record thy woes.
</p>
<p>
"But say, upon the dark and dismal coast,<br/>
Saw'st thou the worthies of the Grecian host?<br/>
The godlike leaders who, in battle slain,<br/>
Fell before Troy, and nobly press'd the plain?<br/>
And lo! a length of night behind remains,<br/>
The evening stars still mount the ethereal plains.<br/>
Thy tale with raptures I could hear thee tell,<br/>
Thy woes on earth, the wondrous scenes in hell,<br/>
Till in the vault of heaven the stars decay.<br/>
And the sky reddens with the rising day."
</p>
<p>
"O worthy of the power the gods assign'd<br/>
(Ulysses thus replies), a king in mind:<br/>
Since yet the early hour of night allows<br/>
Time for discourse, and time for soft repose,<br/>
If scenes of misery can entertain,<br/>
Woes I unfold, of woes a dismal train.<br/>
Prepare to hear of murder and of blood;<br/>
Of godlike heroes who uninjured stood<br/>
Amidst a war of spears in foreign lands,<br/>
Yet bled at home, and bled by female hands.
</p>
<p>
"Now summon'd Proserpine to hell's black hall<br/>
The heroine shades: they vanish'd at her call.<br/>
When lo! advanced the forms of heroes slain<br/>
By stern AEgysthus, a majestic train:<br/>
And, high above the rest Atrides press'd the plain.<br/>
He quaff'd the gore; and straight his soldier knew,<br/>
And from his eyes pour'd down the tender dew:<br/>
His arms he stretch'd; his arms the touch deceive,<br/>
Nor in the fond embrace, embraces give:<br/>
His substance vanish'd, and his strength decay'd,<br/>
Now all Atrides is an empty shade.
</p>
<p>
"Moved at the sight, I for a apace resign'd<br/>
To soft affliction all my manly mind;<br/>
At last with tears: 'O what relentless doom,<br/>
Imperial phantom, bow'd thee to the tomb?<br/>
Say while the sea, and while the tempest raves,<br/>
Has Fate oppress'd thee in the roaring waves,<br/>
Or nobly seized thee in the dire alarms<br/>
Of war and slaughter, and the clash of arms?'
</p>
<p>
"The ghost returns: 'O chief of human kind<br/>
For active courage and a patient mind;<br/>
Nor while the sea, nor while the tempest raves<br/>
Has Fate oppress'd me on the roaring waves!<br/>
Nor nobly seized me in the dire alarms<br/>
Of war and slaughter, and the clash of arms<br/>
Stabb'd by a murderous hand Atrides died,<br/>
A foul adulterer, and a faithless bride;<br/>
E'en in my mirth, and at the friendly feast,<br/>
O'er the full bowl, the traitor stabb'd his guest;<br/>
Thus by the gory arm of slaughter falls<br/>
The stately ox, and bleeds within the stalls.<br/>
But not with me the direful murder ends,<br/>
These, these expired! their crime, they were my friends:<br/>
Thick as the boars, which some luxurious lord<br/>
Kills for the feast, to crown the nuptial board.<br/>
When war has thunder'd with its loudest storms,<br/>
Death thou hast seen in all her ghastly forms:<br/>
In duel met her on the listed ground,<br/>
When hand to hand they wound return for wound;<br/>
But never have the eyes astonish'd view'd<br/>
So vile a deed, so dire a scene of blood.<br/>
E'en in the flow of joy, when now the bowl<br/>
Glows in our veins, and opens every soul,<br/>
We groan, we faint; with blood the doom is dyed.<br/>
And o'er the pavement floats the dreadful tide&mdash;<br/>
Her breast all gore, with lamentable cries,<br/>
The bleeding innocent Cassandra dies!<br/>
Then though pale death froze cold in every vein,<br/>
My sword I strive to wield, but strive in vain;<br/>
Nor did my traitress wife these eyelids close,<br/>
Or decently in death my limbs compose.<br/>
O woman, woman, when to ill thy mind<br/>
Is bent, all hell contains no fouler fiend:<br/>
And such was mine! who basely plunged her sword<br/>
Through the fond bosom where she reign'd adored!<br/>
Alas! I hoped the toils of war o'ercome,<br/>
To meet soft quiet and repose at home;<br/>
Delusive hope! O wife, thy deeds disgrace<br/>
The perjured sex, and blacken all the race;<br/>
And should posterity one virtuous find,<br/>
Name Clytemnestra, they will curse the kind.'
</p>
<p>
"Oh injured shade (I cried) what mighty woes<br/>
To thy imperial race from woman rose!<br/>
By woman here thou tread'st this mournful strand,<br/>
And Greece by woman lies a desert land.'
</p>
<p>
"'Warn'd by my ills beware, (the shade replies,)<br/>
Nor trust the sex that is so rarely wise;<br/>
When earnest to explore thy secret breast,<br/>
Unfold some trifle, but conceal the rest.<br/>
But in thy consort cease to fear a foe,<br/>
For thee she feels sincerity of woe;<br/>
When Troy first bled beneath the Grecian arms,<br/>
She shone unrivall'd with a blaze of charms;<br/>
Thy infant son her fragrant bosom press'd,<br/>
Hung at her knee, or wanton'd at her breast;<br/>
But now the years a numerous train have ran;<br/>
The blooming boy is ripen'd into man;<br/>
Thy eyes shall see him burn with noble fire,<br/>
The sire shall bless his son, the son his sire;<br/>
But my Orestes never met these eyes,<br/>
Without one look the murder'd father dies;<br/>
Then from a wretched friend this wisdom learn,<br/>
E'en to thy queen disguised, unknown, return;<br/>
For since of womankind so few are just,<br/>
Think all are false, nor e'en the faithful trust.
</p>
<p>
"'But, say, resides my son in royal port,<br/>
In rich Orchomenos, or Sparta's court?<br/>
Or say in Pyle? for yet he views the light,<br/>
Nor glides a phantom through the realms of night.'
</p>
<p>
"Then I: 'Thy suit is vain, nor can I say<br/>
If yet he breathes in realms of cheerful day;<br/>
Or pale or wan beholds these nether skies;<br/>
Truth I revere; for wisdom never lies.'
</p>
<p>
"Thus in a tide of tears our sorrows flow,<br/>
And add new horror to the realms of woe;<br/>
Till side by side along the dreary coast<br/>
Advanced Achilles' and Patroclus' ghost,<br/>
A friendly pair! near these the Pylian stray'd,<br/>
And towering Ajax, an illustrious shade!<br/>
War was his joy, and pleased with loud alarms,<br/>
None but Pelides brighter shone in arms.
</p>
<p>
"Through the thick gloom his friend Achilles knew,<br/>
And as he speaks the tears descend in dew.
</p>
<p>
"'Comest thou alive to view the Stygian bounds,<br/>
Where the wan spectres walk eternal rounds;<br/>
Nor fear'st the dark and dismal waste to tread,<br/>
Throng'd with pale ghosts, familiar with the dead?'
</p>
<p>
"To whom with sighs: 'I pass these dreadful gates<br/>
To seek the Theban, and consult the Fates;<br/>
For still, distress'd, I rove from coast to coast,<br/>
Lost to my friends, and to my country lost.<br/>
But sure the eye of Time beholds no name<br/>
So bless'd as thine in all the rolls of fame;<br/>
Alive we hail'd thee with our guardian gods,<br/>
And dead thou rulest a king in these abodes.'
</p>
<p>
"'Talk not of ruling in this dolorous gloom,<br/>
Nor think vain words (he cried) can ease my doom.<br/>
Rather I'd choose laboriously to bear<br/>
A weight of woes, and breathe the vital air,<br/>
A slave to some poor hind that toils for bread,<br/>
Than reign the sceptred monarch of the dead.<br/>
But say, if in my steps my son proceeds,<br/>
And emulates his godlike father's deeds?<br/>
If at the clash of arms, and shout of foes,<br/>
Swells his bold heart, his bosom nobly glows?<br/>
Say if my sire, the reverend Peleus, reigns,<br/>
Great in his Phthia, and his throne maintains;<br/>
Or, weak and old, my youthful arm demands,<br/>
To fix the sceptre steadfast in his hands?<br/>
O might the lamp of life rekindled burn,<br/>
And death release me from the silent urn!<br/>
This arm, that thunder'd o'er the Phrygian plain,<br/>
And swell'd the ground with mountains of the slain,<br/>
Should vindicate my injured father's fame,<br/>
Crush the proud rebel, and assert his claim.'
</p>
<p>
"'Illustrious shade (I cried), of Peleus' fates<br/>
No circumstance the voice of Fame relates:<br/>
But hear with pleased attention the renown,<br/>
The wars and wisdom of thy gallant son.<br/>
With me from Scyros to the field of fame<br/>
Radiant in arms the blooming hero came.<br/>
When Greece assembled all her hundred states,<br/>
To ripen counsels, and decide debates,<br/>
Heavens! how he charm'd us with a flow of sense,<br/>
And won the heart with manly eloquence!<br/>
He first was seen of all the peers to rise,<br/>
The third in wisdom, where they all were wise!<br/>
But when, to try the fortune of the day,<br/>
Host moved toward host in terrible array,<br/>
Before the van, impatient for the fight,<br/>
With martial port he strode, and stern delight:<br/>
Heaps strew'd on heaps beneath his falchion groan'd,<br/>
And monuments of dead deform'd the ground.<br/>
The time would fail should I in order tell<br/>
What foes were vanquish'd, and what numbers fell:<br/>
How, lost through love, Eurypylus was slain,<br/>
And round him bled his bold Cetaean train.<br/>
To Troy no hero came of nobler line,<br/>
Or if of nobler, Memnon, it was thine.
</p>
<p>
"When Ilion in the horse received her doom,<br/>
And unseen armies ambush'd in its womb,<br/>
Greece gave her latent warriors to my care,<br/>
'Twas mine on Troy to pour the imprison'd war:<br/>
Then when the boldest bosom beat with fear,<br/>
When the stern eyes of heroes dropp'd a tear,<br/>
Fierce in his look his ardent valour glow'd,<br/>
Flush'd in his cheek, or sallied in his blood;<br/>
Indignant in the dark recess he stands,<br/>
Pants for the battle, and the war demands:<br/>
His voice breathed death, and with a martial air<br/>
He grasp'd his sword, and shook his glittering spear.<br/>
And when the gods our arms with conquest crown'd,<br/>
When Troy's proud bulwarks smoked upon the ground,<br/>
Greece, to reward her soldier's gallant toils,<br/>
Heap'd high his navy with unnumber'd spoils.
</p>
<p>
"Thus great in glory, from the din of war<br/>
Safe he return'd, without one hostile scar;<br/>
Though spears in iron tempests rain'd around,<br/>
Yet innocent they play'd, and guiltless of a wound.'
</p>
<p>
"While yet I spoke, the shade with transport glow'd,<br/>
Rose in his majesty, and nobler trod;<br/>
With haughty stalk he sought the distant glades<br/>
Of warrior kings, and join'd the illustrious shades.
</p>
<p>
"Now without number ghost by ghost arose,<br/>
All wailing with unutterable woes.<br/>
Alone, apart, in discontented mood,<br/>
A gloomy shade the sullen Ajax stood;<br/>
For ever sad, with proud disdain he pined,<br/>
And the lost arms for ever stung his mind;<br/>
Though to the contest Thetis gave the laws,<br/>
And Pallas, by the Trojans, judged the cause.<br/>
O why was I victorious in the strife?<br/>
O dear bought honour with so brave a life!<br/>
With him the strength of war, the soldier's pride,<br/>
Our second hope to great Achilles, died!<br/>
Touch'd at the sight from tears I scarce refrain,<br/>
And tender sorrow thrills in every vein;<br/>
Pensive and sad I stand, at length accost<br/>
With accents mild the inexorable ghost:<br/>
'Still burns thy rage? and can brave souls resent<br/>
E'en after death? Relent, great shade, relent!<br/>
Perish those arms which by the gods' decree<br/>
Accursed our army with the loss of thee!<br/>
With thee we fall; Greece wept thy hapless fates,<br/>
And shook astonish'd through her hundred states;<br/>
Not more, when great Achilles press'd the ground,<br/>
And breathed his manly spirit through the wound.<br/>
O deem thy fall not owed to man's decree,<br/>
Jove hated Greece, and punish'd Greece in thee!<br/>
Turn then; oh peaceful turn, thy wrath control,<br/>
And calm the raging tempest of thy soul.'
</p>
<p>
"While yet I speak, the shade disdains to stay,<br/>
In silence turns, and sullen stalks away.
</p>
<p>
"Touch'd at his sour retreat, through deepest night,<br/>
Through hell's black bounds I had pursued his flight,<br/>
And forced the stubborn spectre to reply;<br/>
But wondrous visions drew my curious eye.<br/>
High on a throne, tremendous to behold,<br/>
Stern Minos waves a mace of burnish'd gold;<br/>
Around ten thousand thousand spectres stand<br/>
Through the wide dome of Dis, a trembling band<br/>
Still as they plead, the fatal lots he rolls,<br/>
Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls.
</p>
<p>
"The huge Orion, of portentous size,<br/>
Swift through the gloom a giant-hunter flies:<br/>
A ponderous mace of brass with direful sway<br/>
Aloft he whirls, to crush the savage prey!<br/>
Stern beasts in trains that by his truncheon fell,<br/>
Now grisly forms, shoot o'er the lawns of hell.
</p>
<p>
"There Tityus large and long, in fetters bound,<br/>
O'erspreads nine acres of infernal ground;<br/>
Two ravenous vultures, furious for their food,<br/>
Scream o'er the fiend, and riot in his blood,<br/>
Incessant gore the liver in his breast,<br/>
The immortal liver grows, and gives the immortal feast.<br/>
For as o'er Panope's enamell'd plains<br/>
Latona journey'd to the Pythian fanes,<br/>
With haughty love the audacious monster strove<br/>
To force the goddess, and to rival Jove.
</p>
<p>
"There Tantalus along the Stygian bounds<br/>
Pours out deep groans (with groans all hell resounds);<br/>
E'en in the circling floods refreshment craves,<br/>
And pines with thirst amidst a sea of waves;<br/>
When to the water he his lip applies,<br/>
Back from his lip the treacherous water flies.<br/>
Above, beneath, around his hapless head,<br/>
Trees of all kinds delicious fruitage spread;<br/>
There figs, sky-dyed, a purple hue disclose,<br/>
Green looks the olive, the pomegranate glows.<br/>
There dangling pears exalting scents unfold.<br/>
And yellow apples ripen into gold;<br/>
The fruit he strives to seize; but blasts arise,<br/>
Toss it on high, and whirl it to the skies.
</p>
<p>
"I turn'd my eye, and as I turn'd survey'd<br/>
A mournful vision! the Sisyphian shade;<br/>
With many a weary step, and many a groan,<br/>
Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone;<br/>
The huge round stone, resulting with a bound,<br/>
Thunders impetuous down, and smokes along the ground.<br/>
Again the restless orb his toil renews,<br/>
Dust mounts in clouds, and sweat descends in dews.
</p>
<p>
"Now I the strength of Hercules behold,<br/>
A towering spectre of gigantic mould,<br/>
A shadowy form! for high in heaven's abodes<br/>
Himself resides, a god among the gods;<br/>
There in the bright assemblies of the skies.<br/>
He nectar quaffs, and Hebe crowns his joys.<br/>
Here hovering ghosts, like fowl, his shade surround,<br/>
And clang their pinions with terrific sound;<br/>
Gloomy as night he stands, in act to throw<br/>
The aÃ«rial arrow from the twanging bow.<br/>
Around his breast a wondrous zone is roll'd,<br/>
Where woodland monsters grin in fretted gold;<br/>
There sullen lions sternly seem to roar,<br/>
The bear to growl to foam the tusky boar;<br/>
There war and havoc and destruction stood,<br/>
And vengeful murder red with human blood.<br/>
Thus terribly adorned the figures shine,<br/>
Inimitably wrought with skill divine.<br/>
The mighty good advanced with awful look,<br/>
And, turning his grim visage, sternly spoke:
</p>
<p>
"'O exercise in grief! by arts refined;<br/>
O taught to bear the wrongs of base mankind!<br/>
Such, such was I! Still toss'd from care to care,<br/>
While in your world I drew the vital air!<br/>
E'en I, who from the Lord of Thunders rose,<br/>
Bore toils and dangers, and a weight of woes;<br/>
To a base monarch still a slave confined,<br/>
(The hardest bondage to a generous mind!)<br/>
Down to these worlds I trod the dismal way,<br/>
And dragg'd the three-mouth'd dog to upper day<br/>
E'en hell I conquer'd, through the friendly aid<br/>
Of Maia's offspring, and the martial maid.
</p>
<p>
"Thus he, nor deign'd for our reply to stay,<br/>
But, turning, stalk'd with giant-strides away.
</p>
<p>
"Curious to view the kings of ancient days,<br/>
The mighty dead that live in endless praise,<br/>
Resolved I stand; and haply had survey'd<br/>
The godlike Theseus, and Pirithous' shade;<br/>
But swarms of spectres rose from deepest hell,<br/>
With bloodless visage, and with hideous yell.<br/>
They scream, they shriek; and groans and dismal sounds<br/>
Stun my scared ears, and pierce hell's utmost bounds.<br/>
No more my heart the dismal din sustains,<br/>
And my cold blood hangs shivering in my veins;<br/>
Lest Gorgon, rising from the infernal lakes,<br/>
With horrors arm'd, and curls of hissing snakes,<br/>
Should fix me stiffen'd at the monstrous sight,<br/>
A stony image, in eternal night!<br/>
Straight from the direful coast to purer air<br/>
I speed my flight, and to my mates repair.<br/>
My mates ascend the ship; they strike their oars;<br/>
The mountains lessen, and retreat the shores;<br/>
Swift o'er the waves we fly; the freshening gales<br/>
Sing through the shrouds, and stretch the swelling sails."

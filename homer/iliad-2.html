<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book II</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Now pleasing sleep had seal'd each mortal eye,<br/>
Stretch'd in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:<br/>
The immortals slumber'd on their thrones above;<br/>
All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.<br/>
To honour Thetis' son he bends his care,<br/>
And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:<br/>
Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,<br/>
And thus commands the vision of the night.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,<br/>
To Agamemnon's ample tent repair.<br/>
Bid him in arms draw forth the embattled train,<br/>
Lead all his Grecians to the dusty plain.<br/>
Declare, e'en now 'tis given him to destroy<br/>
The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.<br/>
For now no more the gods with fate contend,<br/>
At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.<br/>
Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,<br/>
And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift as the word the vain illusion fled,<br/>
Descends, and hovers o'er Atrides' head;<br/>
Clothed in the figure of the Pylian sage,<br/>
Renown'd for wisdom, and revered for age:<br/>
Around his temples spreads his golden wing,<br/>
And thus the flattering dream deceives the king.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Canst thou, with all a monarch's cares oppress'd,<br/>
O Atreus' son! canst thou indulge thy rest?<br/>
Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,<br/>
Directs in council, and in war presides,<br/>
To whom its safety a whole people owes,<br/>
To waste long nights in indolent repose.<br/>
Monarch, awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear;<br/>
Thou, and thy glory, claim his heavenly care.<br/>
In just array draw forth the embattled train,<br/>
Lead all thy Grecians to the dusty plain;<br/>
E'en now, O king! 'tis given thee to destroy<br/>
The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.<br/>
For now no more the gods with fate contend,<br/>
At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.<br/>
Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,<br/>
And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.<br/>
Awake, but waking this advice approve,<br/>
And trust the vision that descends from Jove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The phantom said; then vanish'd from his sight,<br/>
Resolves to air, and mixes with the night.<br/>
A thousand schemes the monarch's mind employ;<br/>
Elate in thought he sacks untaken Troy:<br/>
Vain as he was, and to the future blind,<br/>
Nor saw what Jove and secret fate design'd,<br/>
What mighty toils to either host remain,<br/>
What scenes of grief, and numbers of the slain!<br/>
Eager he rises, and in fancy hears<br/>
The voice celestial murmuring in his ears.<br/>
First on his limbs a slender vest he drew,<br/>
Around him next the regal mantle threw,<br/>
The embroider'd sandals on his feet were tied;<br/>
The starry falchion glitter'd at his side;<br/>
And last, his arm the massy sceptre loads,<br/>
Unstain'd, immortal, and the gift of gods.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now rosy Morn ascends the court of Jove,<br/>
Lifts up her light, and opens day above.<br/>
The king despatch'd his heralds with commands<br/>
To range the camp and summon all the bands:<br/>
The gathering hosts the monarch's word obey;<br/>
While to the fleet Atrides bends his way.<br/>
In his black ship the Pylian prince he found;<br/>
There calls a senate of the peers around:<br/>
The assembly placed, the king of men express'd<br/>
The counsels labouring in his artful breast.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Friends and confederates! with attentive ear<br/>
Receive my words, and credit what you hear.<br/>
Late as I slumber'd in the shades of night,<br/>
A dream divine appear'd before my sight;<br/>
Whose visionary form like Nestor came,<br/>
The same in habit, and in mien the same.<br/>
The heavenly phantom hover'd o'er my head,<br/>
â€˜And, dost thou sleep, O Atreus' son? (he said)<br/>
Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,<br/>
Directs in council, and in war presides;<br/>
To whom its safety a whole people owes,<br/>
To waste long nights in indolent repose.<br/>
Monarch, awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear,<br/>
Thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care.<br/>
In just array draw forth the embattled train,<br/>
And lead the Grecians to the dusty plain;<br/>
E'en now, O king! 'tis given thee to destroy<br/>
The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.<br/>
For now no more the gods with fate contend,<br/>
At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.<br/>
Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,<br/>
And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This hear observant, and the gods obey!'<br/>
The vision spoke, and pass'd in air away.<br/>
Now, valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarms,<br/>
Unite, and rouse the sons of Greece to arms.<br/>
But first, with caution, try what yet they dare,<br/>
Worn with nine years of unsuccessful war.<br/>
To move the troops to measure back the main,<br/>
Be mine; and yours the province to detain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and sat: when Nestor, rising said,<br/>
(Nestor, whom Pylos' sandy realms obey'd,)<br/>
"Princes of Greece, your faithful ears incline,<br/>
Nor doubt the vision of the powers divine;<br/>
Sent by great Jove to him who rules the host,<br/>
Forbid it, heaven! this warning should be lost!<br/>
Then let us haste, obey the god's alarms,<br/>
And join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay<br/>
Dissolve the council, and their chief obey:<br/>
The sceptred rulers lead; the following host,<br/>
Pour'd forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.<br/>
As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees<br/>
Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,<br/>
Rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,<br/>
With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;<br/>
Dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,<br/>
And o'er the vale descends the living cloud.<br/>
So, from the tents and ships, a lengthen'd train<br/>
Spreads all the beach, and wide o'ershades the plain:<br/>
Along the region runs a deafening sound;<br/>
Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.<br/>
Fame flies before the messenger of Jove,<br/>
And shining soars, and claps her wings above.<br/>
Nine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud<br/>
The monarch's will, suspend the listening crowd.<br/>
Soon as the throngs in order ranged appear,<br/>
And fainter murmurs died upon the ear,<br/>
The king of kings his awful figure raised:<br/>
High in his hand the golden sceptre blazed;<br/>
The golden sceptre, of celestial flame,<br/>
By Vulcan form'd, from Jove to Hermes came.<br/>
To Pelops he the immortal gift resign'd;<br/>
The immortal gift great Pelops left behind,<br/>
In Atreus' hand, which not with Atreus ends,<br/>
To rich Thyestes next the prize descends;<br/>
And now the mark of Agamemnon's reign,<br/>
Subjects all Argos, and controls the main.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On this bright sceptre now the king reclined,<br/>
And artful thus pronounced the speech design'd:<br/>
"Ye sons of Mars, partake your leader's care,<br/>
Heroes of Greece, and brothers of the war!<br/>
Of partial Jove with justice I complain,<br/>
And heavenly oracles believed in vain<br/>
A safe return was promised to our toils,<br/>
Renown'd, triumphant, and enrich'd with spoils.<br/>
Now shameful flight alone can save the host,<br/>
Our blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.<br/>
So Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!<br/>
At whose command whole empires rise or fall:<br/>
He shakes the feeble props of human trust,<br/>
And towns and armies humbles to the dust.<br/>
What shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage,<br/>
Oh, lasting shame in every future age!<br/>
Once great in arms, the common scorn we grow,<br/>
Repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.<br/>
So small their number, that if wars were ceased,<br/>
And Greece triumphant held a general feast,<br/>
All rank'd by tens, whole decades when they dine<br/>
Must want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.<br/>
But other forces have our hopes o'erthrown,<br/>
And Troy prevails by armies not her own.<br/>
Now nine long years of mighty Jove are run,<br/>
Since first the labours of this war begun:<br/>
Our cordage torn, decay'd our vessels lie,<br/>
And scarce insure the wretched power to fly.<br/>
Haste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall!<br/>
Our weeping wives, our tender children call:<br/>
Love, duty, safety, summon us away,<br/>
'Tis nature's voice, and nature we obey.<br/>
Our shatter'd barks may yet transport us o'er,<br/>
Safe and inglorious, to our native shore.<br/>
Fly, Grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ,<br/>
And dream no more of heaven-defended Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
His deep design unknown, the hosts approve<br/>
Atrides' speech. The mighty numbers move.<br/>
So roll the billows to the Icarian shore,<br/>
From east and south when winds begin to roar,<br/>
Burst their dark mansions in the clouds, and sweep<br/>
The whitening surface of the ruffled deep.<br/>
And as on corn when western gusts descend,<br/>
Before the blast the lofty harvests bend:<br/>
Thus o'er the field the moving host appears,<br/>
With nodding plumes and groves of waving spears.<br/>
The gathering murmur spreads, their trampling feet<br/>
Beat the loose sands, and thicken to the fleet;<br/>
With long-resounding cries they urge the train<br/>
To fit the ships, and launch into the main.<br/>
They toil, they sweat, thick clouds of dust arise,<br/>
The doubling clamours echo to the skies.<br/>
E'en then the Greeks had left the hostile plain,<br/>
And fate decreed the fall of Troy in vain;<br/>
But Jove's imperial queen their flight survey'd,<br/>
And sighing thus bespoke the blue-eyed maid:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Shall then the Grecians fly! O dire disgrace!<br/>
And leave unpunish'd this perfidious race?<br/>
Shall Troy, shall Priam, and the adulterous spouse,<br/>
In peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows?<br/>
And bravest chiefs, in Helen's quarrel slain,<br/>
Lie unrevenged on yon detested plain?<br/>
No: let my Greeks, unmoved by vain alarms,<br/>
Once more refulgent shine in brazen arms.<br/>
Haste, goddess, haste! the flying host detain,<br/>
Nor let one sail be hoisted on the main."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pallas obeys, and from Olympus' height<br/>
Swift to the ships precipitates her flight.<br/>
Ulysses, first in public cares, she found,<br/>
For prudent counsel like the gods renown'd:<br/>
Oppress'd with generous grief the hero stood,<br/>
Nor drew his sable vessels to the flood.<br/>
"And is it thus, divine Laertes' son,<br/>
Thus fly the Greeks (the martial maid begun),<br/>
Thus to their country bear their own disgrace,<br/>
And fame eternal leave to Priam's race?<br/>
Shall beauteous Helen still remain unfreed,<br/>
Still unrevenged, a thousand heroes bleed!<br/>
Haste, generous Ithacus! prevent the shame,<br/>
Recall your armies, and your chiefs reclaim.<br/>
Your own resistless eloquence employ,<br/>
And to the immortals trust the fall of Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The voice divine confess'd the warlike maid,<br/>
Ulysses heard, nor uninspired obey'd:<br/>
Then meeting first Atrides, from his hand<br/>
Received the imperial sceptre of command.<br/>
Thus graced, attention and respect to gain,<br/>
He runs, he flies through all the Grecian train;<br/>
Each prince of name, or chief in arms approved,<br/>
He fired with praise, or with persuasion moved.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Warriors like you, with strength and wisdom bless'd,<br/>
By brave examples should confirm the rest.<br/>
The monarch's will not yet reveal'd appears;<br/>
He tries our courage, but resents our fears.<br/>
The unwary Greeks his fury may provoke;<br/>
Not thus the king in secret council spoke.<br/>
Jove loves our chief, from Jove his honour springs,<br/>
Beware! for dreadful is the wrath of kings."<br/>
</p>
<p>
But if a clamorous vile plebeian rose,<br/>
Him with reproof he check'd or tamed with blows.<br/>
"Be still, thou slave, and to thy betters yield;<br/>
Unknown alike in council and in field!<br/>
Ye gods, what dastards would our host command!<br/>
Swept to the war, the lumber of a land.<br/>
Be silent, wretch, and think not here allow'd<br/>
That worst of tyrants, an usurping crowd.<br/>
To one sole monarch Jove commits the sway;<br/>
His are the laws, and him let all obey."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With words like these the troops Ulysses ruled,<br/>
The loudest silenced, and the fiercest cool'd.<br/>
Back to the assembly roll the thronging train,<br/>
Desert the ships, and pour upon the plain.<br/>
Murmuring they move, as when old ocean roars,<br/>
And heaves huge surges to the trembling shores;<br/>
The groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound,<br/>
The rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound.<br/>
At length the tumult sinks, the noises cease,<br/>
And a still silence lulls the camp to peace.<br/>
Thersites only clamour'd in the throng,<br/>
Loquacious, loud, and turbulent of tongue:<br/>
Awed by no shame, by no respect controll'd,<br/>
In scandal busy, in reproaches bold:<br/>
With witty malice studious to defame,<br/>
Scorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim:â€”<br/>
But chief he gloried with licentious style<br/>
To lash the great, and monarchs to revile.<br/>
His figure such as might his soul proclaim;<br/>
One eye was blinking, and one leg was lame:<br/>
His mountain shoulders half his breast o'erspread,<br/>
Thin hairs bestrew'd his long misshapen head.<br/>
Spleen to mankind his envious heart possess'd,<br/>
And much he hated all, but most the best:<br/>
Ulysses or Achilles still his theme;<br/>
But royal scandal his delight supreme,<br/>
Long had he lived the scorn of every Greek,<br/>
Vex'd when he spoke, yet still they heard him speak.<br/>
Sharp was his voice; which in the shrillest tone,<br/>
Thus with injurious taunts attack'd the throne.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Amidst the glories of so bright a reign,<br/>
What moves the great Atrides to complain?<br/>
'Tis thine whate'er the warrior's breast inflames,<br/>
The golden spoil, and thine the lovely dames.<br/>
With all the wealth our wars and blood bestow,<br/>
Thy tents are crowded and thy chests o'erflow.<br/>
Thus at full ease in heaps of riches roll'd,<br/>
What grieves the monarch? Is it thirst of gold?<br/>
Say, shall we march with our unconquer'd powers<br/>
(The Greeks and I) to Ilion's hostile towers,<br/>
And bring the race of royal bastards here,<br/>
For Troy to ransom at a price too dear?<br/>
But safer plunder thy own host supplies;<br/>
Say, wouldst thou seize some valiant leader's prize?<br/>
Or, if thy heart to generous love be led,<br/>
Some captive fair, to bless thy kingly bed?<br/>
Whate'er our master craves submit we must,<br/>
Plagued with his pride, or punish'd for his lust.<br/>
Oh women of Achaia; men no more!<br/>
Hence let us fly, and let him waste his store<br/>
In loves and pleasures on the Phrygian shore.<br/>
We may be wanted on some busy day,<br/>
When Hector comes: so great Achilles may:<br/>
From him he forced the prize we jointly gave,<br/>
From him, the fierce, the fearless, and the brave:<br/>
And durst he, as he ought, resent that wrong,<br/>
This mighty tyrant were no tyrant long."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs,<br/>
In generous vengeance of the king of kings.<br/>
With indignation sparkling in his eyes,<br/>
He views the wretch, and sternly thus replies:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Peace, factious monster, born to vex the state,<br/>
With wrangling talents form'd for foul debate:<br/>
Curb that impetuous tongue, nor rashly vain,<br/>
And singly mad, asperse the sovereign reign.<br/>
Have we not known thee, slave! of all our host,<br/>
The man who acts the least, upbraids the most?<br/>
Think not the Greeks to shameful flight to bring,<br/>
Nor let those lips profane the name of king.<br/>
For our return we trust the heavenly powers;<br/>
Be that their care; to fight like men be ours.<br/>
But grant the host with wealth the general load,<br/>
Except detraction, what hast thou bestow'd?<br/>
Suppose some hero should his spoils resign,<br/>
Art thou that hero, could those spoils be thine?<br/>
Gods! let me perish on this hateful shore,<br/>
And let these eyes behold my son no more;<br/>
If, on thy next offence, this hand forbear<br/>
To strip those arms thou ill deserv'st to wear,<br/>
Expel the council where our princes meet,<br/>
And send thee scourged and howling through the fleet."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and cowering as the dastard bends,<br/>
The weighty sceptre on his back descends.<br/>
On the round bunch the bloody tumours rise:<br/>
The tears spring starting from his haggard eyes;<br/>
Trembling he sat, and shrunk in abject fears,<br/>
From his vile visage wiped the scalding tears;<br/>
While to his neighbour each express'd his thought:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ye gods! what wonders has Ulysses wrought!<br/>
What fruits his conduct and his courage yield!<br/>
Great in the council, glorious in the field.<br/>
Generous he rises in the crown's defence,<br/>
To curb the factious tongue of insolence,<br/>
Such just examples on offenders shown,<br/>
Sedition silence, and assert the throne."<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Twas thus the general voice the hero praised,<br/>
Who, rising, high the imperial sceptre raised:<br/>
The blue-eyed Pallas, his celestial friend,<br/>
(In form a herald,) bade the crowds attend.<br/>
The expecting crowds in still attention hung,<br/>
To hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue.<br/>
Then deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he spoke,<br/>
His silence thus the prudent hero broke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Unhappy monarch! whom the Grecian race<br/>
With shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.<br/>
Not such at Argos was their generous vow:<br/>
Once all their voice, but ah! forgotten now:<br/>
Ne'er to return, was then the common cry,<br/>
Till Troy's proud structures should in ashes lie.<br/>
Behold them weeping for their native shore;<br/>
What could their wives or helpless children more?<br/>
What heart but melts to leave the tender train,<br/>
And, one short month, endure the wintry main?<br/>
Few leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,<br/>
When the ship tosses, and the tempests beat:<br/>
Then well may this long stay provoke their tears,<br/>
The tedious length of nine revolving years.<br/>
Not for their grief the Grecian host I blame;<br/>
But vanquish'd! baffled! oh, eternal shame!<br/>
Expect the time to Troy's destruction given.<br/>
And try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven.<br/>
What pass'd at Aulis, Greece can witness bear,<br/>
And all who live to breathe this Phrygian air.<br/>
Beside a fountain's sacred brink we raised<br/>
Our verdant altars, and the victims blazed:<br/>
'Twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,<br/>
The altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground<br/>
A mighty dragon shot, of dire portent;<br/>
From Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.<br/>
Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll'd,<br/>
And curl'd around in many a winding fold;<br/>
The topmost branch a mother-bird possess'd;<br/>
Eight callow infants fill'd the mossy nest;<br/>
Herself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung,<br/>
Stretch'd his black jaws and crush'd the crying young;<br/>
While hovering near, with miserable moan,<br/>
The drooping mother wail'd her children gone.<br/>
The mother last, as round the nest she flew,<br/>
Seized by the beating wing, the monster slew;<br/>
Nor long survived: to marble turn'd, he stands<br/>
A lasting prodigy on Aulis' sands.<br/>
Such was the will of Jove; and hence we dare<br/>
Trust in his omen, and support the war.<br/>
For while around we gazed with wondering eyes,<br/>
And trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,<br/>
Full of his god, the reverend Chalcas cried,<br/>
â€˜Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside.<br/>
This wondrous signal Jove himself displays,<br/>
Of long, long labours, but eternal praise.<br/>
As many birds as by the snake were slain,<br/>
So many years the toils of Greece remain;<br/>
But wait the tenth, for Ilion's fall decreed:'<br/>
Thus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed.<br/>
Obey, ye Grecians! with submission wait,<br/>
Nor let your flight avert the Trojan fate."<br/>
He said: the shores with loud applauses sound,<br/>
The hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.<br/>
Then Nestor thusâ€”"These vain debates forbear,<br/>
Ye talk like children, not like heroes dare.<br/>
Where now are all your high resolves at last?<br/>
Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?<br/>
Vow'd with libations and with victims then,<br/>
Now vanish'd like their smoke: the faith of men!<br/>
While useless words consume the unactive hours,<br/>
No wonder Troy so long resists our powers.<br/>
Rise, great Atrides! and with courage sway;<br/>
We march to war, if thou direct the way.<br/>
But leave the few that dare resist thy laws,<br/>
The mean deserters of the Grecian cause,<br/>
To grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares,<br/>
And view with envy our successful wars.<br/>
On that great day, when first the martial train,<br/>
Big with the fate of Ilion, plough'd the main,<br/>
Jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,<br/>
And thunder rolling shook the firmament.<br/>
Encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,<br/>
Till every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife,<br/>
Till Helen's woes at full revenged appear,<br/>
And Troy's proud matrons render tear for tear.<br/>
Before that day, if any Greek invite<br/>
His country's troops to base, inglorious flight,<br/>
Stand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly,<br/>
And die the dastard first, who dreads to die.<br/>
But now, O monarch! all thy chiefs advise:<br/>
Nor what they offer, thou thyself despise.<br/>
Among those counsels, let not mine be vain;<br/>
In tribes and nations to divide thy train:<br/>
His separate troops let every leader call,<br/>
Each strengthen each, and all encourage all.<br/>
What chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,<br/>
Or bravely fights, or ill obeys command,<br/>
When thus distinct they war, shall soon be known<br/>
And what the cause of Ilion not o'erthrown;<br/>
If fate resists, or if our arms are slow,<br/>
If gods above prevent, or men below."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To him the king: "How much thy years excel<br/>
In arts of counsel, and in speaking well!<br/>
O would the gods, in love to Greece, decree<br/>
But ten such sages as they grant in thee;<br/>
Such wisdom soon should Priam's force destroy,<br/>
And soon should fall the haughty towers of Troy!<br/>
But Jove forbids, who plunges those he hates<br/>
In fierce contention and in vain debates:<br/>
Now great Achilles from our aid withdraws,<br/>
By me provoked; a captive maid the cause:<br/>
If e'er as friends we join, the Trojan wall<br/>
Must shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall!<br/>
But now, ye warriors, take a short repast;<br/>
And, well refresh'd, to bloody conflict haste.<br/>
His sharpen'd spear let every Grecian wield,<br/>
And every Grecian fix his brazen shield,<br/>
Let all excite the fiery steeds of war,<br/>
And all for combat fit the rattling car.<br/>
This day, this dreadful day, let each contend;<br/>
No rest, no respite, till the shades descend;<br/>
Till darkness, or till death, shall cover all:<br/>
Let the war bleed, and let the mighty fall;<br/>
Till bathed in sweat be every manly breast,<br/>
With the huge shield each brawny arm depress'd,<br/>
Each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw,<br/>
And each spent courser at the chariot blow.<br/>
Who dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay,<br/>
Who dares to tremble on this signal day;<br/>
That wretch, too mean to fall by martial power,<br/>
The birds shall mangle, and the dogs devour."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The monarch spoke; and straight a murmur rose,<br/>
Loud as the surges when the tempest blows,<br/>
That dash'd on broken rocks tumultuous roar,<br/>
And foam and thunder on the stony shore.<br/>
Straight to the tents the troops dispersing bend,<br/>
The fires are kindled, and the smokes ascend;<br/>
With hasty feasts they sacrifice, and pray,<br/>
To avert the dangers of the doubtful day.<br/>
A steer of five years' age, large limb'd, and fed,<br/>
To Jove's high altars Agamemnon led:<br/>
There bade the noblest of the Grecian peers;<br/>
And Nestor first, as most advanced in years.<br/>
Next came Idomeneus, and Tydeus' son,<br/>
Ajax the less, and Ajax Telamon;<br/>
Then wise Ulysses in his rank was placed;<br/>
And Menelaus came, unbid, the last.<br/>
The chiefs surround the destined beast, and take<br/>
The sacred offering of the salted cake:<br/>
When thus the king prefers his solemn prayer;<br/>
"O thou! whose thunder rends the clouded air,<br/>
Who in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne,<br/>
Supreme of gods! unbounded, and alone!<br/>
Hear! and before the burning sun descends,<br/>
Before the night her gloomy veil extends,<br/>
Low in the dust be laid yon hostile spires,<br/>
Be Priam's palace sunk in Grecian fires.<br/>
In Hector's breast be plunged this shining sword,<br/>
And slaughter'd heroes groan around their lord!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus prayed the chief: his unavailing prayer<br/>
Great Jove refused, and toss'd in empty air:<br/>
The God averse, while yet the fumes arose,<br/>
Prepared new toils, and doubled woes on woes.<br/>
Their prayers perform'd the chiefs the rite pursue,<br/>
The barley sprinkled, and the victim slew.<br/>
The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide,<br/>
The thighs, selected to the gods, divide.<br/>
On these, in double cauls involved with art,<br/>
The choicest morsels lie from every part,<br/>
From the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire<br/>
While the fat victims feed the sacred fire.<br/>
The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress'd<br/>
The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest;<br/>
Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,<br/>
Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.<br/>
Soon as the rage of hunger was suppress'd,<br/>
The generous Nestor thus the prince address'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms,<br/>
And call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms;<br/>
Now seize the occasion, now the troops survey,<br/>
And lead to war when heaven directs the way."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; the monarch issued his commands;<br/>
Straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands;<br/>
The chiefs inclose their king; the hosts divide,<br/>
In tribes and nations rank'd on either side.<br/>
High in the midst the blue-eyed virgin flies;<br/>
From rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes;<br/>
The dreadful aegis, Jove's immortal shield,<br/>
Blazed on her arm, and lighten'd all the field:<br/>
Round the vast orb a hundred serpents roll'd,<br/>
Form'd the bright fringe, and seem'd to burn in gold,<br/>
With this each Grecian's manly breast she warms,<br/>
Swells their bold hearts, and strings their nervous arms,<br/>
No more they sigh, inglorious, to return,<br/>
But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As on some mountain, through the lofty grove,<br/>
The crackling flames ascend, and blaze above;<br/>
The fires expanding, as the winds arise,<br/>
Shoot their long beams, and kindle half the skies:<br/>
So from the polish'd arms, and brazen shields,<br/>
A gleamy splendour flash'd along the fields.<br/>
Not less their number than the embodied cranes,<br/>
Or milk-white swans in Asius' watery plains.<br/>
That, o'er the windings of Cayster's springs,<br/>
Stretch their long necks, and clap their rustling wings,<br/>
Now tower aloft, and course in airy rounds,<br/>
Now light with noise; with noise the field resounds.<br/>
Thus numerous and confused, extending wide,<br/>
The legions crowd Scamander's flowery side;<br/>
With rushing troops the plains are cover'd o'er,<br/>
And thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore.<br/>
Along the river's level meads they stand,<br/>
Thick as in spring the flowers adorn the land,<br/>
Or leaves the trees; or thick as insects play,<br/>
The wandering nation of a summer's day:<br/>
That, drawn by milky steams, at evening hours,<br/>
In gather'd swarms surround the rural bowers;<br/>
From pail to pail with busy murmur run<br/>
The gilded legions, glittering in the sun.<br/>
So throng'd, so close, the Grecian squadrons stood<br/>
In radiant arms, and thirst for Trojan blood.<br/>
Each leader now his scatter'd force conjoins<br/>
In close array, and forms the deepening lines.<br/>
Not with more ease the skilful shepherd-swain<br/>
Collects his flocks from thousands on the plain.<br/>
The king of kings, majestically tall,<br/>
Towers o'er his armies, and outshines them all;<br/>
Like some proud bull, that round the pastures leads<br/>
His subject herds, the monarch of the meads,<br/>
Great as the gods, the exalted chief was seen,<br/>
His strength like Neptune, and like Mars his mien;<br/>
Jove o'er his eyes celestial glories spread,<br/>
And dawning conquest played around his head.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Say, virgins, seated round the throne divine,<br/>
All-knowing goddesses! immortal nine!<br/>
Since earth's wide regions, heaven's umneasur'd height,<br/>
And hell's abyss, hide nothing from your sight,<br/>
(We, wretched mortals! lost in doubts below,<br/>
But guess by rumour, and but boast we know,)<br/>
O say what heroes, fired by thirst of fame,<br/>
Or urged by wrongs, to Troy's destruction came.<br/>
To count them all, demands a thousand tongues,<br/>
A throat of brass, and adamantine lungs.<br/>
Daughters of Jove, assist! inspired by you<br/>
The mighty labour dauntless I pursue;<br/>
What crowded armies, from what climes they bring,<br/>
Their names, their numbers, and their chiefs I sing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The hardy warriors whom Boeotia bred,<br/>
Penelius, Leitus, Prothoenor, led:<br/>
With these Arcesilaus and Clonius stand,<br/>
Equal in arms, and equal in command.<br/>
These head the troops that rocky Aulis yields,<br/>
And Eteon's hills, and Hyrie's watery fields,<br/>
And Schoenos, Scholos, Graea near the main,<br/>
And Mycalessia's ample piny plain;<br/>
Those who in Peteon or Ilesion dwell,<br/>
Or Harma where Apollo's prophet fell;<br/>
Heleon and Hyle, which the springs o'erflow;<br/>
And Medeon lofty, and Ocalea low;<br/>
Or in the meads of Haliartus stray,<br/>
Or Thespia sacred to the god of day:<br/>
Onchestus, Neptune's celebrated groves;<br/>
Copae, and Thisbe, famed for silver doves;<br/>
For flocks Erythrae, Glissa for the vine;<br/>
Platea green, and Nysa the divine;<br/>
And they whom Thebe's well-built walls inclose,<br/>
Where Myde, Eutresis, Corone, rose;<br/>
And Arne rich, with purple harvests crown'd;<br/>
And Anthedon, Boeotia's utmost bound.<br/>
Full fifty ships they send, and each conveys<br/>
Twice sixty warriors through the foaming seas.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To these succeed Aspledon's martial train,<br/>
Who plough the spacious Orchomenian plain.<br/>
Two valiant brothers rule the undaunted throng,<br/>
Ialmen and Ascalaphus the strong:<br/>
Sons of Astyoche, the heavenly fair,<br/>
Whose virgin charms subdued the god of war:<br/>
(In Actor's court as she retired to rest,<br/>
The strength of Mars the blushing maid compress'd)<br/>
Their troops in thirty sable vessels sweep,<br/>
With equal oars, the hoarse-resounding deep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Phocians next in forty barks repair;<br/>
Epistrophus and Schedius head the war:<br/>
From those rich regions where Cephisus leads<br/>
His silver current through the flowery meads;<br/>
From Panopea, Chrysa the divine,<br/>
Where Anemoria's stately turrets shine,<br/>
Where Pytho, Daulis, Cyparissus stood,<br/>
And fair Lilaea views the rising flood.<br/>
These, ranged in order on the floating tide,<br/>
Close, on the left, the bold Boeotians' side.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fierce Ajax led the Locrian squadrons on,<br/>
Ajax the less, Oileus' valiant son;<br/>
Skill'd to direct the flying dart aright;<br/>
Swift in pursuit, and active in the fight.<br/>
Him, as their chief, the chosen troops attend,<br/>
Which Bessa, Thronus, and rich Cynos send;<br/>
Opus, Calliarus, and Scarphe's bands;<br/>
And those who dwell where pleasing Augia stands,<br/>
And where Boagrius floats the lowly lands,<br/>
Or in fair Tarphe's sylvan seats reside:<br/>
In forty vessels cut the yielding tide.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Euboea next her martial sons prepares,<br/>
And sends the brave Abantes to the wars:<br/>
Breathing revenge, in arms they take their way<br/>
From Chalcis' walls, and strong Eretria;<br/>
The Isteian fields for generous vines renown'd,<br/>
The fair Caristos, and the Styrian ground;<br/>
Where Dios from her towers o'erlooks the plain,<br/>
And high Cerinthus views the neighbouring main.<br/>
Down their broad shoulders falls a length of hair;<br/>
Their hands dismiss not the long lance in air;<br/>
But with protended spears in fighting fields<br/>
Pierce the tough corslets and the brazen shields.<br/>
Twice twenty ships transport the warlike bands,<br/>
Which bold Elphenor, fierce in arms, commands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Full fifty more from Athens stem the main,<br/>
Led by Menestheus through the liquid plain.<br/>
(Athens the fair, where great Erectheus sway'd,<br/>
That owed his nurture to the blue-eyed maid,<br/>
But from the teeming furrow took his birth,<br/>
The mighty offspring of the foodful earth.<br/>
Him Pallas placed amidst her wealthy fane,<br/>
Adored with sacrifice and oxen slain;<br/>
Where, as the years revolve, her altars blaze,<br/>
And all the tribes resound the goddess' praise.)<br/>
No chief like thee, Menestheus! Greece could yield,<br/>
To marshal armies in the dusty field,<br/>
The extended wings of battle to display,<br/>
Or close the embodied host in firm array.<br/>
Nestor alone, improved by length of days,<br/>
For martial conduct bore an equal praise.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With these appear the Salaminian bands,<br/>
Whom the gigantic Telamon commands;<br/>
In twelve black ships to Troy they steer their course,<br/>
And with the great Athenians join their force.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next move to war the generous Argive train,<br/>
From high Troezene, and Maseta's plain,<br/>
And fair Ã†gina circled by the main:<br/>
Whom strong Tyrinthe's lofty walls surround,<br/>
And Epidaure with viny harvests crown'd:<br/>
And where fair Asinen and Hermoin show<br/>
Their cliffs above, and ample bay below.<br/>
These by the brave Euryalus were led,<br/>
Great Sthenelus, and greater Diomed;<br/>
But chief Tydides bore the sovereign sway:<br/>
In fourscore barks they plough the watery way.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The proud Mycene arms her martial powers,<br/>
Cleone, Corinth, with imperial towers,<br/>
Fair Araethyrea, Ornia's fruitful plain,<br/>
And Ã†gion, and Adrastus' ancient reign;<br/>
And those who dwell along the sandy shore,<br/>
And where Pellene yields her fleecy store,<br/>
Where Helice and Hyperesia lie,<br/>
And Gonoessa's spires salute the sky.<br/>
Great Agamemnon rules the numerous band,<br/>
A hundred vessels in long order stand,<br/>
And crowded nations wait his dread command.<br/>
High on the deck the king of men appears,<br/>
And his refulgent arms in triumph wears;<br/>
Proud of his host, unrivall'd in his reign,<br/>
In silent pomp he moves along the main.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His brother follows, and to vengeance warms<br/>
The hardy Spartans, exercised in arms:<br/>
Phares and Brysia's valiant troops, and those<br/>
Whom Lacedaemon's lofty hills inclose;<br/>
Or Messe's towers for silver doves renown'd,<br/>
Amyclae, Laas, Augia's happy ground,<br/>
And those whom OEtylos' low walls contain,<br/>
And Helos, on the margin of the main.<br/>
These, o'er the bending ocean, Helen's cause,<br/>
In sixty ships with Menelaus draws:<br/>
Eager and loud from man to man he flies,<br/>
Revenge and fury flaming in his eyes;<br/>
While vainly fond, in fancy oft he hears<br/>
The fair one's grief, and sees her falling tears.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In ninety sail, from Pylos' sandy coast,<br/>
Nestor the sage conducts his chosen host:<br/>
From Amphigenia's ever-fruitful land,<br/>
Where Ã†py high, and little Pteleon stand;<br/>
Where beauteous Arene her structures shows,<br/>
And Thryon's walls Alpheus' streams inclose:<br/>
And Dorion, famed for Thamyris' disgrace,<br/>
Superior once of all the tuneful race,<br/>
Till, vain of mortals' empty praise, he strove<br/>
To match the seed of cloud-compelling Jove!<br/>
Too daring bard! whose unsuccessful pride<br/>
The immortal Muses in their art defied.<br/>
The avenging Muses of the light of day<br/>
Deprived his eyes, and snatch'd his voice away;<br/>
No more his heavenly voice was heard to sing,<br/>
His hand no more awaked the silver string.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Where under high Cyllene, crown'd with wood,<br/>
The shaded tomb of old Ã†pytus stood;<br/>
From Ripe, Stratie, Tegea's bordering towns,<br/>
The Phenean fields, and Orchomenian downs,<br/>
Where the fat herds in plenteous pasture rove;<br/>
And Stymphelus with her surrounding grove;<br/>
Parrhasia, on her snowy cliffs reclined,<br/>
And high Enispe shook by wintry wind,<br/>
And fair Mantinea's ever-pleasing site;<br/>
In sixty sail the Arcadian bands unite.<br/>
Bold Agapenor, glorious at their head,<br/>
(Ancaeus' son) the mighty squadron led.<br/>
Their ships, supplied by Agamemnon's care,<br/>
Through roaring seas the wondering warriors bear;<br/>
The first to battle on the appointed plain,<br/>
But new to all the dangers of the main.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Those, where fair Elis and Buprasium join;<br/>
Whom Hyrmin, here, and Myrsinus confine,<br/>
And bounded there, where o'er the valleys rose<br/>
The Olenian rock; and where Alisium flows;<br/>
Beneath four chiefs (a numerous army) came:<br/>
The strength and glory of the Epean name.<br/>
In separate squadrons these their train divide,<br/>
Each leads ten vessels through the yielding tide.<br/>
One was Amphimachus, and Thalpius one;<br/>
(Eurytus' this, and that Teatus' son;)<br/>
Diores sprung from Amarynceus' line;<br/>
And great Polyxenus, of force divine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But those who view fair Elis o'er the seas<br/>
From the blest islands of the Echinades,<br/>
In forty vessels under Meges move,<br/>
Begot by Phyleus, the beloved of Jove:<br/>
To strong Dulichium from his sire he fled,<br/>
And thence to Troy his hardy warriors led.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ulysses follow'd through the watery road,<br/>
A chief, in wisdom equal to a god.<br/>
With those whom Cephalenia's line inclosed,<br/>
Or till their fields along the coast opposed;<br/>
Or where fair Ithaca o'erlooks the floods,<br/>
Where high Neritos shakes his waving woods,<br/>
Where Ã†gilipa's rugged sides are seen,<br/>
Crocylia rocky, and Zacynthus green.<br/>
These in twelve galleys with vermilion prores,<br/>
Beneath his conduct sought the Phrygian shores.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thoas came next, Andraemon's valiant son,<br/>
From Pleuron's walls, and chalky Calydon,<br/>
And rough Pylene, and the Olenian steep,<br/>
And Chalcis, beaten by the rolling deep.<br/>
He led the warriors from the Ã†tolian shore,<br/>
For now the sons of OEneus were no more!<br/>
The glories of the mighty race were fled!<br/>
OEneus himself, and Meleager dead!<br/>
To Thoas' care now trust the martial train,<br/>
His forty vessels follow through the main.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next, eighty barks the Cretan king commands,<br/>
Of Gnossus, Lyctus, and Gortyna's bands;<br/>
And those who dwell where Rhytion's domes arise,<br/>
Or white Lycastus glitters to the skies,<br/>
Or where by Phaestus silver Jardan runs;<br/>
Crete's hundred cities pour forth all her sons.<br/>
These march'd, Idomeneus, beneath thy care,<br/>
And Merion, dreadful as the god of war.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules,<br/>
Led nine swift vessels through the foamy seas,<br/>
From Rhodes, with everlasting sunshine bright,<br/>
Jalyssus, Lindus, and Camirus white.<br/>
His captive mother fierce Alcides bore<br/>
From Ephyr's walls and Selle's winding shore,<br/>
Where mighty towns in ruins spread the plain,<br/>
And saw their blooming warriors early slain.<br/>
The hero, when to manly years he grew,<br/>
Alcides' uncle, old Licymnius, slew;<br/>
For this, constrain'd to quit his native place,<br/>
And shun the vengeance of the Herculean race,<br/>
A fleet he built, and with a numerous train<br/>
Of willing exiles wander'd o'er the main;<br/>
Where, many seas and many sufferings past,<br/>
On happy Rhodes the chief arrived at last:<br/>
There in three tribes divides his native band,<br/>
And rules them peaceful in a foreign land;<br/>
Increased and prosper'd in their new abodes<br/>
By mighty Jove, the sire of men and gods;<br/>
With joy they saw the growing empire rise,<br/>
And showers of wealth descending from the skies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Three ships with Nireus sought the Trojan shore,<br/>
Nireus, whom Aglae to Charopus bore,<br/>
Nireus, in faultless shape and blooming grace,<br/>
The loveliest youth of all the Grecian race;<br/>
Pelides only match'd his early charms;<br/>
But few his troops, and small his strength in arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next thirty galleys cleave the liquid plain,<br/>
Of those Calydnae's sea-girt isles contain;<br/>
With them the youth of Nisyrus repair,<br/>
Casus the strong, and Crapathus the fair;<br/>
Cos, where Eurypylus possess'd the sway,<br/>
Till great Alcides made the realms obey:<br/>
These Antiphus and bold Phidippus bring,<br/>
Sprung from the god by Thessalus the king.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now, Muse, recount Pelasgic Argos' powers,<br/>
From Alos, Alope, and Trechin's towers:<br/>
From Phthia's spacious vales; and Hella, bless'd<br/>
With female beauty far beyond the rest.<br/>
Full fifty ships beneath Achilles' care,<br/>
The Achaians, Myrmidons, Hellenians bear;<br/>
Thessalians all, though various in their name;<br/>
The same their nation, and their chief the same.<br/>
But now inglorious, stretch'd along the shore,<br/>
They hear the brazen voice of war no more;<br/>
No more the foe they face in dire array:<br/>
Close in his fleet the angry leader lay;<br/>
Since fair Briseis from his arms was torn,<br/>
The noblest spoil from sack'd Lyrnessus borne,<br/>
Then, when the chief the Theban walls o'erthrew,<br/>
And the bold sons of great Evenus slew.<br/>
There mourn'd Achilles, plunged in depth of care,<br/>
But soon to rise in slaughter, blood, and war.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To these the youth of Phylace succeed,<br/>
Itona, famous for her fleecy breed,<br/>
And grassy Pteleon deck'd with cheerful greens,<br/>
The bowers of Ceres, and the sylvan scenes.<br/>
Sweet Pyrrhasus, with blooming flowerets crown'd,<br/>
And Antron's watery dens, and cavern'd ground.<br/>
These own'd, as chief, Protesilas the brave,<br/>
Who now lay silent in the gloomy grave:<br/>
The first who boldly touch'd the Trojan shore,<br/>
And dyed a Phrygian lance with Grecian gore;<br/>
There lies, far distant from his native plain;<br/>
Unfinish'd his proud palaces remain,<br/>
And his sad consort beats her breast in vain.<br/>
His troops in forty ships Podarces led,<br/>
Iphiclus' son, and brother to the dead;<br/>
Nor he unworthy to command the host;<br/>
Yet still they mourn'd their ancient leader lost.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The men who Glaphyra's fair soil partake,<br/>
Where hills incircle Boebe's lowly lake,<br/>
Where Phaere hears the neighbouring waters fall,<br/>
Or proud Iolcus lifts her airy wall,<br/>
In ten black ships embark'd for Ilion's shore,<br/>
With bold Eumelus, whom Alceste bore:<br/>
All Pelias' race Alceste far outshined,<br/>
The grace and glory of the beauteous kind,<br/>
</p>
<p>
The troops Methone or Thaumacia yields,<br/>
Olizon's rocks, or Meliboea's fields,<br/>
With Philoctetes sail'd whose matchless art<br/>
From the tough bow directs the feather'd dart.<br/>
Seven were his ships; each vessel fifty row,<br/>
Skill'd in his science of the dart and bow.<br/>
But he lay raging on the Lemnian ground,<br/>
A poisonous hydra gave the burning wound;<br/>
There groan'd the chief in agonizing pain,<br/>
Whom Greece at length shall wish, nor wish in vain.<br/>
His forces Medon led from Lemnos' shore,<br/>
Oileus' son, whom beauteous Rhena bore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Å’chalian race, in those high towers contain'd<br/>
Where once Eurytus in proud triumph reign'd,<br/>
Or where her humbler turrets Tricca rears,<br/>
Or where Ithome, rough with rocks, appears,<br/>
In thirty sail the sparkling waves divide,<br/>
Which Podalirius and Machaon guide.<br/>
To these his skill their parent-god imparts,<br/>
Divine professors of the healing arts.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The bold Ormenian and Asterian bands<br/>
In forty barks Eurypylus commands.<br/>
Where Titan hides his hoary head in snow,<br/>
And where Hyperia's silver fountains flow.<br/>
Thy troops, Argissa, Polypoetes leads,<br/>
And Eleon, shelter'd by Olympus' shades,<br/>
Gyrtone's warriors; and where Orthe lies,<br/>
And Oloosson's chalky cliffs arise.<br/>
Sprung from Pirithous of immortal race,<br/>
The fruit of fair Hippodame's embrace,<br/>
(That day, when hurl'd from Pelion's cloudy head,<br/>
To distant dens the shaggy Centaurs fled)<br/>
With Polypoetes join'd in equal sway<br/>
Leonteus leads, and forty ships obey.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In twenty sail the bold Perrhaebians came<br/>
From Cyphus, Guneus was their leader's name.<br/>
With these the Enians join'd, and those who freeze<br/>
Where cold Dodona lifts her holy trees;<br/>
Or where the pleasing Titaresius glides,<br/>
And into Peneus rolls his easy tides;<br/>
Yet o'er the silvery surface pure they flow,<br/>
The sacred stream unmix'd with streams below,<br/>
Sacred and awful! from the dark abodes<br/>
Styx pours them forth, the dreadful oath of gods!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Last, under Prothous the Magnesians stood,<br/>
(Prothous the swift, of old Tenthredon's blood;)<br/>
Who dwell where Pelion, crown'd with piny boughs,<br/>
Obscures the glade, and nods his shaggy brows;<br/>
Or where through flowery Tempe Peneus stray'd:<br/>
(The region stretch'd beneath his mighty shade:)<br/>
In forty sable barks they stemm'd the main;<br/>
Such were the chiefs, and such the Grecian train.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Say next, O Muse! of all Achaia breeds,<br/>
Who bravest fought, or rein'd the noblest steeds?<br/>
Eumelus' mares were foremost in the chase,<br/>
As eagles fleet, and of Pheretian race;<br/>
Bred where Pieria's fruitful fountains flow,<br/>
And train'd by him who bears the silver bow.<br/>
Fierce in the fight their nostrils breathed a flame,<br/>
Their height, their colour, and their age the same;<br/>
O'er fields of death they whirl the rapid car,<br/>
And break the ranks, and thunder through the war.<br/>
Ajax in arms the first renown acquired,<br/>
While stern Achilles in his wrath retired:<br/>
(His was the strength that mortal might exceeds,<br/>
And his the unrivall'd race of heavenly steeds:)<br/>
But Thetis' son now shines in arms no more;<br/>
His troops, neglected on the sandy shore.<br/>
In empty air their sportive javelins throw,<br/>
Or whirl the disk, or bend an idle bow:<br/>
Unstain'd with blood his cover'd chariots stand;<br/>
The immortal coursers graze along the strand;<br/>
But the brave chiefs the inglorious life deplored,<br/>
And, wandering o'er the camp, required their lord.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now, like a deluge, covering all around,<br/>
The shining armies sweep along the ground;<br/>
Swift as a flood of fire, when storms arise,<br/>
Floats the wild field, and blazes to the skies.<br/>
Earth groan'd beneath them; as when angry Jove<br/>
Hurls down the forky lightning from above,<br/>
On Arime when he the thunder throws,<br/>
And fires Typhoeus with redoubled blows,<br/>
Where Typhon, press'd beneath the burning load,<br/>
Still feels the fury of the avenging god.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But various Iris, Jove's commands to bear,<br/>
Speeds on the wings of winds through liquid air;<br/>
In Priam's porch the Trojan chiefs she found,<br/>
The old consulting, and the youths around.<br/>
Polites' shape, the monarch's son, she chose,<br/>
Who from Ã†setes' tomb observed the foes,<br/>
High on the mound; from whence in prospect lay<br/>
The fields, the tents, the navy, and the bay.<br/>
In this dissembled form, she hastes to bring<br/>
The unwelcome message to the Phrygian king.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Cease to consult, the time for action calls;<br/>
War, horrid war, approaches to your walls!<br/>
Assembled armies oft have I beheld;<br/>
But ne'er till now such numbers charged a field:<br/>
Thick as autumnal leaves or driving sand,<br/>
The moving squadrons blacken all the strand.<br/>
Thou, godlike Hector! all thy force employ,<br/>
Assemble all the united bands of Troy;<br/>
In just array let every leader call<br/>
The foreign troops: this day demands them all!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The voice divine the mighty chief alarms;<br/>
The council breaks, the warriors rush to arms.<br/>
The gates unfolding pour forth all their train,<br/>
Nations on nations fill the dusky plain,<br/>
Men, steeds, and chariots, shake the trembling ground:<br/>
The tumult thickens, and the skies resound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Amidst the plain, in sight of Ilion, stands<br/>
A rising mount, the work of human hands;<br/>
(This for Myrinne's tomb the immortals know,<br/>
Though call'd Bateia in the world below;)<br/>
Beneath their chiefs in martial order here,<br/>
The auxiliar troops and Trojan hosts appear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The godlike Hector, high above the rest,<br/>
Shakes his huge spear, and nods his plumy crest:<br/>
In throngs around his native bands repair,<br/>
And groves of lances glitter in the air.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Divine Ã†neas brings the Dardan race,<br/>
Anchises' son, by Venus' stolen embrace,<br/>
Born in the shades of Ida's secret grove;<br/>
(A mortal mixing with the queen of love;)<br/>
Archilochus and Acamas divide<br/>
The warrior's toils, and combat by his side.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Who fair Zeleia's wealthy valleys till,<br/>
Fast by the foot of Ida's sacred hill,<br/>
Or drink, Ã†sepus, of thy sable flood,<br/>
Were led by Pandarus, of royal blood;<br/>
To whom his art Apollo deign'd to show,<br/>
Graced with the presents of his shafts and bow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From rich Apaesus and Adrestia's towers,<br/>
High Teree's summits, and Pityea's bowers;<br/>
From these the congregated troops obey<br/>
Young Amphius and Adrastus' equal sway;<br/>
Old Merops' sons; whom, skill'd in fates to come,<br/>
The sire forewarn'd, and prophesied their doom:<br/>
Fate urged them on! the sire forewarn'd in vain,<br/>
They rush'd to war, and perish'd on the plain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From Practius' stream, Percote's pasture lands,<br/>
And Sestos and Abydos' neighbouring strands,<br/>
From great Arisba's walls and Selle's coast,<br/>
Asius Hyrtacides conducts his host:<br/>
High on his car he shakes the flowing reins,<br/>
His fiery coursers thunder o'er the plains.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The fierce Pelasgi next, in war renown'd,<br/>
March from Larissa's ever-fertile ground:<br/>
In equal arms their brother leaders shine,<br/>
Hippothous bold, and Pyleus the divine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next Acamas and Pyrous lead their hosts,<br/>
In dread array, from Thracia's wintry coasts;<br/>
Round the bleak realms where Hellespontus roars,<br/>
And Boreas beats the hoarse-resounding shores.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With great Euphemus the Ciconians move,<br/>
Sprung from Troezenian Ceus, loved by Jove.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pyraechmes the Paeonian troops attend,<br/>
Skill'd in the fight their crooked bows to bend;<br/>
From Axius' ample bed he leads them on,<br/>
Axius, that laves the distant Amydon,<br/>
Axius, that swells with all his neighbouring rills,<br/>
And wide around the floating region fills.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Paphlagonians Pylaemenes rules,<br/>
Where rich Henetia breeds her savage mules,<br/>
Where Erythinus' rising cliffs are seen,<br/>
Thy groves of box, Cytorus! ever green,<br/>
And where Ã†gialus and Cromna lie,<br/>
And lofty Sesamus invades the sky,<br/>
And where Parthenius, roll'd through banks of flowers,<br/>
Reflects her bordering palaces and bowers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here march'd in arms the Halizonian band,<br/>
Whom Odius and Epistrophus command,<br/>
From those far regions where the sun refines<br/>
The ripening silver in Alybean mines.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There mighty Chromis led the Mysian train,<br/>
And augur Ennomus, inspired in vain;<br/>
For stern Achilles lopp'd his sacred head,<br/>
Roll'd down Scamander with the vulgar dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Phorcys and brave Ascanius here unite<br/>
The Ascanian Phrygians, eager for the fight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of those who round Maeonia's realms reside,<br/>
Or whom the vales in shades of Tmolus hide,<br/>
Mestles and Antiphus the charge partake,<br/>
Born on the banks of Gyges' silent lake.<br/>
There, from the fields where wild Maeander flows,<br/>
High Mycale, and Latmos' shady brows,<br/>
And proud Miletus, came the Carian throngs,<br/>
With mingled clamours and with barbarous tongues.<br/>
Amphimachus and Naustes guide the train,<br/>
Naustes the bold, Amphimachus the vain,<br/>
Who, trick'd with gold, and glittering on his car,<br/>
Rode like a woman to the field of war.<br/>
Fool that he was! by fierce Achilles slain,<br/>
The river swept him to the briny main:<br/>
There whelm'd with waves the gaudy warrior lies<br/>
The valiant victor seized the golden prize.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The forces last in fair array succeed,<br/>
Which blameless Glaucus and Sarpedon lead<br/>
The warlike bands that distant Lycia yields,<br/>
Where gulfy Xanthus foams along the fields.<br/>

<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XIX</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Soon as Aurora heaved her Orient head<br/>
Above the waves, that blush'd with early red,<br/>
(With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,<br/>
And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,)<br/>
The immortal arms the goddess-mother bears<br/>
Swift to her son: her son she finds in tears<br/>
Stretch'd o'er Patroclus' corse; while all the rest<br/>
Their sovereign's sorrows in their own express'd.<br/>
A ray divine her heavenly presence shed,<br/>
And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know<br/>
It was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow;<br/>
Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestow'd,<br/>
Arms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then drops the radiant burden on the ground;<br/>
Clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around;<br/>
Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise,<br/>
And from the broad effulgence turn their eyes.<br/>
Unmoved the hero kindles at the show,<br/>
And feels with rage divine his bosom glow;<br/>
From his fierce eyeballs living flames expire,<br/>
And flash incessant like a stream of fire:<br/>
He turns the radiant gift: and feeds his mind<br/>
On all the immortal artist had design'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Goddess! (he cried,) these glorious arms, that shine<br/>
With matchless art, confess the hand divine.<br/>
Now to the bloody battle let me bend:<br/>
But ah! the relics of my slaughter'd friend!<br/>
In those wide wounds through which his spirit fled,<br/>
Shall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"That unavailing care be laid aside,<br/>
(The azure goddess to her son replied,)<br/>
Whole years untouch'd, uninjured shall remain,<br/>
Fresh as in life, the carcase of the slain.<br/>
But go, Achilles, as affairs require,<br/>
Before the Grecian peers renounce thine ire:<br/>
Then uncontroll'd in boundless war engage,<br/>
And heaven with strength supply the mighty rage!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then in the nostrils of the slain she pour'd<br/>
Nectareous drops, and rich ambrosia shower'd<br/>
O'er all the corse. The flies forbid their prey,<br/>
Untouch'd it rests, and sacred from decay.<br/>
Achilles to the strand obedient went:<br/>
The shores resounded with the voice he sent.<br/>
The heroes heard, and all the naval train<br/>
That tend the ships, or guide them o'er the main,<br/>
Alarm'd, transported, at the well-known sound,<br/>
Frequent and full, the great assembly crown'd;<br/>
Studious to see the terror of the plain,<br/>
Long lost to battle, shine in arms again.<br/>
Tydides and Ulysses first appear,<br/>
Lame with their wounds, and leaning on the spear;<br/>
These on the sacred seats of council placed,<br/>
The king of men, Atrides, came the last:<br/>
He too sore wounded by Agenor's son.<br/>
Achilles (rising in the midst) begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O monarch! better far had been the fate<br/>
Of thee, of me, of all the Grecian state,<br/>
If (ere the day when by mad passion sway'd,<br/>
Rash we contended for the black-eyed maid)<br/>
Preventing Dian had despatch'd her dart,<br/>
And shot the shining mischief to the heart!<br/>
Then many a hero had not press'd the shore,<br/>
Nor Troy's glad fields been fatten'd with our gore.<br/>
Long, long shall Greece the woes we caused bewail,<br/>
And sad posterity repeat the tale.<br/>
But this, no more the subject of debate,<br/>
Is past, forgotten, and resign'd to fate.<br/>
Why should, alas, a mortal man, as I,<br/>
Burn with a fury that can never die?<br/>
Here then my anger ends: let war succeed,<br/>
And even as Greece has bled, let Ilion bleed.<br/>
Now call the hosts, and try if in our sight<br/>
Troy yet shall dare to camp a second night!<br/>
I deem, their mightiest, when this arm he knows,<br/>
Shall 'scape with transport, and with joy repose."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: his finish'd wrath with loud acclaim<br/>
The Greeks accept, and shout Pelides' name.<br/>
When thus, not rising from his lofty throne,<br/>
In state unmoved, the king of men begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hear me, ye sons of Greece! with silence hear!<br/>
And grant your monarch an impartial ear:<br/>
Awhile your loud, untimely joy suspend,<br/>
And let your rash, injurious clamours end:<br/>
Unruly murmurs, or ill-timed applause,<br/>
Wrong the best speaker, and the justest cause.<br/>
Nor charge on me, ye Greeks, the dire debate:<br/>
Know, angry Jove, and all-compelling Fate,<br/>
With fell Erinnys, urged my wrath that day<br/>
When from Achilles' arms I forced the prey.<br/>
What then could I against the will of heaven?<br/>
Not by myself, but vengeful Ate driven;<br/>
She, Jove's dread daughter, fated to infest<br/>
The race of mortals, enter'd in my breast.<br/>
Not on the ground that haughty fury treads,<br/>
But prints her lofty footsteps on the heads<br/>
Of mighty men; inflicting as she goes<br/>
Long-festering wounds, inextricable woes!<br/>
Of old, she stalk'd amid the bright abodes;<br/>
And Jove himself, the sire of men and gods,<br/>
The world's great ruler, felt her venom'd dart;<br/>
Deceived by Juno's wiles, and female art:<br/>
For when Alcmena's nine long months were run,<br/>
And Jove expected his immortal son,<br/>
To gods and goddesses the unruly joy<br/>
He show'd, and vaunted of his matchless boy:<br/>
'From us, (he said) this day an infant springs,<br/>
Fated to rule, and born a king of kings.'<br/>
Saturnia ask'd an oath, to vouch the truth,<br/>
And fix dominion on the favour'd youth.<br/>
The Thunderer, unsuspicious of the fraud,<br/>
Pronounced those solemn words that bind a god.<br/>
The joyful goddess, from Olympus' height,<br/>
Swift to Achaian Argos bent her flight:<br/>
Scarce seven moons gone, lay Sthenelus's wife;<br/>
She push'd her lingering infant into life:<br/>
Her charms Alcmena's coming labours stay,<br/>
And stop the babe, just issuing to the day.<br/>
Then bids Saturnius bear his oath in mind;<br/>
'A youth (said she) of Jove's immortal kind<br/>
Is this day born: from Sthenelus he springs,<br/>
And claims thy promise to be king of kings.'<br/>
Grief seized the Thunderer, by his oath engaged;<br/>
Stung to the soul, he sorrow'd, and he raged.<br/>
From his ambrosial head, where perch'd she sate,<br/>
He snatch'd the fury-goddess of debate,<br/>
The dread, the irrevocable oath he swore,<br/>
The immortal seats should ne'er behold her more;<br/>
And whirl'd her headlong down, for ever driven<br/>
From bright Olympus and the starry heaven:<br/>
Thence on the nether world the fury fell;<br/>
Ordain'd with man's contentious race to dwell.<br/>
Full oft the god his son's hard toils bemoan'd,<br/>
Cursed the dire fury, and in secret groan'd.<br/>
Even thus, like Jove himself, was I misled,<br/>
While raging Hector heap'd our camps with dead.<br/>
What can the errors of my rage atone?<br/>
My martial troops, my treasures are thy own:<br/>
This instant from the navy shall be sent<br/>
Whate'er Ulysses promised at thy tent:<br/>
But thou! appeased, propitious to our prayer,<br/>
Resume thy arms, and shine again in war."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O king of nations! whose superior sway<br/>
(Returns Achilles) all our hosts obey!<br/>
To keep or send the presents, be thy care;<br/>
To us, 'tis equal: all we ask is war.<br/>
While yet we talk, or but an instant shun<br/>
The fight, our glorious work remains undone.<br/>
Let every Greek, who sees my spear confound<br/>
The Trojan ranks, and deal destruction round,<br/>
With emulation, what I act survey,<br/>
And learn from thence the business of the day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The son of Peleus thus; and thus replies<br/>
The great in councils, Ithacus the wise:<br/>
"Though, godlike, thou art by no toils oppress'd,<br/>
At least our armies claim repast and rest:<br/>
Long and laborious must the combat be,<br/>
When by the gods inspired, and led by thee.<br/>
Strength is derived from spirits and from blood,<br/>
And those augment by generous wine and food:<br/>
What boastful son of war, without that stay,<br/>
Can last a hero through a single day?<br/>
Courage may prompt; but, ebbing out his strength,<br/>
Mere unsupported man must yield at length;<br/>
Shrunk with dry famine, and with toils declined,<br/>
The drooping body will desert the mind:<br/>
But built anew with strength-conferring fare,<br/>
With limbs and soul untamed, he tires a war.<br/>
Dismiss the people, then, and give command,<br/>
With strong repast to hearten every band;<br/>
But let the presents to Achilles made,<br/>
In full assembly of all Greece be laid.<br/>
The king of men shall rise in public sight,<br/>
And solemn swear (observant of the rite)<br/>
That, spotless, as she came, the maid removes,<br/>
Pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.<br/>
That done, a sumptuous banquet shall be made,<br/>
And the full price of injured honour paid.<br/>
Stretch not henceforth, O prince! thy sovereign might<br/>
Beyond the bounds of reason and of right;<br/>
'Tis the chief praise that e'er to kings belong'd,<br/>
To right with justice whom with power they wrong'd."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To him the monarch: "Just is thy decree,<br/>
Thy words give joy, and wisdom breathes in thee.<br/>
Each due atonement gladly I prepare;<br/>
And heaven regard me as I justly swear!<br/>
Here then awhile let Greece assembled stay,<br/>
Nor great Achilles grudge this short delay.<br/>
Till from the fleet our presents be convey'd,<br/>
And Jove attesting, the firm compact made.<br/>
A train of noble youths the charge shall bear;<br/>
These to select, Ulysses, be thy care:<br/>
In order rank'd let all our gifts appear,<br/>
And the fair train of captives close the rear:<br/>
Talthybius shall the victim boar convey,<br/>
Sacred to Jove, and yon bright orb of day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"For this (the stern Æacides replies)<br/>
Some less important season may suffice,<br/>
When the stern fury of the war is o'er,<br/>
And wrath, extinguish'd, burns my breast no more.<br/>
By Hector slain, their faces to the sky,<br/>
All grim with gaping wounds, our heroes lie:<br/>
Those call to war! and might my voice incite,<br/>
Now, now, this instant, shall commence the fight:<br/>
Then, when the day's complete, let generous bowls,<br/>
And copious banquets, glad your weary souls.<br/>
Let not my palate know the taste of food,<br/>
Till my insatiate rage be cloy'd with blood:<br/>
Pale lies my friend, with wounds disfigured o'er,<br/>
And his cold feet are pointed to the door.<br/>
Revenge is all my soul! no meaner care,<br/>
Interest, or thought, has room to harbour there;<br/>
Destruction be my feast, and mortal wounds,<br/>
And scenes of blood, and agonizing sounds."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O first of Greeks, (Ulysses thus rejoin'd,)<br/>
The best and bravest of the warrior kind!<br/>
Thy praise it is in dreadful camps to shine,<br/>
But old experience and calm wisdom mine.<br/>
Then hear my counsel, and to reason yield,<br/>
The bravest soon are satiate of the field;<br/>
Though vast the heaps that strow the crimson plain,<br/>
The bloody harvest brings but little gain:<br/>
The scale of conquest ever wavering lies,<br/>
Great Jove but turns it, and the victor dies!<br/>
The great, the bold, by thousands daily fall,<br/>
And endless were the grief, to weep for all.<br/>
Eternal sorrows what avails to shed?<br/>
Greece honours not with solemn fasts the dead:<br/>
Enough, when death demands the brave, to pay<br/>
The tribute of a melancholy day.<br/>
One chief with patience to the grave resign'd,<br/>
Our care devolves on others left behind.<br/>
Let generous food supplies of strength produce,<br/>
Let rising spirits flow from sprightly juice,<br/>
Let their warm heads with scenes of battle glow,<br/>
And pour new furies on the feebler foe.<br/>
Yet a short interval, and none shall dare<br/>
Expect a second summons to the war;<br/>
Who waits for that, the dire effects shall find,<br/>
If trembling in the ships he lags behind.<br/>
Embodied, to the battle let us bend,<br/>
And all at once on haughty Troy descend."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now the delegates Ulysses sent,<br/>
To bear the presents from the royal tent:<br/>
The sons of Nestor, Phyleus' valiant heir,<br/>
Thias and Merion, thunderbolts of war,<br/>
With Lycomedes of Creiontian strain,<br/>
And Melanippus, form'd the chosen train.<br/>
Swift as the word was given, the youths obey'd:<br/>
Twice ten bright vases in the midst they laid;<br/>
A row of six fair tripods then succeeds;<br/>
And twice the number of high-bounding steeds:<br/>
Seven captives next a lovely line compose;<br/>
The eighth Briseis, like the blooming rose,<br/>
Closed the bright band: great Ithacus, before,<br/>
First of the train, the golden talents bore:<br/>
The rest in public view the chiefs dispose,<br/>
A splendid scene! then Agamemnon rose:<br/>
The boar Talthybius held: the Grecian lord<br/>
Drew the broad cutlass sheath'd beside his sword:<br/>
The stubborn bristles from the victim's brow<br/>
He crops, and offering meditates his vow.<br/>
His hands uplifted to the attesting skies,<br/>
On heaven's broad marble roof were fixed his eyes.<br/>
The solemn words a deep attention draw,<br/>
And Greece around sat thrill'd with sacred awe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Witness thou first! thou greatest power above,<br/>
All-good, all-wise, and all-surveying Jove!<br/>
And mother-earth, and heaven's revolving light,<br/>
And ye, fell furies of the realms of night,<br/>
Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare<br/>
For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!<br/>
The black-eyed maid inviolate removes,<br/>
Pure and unconscious of my manly loves.<br/>
If this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,<br/>
And levell'd thunder strike my guilty head!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
With that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound;<br/>
The bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;<br/>
The sacred herald rolls the victim slain<br/>
(A feast for fish) into the foaming main.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus Achilles: "Hear, ye Greeks! and know<br/>
Whate'er we feel, 'tis Jove inflicts the woe;<br/>
Not else Atrides could our rage inflame,<br/>
Nor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.<br/>
'Twas Jove's high will alone, o'erruling all,<br/>
That doom'd our strife, and doom'd the Greeks to fall.<br/>
Go then, ye chiefs! indulge the genial rite;<br/>
Achilles waits ye, and expects the fight."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The speedy council at his word adjourn'd:<br/>
To their black vessels all the Greeks return'd.<br/>
Achilles sought his tent. His train before<br/>
March'd onward, bending with the gifts they bore.<br/>
Those in the tents the squires industrious spread:<br/>
The foaming coursers to the stalls they led;<br/>
To their new seats the female captives move.<br/>
Briseis, radiant as the queen of love,<br/>
Slow as she pass'd, beheld with sad survey<br/>
Where, gash'd with cruel wounds, Patroclus lay.<br/>
Prone on the body fell the heavenly fair,<br/>
Beat her sad breast, and tore her golden hair;<br/>
All beautiful in grief, her humid eyes<br/>
Shining with tears she lifts, and thus she cries:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ah, youth for ever dear, for ever kind,<br/>
Once tender friend of my distracted mind!<br/>
I left thee fresh in life, in beauty gay;<br/>
Now find thee cold, inanimated clay!<br/>
What woes my wretched race of life attend!<br/>
Sorrows on sorrows, never doom'd to end!<br/>
The first loved consort of my virgin bed<br/>
Before these eyes in fatal battle bled:<br/>
My three brave brothers in one mournful day<br/>
All trod the dark, irremeable way:<br/>
Thy friendly hand uprear'd me from the plain,<br/>
And dried my sorrows for a husband slain;<br/>
Achilles' care you promised I should prove,<br/>
The first, the dearest partner of his love;<br/>
That rites divine should ratify the band,<br/>
And make me empress in his native land.<br/>
Accept these grateful tears! for thee they flow,<br/>
For thee, that ever felt another's woe!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Her sister captives echoed groan for groan,<br/>
Nor mourn'd Patroclus' fortunes, but their own.<br/>
The leaders press'd the chief on every side;<br/>
Unmoved he heard them, and with sighs denied.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"If yet Achilles have a friend, whose care<br/>
Is bent to please him, this request forbear;<br/>
Till yonder sun descend, ah, let me pay<br/>
To grief and anguish one abstemious day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and from the warriors turn'd his face:<br/>
Yet still the brother-kings of Atreus' race,<br/>
Nestor, Idomeneus, Ulysses sage,<br/>
And Phoenix, strive to calm his grief and rage:<br/>
His rage they calm not, nor his grief control;<br/>
He groans, he raves, he sorrows from his soul.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thou too, Patroclus! (thus his heart he vents)<br/>
Once spread the inviting banquet in our tents:<br/>
Thy sweet society, thy winning care,<br/>
Once stay'd Achilles, rushing to the war.<br/>
But now, alas! to death's cold arms resign'd,<br/>
What banquet but revenge can glad my mind?<br/>
What greater sorrow could afflict my breast,<br/>
What more if hoary Peleus were deceased?<br/>
Who now, perhaps, in Phthia dreads to hear<br/>
His son's sad fate, and drops a tender tear.<br/>
What more, should Neoptolemus the brave,<br/>
My only offspring, sink into the grave?<br/>
If yet that offspring lives; (I distant far,<br/>
Of all neglectful, wage a hateful war.)<br/>
I could not this, this cruel stroke attend;<br/>
Fate claim'd Achilles, but might spare his friend.<br/>
I hoped Patroclus might survive, to rear<br/>
My tender orphan with a parent's care,<br/>
From Scyros' isle conduct him o'er the main,<br/>
And glad his eyes with his paternal reign,<br/>
The lofty palace, and the large domain.<br/>
For Peleus breathes no more the vital air;<br/>
Or drags a wretched life of age and care,<br/>
But till the news of my sad fate invades<br/>
His hastening soul, and sinks him to the shades."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sighing he said: his grief the heroes join'd,<br/>
Each stole a tear for what he left behind.<br/>
Their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey'd,<br/>
And thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Is then Achilles now no more thy care,<br/>
And dost thou thus desert the great in war?<br/>
Lo, where yon sails their canvas wings extend,<br/>
All comfortless he sits, and wails his friend:<br/>
Ere thirst and want his forces have oppress'd,<br/>
Haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; and sudden, at the word of Jove,<br/>
Shot the descending goddess from above.<br/>
So swift through ether the shrill harpy springs,<br/>
The wide air floating to her ample wings,<br/>
To great Achilles she her flight address'd,<br/>
And pour'd divine ambrosia in his breast,<br/>
With nectar sweet, (refection of the gods!)<br/>
Then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now issued from the ships the warrior-train,<br/>
And like a deluge pour'd upon the plain.<br/>
As when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow,<br/>
And scatter o'er the fields the driving snow;<br/>
From dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies,<br/>
Whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies:<br/>
So helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields,<br/>
Catch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields;<br/>
Broad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays,<br/>
Mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze;<br/>
Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound;<br/>
With splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Full in the midst, high-towering o'er the rest,<br/>
His limbs in arms divine Achilles dress'd;<br/>
Arms which the father of the fire bestow'd,<br/>
Forged on the eternal anvils of the god.<br/>
Grief and revenge his furious heart inspire,<br/>
His glowing eyeballs roll with living fire;<br/>
He grinds his teeth, and furious with delay<br/>
O'erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The silver cuishes first his thighs infold;<br/>
Then o'er his breast was braced the hollow gold;<br/>
The brazen sword a various baldric tied,<br/>
That, starr'd with gems, hung glittering at his side;<br/>
And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield<br/>
Blazed with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,<br/>
Wide o'er the watery waste, a light appears,<br/>
Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high,<br/>
Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:<br/>
With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;<br/>
Loud howls the storm, and drives them o'er the main.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next, his high head the helmet graced; behind<br/>
The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:<br/>
Like the red star, that from his flaming hair<br/>
Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;<br/>
So stream'd the golden honours from his head,<br/>
Trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.<br/>
The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;<br/>
His arms he poises, and his motions tries;<br/>
Buoy'd by some inward force, he seems to swim,<br/>
And feels a pinion lifting every limb.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now he shakes his great paternal spear,<br/>
Ponderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear,<br/>
From Pelion's cloudy top an ash entire<br/>
Old Chiron fell'd, and shaped it for his sire;<br/>
A spear which stern Achilles only wields,<br/>
The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Automedon and Alcimus prepare<br/>
The immortal coursers, and the radiant car;<br/>
(The silver traces sweeping at their side;)<br/>
Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied;<br/>
The ivory-studded reins, return'd behind,<br/>
Waved o'er their backs, and to the chariot join'd.<br/>
The charioteer then whirl'd the lash around,<br/>
And swift ascended at one active bound.<br/>
All bright in heavenly arms, above his squire<br/>
Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire;<br/>
Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way<br/>
Flames from his chariot, and restores the day.<br/>
High o'er the host, all terrible he stands,<br/>
And thunders to his steeds these dread commands:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Xanthus and Balius! of Podarges' strain,<br/>
(Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,)<br/>
Be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,<br/>
And learn to make your master more your care:<br/>
Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,<br/>
Nor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The generous Xanthus, as the words he said,<br/>
Seem'd sensible of woe, and droop'd his head:<br/>
Trembling he stood before the golden wain,<br/>
And bow'd to dust the honours of his mane.<br/>
When, strange to tell! (so Juno will'd) he broke<br/>
Eternal silence, and portentous spoke.<br/>
"Achilles! yes! this day at least we bear<br/>
Thy rage in safety through the files of war:<br/>
But come it will, the fatal time must come,<br/>
Not ours the fault, but God decrees thy doom.<br/>
Not through our crime, or slowness in the course,<br/>
Fell thy Patroclus, but by heavenly force;<br/>
The bright far-shooting god who gilds the day<br/>
(Confess'd we saw him) tore his arms away.<br/>
No&mdash;could our swiftness o'er the winds prevail,<br/>
Or beat the pinions of the western gale,<br/>
All were in vain&mdash;the Fates thy death demand,<br/>
Due to a mortal and immortal hand."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,<br/>
His fateful voice. The intrepid chief replied<br/>
With unabated rage&mdash;"So let it be!<br/>
Portents and prodigies are lost on me.<br/>
I know my fate: to die, to see no more<br/>
My much-loved parents, and my native shore&mdash;<br/>
Enough&mdash;when heaven ordains, I sink in night:<br/>
Now perish Troy!" He said, and rush'd to fight.<br/>

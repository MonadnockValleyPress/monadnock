<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book V</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
The saffron morn, with early blushes spread,<br/>
Now rose refulgent from Tithonus' bed;<br/>
With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,<br/>
And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light.<br/>
Then met the eternal synod of the sky,<br/>
Before the god, who thunders from on high,<br/>
Supreme in might, sublime in majesty.<br/>
Pallas, to these, deplores the unequal fates<br/>
Of wise Ulysses and his toils relates:<br/>
Her hero's danger touch'd the pitying power,<br/>
The nymph's seducements, and the magic bower.<br/>
Thus she began her plaint: "Immortal Jove!<br/>
And you who fill the blissful seats above!<br/>
Let kings no more with gentle mercy sway,<br/>
Or bless a people willing to obey,<br/>
But crush the nations with an iron rod,<br/>
And every monarch be the scourge of God.<br/>
If from your thoughts Ulysses you remove,<br/>
Who ruled his subjects with a father's love,<br/>
Sole in an isle, encircled by the main,<br/>
Abandon'd, banish'd from his native reign,<br/>
Unbless'd he sighs, detained by lawless charms,<br/>
And press'd unwilling in Calypso's arms.<br/>
Nor friends are there, nor vessels to convey,<br/>
Nor oars to cut the immeasurable way.<br/>
And now fierce traitors, studious to destroy<br/>
His only son, their ambush'd fraud employ;<br/>
Who, pious, following his great father's fame,<br/>
To sacred Pylos and to Sparta came."
</p>
<p>
"What words are these? (replied the power who forms<br/>
The clouds of night, and darkens heaven with storms;)<br/>
Is not already in thy soul decreed,<br/>
The chief's return shall make the guilty bleed?<br/>
What cannot Wisdom do? Thou may'st restore<br/>
The son in safety to his native shore;<br/>
While the fell foes, who late in ambush lay,<br/>
With fraud defeated measure back their way."
</p>
<p>
Then thus to Hermes the command was given:<br/>
"Hermes, thou chosen messenger of heaven!<br/>
Go, to the nymph be these our orders borne<br/>
'Tis Jove's decree, Ulysses shall return:<br/>
The patient man shall view his old abodes,<br/>
Nor helped by mortal hand, nor guiding gods<br/>
In twice ten days shall fertile Scheria find,<br/>
Alone, and floating to the wave and wind.<br/>
The bold Ph√¶acians there, whose haughty line<br/>
Is mixed with gods, half human, half divine,<br/>
The chief shall honour as some heavenly guest,<br/>
And swift transport him to his place of rest,<br/>
His vessels loaded with a plenteous store<br/>
Of brass, of vestures, and resplendent ore<br/>
(A richer prize than if his joyful isle<br/>
Received him charged with Ilion's noble spoil),<br/>
His friends, his country, he shall see, though late:<br/>
Such is our sovereign will, and such is fate."
</p>
<p>
He spoke. The god who mounts the winged winds<br/>
Fast to his feet the golden pinions binds,<br/>
That high through fields of air his flight sustain<br/>
O'er the wide earth, and o'er the boundless main:<br/>
He grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,<br/>
Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye;<br/>
Then shoots from heaven to high Pieria's steep,<br/>
And stoops incumbent on the rolling deep.<br/>
So watery fowl, that seek their fishy food,<br/>
With wings expanded o'er the foaming flood,<br/>
Now sailing smooth the level surface sweep,<br/>
Now dip their pinions in the briny deep;<br/>
Thus o'er the world of waters Hermes flew,<br/>
Till now the distant island rose in view:<br/>
Then, swift ascending from the azure wave,<br/>
He took the path that winded to the cave.<br/>
Large was the grot, in which the nymph he found<br/>
(The fair-hair'd nymph with every beauty crown'd).<br/>
The cave was brighten'd with a rising blaze;<br/>
Cedar and frankincense, an odorous pile,<br/>
Flamed on the hearth, and wide perfumed the isle;<br/>
While she with work and song the time divides,<br/>
And through the loom the golden shuttle guides.<br/>
Without the grot a various sylvan scene<br/>
Appear'd around, and groves of living green;<br/>
Poplars and alders ever quivering play'd,<br/>
And nodding cypress form'd a fragrant shade:<br/>
On whose high branches, waving with the storm,<br/>
The birds of broadest wing their mansions form,&mdash;<br/>
The chough, the sea-mew, the loquacious crow,&mdash;<br/>
and scream aloft, and skim the deeps below.<br/>
Depending vines the shelving cavern screen.<br/>
With purple clusters blushing through the green.<br/>
Four limpid fountains from the clefts distil:<br/>
And every fountain pours a several rill,<br/>
In mazy windings wandering down the hill:<br/>
Where bloomy meads with vivid greens were crown'd,<br/>
And glowing violets threw odours round.<br/>
A scene, where, if a god should cast his sight,<br/>
A god might gaze, and wander with delight!<br/>
Joy touch'd the messenger of heaven: he stay'd<br/>
Entranced, and all the blissful haunts surveyed.<br/>
Him, entering in the cave, Calypso knew;<br/>
For powers celestial to each other's view<br/>
Stand still confess'd, though distant far they lie<br/>
To habitants of earth, or sea, or sky.<br/>
But sad Ulysses, by himself apart,<br/>
Pour'd the big sorrows of his swelling heart;<br/>
All on the lonely shore he sate to weep,<br/>
And roll'd his eyes around the restless deep:<br/>
Toward his loved coast he roll'd his eyes in vain,<br/>
Till, dimm'd with rising grief, they stream'd again.
</p>
<p>
Now graceful seated on her shining throne,<br/>
To Hermes thus the nymph divine begun:
</p>
<p>
"God of the golden wand! on what behest<br/>
Arrivest thou here, an unexpected guest?<br/>
Loved as thou art, thy free injunctions lay;<br/>
'Tis mine with joy and duty to obey.<br/>
Till now a stranger, in a happy hour<br/>
Approach, and taste the dainties of my bower."
</p>
<p>
Thus having spoke, the nymph the table spread<br/>
(Ambrosial cates, with nectar rosy-red);<br/>
Hermes the hospitable rite partook,<br/>
Divine refection! then, recruited, spoke:
</p>
<p>
"What moves this journey from my native sky,<br/>
A goddess asks, nor can a god deny.<br/>
Hear then the truth. By mighty Jove's command<br/>
Unwilling have I trod this pleasing land:<br/>
For who, self-moved, with weary wing would sweep<br/>
Such length of ocean and unmeasured deep;<br/>
A world of waters! far from all the ways<br/>
Where men frequent, or sacred altars blaze!<br/>
But to Jove's will submission we must pay;<br/>
What power so great to dare to disobey?<br/>
A man, he says, a man resides with thee,<br/>
Of all his kind most worn with misery.<br/>
The Greeks, (whose arms for nine long year employ'd<br/>
Their force on Ilion, in the tenth destroy'd,)<br/>
At length, embarking in a luckless hour,<br/>
With conquest proud, incensed Minerva's power:<br/>
Hence on the guilty race her vengeance hurl'd,<br/>
With storms pursued them through the liquid world.<br/>
There all his vessels sunk beneath the wave!<br/>
There all his dear companions found their grave!<br/>
Saved from the jaws of death by Heaven's decree,<br/>
The tempest drove him to these shores and thee.<br/>
Him, Jove now orders to his native lands<br/>
Straight to dismiss: so destiny commands:<br/>
Impatient Fate his near return attends,<br/>
And calls him to his country, and his friends."
</p>
<p>
E'en to her inmost soul the goddess shook;<br/>
Then thus her anguish, and her passion broke:<br/>
"Ungracious gods! with spite and envy cursed!<br/>
Still to your own ethereal race the worst!<br/>
Ye envy mortal and immortal joy,<br/>
And love, the only sweet of life destroy,<br/>
Did ever goddess by her charms engage<br/>
A favour'd mortal, and not feel your rage?<br/>
So when Aurora sought Orion's love,<br/>
Her joys disturbed your blissful hours above,<br/>
Till, in Ortygia Dian's winged dart<br/>
Had pierced the hapless hunter to the heart,<br/>
So when the covert of the thrice-eared field<br/>
Saw stately Ceres to her passion yield,<br/>
Scarce could Iasion taste her heavenly charms,<br/>
But Jove's swift lightning scorched him in her arms.<br/>
And is it now my turn, ye mighty powers!<br/>
Am I the envy of your blissful bowers?<br/>
A man, an outcast to the storm and wave,<br/>
It was my crime to pity, and to save;<br/>
When he who thunders rent his bark in twain,<br/>
And sunk his brave companions in the main,<br/>
Alone, abandon'd, in mid-ocean tossed,<br/>
The sport of winds, and driven from every coast,<br/>
Hither this man of miseries I led,<br/>
Received the friendless, and the hungry fed;<br/>
Nay promised (vainly promised) to bestow<br/>
Immortal life, exempt from age and woe.<br/>
'Tis past-and Jove decrees he shall remove;<br/>
Gods as we are, we are but slaves to Jove.<br/>
Go then he must (he must, if he ordain,<br/>
Try all those dangers, all those deeps, again);<br/>
But never, never shall Calypso send<br/>
To toils like these her husband and her friend.<br/>
What ships have I, what sailors to convey,<br/>
What oars to cut the long laborious way?<br/>
Yet I'll direct the safest means to go;<br/>
That last advice is all I can bestow."
</p>
<p>
To her the power who hears the charming rod;<br/>
"Dismiss the man, nor irritate the god;<br/>
Prevent the rage of him who reigns above,<br/>
For what so dreadful as the wrath of Jove?"<br/>
Thus having said, he cut the cleaving sky,<br/>
And in a moment vanished from her eye,<br/>
The nymph, obedient to divine command,<br/>
To seek Ulysses, paced along the sand,<br/>
Him pensive on the lonely beach she found,<br/>
With streaming eyes in briny torrents drown'd,<br/>
And inly pining for his native shore;<br/>
For now the soft enchantress pleased no more;<br/>
For now, reluctant, and constrained by charms,<br/>
Absent he lay in her desiring arms,<br/>
In slumber wore the heavy night away,<br/>
On rocks and shores consumed the tedious day;<br/>
There sate all desolate, and sighed alone,<br/>
With echoing sorrows made the mountains groan.<br/>
And roll'd his eyes o'er all the restless main,<br/>
Till, dimmed with rising grief, they streamed again.
</p>
<p>
Here, on his musing mood the goddess press'd,<br/>
Approaching soft, and thus the chief address'd:<br/>
"Unhappy man! to wasting woes a prey,<br/>
No more in sorrows languish life away:<br/>
Free as the winds I give thee now to rove:<br/>
Go, fell the timber of yon lofty grove,<br/>
And form a raft, and build the rising ship,<br/>
Sublime to bear thee o'er the gloomy deep.<br/>
To store the vessel let the care be mine,<br/>
With water from the rock and rosy wine,<br/>
And life-sustaining bread, and fair array,<br/>
And prosperous gales to waft thee on the way.<br/>
These, if the gods with my desire comply<br/>
(The gods, alas, more mighty far than I,<br/>
And better skill'd in dark events to come),<br/>
In peace shall land thee at thy native home."
</p>
<p>
With sighs Ulysses heard the words she spoke,<br/>
Then thus his melancholy silence broke:<br/>
"Some other motive, goddess! sways thy mind<br/>
(Some close design, or turn of womankind),<br/>
Nor my return the end, nor this the way,<br/>
On a slight raft to pass the swelling sea,<br/>
Huge, horrid, vast! where scarce in safety sails<br/>
The best-built ship, though Jove inspires the gales.<br/>
The bold proposal how shall I fulfil,<br/>
Dark as I am, unconscious of thy will?<br/>
Swear, then, thou mean'st not what my soul forebodes;<br/>
Swear by the solemn oath that binds the gods."
</p>
<p>
Him, while he spoke, with smiles Calypso eyed,<br/>
And gently grasp'd his hand, and thus replied:<br/>
"This shows thee, friend, by old experience taught,<br/>
And learn'd in all the wiles of human thought,<br/>
How prone to doubt, how cautious, are the wise!<br/>
But hear, O earth, and hear, ye sacred skies!<br/>
And thou, O Styx! whose formidable floods<br/>
Glide through the shades, and bind the attesting gods!<br/>
No form'd design, no meditated end,<br/>
Lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend;<br/>
Kind the persuasion, and sincere my aim;<br/>
The same my practice, were my fate the same.<br/>
Heaven has not cursed me with a heart of steel,<br/>
But given the sense to pity, and to feel."
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, the goddess marched before:<br/>
He trod her footsteps in the sandy shore.<br/>
At the cool cave arrived, they took their state;<br/>
He filled the throne where Mercury had sate.<br/>
For him the nymph a rich repast ordains,<br/>
Such as the mortal life of man sustains;<br/>
Before herself were placed the the cates divine,<br/>
Ambrosial banquet and celestial wine.<br/>
Their hunger satiate, and their thirst repress'd,<br/>
Thus spoke Calypso to her godlike guest:
</p>
<p>
"Ulysses! (with a sigh she thus began;)<br/>
O sprung from gods! in wisdom more than man!<br/>
Is then thy home the passion of thy heart?<br/>
Thus wilt thou leave me, are we thus to part?<br/>
Farewell! and ever joyful mayst thou be,<br/>
Nor break the transport with one thought of me.<br/>
But ah, Ulysses! wert thou given to know<br/>
What Fate yet dooms these still to undergo,<br/>
Thy heart might settle in this scene of ease.<br/>
And e'en these slighted charms might learn to please.<br/>
A willing goddess, and immortal life,<br/>
Might banish from thy mind an absent wife.<br/>
Am I inferior to a mortal dame?<br/>
Less soft my feature less august my frame?<br/>
Or shall the daughters of mankind compare<br/>
Their earth born beauties with the heavenly fair?"
</p>
<p>
"Alas! for this (the prudent man replies)<br/>
Against Ulysses shall thy anger rise?<br/>
Loved and adored, O goddess as thou art,<br/>
Forgive the weakness of a human heart.<br/>
Though well I see thy graces far above<br/>
The dear, though mortal, object of my love,<br/>
Of youth eternal well the difference know,<br/>
And the short date of fading charms below;<br/>
Yet every day, while absent thus I roam,<br/>
I languish to return and die at home.<br/>
Whate'er the gods shall destine me to bear;<br/>
In the black ocean or the watery war,<br/>
'Tis mine to master with a constant mind;<br/>
Inured to perils, to the worst resign'd,<br/>
By seas, by wars, so many dangers run;<br/>
Still I can suffer; their high will he done!"
</p>
<p>
Thus while he spoke, the beamy sun descends,<br/>
And rising night her friendly shade extends,<br/>
To the close grot the lonely pair remove,<br/>
And slept delighted with the gifts of love.<br/>
When rosy morning call'd them from their rest,<br/>
Ulysses robed him in the cloak and vest.<br/>
The nymph's fair head a veil transparent graced,<br/>
Her swelling loins a radiant zone embraced<br/>
With flowers of gold; an under robe, unbound,<br/>
In snowy waves flow'd glittering on the ground.<br/>
Forth issuing thus, she gave him first to wield<br/>
A weighty axe with truest temper steeled,<br/>
And double-edged; the handle smooth and plain,<br/>
Wrought of the clouded olive's easy grain;<br/>
And next, a wedge to drive with sweepy sway<br/>
Then to the neighboring forest led the way.<br/>
On the lone island's utmost verge there stood<br/>
Of poplars, pine, and firs, a lofty wood,<br/>
Whose leafless summits to the skies aspire,<br/>
Scorch'd by the sun, or seared by heavenly fire<br/>
(Already dried). These pointing out to view,<br/>
The nymph just show'd him, and with tears withdrew.
</p>
<p>
Now toils the hero: trees on trees o'erthrown<br/>
Fall crackling round him, and the forests groan:<br/>
Sudden, full twenty on the plain are strow'd,<br/>
And lopp'd and lighten'd of their branchy load.<br/>
At equal angles these disposed to join,<br/>
He smooth'd and squared them by the rule and line,<br/>
(The wimbles for the work Calypso found)<br/>
With those he pierced them and with clinchers bound.<br/>
Long and capacious as a shipwright forms<br/>
Some bark's broad bottom to out-ride the storms,<br/>
So large he built the raft; then ribb'd it strong<br/>
From space to space, and nail'd the planks along;<br/>
These form'd the sides: the deck he fashion'd last;<br/>
Then o'er the vessel raised the taper mast,<br/>
With crossing sail-yards dancing in the wind;<br/>
And to the helm the guiding rudder join'd<br/>
(With yielding osiers fenced, to break the force<br/>
Of surging waves, and steer the steady course).<br/>
Thy loom, Calypso, for the future sails<br/>
Supplied the cloth, capacious of the gales.<br/>
With stays and cordage last he rigged the ship,<br/>
And, roll'd on levers, launch'd her in the deep.
</p>
<p>
Four days were pass'd, and now the work complete,<br/>
Shone the fifth morn, when from her sacred seat<br/>
The nymph dismiss'd him (odorous garments given),<br/>
And bathed in fragrant oils that breathed of heaven:<br/>
Then fill'd two goatskins with her hands divine,<br/>
With water one, and one with sable wine:<br/>
Of every kind, provisions heaved aboard;<br/>
And the full decks with copious viands stored.<br/>
The goddess, last, a gentle breeze supplies,<br/>
To curl old Ocean, and to warm the skies.
</p>
<p>
And now, rejoicing in the prosperous gales,<br/>
With beating heart Ulysses spreads his sails;<br/>
Placed at the helm he sate, and mark'd the skies,<br/>
Nor closed in sleep his ever-watchful eyes.<br/>
There view'd the Pleiads, and the Northern Team,<br/>
And great Orion's more refulgent beam.<br/>
To which, around the axle of the sky,<br/>
The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye:<br/>
Who shines exalted on the ethereal plain,<br/>
Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.<br/>
Far on the left those radiant fires to keep<br/>
The nymph directed, as he sail'd the deep.<br/>
Full seventeen nights he cut the foaming way:<br/>
The distant land appear'd the following day:<br/>
Then swell'd to sight Ph√¶acia's dusky coast,<br/>
And woody mountains, half in vapours lost;<br/>
That lay before him indistinct and vast,<br/>
Like a broad shield amid the watery waste.
</p>
<p>
But him, thus voyaging the deeps below,<br/>
From far, on Solyme's a√´rial brow,<br/>
The king of ocean saw, and seeing burn'd<br/>
(From √Üthiopia's happy climes return'd);<br/>
The raging monarch shook his azure head,<br/>
And thus in secret to his soul he said:<br/>
"Heavens! how uncertain are the powers on high!<br/>
Is then reversed the sentence of the sky,<br/>
In one man's favour; while a distant guest<br/>
I shared secure the √Üthiopian feast?<br/>
Behold how near Ph√¶acia's land he draws;<br/>
The land affix'd by Fate's eternal laws<br/>
To end his toils. Is then our anger vain?<br/>
No; if this sceptre yet commands the main."
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and high the forky trident hurl'd,<br/>
Rolls clouds on clouds, and stirs the watery world,<br/>
At once the face of earth and sea deforms,<br/>
Swells all the winds, and rouses all the storms.<br/>
Down rushed the night: east, west, together roar;<br/>
And south and north roll mountains to the shore.<br/>
Then shook the hero, to despair resign'd,<br/>
And question'd thus his yet unconquer'd mind;
</p>
<p>
"Wretch that I am! what farther fates attend<br/>
This life of toils, and what my destined end?<br/>
Too well, alas! the island goddess knew<br/>
On the black sea what perils should ensue.<br/>
New horrors now this destined head inclose;<br/>
Untill'd is yet the measure of my woes;<br/>
With what a cloud the brows of heaven are crown'd;<br/>
What raging winds! what roaring waters round!<br/>
'Tis Jove himself the swelling tempest rears;<br/>
Death, present death, on every side appears.<br/>
Happy! thrice happy! who, in battle slain,<br/>
Press'd in Atrides' cause the Trojan plain!<br/>
Oh! had I died before that well-fought wall!<br/>
Had some distinguish'd day renown'd my fall<br/>
(Such as was that when showers of javelins fled<br/>
From conquering Troy around Achilles dead),<br/>
All Greece had paid me solemn funerals then,<br/>
And spread my glory with the sons of men.<br/>
A shameful fate now hides my hapless head,<br/>
Unwept, unnoted, and for ever dead!"
</p>
<p>
A mighty wave rush'd o'er him as he spoke,<br/>
The raft is cover'd, and the mast is broke;<br/>
Swept from the deck and from the rudder torn,<br/>
Far on the swelling surge the chief was borne;<br/>
While by the howling tempest rent in twain<br/>
Flew sail and sail-yards rattling o'er the main.<br/>
Long-press'd, he heaved beneath the weighty wave,<br/>
Clogg'd by the cumbrous vest Calypso gave;<br/>
At length, emerging, from his nostrils wide<br/>
And gushing mouth effused the briny tide;<br/>
E'en then not mindless of his last retreat,<br/>
He seized the raft, and leap'd into his seat,<br/>
Strong with the fear of death. In rolling flood,<br/>
Now here, now there, impell'd the floating wood<br/>
As when a heap of gather'd thorns is cast,<br/>
Now to, now fro, before the autumnal blast;<br/>
Together clung, it rolls around the field;<br/>
So roll'd the float, and so its texture held:<br/>
And now the south, and now the north, bear sway,<br/>
And now the east the foamy floods obey,<br/>
And now the west wind whirls it o'er the sea.<br/>
The wandering chief with toils on toils oppress'd,<br/>
Leucothea saw, and pity touch'd her breast.<br/>
(Herself a mortal once, of Cadmus' strain,<br/>
But now an azure sister of the main)<br/>
Swift as a sea-mew springing from the flood,<br/>
All radiant on the raft the goddess stood;<br/>
Then thus address'd him: "Thou whom heaven decrees<br/>
To Neptune's wrath, stern tyrant of the seas!<br/>
(Unequal contest!) not his rage and power,<br/>
Great as he is, such virtue shall devour.<br/>
What I suggest, thy wisdom will perform:<br/>
Forsake thy float, and leave it to the storm;<br/>
Strip off thy garments; Neptune's fury brave<br/>
With naked strength, and plunge into the wave.<br/>
To reach Ph√¶acia all thy nerves extend,<br/>
There Fate decrees thy miseries shall end.<br/>
This heavenly scarf beneath thy bosom bind,<br/>
And live; give all thy terrors to the wind.<br/>
Soon as thy arms the happy shore shall gain,<br/>
Return the gift, and cast it in the main:<br/>
Observe my orders, and with heed obey,<br/>
Cast it far off, and turn thy eyes away."
</p>
<p>
With that, her hand the sacred veil bestows,<br/>
Then down the deeps she dived from whence she rose;<br/>
A moment snatch'd the shining form away,<br/>
And all was covered with the curling sea.
</p>
<p>
Struck with amaze, yet still to doubt inclined,<br/>
He stands suspended, and explores his mind:<br/>
"What shall I do? unhappy me! who knows<br/>
But other gods intend me other woes?<br/>
Whoe'er thou art, I shall not blindly join<br/>
Thy pleaded reason, but consult with mine:<br/>
For scarce in ken appears that distant isle<br/>
Thy voice foretells me shall conclude my toil.<br/>
Thus then I judge: while yet the planks sustain<br/>
The wild waves' fury, here I fix'd remain:<br/>
But, when their texture to the tempest yields,<br/>
I launch adventurous on the liquid fields,<br/>
Join to the help of gods the strength of man,<br/>
And take this method, since the best I can."
</p>
<p>
While thus his thoughts an anxious council hold,<br/>
The raging god a watery mountain roll'd;<br/>
Like a black sheet the whelming billows spread,<br/>
Burst o'er the float, and thunder'd on his head.<br/>
Planks, beams, disparted fly; the scatter'd wood<br/>
Rolls diverse, and in fragments strews the flood.<br/>
So the rude Boreas, o'er the field new-shorn,<br/>
Tosses and drives the scatter'd heaps of corn.<br/>
And now a single beam the chief bestrides:<br/>
There poised a while above the bounding tides,<br/>
His limbs discumbers of the clinging vest,<br/>
And binds the sacred cincture round his breast:<br/>
Then prone an ocean in a moment flung,<br/>
Stretch'd wide his eager arms, and shot the seas along.<br/>
All naked now, on heaving billows laid,<br/>
Stern Neptune eyed him, and contemptuous said:
</p>
<p>
"Go, learn'd in woes, and other foes essay!<br/>
Go, wander helpless on the watery way;<br/>
Thus, thus find out the destined shore, and then<br/>
(If Jove ordains it) mix with happier men.<br/>
Whate'er thy fate, the ills our wrath could raise<br/>
Shall last remember'd in thy best of days."
</p>
<p>
This said, his sea-green steeds divide the foam,<br/>
And reach high √Üg√¶ and the towery dome.<br/>
Now, scarce withdrawn the fierce earth-shaking power,<br/>
Jove's daughter Pallas watch'd the favouring hour.<br/>
Back to their caves she bade the winds to fly;<br/>
And hush'd the blustering brethren of the sky.<br/>
The drier blasts alone of Boreas away,<br/>
And bear him soft on broken waves away;<br/>
With gentle force impelling to that shore,<br/>
Where fate has destined he shall toil no more.<br/>
And now, two nights, and now two days were pass'd,<br/>
Since wide he wander'd on the watery waste;<br/>
Heaved on the surge with intermitting breath,<br/>
And hourly panting in the arms of death.<br/>
The third fair morn now blazed upon the main;<br/>
Then glassy smooth lay all the liquid plain;<br/>
The winds were hush'd, the billows scarcely curl'd,<br/>
And a dead silence still'd the watery world;<br/>
When lifted on a ridgy wave he spies<br/>
The land at distance, and with sharpen'd eyes.<br/>
As pious children joy with vast delight<br/>
When a loved sire revives before their sight<br/>
(Who, lingering long, has call'd on death in vain,<br/>
Fix'd by some demon to his bed of pain,<br/>
Till heaven by miracle his life restore);<br/>
So joys Ulysses at the appearing shore;<br/>
And sees (and labours onward as he sees)<br/>
The rising forests, and the tufted trees.<br/>
And now, as near approaching as the sound<br/>
Of human voice the listening ear may wound,<br/>
Amidst the rocks he heard a hollow roar<br/>
Of murmuring surges breaking on the shore;<br/>
Nor peaceful port was there, nor winding bay,<br/>
To shield the vessel from the rolling sea,<br/>
But cliffs and shaggy shores, a dreadful sight!<br/>
All rough with rocks, with foamy billows white.<br/>
Fear seized his slacken'd limbs and beating heart,<br/>
As thus he communed with his soul apart;
</p>
<p>
"Ah me! when, o'er a length of waters toss'd,<br/>
These eyes at last behold the unhoped-for coast,<br/>
No port receives me from the angry main,<br/>
But the loud deeps demand me back again.<br/>
Above, sharp rocks forbid access; around<br/>
Roar the wild waves; beneath, is sea profound!<br/>
No footing sure affords the faithless sand,<br/>
To stem too rapid, and too deep to stand.<br/>
If here I enter, my efforts are vain,<br/>
Dash'd on the cliffs, or heaved into the main;<br/>
Or round the island if my course I bend,<br/>
Where the ports open, or the shores descend,<br/>
Back to the seas the rolling surge may sweep,<br/>
And bury all my hopes beneath the deep.<br/>
Or some enormous whale the god may send<br/>
(For many such an Amphitrite attend);<br/>
Too well the turns of mortal chance I know,<br/>
And hate relentless of my heavenly foe."<br/>
While thus he thought, a monstrous wave upbore<br/>
The chief, and dash'd him on the craggy shore;<br/>
Torn was his skin, nor had the ribs been whole,<br/>
But Instant Pallas enter'd in his soul.<br/>
Close to the cliff with both his hands he clung,<br/>
And stuck adherent, and suspended hung;<br/>
Till the huge surge roll'd off; then backward sweep<br/>
The refluent tides, and plunge him in the deep.<br/>
As when the polypus, from forth his cave<br/>
Torn with full force, reluctant beats the wave,<br/>
His ragged claws are stuck with stones and sands;<br/>
So the rough rock had shagg'd Ulysses hands,<br/>
And now had perish'd, whelm'd beneath the main,<br/>
The unhappy man; e'en fate had been in vain;<br/>
But all-subduing Pallas lent her power,<br/>
And prudence saved him in the needful hour.<br/>
Beyond the beating surge his course he bore,<br/>
(A wider circle, but in sight of shore),<br/>
With longing eyes, observing, to survey<br/>
Some smooth ascent, or safe sequester'd bay.<br/>
Between the parting rocks at length he spied<br/>
A failing stream with gentler waters glide;<br/>
Where to the seas the shelving shore declined,<br/>
And form'd a bay impervious to the wind.<br/>
To this calm port the glad Ulysses press'd,<br/>
And hail'd the river, and its god address'd:
</p>
<p>
"Whoe'er thou art, before whose stream unknown<br/>
I bend, a suppliant at thy watery throne,<br/>
Hear, azure king! nor let me fly in vain<br/>
To thee from Neptune and the raging main<br/>
Heaven hears and pities hapless men like me,<br/>
For sacred even to gods is misery:<br/>
Let then thy waters give the weary rest,<br/>
And save a suppliant, and a man distress'd."
</p>
<p>
He pray'd, and straight the gentle stream subsides,<br/>
Detains the rushing current of his tides,<br/>
Before the wanderer smooths the watery way,<br/>
And soft receives him from the rolling sea.<br/>
That moment, fainting as he touch'd the shore,<br/>
He dropp'd his sinewy arms: his knees no more<br/>
Perform'd their office, or his weight upheld:<br/>
His swoln heart heaved; his bloated body swell'd:<br/>
From mouth and nose the briny torrent ran;<br/>
And lost in lassitude lay all the man,<br/>
Deprived of voice, of motion, and of breath;<br/>
The soul scarce waking in the arms of death.<br/>
Soon as warm life its wonted office found,<br/>
The mindful chief Leucothea's scarf unbound;<br/>
Observant of her word, he turn'd aside<br/>
His head, and cast it on the rolling tide.<br/>
Behind him far, upon the purple waves,<br/>
The waters waft it, and the nymph receives.
</p>
<p>
Now parting from the stream, Ulysses found<br/>
A mossy bank with pliant rushes crown'd;<br/>
The bank he press'd, and gently kiss'd the ground;<br/>
Where on the flowery herb as soft he lay,<br/>
Thus to his soul the sage began to say:
</p>
<p>
"What will ye next ordain, ye powers on high!<br/>
And yet, ah yet, what fates are we to try?<br/>
Here by the stream, if I the night out-wear,<br/>
Thus spent already, how shall nature bear<br/>
The dews descending, and nocturnal air;<br/>
Or chilly vapours breathing from the flood<br/>
When morning rises?&mdash;If I take the wood,<br/>
And in thick shelter of innumerous boughs<br/>
Enjoy the comfort gentle sleep allows;<br/>
Though fenced from cold, and though my toil be pass'd,<br/>
What savage beasts may wander in the waste?<br/>
Perhaps I yet may fall a bloody prey<br/>
To prowling bears, or lions in the way."
</p>
<p>
Thus long debating in himself he stood:<br/>
At length he took the passage to the wood,<br/>
Whose shady horrors on a rising brow<br/>
Waved high, and frown'd upon the stream below.<br/>
There grew two olives, closest of the grove,<br/>
With roots entwined, the branches interwove;<br/>
Alike their leaves, but not alike they smiled<br/>
With sister-fruits; one fertile, one was wild.<br/>
Nor here the sun's meridian rays had power,<br/>
Nor wind sharp-piercing, nor the rushing shower;<br/>
The verdant arch so close its texture kept:<br/>
Beneath this covert great Ulysses crept.<br/>
Of gather'd leaves an ample bed he made<br/>
(Thick strewn by tempest through the bowery shade);<br/>
Where three at least might winter's cold defy,<br/>
Though Boreas raged along the inclement sky.<br/>
This store with joy the patient hero found,<br/>
And, sunk amidst them, heap'd the leaves around.<br/>
As some poor peasant, fated to reside<br/>
Remote from neighbours in a forest wide,<br/>
Studious to save what human wants require,<br/>
In embers heap'd, preserves the seeds of fire:<br/>
Hid in dry foliage thus Ulysses lies,<br/>
Till Pallas pour'd soft slumbers on his eyes;<br/>
And golden dreams (the gift of sweet repose)<br/>
Lull'd all his cares, and banish'd all his woes.

<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XXIII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Then to the queen, as in repose she lay,<br/>
The nurse with eager rapture speeds her way:<br/>
The transports of her faithful heart supply<br/>
A sudden youth, and give her wings to fly.
</p>
<p>
"And sleeps my child? (the reverend matron cries)<br/>
Ulysses lives! arise, my child, arise!<br/>
At length appears the long-expected hour!<br/>
Ulysses comes! the suitors are no more!<br/>
No more they view the golden light of day!<br/>
Arise, and bless thee with the glad survey?"
</p>
<p>
Touch'd at her words, the mournful queen rejoin'd:<br/>
"Ah! whither wanders thy distemper'd mind?<br/>
The righteous powers, who tread the starry skies,<br/>
The weak enlighten, and confound the wise,<br/>
And human thought, with unresisted sway,<br/>
Depress or raise, enlarge or take away:<br/>
Truth, by their high decree, thy voice forsakes,<br/>
And folly with the tongue of wisdom speaks.<br/>
Unkind, the fond illusion to impose!<br/>
Was it to flatter or deride my woes?<br/>
Never did I sleep so sweet enjoy,<br/>
Since my dear lord left Ithaca for Troy.<br/>
Why must I wake to grieve, and curse thy shore,<br/>
O Troy?&mdash;may never tongue pronounce thee more!<br/>
Begone! another might have felt our rage,<br/>
But age is sacred, and we spare thy age."
</p>
<p>
To whom with warmth: "My soul a lie disdains;<br/>
Ulysses lives, thy own Ulysses reigns:<br/>
That stranger, patient of the suitors' wrongs,<br/>
And the rude license of ungovern'd tongues!<br/>
He, he is thine! Thy son his latent guest<br/>
Long knew, but lock'd the secret in his breast:<br/>
With well concerted art to end his woes,<br/>
And burst at once in vengeance on the foes."
</p>
<p>
While yet she spoke, the queen in transport sprung<br/>
Swift from the couch, and round the matron hung;<br/>
Fast from her eye descends the rolling tear:<br/>
"Say, once more say, is my Ulysses here?<br/>
How could that numerous and outrageous band<br/>
By one be slain, though by a hero's hand?"
</p>
<p>
"I saw it not (she cries), but heard alone,<br/>
When death was busy, a loud dying groan;<br/>
The damsel-train turn'd pale at every wound,<br/>
Immured we sate, and catch'd each passing sound;<br/>
When death had seized her prey, thy son attends,<br/>
And at his nod the damsel-train descends;<br/>
There terrible in arms Ulysses stood,<br/>
And the dead suitors almost swam in blood:<br/>
Thy heart had leap'd the hero to survey,<br/>
Stern as the surly lion o'er his prey,<br/>
Glorious in gore, now with sulphereous fire<br/>
The dome he purges, now the flame aspires;<br/>
Heap'd lie the dead without the palace walls&mdash;<br/>
Haste, daughter, haste, thy own Ulysses calls!<br/>
Thy every wish the bounteous gods bestow;<br/>
Enjoy the present good, and former woe.<br/>
Ulysses lives, his vanquish'd foes to see;<br/>
He lives to thy Telemachus and thee!"
</p>
<p>
"Ah, no! (with sighs Penelope rejoin'd,)<br/>
Excess of joy disturbs thy wandering mind;<br/>
How blest this happy hour, should he appear,<br/>
Dear to us all, to me supremely dear;<br/>
Ah, no! some god the suitors death decreed,<br/>
Some god descends, and by his hand they bleed;<br/>
Blind! to contemn the stranger's righteous cause,<br/>
And violate all hospitable laws!<br/>
The good they hated, and the powers defied!<br/>
But heaven is just, and by a god they died.<br/>
For never must Ulysses view this shore;<br/>
Never! the loved Ulysses is no more!"
</p>
<p>
"What words (the matron cries) have reach'd my ears?<br/>
Doubt we his presence, when he now appears!<br/>
Then hear conviction: Ere the fatal day<br/>
That forced Ulysses o'er the watery way,<br/>
A boar, fierce rushing in the sylvan war,<br/>
Plough'd half his thigh; I saw, I saw the scar,<br/>
And wild with transport had reveal'd the wound;<br/>
But ere I spoke, he rose, and check'd the sound.<br/>
Then, daughter, haste away! and if a lie<br/>
Flow from this tongue, then let thy servant die!"<br/>
To whom with dubious joy the queen replies:<br/>
"Wise is thy soul, but errors seize the wise;<br/>
The works of gods what mortal can survey?<br/>
Who knows their motives, who shall trace their way?<br/>
But learn we instant how the suitors trod<br/>
The paths of death, by man, or by a god."<br/>
Thus speaks the queen, and no reply attends,<br/>
But with alternate joy and fear descends;<br/>
At every step debates her lord to prove;<br/>
Or, rushing to his arms, confess her love!<br/>
Then gliding through the marble valves, in state<br/>
Opposed, before the shining sire she sate.<br/>
The monarch, by a column high enthroned,<br/>
His eye withdrew, and fix'd it on the ground;<br/>
Curious to hear his queen the silence break:<br/>
Amazed she sate, and impotent to speak;<br/>
O'er all the man her eyes she rolls in vain,<br/>
Now hopes, now fears, now knows, then doubts again.<br/>
At length Telemachus: "Oh, who can find<br/>
A woman like Penelope unkind?<br/>
Why thus in silence? why with winning charms<br/>
Thus slow to fly with rapture to his arms?<br/>
Stubborn the breast that with no transport glows,<br/>
When twice ten years are pass'd of mighty woes;<br/>
To softness lost, to spousal love unknown,<br/>
The gods have formed that rigid heart of stone!"<br/>
"O my Telemachus! (the queen rejoin'd,)<br/>
Distracting fears confound my labouring mind;<br/>
Powerless to speak. I scarce uplift my eyes,<br/>
Nor dare to question; doubts on doubts arise.<br/>
Oh deign he, if Ulysses, to remove<br/>
These boding thoughts, and what he is, to prove!"<br/>
Pleased with her virtuous fears, the king replies:<br/>
"Indulge, my son, the cautions of the wise;<br/>
Time shall the truth to sure remembrance bring:<br/>
This garb of poverty belies the king:<br/>
No more. This day our deepest care requires,<br/>
Cautious to act what thought mature inspires.<br/>
If one man's blood, though mean, distain our hands,<br/>
The homicide retreats to foreign lands;<br/>
By us, in heaps the illustrious peerage falls,<br/>
The important deed our whole attention calls."
</p>
<p>
"Be that thy care (Telemachus replies)<br/>
The world conspires to speak Ulysses wise;<br/>
For wisdom all is thine! lo, I obey,<br/>
And dauntless follow where you led the way;<br/>
Nor shalt thou in the day of danger find<br/>
Thy coward son degenerate lag behind."
</p>
<p>
"Then instant to the bath (the monarch cries),<br/>
Bid the gay youth and sprightly virgins rise,<br/>
Thence all descend in pomp and proud array,<br/>
And bid the dome resound the mirthful lay;<br/>
While the sweet lyrist airs of rapture sings,<br/>
And forms the dance responsive to the strings,<br/>
That hence the eluded passengers may say,<br/>
'Lo! the queen weds! we hear the spousal lay!'<br/>
The suitor's death, unknown, till we remove<br/>
Far from the court, and act inspired by Jove."
</p>
<p>
Thus spoke the king: the observant train obey,<br/>
At once they bathe, and dress in proud array:<br/>
The lyrist strikes the string; gay youths advance,<br/>
And fair-zoned damsels form the sprightly dance.<br/>
The voice, attuned to instrumental sounds,<br/>
Ascends the roof, the vaulted roof rebounds;<br/>
Not unobserved: the Greeks eluded say,<br/>
"Lo! the queen weds, we hear the spousal lay!<br/>
Inconstant! to admit the bridal hour."<br/>
Thus they&mdash;but nobly chaste she weds no more.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the wearied king the bath ascends;<br/>
With faithful cares Eurynome attends,<br/>
O'er every limb a shower of fragrance sheds;<br/>
Then, dress'd in pomp, magnificent he treads.<br/>
The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine<br/>
With majesty enlarged, and grace divine.<br/>
Back from his brows in wavy ringlets fly<br/>
His thick large locks of hyacinthine dye.<br/>
As by some artist to whom Vulcan gives<br/>
His heavenly skill, a breathing image lives;<br/>
By Pallas taught, he frames the wondrous mould,<br/>
And the pale silver glows with fusile gold:<br/>
So Pallas his heroic form improves<br/>
With bloom divine, and like a god he moves!<br/>
More high he treads, and issuing forth in state,<br/>
Radiant before his gazing consort sate.<br/>
"And, O my queen! (he cries) what power above<br/>
Has steel'd that heart, averse to spousal love?<br/>
Canst thou, Penelope, when heaven restores<br/>
Thy lost Ulysses to his native shores,<br/>
Canst thou, O cruel! unconcern'd survey<br/>
Thy lost Ulysses, on this signal day?<br/>
Haste, Euryclea, and despatchful spread<br/>
For me, and me alone, the imperial bed,<br/>
My weary nature craves the balm of rest.<br/>
But Heaven with adamant has arm'd her breast."
</p>
<p>
"Ah no! (she cries) a tender heart I bear,<br/>
A foe to pride: no adamant is there;<br/>
And now, e'en now it melts! for sure I see<br/>
Once more Ulysses my beloved in thee!<br/>
Fix'd in my soul, as when he sailed to Troy,<br/>
His image dwells: then haste the bed of joy,<br/>
Haste, from the bridal bower the bed translate,<br/>
Fram'd by his hand, and be it dress'd in state!"
</p>
<p>
Thus speaks the queen, still dubious, with disguise<br/>
Touch'd at her words, the king with warmth replies<br/>
"Alas for this! what mortal strength can move<br/>
The enormous burden, who but Heaven above?<br/>
It mocks the weak attempts of human hands!<br/>
But the whole earth must move if Heaven commands<br/>
Then hear sure evidence, while we display<br/>
Words seal'd with sacred truth, and truth obey:<br/>
This hand the wonder framed; an olive spread<br/>
Full in the court its ever verdant head.<br/>
Vast as some mighty column's bulk, on high<br/>
The huge trunk rose, and heaved into the sky;<br/>
Around the tree I raised a nuptial bower,<br/>
And roof'd defensive of the storm and shower;<br/>
The spacious valve, with art inwrought conjoins;<br/>
And the fair dome with polished marble shines.<br/>
I lopp'd the branchy head: aloft in twain<br/>
Sever'd the bole, and smoothed the shining grain;<br/>
Then posts, capacious of the frame, I raise,<br/>
And bore it, regular, from space to space:<br/>
Athwart the frame, at equal distance lie<br/>
Thongs of tough hides, that boast a purple dye;<br/>
Then polishing the whole, the finished mould<br/>
With silver shone, with elephant, and gold.<br/>
But if o'erturn'd by rude, ungovern'd hands,<br/>
Or still inviolate the olive stands,<br/>
'Tis thine, O queen, to say, and now impart,<br/>
If fears remain, or doubts distract thy heart."
</p>
<p>
While yet he speaks, her powers of life decay;<br/>
She sickens, trembles, falls, and faints away.<br/>
At length recovering, to his arms she flew,<br/>
And strain'd him close, as to his breast she grew.<br/>
The tears pour'd down amain, and "O (she cries)<br/>
Let not against thy spouse thine anger rise!<br/>
O versed in every turn of human art,<br/>
Forgive the weakness of a woman's heart!<br/>
The righteous powers, that mortal lot dispose,<br/>
Decree us to sustain a length of woes.<br/>
And from the flower of life the bliss deny<br/>
To bloom together, fade away, and die.<br/>
O let me, let me not thine anger move,<br/>
That I forbore, thus, thus to speak my love:<br/>
Thus in fond kisses, while the transport warms<br/>
Pour out my soul and die within thine arms!<br/>
I dreaded fraud! Men, faithless men, betray<br/>
Our easy faith, and make our sex their prey:<br/>
Against the fondness of my heart I strove:<br/>
'Twas caution, O my lord! not want of love.<br/>
Like me had Helen fear'd, with wanton charms<br/>
Ere the fair mischief set two worlds in arms;<br/>
Ere Greece rose dreadful in the avenging day;<br/>
Thus had she fear'd, she had not gone astray.<br/>
But Heaven, averse to Greece, in wrath decreed<br/>
That she should wander, and that Greece should bleed:<br/>
Blind to the ills that from injustice flow,<br/>
She colour'd all our wretched lives with woe.<br/>
But why these sorrows when my lord arrives?<br/>
I yield, I yield! my own Ulysses lives!<br/>
The secrets of the bridal bed are known<br/>
To thee, to me, to Actoris alone<br/>
(My father's present in the spousal hour,<br/>
The sole attendant on our genial bower).<br/>
Since what no eye hath seen thy tongue reveal'd,<br/>
Hard and distrustful as I am, I yield."
</p>
<p>
Touch'd to the soul, the king with rapture hears,<br/>
Hangs round her neck, and speaks his joy in tears.<br/>
As to the shipwreck'd mariner, the shores<br/>
Delightful rise, when angry Neptune roars:<br/>
Then, when the surge in thunder mounts the sky,<br/>
And gulf'd in crowds at once the sailors die;<br/>
If one, more happy, while the tempest raves,<br/>
Outlives the tumult of conflicting waves,<br/>
All pale, with ooze deform'd, he views the strand,<br/>
And plunging forth with transport grasps the land:<br/>
The ravish'd queen with equal rapture glows,<br/>
Clasps her loved lord, and to his bosom grows.<br/>
Nor had they ended till the morning ray,<br/>
But Pallas backward held the rising day,<br/>
The wheels of night retarding, to detain<br/>
The gay Aurora in the wavy main;<br/>
Whose flaming steeds, emerging through the night,<br/>
Beam o'er the eastern hills with streaming light.
</p>
<p>
At length Ulysses with a sigh replies:<br/>
"Yet Fate, yet cruel Fate repose denies;<br/>
A labour long, and hard, remains behind;<br/>
By heaven above, by hell beneath enjoin'd:<br/>
For to Tiresias through the eternal gates<br/>
Of hell I trode, to learn my future fates.<br/>
But end we here&mdash;the night demands repose,<br/>
Be deck'd the couch! and peace awhile, my woes!"
</p>
<p>
To whom the queen: "Thy word we shall obey,<br/>
And deck the couch; far hence be woes away:<br/>
Since the just gods, who tread the starry plains,<br/>
Restore thee safe, since my Ulysses reigns.<br/>
But what those perils heaven decrees, impart;<br/>
Knowledge may grieve, but fear distracts the heart."
</p>
<p>
To this the king: "Ah, why must I disclose<br/>
A dreadful story of approaching woes?<br/>
Why in this hour of transport wound thy ears,<br/>
When thou must learn what I must speak with tears?<br/>
Heaven, by the Theban ghost, thy spouse decrees,<br/>
Torn from thy arms, to sail a length of seas;<br/>
From realm to realm, a nation to explore<br/>
Who ne'er knew salt, or heard the billows roar,<br/>
Nor saw gay vessel storm the surgy plain,<br/>
A painted wonder, flying on the main:<br/>
An oar my hand must bear; a shepherd eyes<br/>
The unknown instrument with strange surprise,<br/>
And calls a corn-van; this upon the plain<br/>
I fix, and hail the monarch of the main;<br/>
Then bathe his altars with the mingled gore<br/>
Of victims vow'd, a ram, a bull, a boar;<br/>
Thence swift re-sailing to my native shores,<br/>
Due victims slay to all the ethereal powers.<br/>
Then Heaven decrees, in peace to end my days<br/>
And steal myself from life by slow decays!<br/>
Unknown to pain, in age resign my breath,<br/>
When late stern Neptune points the shaft of death;<br/>
To the dark grave retiring as to rest;<br/>
My people blessing, by my people bless'd.<br/>
Such future scenes the all-righteous powers display<br/>
By their dread seer, and such my future day."
</p>
<p>
To whom thus firm of soul: "If ripe for death,<br/>
And full of days, thou gently yield thy breath;<br/>
While Heaven a kind release from ills foreshows,<br/>
Triumph, thou happy victor of thy woes?"
</p>
<p>
But Euryclea, with dispatchful care,<br/>
And sage Eurynome, the couch prepare;<br/>
Instant they bid the blazing torch display<br/>
Around the dome and artificial day;<br/>
Then to repose her steps the matron bends,<br/>
And to the queen Eurynome descends;<br/>
A torch she bears, to light with guiding fires<br/>
The royal pair; she guides them, and retires<br/>
The instant his fair spouse Ulysses led<br/>
To the chaste love-rites of the nuptial bed.
</p>
<p>
And now the blooming youths and sprightly fair<br/>
Cease the gay dance, and to their rest repair;<br/>
But in discourse the king and consort lay,<br/>
While the soft hours stole unperceived away;<br/>
Intent he hears Penelope disclose<br/>
A mournful story of domestic woes,<br/>
His servants' insults, his invaded bed,<br/>
How his whole flocks and herds exhausted bled,<br/>
His generous wines dishonour'd shed in vain,<br/>
And the wild riots of the suitor-train.<br/>
The king alternate a dire tale relates,<br/>
Of wars, of triumphs, and disastrous fates;<br/>
All he unfolds; his listening spouse turns pale<br/>
With pleasing horror at the dreadful tale;<br/>
Sleepless devours each word; and hears how slain<br/>
Cicons on Cicons swell the ensanguined plain;<br/>
How to the land of Lote unbless'd he sails;<br/>
And images the rills and flowery vales!<br/>
How dash'd like dogs, his friends the Cyclops tore<br/>
(Not unrevenged), and quaff'd the spouting gore;<br/>
How the loud storms in prison bound, he sails<br/>
From friendly Aeolus with prosperous gales:<br/>
Yet fate withstands! a sudden tempest roars,<br/>
And whirls him groaning from his native shores:<br/>
How on the barbarous Laestrigonian coast,<br/>
By savage hands his fleet and friends lie lost;<br/>
How scarce himself survived: he paints the bower,<br/>
The spells of Circe, and her magic power;<br/>
His dreadful journey to the realms beneath,<br/>
To seek Tiresias in the vales of death;<br/>
How in the doleful mansions lie survey'd<br/>
His royal mother, pale Anticlea's shade;<br/>
And friends in battle slain, heroic ghosts!<br/>
Then how, unharm'd, he pass'd the Syren-coasts,<br/>
The justling rocks where fierce Charybdis raves,<br/>
And howling Scylla whirls her thunderous waves,<br/>
The cave of death! How his companions slay<br/>
The oxen sacred to the god of day.<br/>
Till Jove in wrath the rattling tempest guides,<br/>
And whelms the offenders in the roaring tides:<br/>
How struggling through the surge he reach'd the shores<br/>
Of fair Ogygia and Calypso's bowers;<br/>
Where the gay blooming nymph constrain'd his stay,<br/>
With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay;<br/>
And promised, vainly promised, to bestow<br/>
Immortal life, exempt from age and woe:<br/>
How saved from storms Phæacia's coast he trod,<br/>
By great Alcinous honour'd as a god,<br/>
Who gave him last his country to behold,<br/>
With change of raiment, brass, and heaps of gold
</p>
<p>
He ended, sinking into sleep, and shares<br/>
A sweet forgetfulness of all his cares.
</p>
<p>
Soon as soft slumber eased the toils of day,<br/>
Minerva rushes through the aërial way,<br/>
And bids Aurora with her golden wheels<br/>
Flame from the ocean o'er the eastern hills;<br/>
Uprose Ulysses from the genial bed,<br/>
And thus with thought mature the monarch said:
</p>
<p>
"My queen, my consort! through a length of years<br/>
We drank the cup of sorrow mix'd with tears;<br/>
Thou, for thy lord; while me the immortal powers<br/>
Detain'd reluctant from my native shores.<br/>
Now, bless'd again by Heaven, the queen display,<br/>
And rule our palace with an equal sway.<br/>
Be it my care, by loans, or martial toils,<br/>
To throng my empty folds with gifts or spoils.<br/>
But now I haste to bless Laertes' eyes<br/>
With sight of his Ulysses ere he dies;<br/>
The good old man, to wasting woes a prey,<br/>
Weeps a sad life in solitude away.<br/>
But hear, though wise! This morning shall unfold<br/>
The deathful scene, on heroes heroes roll'd.<br/>
Thou with thy maids within the palace stay,<br/>
From all the scene of tumult far away!"
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and sheathed in arms incessant flies<br/>
To wake his son, and bid his friends arise.<br/>
"To arms!" aloud he cries; his friends obey,<br/>
With glittering arms their manly limbs array,<br/>
And pass the city gate; Ulysses leads the way.<br/>
Now flames the rosy dawn, but Pallas shrouds<br/>
The latent warriors in a veil of clouds.

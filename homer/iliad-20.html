<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book X</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood<br/>
Greece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood;<br/>
While near impending from a neighbouring height,<br/>
Troy's black battalions wait the shock of fight.<br/>
Then Jove to Themis gives command, to call<br/>
The gods to council in the starry hall:<br/>
Swift o'er Olympus' hundred hills she flies,<br/>
And summons all the senate of the skies.<br/>
These shining on, in long procession come<br/>
To Jove's eternal adamantine dome.<br/>
Not one was absent, not a rural power<br/>
That haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower;<br/>
Each fair-hair'd dryad of the shady wood,<br/>
Each azure sister of the silver flood;<br/>
All but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps<br/>
His ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.<br/>
On marble thrones, with lucid columns crown'd,<br/>
(The work of Vulcan,) sat the powers around.<br/>
Even he whose trident sways the watery reign<br/>
Heard the loud summons, and forsook the main,<br/>
Assumed his throne amid the bright abodes,<br/>
And question'd thus the sire of men and gods:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What moves the god who heaven and earth commands,<br/>
And grasps the thunder in his awful hands,<br/>
Thus to convene the whole ethereal state?<br/>
Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate?<br/>
Already met, the louring hosts appear,<br/>
And death stands ardent on the edge of war."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"'Tis true (the cloud-compelling power replies)<br/>
This day we call the council of the skies<br/>
In care of human race; even Jove's own eye<br/>
Sees with regret unhappy mortals die.<br/>
Far on Olympus' top in secret state<br/>
Ourself will sit, and see the hand of fate<br/>
Work out our will. Celestial powers! descend,<br/>
And as your minds direct, your succour lend<br/>
To either host. Troy soon must lie o'erthrown,<br/>
If uncontroll'd Achilles fights alone:<br/>
Their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;<br/>
What can they now, if in his rage he rise?<br/>
Assist them, gods! or Ilion's sacred wall<br/>
May fall this day, though fate forbids the fall."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.<br/>
On adverse parts the warring gods engage:<br/>
Heaven's awful queen; and he whose azure round<br/>
Girds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown'd;<br/>
Hermes, of profitable arts the sire;<br/>
And Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire:<br/>
These to the fleet repair with instant flight;<br/>
The vessels tremble as the gods alight.<br/>
In aid of Troy, Latona, Phoebus came,<br/>
Mars fiery-helm'd, the laughter-loving dame,<br/>
Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,<br/>
And the chaste huntress of the silver bow.<br/>
Ere yet the gods their various aid employ,<br/>
Each Argive bosom swell'd with manly joy,<br/>
While great Achilles (terror of the plain),<br/>
Long lost to battle, shone in arms again.<br/>
Dreadful he stood in front of all his host;<br/>
Pale Troy beheld, and seem'd already lost;<br/>
Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear,<br/>
And trembling see another god of war.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But when the powers descending swell'd the fight,<br/>
Then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright<br/>
Varied each face: then Discord sounds alarms,<br/>
Earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.<br/>
Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls,<br/>
And now she thunders from the Grecian walls.<br/>
Mars hovering o'er his Troy, his terror shrouds<br/>
In gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:<br/>
Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours<br/>
With voice divine, from Ilion's topmost towers:<br/>
Now shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill;<br/>
The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls,<br/>
And peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.<br/>
Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground;<br/>
The forests wave, the mountains nod around;<br/>
Through all their summits tremble Ida's woods,<br/>
And from their sources boil her hundred floods.<br/>
Troy's turrets totter on the rocking plain,<br/>
And the toss'd navies beat the heaving main.<br/>
Deep in the dismal regions of the dead,<br/>
The infernal monarch rear'd his horrid head,<br/>
Leap'd from his throne, lest Neptune's arm should lay<br/>
His dark dominions open to the day,<br/>
And pour in light on Pluto's drear abodes,<br/>
Abhorr'd by men, and dreadful even to gods.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Such war the immortals wage; such horrors rend<br/>
The world's vast concave, when the gods contend.<br/>
First silver-shafted Phoebus took the plain<br/>
Against blue Neptune, monarch of the main.<br/>
The god of arms his giant bulk display'd,<br/>
Opposed to Pallas, war's triumphant maid.<br/>
Against Latona march'd the son of May.<br/>
The quiver'd Dian, sister of the day,<br/>
(Her golden arrows sounding at her side,)<br/>
Saturnia, majesty of heaven, defied.<br/>
With fiery Vulcan last in battle stands<br/>
The sacred flood that rolls on golden sands;<br/>
Xanthus his name with those of heavenly birth,<br/>
But called Scamander by the sons of earth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While thus the gods in various league engage,<br/>
Achilles glow'd with more than mortal rage:<br/>
Hector he sought; in search of Hector turn'd<br/>
His eyes around, for Hector only burn'd;<br/>
And burst like lightning through the ranks, and vow'd<br/>
To glut the god of battles with his blood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Æneas was the first who dared to stay;<br/>
Apollo wedged him in the warrior's way,<br/>
But swell'd his bosom with undaunted might,<br/>
Half-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.<br/>
Like young Lycaon, of the royal line,<br/>
In voice and aspect, seem'd the power divine;<br/>
And bade the chief reflect, how late with scorn<br/>
In distant threats he braved the goddess-born.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus the hero of Anchises' strain:<br/>
"To meet Pelides you persuade in vain:<br/>
Already have I met, nor void of fear<br/>
Observed the fury of his flying spear;<br/>
From Ida's woods he chased us to the field,<br/>
Our force he scattered, and our herds he kill'd;<br/>
Lyrnessus, Pedasus in ashes lay;<br/>
But (Jove assisting) I survived the day:<br/>
Else had I sunk oppress'd in fatal fight<br/>
By fierce Achilles and Minerva's might.<br/>
Where'er he moved, the goddess shone before,<br/>
And bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.<br/>
What mortal man Achilles can sustain?<br/>
The immortals guard him through the dreadful plain,<br/>
And suffer not his dart to fall in vain.<br/>
Were God my aid, this arm should check his power,<br/>
Though strong in battle as a brazen tower."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the son of Jove: "That god implore,<br/>
And be what great Achilles was before.<br/>
From heavenly Venus thou deriv'st thy strain,<br/>
And he but from a sister of the main;<br/>
An aged sea-god father of his line;<br/>
But Jove himself the sacred source of thine.<br/>
Then lift thy weapon for a noble blow,<br/>
Nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, and spirit breathed into his breast,<br/>
Through the thick troops the embolden'd hero press'd:<br/>
His venturous act the white-arm'd queen survey'd,<br/>
And thus, assembling all the powers, she said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Behold an action, gods! that claims your care,<br/>
Lo great Æneas rushing to the war!<br/>
Against Pelides he directs his course,<br/>
Phoebus impels, and Phoebus gives him force.<br/>
Restrain his bold career; at least, to attend<br/>
Our favour'd hero, let some power descend.<br/>
To guard his life, and add to his renown,<br/>
We, the great armament of heaven, came down.<br/>
Hereafter let him fall, as Fates design,<br/>
That spun so short his life's illustrious line:<br/>
But lest some adverse god now cross his way,<br/>
Give him to know what powers assist this day:<br/>
For how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,<br/>
When heaven's refulgent host appear in arms?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus she; and thus the god whose force can make<br/>
The solid globe's eternal basis shake:<br/>
"Against the might of man, so feeble known,<br/>
Why should celestial powers exert their own?<br/>
Suffice from yonder mount to view the scene,<br/>
And leave to war the fates of mortal men.<br/>
But if the armipotent, or god of light,<br/>
Obstruct Achilles, or commence the fight,<br/>
Thence on the gods of Troy we swift descend:<br/>
Full soon, I doubt not, shall the conflict end;<br/>
And these, in ruin and confusion hurl'd,<br/>
Yield to our conquering arms the lower world."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, the tyrant of the sea,<br/>
Coerulean Neptune, rose, and led the way.<br/>
Advanced upon the field there stood a mound<br/>
Of earth congested, wall'd, and trench'd around;<br/>
In elder times to guard Alcides made,<br/>
(The work of Trojans, with Minerva's aid,)<br/>
What time a vengeful monster of the main<br/>
Swept the wide shore, and drove him to the plain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here Neptune and the gods of Greece repair,<br/>
With clouds encompass'd, and a veil of air:<br/>
The adverse powers, around Apollo laid,<br/>
Crown the fair hills that silver Simois shade.<br/>
In circle close each heavenly party sat,<br/>
Intent to form the future scheme of fate;<br/>
But mix not yet in fight, though Jove on high<br/>
Gives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground;<br/>
The trampled centre yields a hollow sound:<br/>
Steeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright,<br/>
The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.<br/>
Amid both hosts (a dreadful space) appear,<br/>
There great Achilles; bold Æneas, here.<br/>
With towering strides Æneas first advanced;<br/>
The nodding plumage on his helmet danced:<br/>
Spread o'er his breast the fencing shield he bore,<br/>
And, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.<br/>
Not so Pelides; furious to engage,<br/>
He rush'd impetuous. Such the lion's rage,<br/>
Who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,<br/>
Though all in arms the peopled city rise,<br/>
Stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;<br/>
Till at the length, by some brave youth defied,<br/>
To his bold spear the savage turns alone,<br/>
He murmurs fury with a hollow groan;<br/>
He grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around,<br/>
Lash'd by his tail his heaving sides resound;<br/>
He calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,<br/>
Resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.<br/>
So fierce Achilles on Æneas flies;<br/>
So stands Æneas, and his force defies.<br/>
Ere yet the stern encounter join'd, begun<br/>
The seed of Thetis thus to Venus' son:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Why comes Æneas through the ranks so far?<br/>
Seeks he to meet Achilles' arm in war,<br/>
In hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,<br/>
And prove his merits to the throne of Troy?<br/>
Grant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,<br/>
The partial monarch may refuse the prize;<br/>
Sons he has many; those thy pride may quell:<br/>
And 'tis his fault to love those sons too well,<br/>
Or, in reward of thy victorious hand,<br/>
Has Troy proposed some spacious tract of land,<br/>
An ample forest, or a fair domain,<br/>
Of hills for vines, and arable for grain?<br/>
Even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.<br/>
But can Achilles be so soon forgot?<br/>
Once (as I think) you saw this brandish'd spear,<br/>
And then the great Æneas seem'd to fear:<br/>
With hearty haste from Ida's mount he fled,<br/>
Nor, till he reach'd Lyrnessus, turn'd his head.<br/>
Her lofty walls not long our progress stay'd;<br/>
Those, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:<br/>
In Grecian chains her captive race were cast;<br/>
'Tis true, the great Æneas fled too fast.<br/>
Defrauded of my conquest once before,<br/>
What then I lost, the gods this day restore.<br/>
Go; while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;<br/>
Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To this Anchises' son: "Such words employ<br/>
To one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;<br/>
Such we disdain; the best may be defied<br/>
With mean reproaches, and unmanly pride;<br/>
Unworthy the high race from which we came<br/>
Proclaim'd so loudly by the voice of fame:<br/>
Each from illustrious fathers draws his line;<br/>
Each goddess-born; half human, half divine.<br/>
Thetis' this day, or Venus' offspring dies,<br/>
And tears shall trickle from celestial eyes:<br/>
For when two heroes, thus derived, contend,<br/>
'Tis not in words the glorious strife can end.<br/>
If yet thou further seek to learn my birth<br/>
(A tale resounded through the spacious earth)<br/>
Hear how the glorious origin we prove<br/>
From ancient Dardanus, the first from Jove:<br/>
Dardania's walls he raised; for Ilion, then,<br/>
(The city since of many-languaged men,)<br/>
Was not. The natives were content to till<br/>
The shady foot of Ida's fountful hill.<br/>
From Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,<br/>
The richest, once, of Asia's wealthy kings;<br/>
Three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,<br/>
Three thousand foals beside their mothers fed.<br/>
Boreas, enamour'd of the sprightly train,<br/>
Conceal'd his godhead in a flowing mane,<br/>
With voice dissembled to his loves he neigh'd,<br/>
And coursed the dappled beauties o'er the mead:<br/>
Hence sprung twelve others of unrivall'd kind,<br/>
Swift as their mother mares, and father wind.<br/>
These lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,<br/>
Nor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;<br/>
And when along the level seas they flew,<br/>
Scarce on the surface curl'd the briny dew.<br/>
Such Erichthonius was: from him there came<br/>
The sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.<br/>
Three sons renown'd adorn'd his nuptial bed,<br/>
Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:<br/>
The matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,<br/>
Whom heaven, enamour'd, snatch'd to upper air,<br/>
To bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,<br/>
The grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).<br/>
The two remaining sons the line divide:<br/>
First rose Laomedon from Ilus' side;<br/>
From him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,<br/>
And Priam, bless'd with Hector, brave and bold;<br/>
Clytius and Lampus, ever-honour'd pair;<br/>
And Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.<br/>
From great Assaracus sprang Capys, he<br/>
Begat Anchises, and Anchises me.<br/>
Such is our race: 'tis fortune gives us birth,<br/>
But Jove alone endues the soul with worth:<br/>
He, source of power and might! with boundless sway,<br/>
All human courage gives, or takes away.<br/>
Long in the field of words we may contend,<br/>
Reproach is infinite, and knows no end,<br/>
Arm'd or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;<br/>
So voluble a weapon is the tongue;<br/>
Wounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,<br/>
For every man has equal strength to rail:<br/>
Women alone, when in the streets they jar,<br/>
Perhaps excel us in this wordy war;<br/>
Like us they stand, encompass'd with the crowd,<br/>
And vent their anger impotent and loud.<br/>
Cease then—Our business in the field of fight<br/>
Is not to question, but to prove our might.<br/>
To all those insults thou hast offer'd here,<br/>
Receive this answer: 'tis my flying spear."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,<br/>
Fix'd deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.<br/>
Far on his outstretch'd arm, Pelides held<br/>
(To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,<br/>
That trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear<br/>
Saw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.<br/>
His fears were vain; impenetrable charms<br/>
Secured the temper of the ethereal arms.<br/>
Through two strong plates the point its passage held,<br/>
But stopp'd, and rested, by the third repell'd.<br/>
Five plates of various metal, various mould,<br/>
Composed the shield; of brass each outward fold,<br/>
Of tin each inward, and the middle gold:<br/>
There stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,<br/>
The forceful spear of great Achilles flew,<br/>
And pierced the Dardan shield's extremest bound,<br/>
Where the shrill brass return'd a sharper sound:<br/>
Through the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,<br/>
And the slight covering of expanded hides.<br/>
Æneas his contracted body bends,<br/>
And o'er him high the riven targe extends,<br/>
Sees, through its parting plates, the upper air,<br/>
And at his back perceives the quivering spear:<br/>
A fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;<br/>
And swims before his eyes the many-colour'd light.<br/>
Achilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,<br/>
Draws his broad blade, and at Æneas flies:<br/>
Æneas rousing as the foe came on,<br/>
With force collected, heaves a mighty stone:<br/>
A mass enormous! which in modern days<br/>
No two of earth's degenerate sons could raise.<br/>
But ocean's god, whose earthquakes rock the ground<br/>
Saw the distress, and moved the powers around:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lo! on the brink of fate Æneas stands,<br/>
An instant victim to Achilles' hands;<br/>
By Phoebus urged; but Phoebus has bestow'd<br/>
His aid in vain: the man o'erpowers the god.<br/>
And can ye see this righteous chief atone<br/>
With guiltless blood for vices not his own?<br/>
To all the gods his constant vows were paid;<br/>
Sure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.<br/>
Fate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign<br/>
The future father of the Dardan line:<br/>
The first great ancestor obtain'd his grace,<br/>
And still his love descends on all the race:<br/>
For Priam now, and Priam's faithless kind,<br/>
At length are odious to the all-seeing mind;<br/>
On great Æneas shall devolve the reign,<br/>
And sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The great earth-shaker thus: to whom replies<br/>
The imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:<br/>
"Good as he is, to immolate or spare<br/>
The Dardan prince, O Neptune! be thy care;<br/>
Pallas and I, by all that gods can bind,<br/>
Have sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;<br/>
Not even an instant to protract their fate,<br/>
Or save one member of the sinking state;<br/>
Till her last flame be quench'd with her last gore,<br/>
And even her crumbling ruins are no more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The king of ocean to the fight descends,<br/>
Through all the whistling darts his course he bends,<br/>
Swift interposed between the warrior flies,<br/>
And casts thick darkness o'er Achilles' eyes.<br/>
From great Æneas' shield the spear he drew,<br/>
And at his master's feet the weapon threw.<br/>
That done, with force divine he snatch'd on high<br/>
The Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,<br/>
Smooth-gliding without step, above the heads<br/>
Of warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:<br/>
Till at the battle's utmost verge they light,<br/>
Where the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.<br/>
The godhead there (his heavenly form confess'd)<br/>
With words like these the panting chief address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What power, O prince! with force inferior far,<br/>
Urged thee to meet Achilles' arm in war?<br/>
Henceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,<br/>
Defrauding fate of all thy fame to come.<br/>
But when the day decreed (for come it must)<br/>
Shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,<br/>
Let then the furies of that arm be known,<br/>
Secure no Grecian force transcends thy own."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With that, he left him wondering as he lay,<br/>
Then from Achilles chased the mist away:<br/>
Sudden, returning with a stream of light,<br/>
The scene of war came rushing on his sight.<br/>
Then thus, amazed; "What wonders strike my mind!<br/>
My spear, that parted on the wings of wind,<br/>
Laid here before me! and the Dardan lord,<br/>
That fell this instant, vanish'd from my sword!<br/>
I thought alone with mortals to contend,<br/>
But powers celestial sure this foe defend.<br/>
Great as he is, our arms he scarce will try,<br/>
Content for once, with all his gods, to fly.<br/>
Now then let others bleed." This said, aloud<br/>
He vents his fury and inflames the crowd:<br/>
"O Greeks! (he cries, and every rank alarms)<br/>
Join battle, man to man, and arms to arms!<br/>
'Tis not in me, though favour'd by the sky,<br/>
To mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:<br/>
No god can singly such a host engage,<br/>
Not Mars himself, nor great Minerva's rage.<br/>
But whatsoe'er Achilles can inspire,<br/>
Whate'er of active force, or acting fire;<br/>
Whate'er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;<br/>
All, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to-day.<br/>
Through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,<br/>
And thin the squadrons with my single spear."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: nor less elate with martial joy,<br/>
The godlike Hector warm'd the troops of Troy:<br/>
"Trojans, to war! Think, Hector leads you on;<br/>
Nor dread the vaunts of Peleus' haughty son.<br/>
Deeds must decide our fate. E'en these with words<br/>
Insult the brave, who tremble at their swords:<br/>
The weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,<br/>
But shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.<br/>
Nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,<br/>
Not though his heart were steel, his hands were fire;<br/>
That fire, that steel, your Hector should withstand,<br/>
And brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;<br/>
A wood of lances rises round his head,<br/>
Clamours on clamours tempest all the air,<br/>
They join, they throng, they thicken to the war.<br/>
But Phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun<br/>
The single fight with Thetis' godlike son;<br/>
More safe to combat in the mingled band,<br/>
Nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.<br/>
He hears, obedient to the god of light,<br/>
And, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then fierce Achilles, shouting to the skies,<br/>
On Troy's whole force with boundless fury flies.<br/>
First falls Iphytion, at his army's head;<br/>
Brave was the chief, and brave the host he led;<br/>
From great Otrynteus he derived his blood,<br/>
His mother was a Nais, of the flood;<br/>
Beneath the shades of Tmolus, crown'd with snow,<br/>
From Hyde's walls he ruled the lands below.<br/>
Fierce as he springs, the sword his head divides:<br/>
The parted visage falls on equal sides:<br/>
With loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain;<br/>
While thus Achilles glories o'er the slain:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lie there, Otryntides! the Trojan earth<br/>
Receives thee dead, though Gygae boast thy birth;<br/>
Those beauteous fields where Hyllus' waves are roll'd,<br/>
And plenteous Hermus swells with tides of gold,<br/>
Are thine no more."—The insulting hero said,<br/>
And left him sleeping in eternal shade.<br/>
The rolling wheels of Greece the body tore,<br/>
And dash'd their axles with no vulgar gore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Demoleon next, Antenor's offspring, laid<br/>
Breathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.<br/>
The impatient steel with full-descending sway<br/>
Forced through his brazen helm its furious way,<br/>
Resistless drove the batter'd skull before,<br/>
And dash'd and mingled all the brains with gore.<br/>
This sees Hippodamas, and seized with fright,<br/>
Deserts his chariot for a swifter flight:<br/>
The lance arrests him: an ignoble wound<br/>
The panting Trojan rivets to the ground.<br/>
He groans away his soul: not louder roars,<br/>
At Neptune's shrine on Helice's high shores,<br/>
The victim bull; the rocks re-bellow round,<br/>
And ocean listens to the grateful sound.<br/>
Then fell on Polydore his vengeful rage,<br/>
The youngest hope of Priam's stooping age:<br/>
(Whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass'd:)<br/>
Of all his sons, the dearest, and the last.<br/>
To the forbidden field he takes his flight,<br/>
In the first folly of a youthful knight,<br/>
To vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,<br/>
But vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain:<br/>
Struck where the crossing belts unite behind,<br/>
And golden rings the double back-plate join'd<br/>
Forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;<br/>
And on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell;<br/>
The rushing entrails pour'd upon the ground<br/>
His hands collect; and darkness wraps him round.<br/>
When Hector view'd, all ghastly in his gore,<br/>
Thus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore,<br/>
A cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,<br/>
His soul no longer brook'd the distant fight:<br/>
Full in Achilles' dreadful front he came,<br/>
And shook his javelin like a waving flame.<br/>
The son of Peleus sees, with joy possess'd,<br/>
His heart high-bounding in his rising breast.<br/>
"And, lo! the man on whom black fates attend;<br/>
The man, that slew Achilles, is his friend!<br/>
No more shall Hector's and Pelides' spear<br/>
Turn from each other in the walks of war."—<br/>
Then with revengeful eyes he scann'd him o'er:<br/>
"Come, and receive thy fate!" He spake no more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hector, undaunted, thus: "Such words employ<br/>
To one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy:<br/>
Such we could give, defying and defied,<br/>
Mean intercourse of obloquy and pride!<br/>
I know thy force to mine superior far;<br/>
But heaven alone confers success in war:<br/>
Mean as I am, the gods may guide my dart,<br/>
And give it entrance in a braver heart."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then parts the lance: but Pallas' heavenly breath<br/>
Far from Achilles wafts the winged death:<br/>
The bidden dart again to Hector flies,<br/>
And at the feet of its great master lies.<br/>
Achilles closes with his hated foe,<br/>
His heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:<br/>
But present to his aid, Apollo shrouds<br/>
The favour'd hero in a veil of clouds.<br/>
Thrice struck Pelides with indignant heart,<br/>
Thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;<br/>
The spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.<br/>
He foams with fury, and exclaims aloud:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Wretch! thou hast 'scaped again; once more thy flight<br/>
Has saved thee, and the partial god of light.<br/>
But long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,<br/>
If any power assist Achilles' hand.<br/>
Fly then inglorious! but thy flight this day<br/>
Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With that, he gluts his rage on numbers slain:<br/>
Then Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain,<br/>
Pierced through the neck: he left him panting there,<br/>
And stopp'd Demuchus, great Philetor's heir.<br/>
Gigantic chief! deep gash'd the enormous blade,<br/>
And for the soul an ample passage made.<br/>
Laoganus and Dardanus expire,<br/>
The valiant sons of an unhappy sire;<br/>
Both in one instant from the chariot hurl'd,<br/>
Sunk in one instant to the nether world:<br/>
This difference only their sad fates afford<br/>
That one the spear destroy'd, and one the sword.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor less unpitied, young Alastor bleeds;<br/>
In vain his youth, in vain his beauty pleads;<br/>
In vain he begs thee, with a suppliant's moan,<br/>
To spare a form, an age so like thy own!<br/>
Unhappy boy! no prayer, no moving art,<br/>
E'er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!<br/>
While yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,<br/>
The ruthless falchion oped his tender side;<br/>
The panting liver pours a flood of gore<br/>
That drowns his bosom till he pants no more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through Mulius' head then drove the impetuous spear:<br/>
The warrior falls, transfix'd from ear to ear.<br/>
Thy life, Echeclus! next the sword bereaves,<br/>
Deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves;<br/>
Warm'd in the brain the smoking weapon lies,<br/>
The purple death comes floating o'er his eyes.<br/>
Then brave Deucalion died: the dart was flung<br/>
Where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung;<br/>
He dropp'd his arm, an unassisting weight,<br/>
And stood all impotent, expecting fate:<br/>
Full on his neck the falling falchion sped,<br/>
From his broad shoulders hew'd his crested head:<br/>
Forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,<br/>
And, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.<br/>
Rhigmas, whose race from fruitful Thracia came,<br/>
(The son of Pierus, an illustrious name,)<br/>
Succeeds to fate: the spear his belly rends;<br/>
Prone from his car the thundering chief descends.<br/>
The squire, who saw expiring on the ground<br/>
His prostrate master, rein'd the steeds around;<br/>
His back, scarce turn'd, the Pelian javelin gored,<br/>
And stretch'd the servant o'er his dying lord.<br/>
As when a flame the winding valley fills,<br/>
And runs on crackling shrubs between the hills;<br/>
Then o'er the stubble up the mountain flies,<br/>
Fires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,<br/>
This way and that, the spreading torrent roars:<br/>
So sweeps the hero through the wasted shores;<br/>
Around him wide, immense destruction pours<br/>
And earth is deluged with the sanguine showers,<br/>
As with autumnal harvests cover'd o'er,<br/>
And thick bestrewn, lies Ceres' sacred floor;<br/>
When round and round, with never-wearied pain,<br/>
The trampling steers beat out the unnumber'd grain:<br/>
So the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,<br/>
Tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes' souls,<br/>
Dash'd from their hoofs while o'er the dead they fly,<br/>
Black, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye:<br/>
The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore;<br/>
And thick the groaning axles dropp'd with gore.<br/>
High o'er the scene of death Achilles stood,<br/>
All grim with dust, all horrible in blood:<br/>
Yet still insatiate, still with rage on flame;<br/>
Such is the lust of never-dying fame!<br/>

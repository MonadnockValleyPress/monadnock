<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XIV</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
But not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,<br/>
Could charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul;<br/>
His startled ears the increasing cries attend;<br/>
Then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What new alarm, divine Machaon, say,<br/>
What mix'd events attend this mighty day?<br/>
Hark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,<br/>
And now come full, and thicken to the fleet!<br/>
Here with the cordial draught dispel thy care,<br/>
Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,<br/>
Refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore;<br/>
While I the adventures of the day explore."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: and, seizing Thrasymedes' shield,<br/>
(His valiant offspring,) hasten'd to the field;<br/>
(That day the son his father's buckler bore;)<br/>
Then snatch'd a lance, and issued from the door.<br/>
Soon as the prospect open'd to his view,<br/>
His wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew;<br/>
Dire disarray! the tumult of the fight,<br/>
The wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.<br/>
As when old ocean's silent surface sleeps,<br/>
The waves just heaving on the purple deeps:<br/>
While yet the expected tempest hangs on high,<br/>
Weighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky,<br/>
The mass of waters will no wind obey;<br/>
Jove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.<br/>
While wavering counsels thus his mind engage,<br/>
Fluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage,<br/>
To join the host, or to the general haste;<br/>
Debating long, he fixes on the last:<br/>
Yet, as he moves, the sight his bosom warms,<br/>
The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,<br/>
The gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly;<br/>
Blows echo blows, and all or kill or die.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Him, in his march, the wounded princes meet,<br/>
By tardy steps ascending from the fleet:<br/>
The king of men, Ulysses the divine,<br/>
And who to Tydeus owes his noble line.<br/>
(Their ships at distance from the battle stand,<br/>
In lines advanced along the shelving strand:<br/>
Whose bay, the fleet unable to contain<br/>
At length; beside the margin of the main.<br/>
Rank above rank, the crowded ships they moor:<br/>
Who landed first, lay highest on the shore.)<br/>
Supported on the spears, they took their way,<br/>
Unfit to fight, but anxious for the day.<br/>
Nestor's approach alarm'd each Grecian breast,<br/>
Whom thus the general of the host address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O grace and glory of the Achaian name;<br/>
What drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame?<br/>
Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill'd,<br/>
Our fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill'd?<br/>
Such was his threat, ah! now too soon made good,<br/>
On many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.<br/>
Is every heart inflamed with equal rage<br/>
Against your king, nor will one chief engage?<br/>
And have I lived to see with mournful eyes<br/>
In every Greek a new Achilles rise?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Gerenian Nestor then: "So fate has will'd;<br/>
And all-confirming time has fate fulfill'd.<br/>
Not he that thunders from the aerial bower,<br/>
Not Jove himself, upon the past has power.<br/>
The wall, our late inviolable bound,<br/>
And best defence, lies smoking on the ground:<br/>
Even to the ships their conquering arms extend,<br/>
And groans of slaughter'd Greeks to heaven ascend.<br/>
On speedy measures then employ your thought<br/>
In such distress! if counsel profit aught:<br/>
Arms cannot much: though Mars our souls incite,<br/>
These gaping wounds withhold us from the fight."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To him the monarch: "That our army bends,<br/>
That Troy triumphant our high fleet ascends,<br/>
And that the rampart, late our surest trust<br/>
And best defence, lies smoking in the dust;<br/>
All this from Jove's afflictive hand we bear,<br/>
Who, far from Argos, wills our ruin here.<br/>
Past are the days when happier Greece was blest,<br/>
And all his favour, all his aid confess'd;<br/>
Now heaven averse, our hands from battle ties,<br/>
And lifts the Trojan glory to the skies.<br/>
Cease we at length to waste our blood in vain,<br/>
And launch what ships lie nearest to the main;<br/>
Leave these at anchor, till the coming night:<br/>
Then, if impetuous Troy forbear the fight,<br/>
Bring all to sea, and hoist each sail for flight.<br/>
Better from evils, well foreseen, to run,<br/>
Than perish in the danger we may shun."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus he. The sage Ulysses thus replies,<br/>
While anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes:<br/>
"What shameful words (unkingly as thou art)<br/>
Fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart?<br/>
Oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers,<br/>
And thou the shame of any host but ours!<br/>
A host, by Jove endued with martial might,<br/>
And taught to conquer, or to fall in fight:<br/>
Adventurous combats and bold wars to wage,<br/>
Employ'd our youth, and yet employs our age.<br/>
And wilt thou thus desert the Trojan plain?<br/>
And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?<br/>
In such base sentence if thou couch thy fear,<br/>
Speak it in whispers, lest a Greek should hear.<br/>
Lives there a man so dead to fame, who dares<br/>
To think such meanness, or the thought declares?<br/>
And comes it even from him whose sovereign sway<br/>
The banded legions of all Greece obey?<br/>
Is this a general's voice that calls to flight,<br/>
While war hangs doubtful, while his soldiers fight?<br/>
What more could Troy? What yet their fate denies<br/>
Thou givest the foe: all Greece becomes their prize.<br/>
No more the troops (our hoisted sails in view,<br/>
Themselves abandon'd) shall the fight pursue;<br/>
But thy ships flying, with despair shall see;<br/>
And owe destruction to a prince like thee."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thy just reproofs (Atrides calm replies)<br/>
Like arrows pierce me, for thy words are wise.<br/>
Unwilling as I am to lose the host,<br/>
I force not Greece to quit this hateful coast;<br/>
Glad I submit, whoe'er, or young, or old,<br/>
Aught, more conducive to our weal, unfold."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Tydides cut him short, and thus began:<br/>
"Such counsel if you seek, behold the man<br/>
Who boldly gives it, and what he shall say,<br/>
Young though he be, disdain not to obey:<br/>
A youth, who from the mighty Tydeus springs,<br/>
May speak to councils and assembled kings.<br/>
Hear then in me the great OEnides' son,<br/>
Whose honoured dust (his race of glory run)<br/>
Lies whelm'd in ruins of the Theban wall;<br/>
Brave in his life, and glorious in his fall.<br/>
With three bold sons was generous Prothous bless'd,<br/>
Who Pleuron's walls and Calydon possess'd;<br/>
Melas and Agrius, but (who far surpass'd<br/>
The rest in courage) OEneus was the last.<br/>
From him, my sire. From Calydon expell'd,<br/>
He pass'd to Argos, and in exile dwell'd;<br/>
The monarch's daughter there (so Jove ordain'd)<br/>
He won, and flourish'd where Adrastus reign'd;<br/>
There, rich in fortune's gifts, his acres till'd,<br/>
Beheld his vines their liquid harvest yield,<br/>
And numerous flocks that whiten'd all the field.<br/>
Such Tydeus was, the foremost once in fame!<br/>
Nor lives in Greece a stranger to his name.<br/>
Then, what for common good my thoughts inspire,<br/>
Attend, and in the son respect the sire.<br/>
Though sore of battle, though with wounds oppress'd,<br/>
Let each go forth, and animate the rest,<br/>
Advance the glory which he cannot share,<br/>
Though not partaker, witness of the war.<br/>
But lest new wounds on wounds o'erpower us quite,<br/>
Beyond the missile javelin's sounding flight,<br/>
Safe let us stand; and, from the tumult far,<br/>
Inspire the ranks, and rule the distant war."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He added not: the listening kings obey,<br/>
Slow moving on; Atrides leads the way.<br/>
The god of ocean (to inflame their rage)<br/>
Appears a warrior furrowed o'er with age;<br/>
Press'd in his own, the general's hand he took,<br/>
And thus the venerable hero spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Atrides! lo! with what disdainful eye<br/>
Achilles sees his country's forces fly;<br/>
Blind, impious man! whose anger is his guide,<br/>
Who glories in unutterable pride.<br/>
So may he perish, so may Jove disclaim<br/>
The wretch relentless, and o'erwhelm with shame!<br/>
But Heaven forsakes not thee: o'er yonder sands<br/>
Soon shall thou view the scattered Trojan bands<br/>
Fly diverse; while proud kings, and chiefs renown'd,<br/>
Driven heaps on heaps, with clouds involved around<br/>
Of rolling dust, their winged wheels employ<br/>
To hide their ignominious heads in Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, then rush'd amid the warrior crew,<br/>
And sent his voice before him as he flew,<br/>
Loud, as the shout encountering armies yield<br/>
When twice ten thousand shake the labouring field;<br/>
Such was the voice, and such the thundering sound<br/>
Of him whose trident rends the solid ground.<br/>
Each Argive bosom beats to meet the fight,<br/>
And grisly war appears a pleasing sight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meantime Saturnia from Olympus' brow,<br/>
High-throned in gold, beheld the fields below;<br/>
With joy the glorious conflict she survey'd,<br/>
Where her great brother gave the Grecians aid.<br/>
But placed aloft, on Ida's shady height<br/>
She sees her Jove, and trembles at the sight.<br/>
Jove to deceive, what methods shall she try,<br/>
What arts, to blind his all-beholding eye?<br/>
At length she trusts her power; resolved to prove<br/>
The old, yet still successful, cheat of love;<br/>
Against his wisdom to oppose her charms,<br/>
And lull the lord of thunders in her arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift to her bright apartment she repairs,<br/>
Sacred to dress and beauty's pleasing cares:<br/>
With skill divine had Vulcan form'd the bower,<br/>
Safe from access of each intruding power.<br/>
Touch'd with her secret key, the doors unfold:<br/>
Self-closed, behind her shut the valves of gold.<br/>
Here first she bathes; and round her body pours<br/>
Soft oils of fragrance, and ambrosial showers:<br/>
The winds, perfumed, the balmy gale convey<br/>
Through heaven, through earth, and all the aerial way:<br/>
Spirit divine! whose exhalation greets<br/>
The sense of gods with more than mortal sweets.<br/>
Thus while she breathed of heaven, with decent pride<br/>
Her artful hands the radiant tresses tied;<br/>
Part on her head in shining ringlets roll'd,<br/>
Part o'er her shoulders waved like melted gold.<br/>
Around her next a heavenly mantle flow'd,<br/>
That rich with Pallas' labour'd colours glow'd:<br/>
Large clasps of gold the foldings gather'd round,<br/>
A golden zone her swelling bosom bound.<br/>
Far-beaming pendants tremble in her ear,<br/>
Each gem illumined with a triple star.<br/>
Then o'er her head she cast a veil more white<br/>
Than new-fallen snow, and dazzling as the light.<br/>
Last her fair feet celestial sandals grace.<br/>
Thus issuing radiant with majestic pace,<br/>
Forth from the dome the imperial goddess moves,<br/>
And calls the mother of the smiles and loves.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"How long (to Venus thus apart she cried)<br/>
Shall human strife celestial minds divide?<br/>
Ah yet, will Venus aid Saturnia's joy,<br/>
And set aside the cause of Greece and Troy?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Let heaven's dread empress (Cytheraea said)<br/>
Speak her request, and deem her will obey'd."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then grant me (said the queen) those conquering charms,<br/>
That power, which mortals and immortals warms,<br/>
That love, which melts mankind in fierce desires,<br/>
And burns the sons of heaven with sacred fires!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"For lo! I haste to those remote abodes,<br/>
Where the great parents, (sacred source of gods!)<br/>
Ocean and Tethys their old empire keep,<br/>
On the last limits of the land and deep.<br/>
In their kind arms my tender years were past;<br/>
What time old Saturn, from Olympus cast,<br/>
Of upper heaven to Jove resign'd the reign,<br/>
Whelm'd under the huge mass of earth and main.<br/>
For strife, I hear, has made the union cease,<br/>
Which held so long that ancient pair in peace.<br/>
What honour, and what love, shall I obtain,<br/>
If I compose those fatal feuds again;<br/>
Once more their minds in mutual ties engage,<br/>
And, what my youth has owed, repay their age!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
She said. With awe divine, the queen of love<br/>
Obey'd the sister and the wife of Jove;<br/>
And from her fragrant breast the zone embraced,<br/>
With various skill and high embroidery graced.<br/>
In this was every art, and every charm,<br/>
To win the wisest, and the coldest warm:<br/>
Fond love, the gentle vow, the gay desire,<br/>
The kind deceit, the still-reviving fire,<br/>
Persuasive speech, and the more persuasive sighs,<br/>
Silence that spoke, and eloquence of eyes.<br/>
This on her hand the Cyprian Goddess laid:<br/>
"Take this, and with it all thy wish;" she said.<br/>
With smiles she took the charm; and smiling press'd<br/>
The powerful cestus to her snowy breast.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Venus to the courts of Jove withdrew;<br/>
Whilst from Olympus pleased Saturnia flew.<br/>
O'er high Pieria thence her course she bore,<br/>
O'er fair Emathia's ever-pleasing shore,<br/>
O'er Hemus' hills with snows eternal crown'd;<br/>
Nor once her flying foot approach'd the ground.<br/>
Then taking wing from Athos' lofty steep,<br/>
She speeds to Lemnos o'er the rolling deep,<br/>
And seeks the cave of Death's half-brother, Sleep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Sweet pleasing Sleep! (Saturnia thus began)<br/>
Who spread'st thy empire o'er each god and man;<br/>
If e'er obsequious to thy Juno's will,<br/>
O power of slumbers! hear, and favour still.<br/>
Shed thy soft dews on Jove's immortal eyes,<br/>
While sunk in love's entrancing joys he lies.<br/>
A splendid footstool, and a throne, that shine<br/>
With gold unfading, Somnus, shall be thine;<br/>
The work of Vulcan; to indulge thy ease,<br/>
When wine and feasts thy golden humours please."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Imperial dame (the balmy power replies),<br/>
Great Saturn's heir, and empress of the skies!<br/>
O'er other gods I spread my easy chain;<br/>
The sire of all, old Ocean, owns my reign.<br/>
And his hush'd waves lie silent on the main.<br/>
But how, unbidden, shall I dare to steep<br/>
Jove's awful temples in the dew of sleep?<br/>
Long since, too venturous, at thy bold command,<br/>
On those eternal lids I laid my hand;<br/>
What time, deserting Ilion's wasted plain,<br/>
His conquering son, Alcides, plough'd the main.<br/>
When lo! the deeps arise, the tempests roar,<br/>
And drive the hero to the Coan shore:<br/>
Great Jove, awaking, shook the blest abodes<br/>
With rising wrath, and tumbled gods on gods;<br/>
Me chief he sought, and from the realms on high<br/>
Had hurl'd indignant to the nether sky,<br/>
But gentle Night, to whom I fled for aid,<br/>
(The friend of earth and heaven,) her wings display'd;<br/>
Impower'd the wrath of gods and men to tame,<br/>
Even Jove revered the venerable dame."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Vain are thy fears (the queen of heaven replies,<br/>
And, speaking, rolls her large majestic eyes);<br/>
Think'st thou that Troy has Jove's high favour won,<br/>
Like great Alcides, his all-conquering son?<br/>
Hear, and obey the mistress of the skies,<br/>
Nor for the deed expect a vulgar prize;<br/>
For know, thy loved-one shall be ever thine,<br/>
The youngest Grace, Pasithae the divine."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Swear then (he said) by those tremendous floods<br/>
That roar through hell, and bind the invoking gods:<br/>
Let the great parent earth one hand sustain,<br/>
And stretch the other o'er the sacred main:<br/>
Call the black Titans, that with Chronos dwell,<br/>
To hear and witness from the depths of hell;<br/>
That she, my loved-one, shall be ever mine,<br/>
The youngest Grace, Pasithae the divine."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The queen assents, and from the infernal bowers<br/>
Invokes the sable subtartarean powers,<br/>
And those who rule the inviolable floods,<br/>
Whom mortals name the dread Titanian gods.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then swift as wind, o'er Lemnos' smoky isle<br/>
They wing their way, and Imbrus' sea-beat soil;<br/>
Through air, unseen, involved in darkness glide,<br/>
And light on Lectos, on the point of Ide:<br/>
(Mother of savages, whose echoing hills<br/>
Are heard resounding with a hundred rills:)<br/>
Fair Ida trembles underneath the god;<br/>
Hush'd are her mountains, and her forests nod.<br/>
There on a fir, whose spiry branches rise<br/>
To join its summit to the neighbouring skies;<br/>
Dark in embowering shade, conceal'd from sight,<br/>
Sat Sleep, in likeness of the bird of night.<br/>
(Chalcis his name by those of heavenly birth,<br/>
But call'd Cymindis by the race of earth.)<br/>
</p>
<p>
To Ida's top successful Juno flies;<br/>
Great Jove surveys her with desiring eyes:<br/>
The god, whose lightning sets the heavens on fire,<br/>
Through all his bosom feels the fierce desire;<br/>
Fierce as when first by stealth he seized her charms,<br/>
Mix'd with her soul, and melted in her arms:<br/>
Fix'd on her eyes he fed his eager look,<br/>
Then press'd her hand, and thus with transport spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Why comes my goddess from the ethereal sky,<br/>
And not her steeds and flaming chariot nigh?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then she&mdash;"I haste to those remote abodes<br/>
Where the great parents of the deathless gods,<br/>
The reverend Ocean and gray Tethys, reign,<br/>
On the last limits of the land and main.<br/>
I visit these, to whose indulgent cares<br/>
I owe the nursing of my tender years:<br/>
For strife, I hear, has made that union cease<br/>
Which held so long that ancient pair in peace.<br/>
The steeds, prepared my chariot to convey<br/>
O'er earth and seas, and through the aerial way,<br/>
Wait under Ide: of thy superior power<br/>
To ask consent, I leave the Olympian bower;<br/>
Nor seek, unknown to thee, the sacred cells<br/>
Deep under seas, where hoary Ocean dwells."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"For that (said Jove) suffice another day!<br/>
But eager love denies the least delay.<br/>
Let softer cares the present hour employ,<br/>
And be these moments sacred all to joy.<br/>
Ne'er did my soul so strong a passion prove,<br/>
Or for an earthly, or a heavenly love:<br/>
Not when I press'd Ixion's matchless dame,<br/>
Whence rose Pirithous like the gods in fame:<br/>
Not when fair Danae felt the shower of gold<br/>
Stream into life, whence Perseus brave and bold.<br/>
Not thus I burn'd for either Theban dame:<br/>
(Bacchus from this, from that Alcides came:)<br/>
Nor Phoenix' daughter, beautiful and young,<br/>
Whence godlike Rhadamanth and Minos sprung.<br/>
Not thus I burn'd for fair Latona's face,<br/>
Nor comelier Ceres' more majestic grace.<br/>
Not thus even for thyself I felt desire,<br/>
As now my veins receive the pleasing fire."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; the goddess with the charming eyes<br/>
Glows with celestial red, and thus replies:<br/>
"Is this a scene for love? On Ida's height,<br/>
Exposed to mortal and immortal sight!<br/>
Our joys profaned by each familiar eye;<br/>
The sport of heaven, and fable of the sky:<br/>
How shall I e'er review the blest abodes,<br/>
Or mix among the senate of the gods?<br/>
Shall I not think, that, with disorder'd charms,<br/>
All heaven beholds me recent from thy arms?<br/>
With skill divine has Vulcan form'd thy bower,<br/>
Sacred to love and to the genial hour;<br/>
If such thy will, to that recess retire,<br/>
In secret there indulge thy soft desire."<br/>
</p>
<p>
She ceased; and, smiling with superior love,<br/>
Thus answer'd mild the cloud-compelling Jove:<br/>
"Nor god nor mortal shall our joys behold,<br/>
Shaded with clouds, and circumfused in gold;<br/>
Not even the sun, who darts through heaven his rays,<br/>
And whose broad eye the extended earth surveys."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Gazing he spoke, and, kindling at the view,<br/>
His eager arms around the goddess threw.<br/>
Glad Earth perceives, and from her bosom pours<br/>
Unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers:<br/>
Thick new-born violets a soft carpet spread,<br/>
And clustering lotos swell'd the rising bed,<br/>
And sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow,<br/>
And flamy crocus made the mountain glow<br/>
There golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair,<br/>
Steep'd in soft joys and circumfused with air;<br/>
Celestial dews, descending o'er the ground,<br/>
Perfume the mount, and breathe ambrosia round:<br/>
At length, with love and sleep's soft power oppress'd,<br/>
The panting thunderer nods, and sinks to rest.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now to the navy borne on silent wings,<br/>
To Neptune's ear soft Sleep his message brings;<br/>
Beside him sudden, unperceived, he stood,<br/>
And thus with gentle words address'd the god:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Now, Neptune! now, the important hour employ,<br/>
To check a while the haughty hopes of Troy:<br/>
While Jove yet rests, while yet my vapours shed<br/>
The golden vision round his sacred head;<br/>
For Juno's love, and Somnus' pleasing ties,<br/>
Have closed those awful and eternal eyes."<br/>
Thus having said, the power of slumber flew,<br/>
On human lids to drop the balmy dew.<br/>
Neptune, with zeal increased, renews his care,<br/>
And towering in the foremost ranks of war,<br/>
Indignant thus&mdash;"Oh once of martial fame!<br/>
O Greeks! if yet ye can deserve the name!<br/>
This half-recover'd day shall Troy obtain?<br/>
Shall Hector thunder at your ships again?<br/>
Lo! still he vaunts, and threats the fleet with fires,<br/>
While stern Achilles in his wrath retires.<br/>
One hero's loss too tamely you deplore,<br/>
Be still yourselves, and ye shall need no more.<br/>
Oh yet, if glory any bosom warms,<br/>
Brace on your firmest helms, and stand to arms:<br/>
His strongest spear each valiant Grecian wield,<br/>
Each valiant Grecian seize his broadest shield;<br/>
Let to the weak the lighter arms belong,<br/>
The ponderous targe be wielded by the strong.<br/>
Thus arm'd, not Hector shall our presence stay;<br/>
Myself, ye Greeks! myself will lead the way."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The troops assent; their martial arms they change:<br/>
The busy chiefs their banded legions range.<br/>
The kings, though wounded, and oppress'd with pain,<br/>
With helpful hands themselves assist the train.<br/>
The strong and cumbrous arms the valiant wield,<br/>
The weaker warrior takes a lighter shield.<br/>
Thus sheath'd in shining brass, in bright array<br/>
The legions march, and Neptune leads the way:<br/>
His brandish'd falchion flames before their eyes,<br/>
Like lightning flashing through the frighted skies.<br/>
Clad in his might, the earth-shaking power appears;<br/>
Pale mortals tremble, and confess their fears.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Troy's great defender stands alone unawed,<br/>
Arms his proud host, and dares oppose a god:<br/>
And lo! the god, and wondrous man, appear:<br/>
The sea's stern ruler there, and Hector here.<br/>
The roaring main, at her great master's call,<br/>
Rose in huge ranks, and form'd a watery wall<br/>
Around the ships: seas hanging o'er the shores,<br/>
Both armies join: earth thunders, ocean roars.<br/>
Not half so loud the bellowing deeps resound,<br/>
When stormy winds disclose the dark profound;<br/>
Less loud the winds that from the Æolian hall<br/>
Roar through the woods, and make whole forests fall;<br/>
Less loud the woods, when flames in torrents pour,<br/>
Catch the dry mountain, and its shades devour;<br/>
With such a rage the meeting hosts are driven,<br/>
And such a clamour shakes the sounding heaven.<br/>
The first bold javelin, urged by Hector's force,<br/>
Direct at Ajax' bosom winged its course;<br/>
But there no pass the crossing belts afford,<br/>
(One braced his shield, and one sustain'd his sword.)<br/>
Then back the disappointed Trojan drew,<br/>
And cursed the lance that unavailing flew:<br/>
But 'scaped not Ajax; his tempestuous hand<br/>
A ponderous stone upheaving from the sand,<br/>
(Where heaps laid loose beneath the warrior's feet,<br/>
Or served to ballast, or to prop the fleet,)<br/>
Toss'd round and round, the missive marble flings;<br/>
On the razed shield the fallen ruin rings,<br/>
Full on his breast and throat with force descends;<br/>
Nor deaden'd there its giddy fury spends,<br/>
But whirling on, with many a fiery round,<br/>
Smokes in the dust, and ploughs into the ground.<br/>
As when the bolt, red-hissing from above,<br/>
Darts on the consecrated plant of Jove,<br/>
The mountain-oak in flaming ruin lies,<br/>
Black from the blow, and smokes of sulphur rise;<br/>
Stiff with amaze the pale beholders stand,<br/>
And own the terrors of the almighty hand!<br/>
So lies great Hector prostrate on the shore;<br/>
His slacken'd hand deserts the lance it bore;<br/>
His following shield the fallen chief o'erspread;<br/>
Beneath his helmet dropp'd his fainting head;<br/>
His load of armour, sinking to the ground,<br/>
Clanks on the field, a dead and hollow sound.<br/>
Loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain;<br/>
Greece sees, in hope, Troy's great defender slain:<br/>
All spring to seize him; storms of arrows fly,<br/>
And thicker javelins intercept the sky.<br/>
In vain an iron tempest hisses round;<br/>
He lies protected, and without a wound.<br/>
Polydamas, Agenor the divine,<br/>
The pious warrior of Anchises' line,<br/>
And each bold leader of the Lycian band,<br/>
With covering shields (a friendly circle) stand,<br/>
His mournful followers, with assistant care,<br/>
The groaning hero to his chariot bear;<br/>
His foaming coursers, swifter than the wind,<br/>
Speed to the town, and leave the war behind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When now they touch'd the mead's enamell'd side,<br/>
Where gentle Xanthus rolls his easy tide,<br/>
With watery drops the chief they sprinkle round,<br/>
Placed on the margin of the flowery ground.<br/>
Raised on his knees, he now ejects the gore;<br/>
Now faints anew, low-sinking on the shore;<br/>
By fits he breathes, half views the fleeting skies,<br/>
And seals again, by fits, his swimming eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Soon as the Greeks the chief's retreat beheld,<br/>
With double fury each invades the field.<br/>
Oilean Ajax first his javelin sped,<br/>
Pierced by whose point the son of Enops bled;<br/>
(Satnius the brave, whom beauteous Neis bore<br/>
Amidst her flocks on Satnio's silver shore;)<br/>
Struck through the belly's rim, the warrior lies<br/>
Supine, and shades eternal veil his eyes.<br/>
An arduous battle rose around the dead;<br/>
By turns the Greeks, by turns the Trojans bled.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fired with revenge, Polydamas drew near,<br/>
And at Prothoenor shook the trembling spear;<br/>
The driving javelin through his shoulder thrust,<br/>
He sinks to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.<br/>
"Lo thus (the victor cries) we rule the field,<br/>
And thus their arms the race of Panthus wield:<br/>
From this unerring hand there flies no dart<br/>
But bathes its point within a Grecian heart.<br/>
Propp'd on that spear to which thou owest thy fall,<br/>
Go, guide thy darksome steps to Pluto's dreary hall."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and sorrow touch'd each Argive breast:<br/>
The soul of Ajax burn'd above the rest.<br/>
As by his side the groaning warrior fell,<br/>
At the fierce foe he launch'd his piercing steel;<br/>
The foe, reclining, shunn'd the flying death;<br/>
But fate, Archilochus, demands thy breath:<br/>
Thy lofty birth no succour could impart,<br/>
The wings of death o'ertook thee on the dart;<br/>
Swift to perform heaven's fatal will, it fled<br/>
Full on the juncture of the neck and head,<br/>
And took the joint, and cut the nerves in twain:<br/>
The dropping head first tumbled on the plain.<br/>
So just the stroke, that yet the body stood<br/>
Erect, then roll'd along the sands in blood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Here, proud Polydamas, here turn thy eyes!<br/>
(The towering Ajax loud-insulting cries:)<br/>
Say, is this chief extended on the plain<br/>
A worthy vengeance for Prothoenor slain?<br/>
Mark well his port! his figure and his face<br/>
Nor speak him vulgar, nor of vulgar race;<br/>
Some lines, methinks, may make his lineage known,<br/>
Antenor's brother, or perhaps his son."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spake, and smiled severe, for well he knew<br/>
The bleeding youth: Troy sadden'd at the view.<br/>
But furious Acamas avenged his cause;<br/>
As Promachus his slaughtered brother draws,<br/>
He pierced his heart&mdash;"Such fate attends you all,<br/>
Proud Argives! destined by our arms to fall.<br/>
Not Troy alone, but haughty Greece, shall share<br/>
The toils, the sorrows, and the wounds of war.<br/>
Behold your Promachus deprived of breath,<br/>
A victim owed to my brave brother's death.<br/>
Not unappeased he enters Pluto's gate,<br/>
Who leaves a brother to revenge his fate."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Heart-piercing anguish struck the Grecian host,<br/>
But touch'd the breast of bold Peneleus most;<br/>
At the proud boaster he directs his course;<br/>
The boaster flies, and shuns superior force.<br/>
But young Ilioneus received the spear;<br/>
Ilioneus, his father's only care:<br/>
(Phorbas the rich, of all the Trojan train<br/>
Whom Hermes loved, and taught the arts of gain:)<br/>
Full in his eye the weapon chanced to fall,<br/>
And from the fibres scoop'd the rooted ball,<br/>
Drove through the neck, and hurl'd him to the plain;<br/>
He lifts his miserable arms in vain!<br/>
Swift his broad falchion fierce Peneleus spread,<br/>
And from the spouting shoulders struck his head;<br/>
To earth at once the head and helmet fly;<br/>
The lance, yet sticking through the bleeding eye,<br/>
The victor seized; and, as aloft he shook<br/>
The gory visage, thus insulting spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Trojans! your great Ilioneus behold!<br/>
Haste, to his father let the tale be told:<br/>
Let his high roofs resound with frantic woe,<br/>
Such as the house of Promachus must know;<br/>
Let doleful tidings greet his mother's ear,<br/>
Such as to Promachus' sad spouse we bear,<br/>
When we victorious shall to Greece return,<br/>
And the pale matron in our triumphs mourn."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Dreadful he spoke, then toss'd the head on high;<br/>
The Trojans hear, they tremble, and they fly:<br/>
Aghast they gaze around the fleet and wall,<br/>
And dread the ruin that impends on all.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Daughters of Jove! that on Olympus shine,<br/>
Ye all-beholding, all-recording nine!<br/>
O say, when Neptune made proud Ilion yield,<br/>
What chief, what hero first embrued the field?<br/>
Of all the Grecians what immortal name,<br/>
And whose bless'd trophies, will ye raise to fame?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thou first, great Ajax! on the unsanguined plain<br/>
Laid Hyrtius, leader of the Mysian train.<br/>
Phalces and Mermer, Nestor's son o'erthrew,<br/>
Bold Merion, Morys and Hippotion slew.<br/>
Strong Periphaetes and Prothoon bled,<br/>
By Teucer's arrows mingled with the dead,<br/>
Pierced in the flank by Menelaus' steel,<br/>
His people's pastor, Hyperenor fell;<br/>
Eternal darkness wrapp'd the warrior round,<br/>
And the fierce soul came rushing through the wound.<br/>
But stretch'd in heaps before Oileus' son,<br/>
Fall mighty numbers, mighty numbers run;<br/>
Ajax the less, of all the Grecian race<br/>
Skill'd in pursuit, and swiftest in the chase.<br/>

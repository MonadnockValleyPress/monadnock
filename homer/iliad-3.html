<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book III</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Thus by their leaders' care each martial band<br/>
Moves into ranks, and stretches o'er the land.<br/>
With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,<br/>
Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war.<br/>
So when inclement winters vex the plain<br/>
With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,<br/>
To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,<br/>
With noise, and order, through the midway sky;<br/>
To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,<br/>
And all the war descends upon the wing,<br/>
But silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill'd<br/>
By mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,<br/>
Swift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around<br/>
Darkening arises from the labour'd ground.<br/>
Thus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds<br/>
A night of vapours round the mountain heads,<br/>
Swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,<br/>
To thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;<br/>
While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,<br/>
Lost and confused amidst the thicken'd day:<br/>
So wrapp'd in gathering dust, the Grecian train,<br/>
A moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now front to front the hostile armies stand,<br/>
Eager of fight, and only wait command;<br/>
When, to the van, before the sons of fame<br/>
Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:<br/>
In form a god! the panther's speckled hide<br/>
Flow'd o'er his armour with an easy pride:<br/>
His bended bow across his shoulders flung,<br/>
His sword beside him negligently hung;<br/>
Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,<br/>
And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,<br/>
He boldly stalk'd, the foremost on the plain,<br/>
Him Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies,<br/>
With heart elated, and with joyful eyes:<br/>
So joys a lion, if the branching deer,<br/>
Or mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear;<br/>
Eager he seizes and devours the slain,<br/>
Press'd by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.<br/>
Thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,<br/>
In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground<br/>
From his high chariot: him, approaching near,<br/>
The beauteous champion views with marks of fear,<br/>
Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,<br/>
And shuns the fate he well deserved to find.<br/>
As when some shepherd, from the rustling trees<br/>
Shot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees,<br/>
Trembling and pale, he starts with wild affright<br/>
And all confused precipitates his flight:<br/>
So from the king the shining warrior flies,<br/>
And plunged amid the thickest Trojans lies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As godlike Hector sees the prince retreat,<br/>
He thus upbraids him with a generous heat:<br/>
"Unhappy Paris! but to women brave!<br/>
So fairly form'd, and only to deceive!<br/>
Oh, hadst thou died when first thou saw'st the light,<br/>
Or died at least before thy nuptial rite!<br/>
A better fate than vainly thus to boast,<br/>
And fly, the scandal of thy Trojan host.<br/>
Gods! how the scornful Greeks exult to see<br/>
Their fears of danger undeceived in thee!<br/>
Thy figure promised with a martial air,<br/>
But ill thy soul supplies a form so fair.<br/>
In former days, in all thy gallant pride,<br/>
When thy tall ships triumphant stemm'd the tide,<br/>
When Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,<br/>
And crowds stood wondering at the passing show,<br/>
Say, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,<br/>
You met the approaches of the Spartan queen,<br/>
Thus from her realm convey'd the beauteous prize,<br/>
And both her warlike lords outshined in Helen's eyes?<br/>
This deed, thy foes' delight, thy own disgrace,<br/>
Thy father's grief, and ruin of thy race;<br/>
This deed recalls thee to the proffer'd fight;<br/>
Or hast thou injured whom thou dar'st not right?<br/>
Soon to thy cost the field would make thee know<br/>
Thou keep'st the consort of a braver foe.<br/>
Thy graceful form instilling soft desire,<br/>
Thy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,<br/>
Beauty and youth; in vain to these you trust,<br/>
When youth and beauty shall be laid in dust:<br/>
Troy yet may wake, and one avenging blow<br/>
Crush the dire author of his country's woe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
His silence here, with blushes, Paris breaks:<br/>
"'Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks:<br/>
But who like thee can boast a soul sedate,<br/>
So firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?<br/>
Thy force, like steel, a temper'd hardness shows,<br/>
Still edged to wound, and still untired with blows,<br/>
Like steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain,<br/>
With falling woods to strew the wasted plain.<br/>
Thy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms<br/>
With which a lover golden Venus arms;<br/>
Soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,<br/>
No wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.<br/>
Yet, would'st thou have the proffer'd combat stand,<br/>
The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;<br/>
Then let a midway space our hosts divide,<br/>
And, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:<br/>
By Paris there the Spartan king be fought,<br/>
For beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;<br/>
And who his rival can in arms subdue,<br/>
His be the fair, and his the treasure too.<br/>
Thus with a lasting league your toils may cease,<br/>
And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace;<br/>
Thus may the Greeks review their native shore,<br/>
Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said. The challenge Hector heard with joy,<br/>
Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,<br/>
Held by the midst, athwart; and near the foe<br/>
Advanced with steps majestically slow:<br/>
While round his dauntless head the Grecians pour<br/>
Their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried:<br/>
"Forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:<br/>
A parley Hector asks, a message bears;<br/>
We know him by the various plume he wears."<br/>
Awed by his high command the Greeks attend,<br/>
The tumult silence, and the fight suspend.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While from the centre Hector rolls his eyes<br/>
On either host, and thus to both applies:<br/>
"Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,<br/>
What Paris, author of the war, demands.<br/>
Your shining swords within the sheath restrain,<br/>
And pitch your lances in the yielding plain.<br/>
Here in the midst, in either army's sight,<br/>
He dares the Spartan king to single fight;<br/>
And wills that Helen and the ravish'd spoil,<br/>
That caused the contest, shall reward the toil.<br/>
Let these the brave triumphant victor grace,<br/>
And different nations part in leagues of peace."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke: in still suspense on either side<br/>
Each army stood: the Spartan chief replied:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right<br/>
A world engages in the toils of fight.<br/>
To me the labour of the field resign;<br/>
Me Paris injured; all the war be mine.<br/>
Fall he that must, beneath his rival's arms;<br/>
And live the rest, secure of future harms.<br/>
Two lambs, devoted by your country's rite,<br/>
To earth a sable, to the sun a white,<br/>
Prepare, ye Trojans! while a third we bring<br/>
Select to Jove, the inviolable king.<br/>
Let reverend Priam in the truce engage,<br/>
And add the sanction of considerate age;<br/>
His sons are faithless, headlong in debate,<br/>
And youth itself an empty wavering state;<br/>
Cool age advances, venerably wise,<br/>
Turns on all hands its deep-discerning eyes;<br/>
Sees what befell, and what may yet befall,<br/>
Concludes from both, and best provides for all.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The nations hear with rising hopes possess'd,<br/>
And peaceful prospects dawn in every breast.<br/>
Within the lines they drew their steeds around,<br/>
And from their chariots issued on the ground;<br/>
Next, all unbuckling the rich mail they wore,<br/>
Laid their bright arms along the sable shore.<br/>
On either side the meeting hosts are seen<br/>
With lances fix'd, and close the space between.<br/>
Two heralds now, despatch'd to Troy, invite<br/>
The Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Talthybius hastens to the fleet, to bring<br/>
The lamb for Jove, the inviolable king.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meantime to beauteous Helen, from the skies<br/>
The various goddess of the rainbow flies:<br/>
(Like fair Laodice in form and face,<br/>
The loveliest nymph of Priam's royal race:)<br/>
Her in the palace, at her loom she found;<br/>
The golden web her own sad story crown'd,<br/>
The Trojan wars she weaved (herself the prize)<br/>
And the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes.<br/>
To whom the goddess of the painted bow:<br/>
"Approach, and view the wondrous scene below!<br/>
Each hardy Greek, and valiant Trojan knight,<br/>
So dreadful late, and furious for the fight,<br/>
Now rest their spears, or lean upon their shields;<br/>
Ceased is the war, and silent all the fields.<br/>
Paris alone and Sparta's king advance,<br/>
In single fight to toss the beamy lance;<br/>
Each met in arms, the fate of combat tries,<br/>
Thy love the motive, and thy charms the prize."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, the many-coloured maid inspires<br/>
Her husband's love, and wakes her former fires;<br/>
Her country, parents, all that once were dear,<br/>
Rush to her thought, and force a tender tear,<br/>
O'er her fair face a snowy veil she threw,<br/>
And, softly sighing, from the loom withdrew.<br/>
Her handmaids, Clymene and Æthra, wait<br/>
Her silent footsteps to the Scaean gate.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There sat the seniors of the Trojan race:<br/>
(Old Priam's chiefs, and most in Priam's grace,)<br/>
The king the first; Thymoetes at his side;<br/>
Lampus and Clytius, long in council tried;<br/>
Panthus, and Hicetaon, once the strong;<br/>
And next, the wisest of the reverend throng,<br/>
Antenor grave, and sage Ucalegon,<br/>
Lean'd on the walls and bask'd before the sun:<br/>
Chiefs, who no more in bloody fights engage,<br/>
But wise through time, and narrative with age,<br/>
In summer days, like grasshoppers rejoice,<br/>
A bloodless race, that send a feeble voice.<br/>
These, when the Spartan queen approach'd the tower,<br/>
In secret own'd resistless beauty's power:<br/>
They cried, "No wonder such celestial charms<br/>
For nine long years have set the world in arms;<br/>
What winning graces! what majestic mien!<br/>
She moves a goddess, and she looks a queen!<br/>
Yet hence, O Heaven, convey that fatal face,<br/>
And from destruction save the Trojan race."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The good old Priam welcomed her, and cried,<br/>
"Approach, my child, and grace thy father's side.<br/>
See on the plain thy Grecian spouse appears,<br/>
The friends and kindred of thy former years.<br/>
No crime of thine our present sufferings draws,<br/>
Not thou, but Heaven's disposing will, the cause<br/>
The gods these armies and this force employ,<br/>
The hostile gods conspire the fate of Troy.<br/>
But lift thy eyes, and say, what Greek is he<br/>
(Far as from hence these aged orbs can see)<br/>
Around whose brow such martial graces shine,<br/>
So tall, so awful, and almost divine!<br/>
Though some of larger stature tread the green,<br/>
None match his grandeur and exalted mien:<br/>
He seems a monarch, and his country's pride."<br/>
Thus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Before thy presence, father, I appear,<br/>
With conscious shame and reverential fear.<br/>
Ah! had I died, ere to these walls I fled,<br/>
False to my country, and my nuptial bed;<br/>
My brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,<br/>
False to them all, to Paris only kind!<br/>
For this I mourn, till grief or dire disease<br/>
Shall waste the form whose fault it was to please!<br/>
The king of kings, Atrides, you survey,<br/>
Great in the war, and great in arts of sway:<br/>
My brother once, before my days of shame!<br/>
And oh! that still he bore a brother's name!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
With wonder Priam view'd the godlike man,<br/>
Extoll'd the happy prince, and thus began:<br/>
"O bless'd Atrides! born to prosperous fate,<br/>
Successful monarch of a mighty state!<br/>
How vast thy empire! Of your matchless train<br/>
What numbers lost, what numbers yet remain!<br/>
In Phrygia once were gallant armies known,<br/>
In ancient time, when Otreus fill'd the throne,<br/>
When godlike Mygdon led their troops of horse,<br/>
And I, to join them, raised the Trojan force:<br/>
Against the manlike Amazons we stood,<br/>
And Sangar's stream ran purple with their blood.<br/>
But far inferior those, in martial grace,<br/>
And strength of numbers, to this Grecian race."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, once more he view'd the warrior train;<br/>
"What's he, whose arms lie scatter'd on the plain?<br/>
Broad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,<br/>
Though great Atrides overtops his head.<br/>
Nor yet appear his care and conduct small;<br/>
From rank to rank he moves, and orders all.<br/>
The stately ram thus measures o'er the ground,<br/>
And, master of the flock, surveys them round."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Helen thus: "Whom your discerning eyes<br/>
Have singled out, is Ithacus the wise;<br/>
A barren island boasts his glorious birth;<br/>
His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Antenor took the word, and thus began:<br/>
"Myself, O king! have seen that wondrous man<br/>
When, trusting Jove and hospitable laws,<br/>
To Troy he came, to plead the Grecian cause;<br/>
(Great Menelaus urged the same request;)<br/>
My house was honour'd with each royal guest:<br/>
I knew their persons, and admired their parts,<br/>
Both brave in arms, and both approved in arts.<br/>
Erect, the Spartan most engaged our view;<br/>
Ulysses seated, greater reverence drew.<br/>
When Atreus' son harangued the listening train,<br/>
Just was his sense, and his expression plain,<br/>
His words succinct, yet full, without a fault;<br/>
He spoke no more than just the thing he ought.<br/>
But when Ulysses rose, in thought profound,<br/>
His modest eyes he fix'd upon the ground;<br/>
As one unskill'd or dumb, he seem'd to stand,<br/>
Nor raised his head, nor stretch'd his sceptred hand;<br/>
But, when he speaks, what elocution flows!<br/>
Soft as the fleeces of descending snows,<br/>
The copious accents fall, with easy art;<br/>
Melting they fall, and sink into the heart!<br/>
Wondering we hear, and fix'd in deep surprise,<br/>
Our ears refute the censure of our eyes."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The king then ask'd (as yet the camp he view'd)<br/>
"What chief is that, with giant strength endued,<br/>
Whose brawny shoulders, and whose swelling chest,<br/>
And lofty stature, far exceed the rest?<br/>
"Ajax the great, (the beauteous queen replied,)<br/>
Himself a host: the Grecian strength and pride.<br/>
See! bold Idomeneus superior towers<br/>
Amid yon circle of his Cretan powers,<br/>
Great as a god! I saw him once before,<br/>
With Menelaus on the Spartan shore.<br/>
The rest I know, and could in order name;<br/>
All valiant chiefs, and men of mighty fame.<br/>
Yet two are wanting of the numerous train,<br/>
Whom long my eyes have sought, but sought in vain:<br/>
Castor and Pollux, first in martial force,<br/>
One bold on foot, and one renown'd for horse.<br/>
My brothers these; the same our native shore,<br/>
One house contain'd us, as one mother bore.<br/>
Perhaps the chiefs, from warlike toils at ease,<br/>
For distant Troy refused to sail the seas;<br/>
Perhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws,<br/>
Ashamed to combat in their sister's cause."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So spoke the fair, nor knew her brothers' doom;<br/>
Wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb;<br/>
Adorn'd with honours in their native shore,<br/>
Silent they slept, and heard of wars no more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meantime the heralds, through the crowded town,<br/>
Bring the rich wine and destined victims down.<br/>
Idaeus' arms the golden goblets press'd,<br/>
Who thus the venerable king address'd:<br/>
"Arise, O father of the Trojan state!<br/>
The nations call, thy joyful people wait<br/>
To seal the truce, and end the dire debate.<br/>
Paris, thy son, and Sparta's king advance,<br/>
In measured lists to toss the weighty lance;<br/>
And who his rival shall in arms subdue,<br/>
His be the dame, and his the treasure too.<br/>
Thus with a lasting league our toils may cease,<br/>
And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace:<br/>
So shall the Greeks review their native shore,<br/>
Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With grief he heard, and bade the chiefs prepare<br/>
To join his milk-white coursers to the car;<br/>
He mounts the seat, Antenor at his side;<br/>
The gentle steeds through Scaea's gates they guide:<br/>
Next from the car descending on the plain,<br/>
Amid the Grecian host and Trojan train,<br/>
Slow they proceed: the sage Ulysses then<br/>
Arose, and with him rose the king of men.<br/>
On either side a sacred herald stands,<br/>
The wine they mix, and on each monarch's hands<br/>
Pour the full urn; then draws the Grecian lord<br/>
His cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword;<br/>
From the sign'd victims crops the curling hair;<br/>
The heralds part it, and the princes share;<br/>
Then loudly thus before the attentive bands<br/>
He calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O first and greatest power! whom all obey,<br/>
Who high on Ida's holy mountain sway,<br/>
Eternal Jove! and you bright orb that roll<br/>
From east to west, and view from pole to pole!<br/>
Thou mother Earth! and all ye living floods!<br/>
Infernal furies, and Tartarean gods,<br/>
Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare<br/>
For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!<br/>
Hear, and be witness. If, by Paris slain,<br/>
Great Menelaus press the fatal plain;<br/>
The dame and treasures let the Trojan keep,<br/>
And Greece returning plough the watery deep.<br/>
If by my brother's lance the Trojan bleed,<br/>
Be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed:<br/>
The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,<br/>
And every age record the signal day.<br/>
This if the Phrygians shall refuse to yield,<br/>
Arms must revenge, and Mars decide the field."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With that the chief the tender victims slew,<br/>
And in the dust their bleeding bodies threw;<br/>
The vital spirit issued at the wound,<br/>
And left the members quivering on the ground.<br/>
From the same urn they drink the mingled wine,<br/>
And add libations to the powers divine.<br/>
While thus their prayers united mount the sky,<br/>
"Hear, mighty Jove! and hear, ye gods on high!<br/>
And may their blood, who first the league confound,<br/>
Shed like this wine, disdain the thirsty ground;<br/>
May all their consorts serve promiscuous lust,<br/>
And all their lust be scatter'd as the dust!"<br/>
Thus either host their imprecations join'd,<br/>
Which Jove refused, and mingled with the wind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The rites now finish'd, reverend Priam rose,<br/>
And thus express'd a heart o'ercharged with woes:<br/>
"Ye Greeks and Trojans, let the chiefs engage,<br/>
But spare the weakness of my feeble age:<br/>
In yonder walls that object let me shun,<br/>
Nor view the danger of so dear a son.<br/>
Whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall,<br/>
Heaven only knows; for heaven disposes all."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, the hoary king no longer stay'd,<br/>
But on his car the slaughter'd victims laid:<br/>
Then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide,<br/>
And drove to Troy, Antenor at his side.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Bold Hector and Ulysses now dispose<br/>
The lists of combat, and the ground inclose:<br/>
Next to decide, by sacred lots prepare,<br/>
Who first shall launch his pointed spear in air.<br/>
The people pray with elevated hands,<br/>
And words like these are heard through all the bands:<br/>
"Immortal Jove, high Heaven's superior lord,<br/>
On lofty Ida's holy mount adored!<br/>
Whoe'er involved us in this dire debate,<br/>
O give that author of the war to fate<br/>
And shades eternal! let division cease,<br/>
And joyful nations join in leagues of peace."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With eyes averted Hector hastes to turn<br/>
The lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn.<br/>
Then, Paris, thine leap'd forth; by fatal chance<br/>
Ordain'd the first to whirl the weighty lance.<br/>
Both armies sat the combat to survey.<br/>
Beside each chief his azure armour lay,<br/>
And round the lists the generous coursers neigh.<br/>
The beauteous warrior now arrays for fight,<br/>
In gilded arms magnificently bright:<br/>
The purple cuishes clasp his thighs around,<br/>
With flowers adorn'd, with silver buckles bound:<br/>
Lycaon's corslet his fair body dress'd,<br/>
Braced in and fitted to his softer breast;<br/>
A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,<br/>
Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side:<br/>
His youthful face a polish'd helm o'erspread;<br/>
The waving horse-hair nodded on his head:<br/>
His figured shield, a shining orb, he takes,<br/>
And in his hand a pointed javelin shakes.<br/>
With equal speed and fired by equal charms,<br/>
The Spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now round the lists the admiring armies stand,<br/>
With javelins fix'd, the Greek and Trojan band.<br/>
Amidst the dreadful vale, the chiefs advance,<br/>
All pale with rage, and shake the threatening lance.<br/>
The Trojan first his shining javelin threw;<br/>
Full on Atrides' ringing shield it flew,<br/>
Nor pierced the brazen orb, but with a bound<br/>
Leap'd from the buckler, blunted, on the ground.<br/>
Atrides then his massy lance prepares,<br/>
In act to throw, but first prefers his prayers:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Give me, great Jove! to punish lawless lust,<br/>
And lay the Trojan gasping in the dust:<br/>
Destroy the aggressor, aid my righteous cause,<br/>
Avenge the breach of hospitable laws!<br/>
Let this example future times reclaim,<br/>
And guard from wrong fair friendship's holy name,"<br/>
He said, and poised in air the javelin sent,<br/>
Through Paris' shield the forceful weapon went,<br/>
His corslet pierces, and his garment rends,<br/>
And glancing downward, near his flank descends.<br/>
The wary Trojan, bending from the blow,<br/>
Eludes the death, and disappoints his foe:<br/>
But fierce Atrides waved his sword, and strook<br/>
Full on his casque: the crested helmet shook;<br/>
The brittle steel, unfaithful to his hand,<br/>
Broke short: the fragments glitter'd on the sand.<br/>
The raging warrior to the spacious skies<br/>
Raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes:<br/>
"Then is it vain in Jove himself to trust?<br/>
And is it thus the gods assist the just?<br/>
When crimes provoke us, Heaven success denies;<br/>
The dart falls harmless, and the falchion flies."<br/>
Furious he said, and towards the Grecian crew<br/>
(Seized by the crest) the unhappy warrior drew;<br/>
Struggling he followed, while the embroider'd thong<br/>
That tied his helmet, dragg'd the chief along.<br/>
Then had his ruin crown'd Atrides' joy,<br/>
But Venus trembled for the prince of Troy:<br/>
Unseen she came, and burst the golden band;<br/>
And left an empty helmet in his hand.<br/>
The casque, enraged, amidst the Greeks he threw;<br/>
The Greeks with smiles the polish'd trophy view.<br/>
Then, as once more he lifts the deadly dart,<br/>
In thirst of vengeance, at his rival's heart;<br/>
The queen of love her favour'd champion shrouds<br/>
(For gods can all things) in a veil of clouds.<br/>
Raised from the field the panting youth she led,<br/>
And gently laid him on the bridal bed,<br/>
With pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews,<br/>
And all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews.<br/>
Meantime the brightest of the female kind,<br/>
The matchless Helen, o'er the walls reclined;<br/>
To her, beset with Trojan beauties, came,<br/>
In borrow'd form, the laughter-loving dame.<br/>
(She seem'd an ancient maid, well-skill'd to cull<br/>
The snowy fleece, and wind the twisted wool.)<br/>
The goddess softly shook her silken vest,<br/>
That shed perfumes, and whispering thus address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Haste, happy nymph! for thee thy Paris calls,<br/>
Safe from the fight, in yonder lofty walls,<br/>
Fair as a god; with odours round him spread,<br/>
He lies, and waits thee on the well-known bed;<br/>
Not like a warrior parted from the foe,<br/>
But some gay dancer in the public show."<br/>
</p>
<p>
She spoke, and Helen's secret soul was moved;<br/>
She scorn'd the champion, but the man she loved.<br/>
Fair Venus' neck, her eyes that sparkled fire,<br/>
And breast, reveal'd the queen of soft desire.<br/>
Struck with her presence, straight the lively red<br/>
Forsook her cheek; and trembling, thus she said:<br/>
"Then is it still thy pleasure to deceive?<br/>
And woman's frailty always to believe!<br/>
Say, to new nations must I cross the main,<br/>
Or carry wars to some soft Asian plain?<br/>
For whom must Helen break her second vow?<br/>
What other Paris is thy darling now?<br/>
Left to Atrides, (victor in the strife,)<br/>
An odious conquest and a captive wife,<br/>
Hence let me sail; and if thy Paris bear<br/>
My absence ill, let Venus ease his care.<br/>
A handmaid goddess at his side to wait,<br/>
Renounce the glories of thy heavenly state,<br/>
Be fix'd for ever to the Trojan shore,<br/>
His spouse, or slave; and mount the skies no more.<br/>
For me, to lawless love no longer led,<br/>
I scorn the coward, and detest his bed;<br/>
Else should I merit everlasting shame,<br/>
And keen reproach, from every Phrygian dame:<br/>
Ill suits it now the joys of love to know,<br/>
Too deep my anguish, and too wild my woe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus incensed, the Paphian queen replies:<br/>
"Obey the power from whom thy glories rise:<br/>
Should Venus leave thee, every charm must fly,<br/>
Fade from thy cheek, and languish in thy eye.<br/>
Cease to provoke me, lest I make thee more<br/>
The world's aversion, than their love before;<br/>
Now the bright prize for which mankind engage,<br/>
Than, the sad victim, of the public rage."<br/>
</p>
<p>
At this, the fairest of her sex obey'd,<br/>
And veil'd her blushes in a silken shade;<br/>
Unseen, and silent, from the train she moves,<br/>
Led by the goddess of the Smiles and Loves.<br/>
Arrived, and enter'd at the palace gate,<br/>
The maids officious round their mistress wait;<br/>
Then, all dispersing, various tasks attend;<br/>
The queen and goddess to the prince ascend.<br/>
Full in her Paris' sight, the queen of love<br/>
Had placed the beauteous progeny of Jove;<br/>
Where, as he view'd her charms, she turn'd away<br/>
Her glowing eyes, and thus began to say:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Is this the chief, who, lost to sense of shame,<br/>
Late fled the field, and yet survives his fame?<br/>
O hadst thou died beneath the righteous sword<br/>
Of that brave man whom once I call'd my lord!<br/>
The boaster Paris oft desired the day<br/>
With Sparta's king to meet in single fray:<br/>
Go now, once more thy rival's rage excite,<br/>
Provoke Atrides, and renew the fight:<br/>
Yet Helen bids thee stay, lest thou unskill'd<br/>
Shouldst fall an easy conquest on the field."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The prince replies: "Ah cease, divinely fair,<br/>
Nor add reproaches to the wounds I bear;<br/>
This day the foe prevail'd by Pallas' power:<br/>
We yet may vanquish in a happier hour:<br/>
There want not gods to favour us above;<br/>
But let the business of our life be love:<br/>
These softer moments let delights employ,<br/>
And kind embraces snatch the hasty joy.<br/>
Not thus I loved thee, when from Sparta's shore<br/>
My forced, my willing heavenly prize I bore,<br/>
When first entranced in Cranae's isle I lay,<br/>
Mix'd with thy soul, and all dissolved away!"<br/>
Thus having spoke, the enamour'd Phrygian boy<br/>
Rush'd to the bed, impatient for the joy.<br/>
Him Helen follow'd slow with bashful charms,<br/>
And clasp'd the blooming hero in her arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While these to love's delicious rapture yield,<br/>
The stern Atrides rages round the field:<br/>
So some fell lion whom the woods obey,<br/>
Roars through the desert, and demands his prey.<br/>
Paris he seeks, impatient to destroy,<br/>
But seeks in vain along the troops of Troy;<br/>
Even those had yielded to a foe so brave<br/>
The recreant warrior, hateful as the grave.<br/>
Then speaking thus, the king of kings arose,<br/>
"Ye Trojans, Dardans, all our generous foes!<br/>
Hear and attest! from Heaven with conquest crown'd,<br/>
Our brother's arms the just success have found:<br/>
Be therefore now the Spartan wealth restor'd,<br/>
Let Argive Helen own her lawful lord;<br/>
The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,<br/>
And age to age record this signal day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He ceased; his army's loud applauses rise,<br/>
And the long shout runs echoing through the skies.<br/>

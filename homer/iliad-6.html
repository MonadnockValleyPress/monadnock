<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book VI</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Now heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield<br/>
To human force and human skill the field:<br/>
Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes;<br/>
Now here, now there, the tide of combat flows;<br/>
While Troy's famed streams, that bound the deathful plain<br/>
On either side, run purple to the main.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Great Ajax first to conquest led the way,<br/>
Broke the thick ranks, and turn'd the doubtful day.<br/>
The Thracian Acamas his falchion found,<br/>
And hew'd the enormous giant to the ground;<br/>
His thundering arm a deadly stroke impress'd<br/>
Where the black horse-hair nodded o'er his crest;<br/>
Fix'd in his front the brazen weapon lies,<br/>
And seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.<br/>
Next Teuthras' son distain'd the sands with blood,<br/>
Axylus, hospitable, rich, and good:<br/>
In fair Arisbe's walls (his native place)<br/>
He held his seat! a friend to human race.<br/>
Fast by the road, his ever-open door<br/>
Obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.<br/>
To stern Tydides now he falls a prey,<br/>
No friend to guard him in the dreadful day!<br/>
Breathless the good man fell, and by his side<br/>
His faithful servant, old Calesius died.<br/>
</p>
<p>
By great Euryalus was Dresus slain,<br/>
And next he laid Opheltius on the plain.<br/>
Two twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young,<br/>
From a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung:<br/>
(Laomedon's white flocks Bucolion fed,<br/>
That monarch's first-born by a foreign bed;<br/>
In secret woods he won the naiad's grace,<br/>
And two fair infants crown'd his strong embrace:)<br/>
Here dead they lay in all their youthful charms;<br/>
The ruthless victor stripp'd their shining arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Astyalus by Polypoetes fell;<br/>
Ulysses' spear Pidytes sent to hell;<br/>
By Teucer's shaft brave Aretaon bled,<br/>
And Nestor's son laid stern Ablerus dead;<br/>
Great Agamemnon, leader of the brave,<br/>
The mortal wound of rich Elatus gave,<br/>
Who held in Pedasus his proud abode,<br/>
And till'd the banks where silver Satnio flow'd.<br/>
Melanthius by Eurypylus was slain;<br/>
And Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Unbless'd Adrastus next at mercy lies<br/>
Beneath the Spartan spear, a living prize.<br/>
Scared with the din and tumult of the fight,<br/>
His headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,<br/>
Rush'd on a tamarisk's strong trunk, and broke<br/>
The shatter'd chariot from the crooked yoke;<br/>
Wide o'er the field, resistless as the wind,<br/>
For Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.<br/>
Prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel:<br/>
Atrides o'er him shakes his vengeful steel;<br/>
The fallen chief in suppliant posture press'd<br/>
The victor's knees, and thus his prayer address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O spare my youth, and for the life I owe<br/>
Large gifts of price my father shall bestow.<br/>
When fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain,<br/>
Thy hollow ships his captive son detain:<br/>
Rich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,<br/>
And steel well-temper'd, and persuasive gold."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: compassion touch'd the hero's heart<br/>
He stood, suspended with the lifted dart:<br/>
As pity pleaded for his vanquish'd prize,<br/>
Stern Agamemnon swift to vengeance flies,<br/>
And, furious, thus: "Oh impotent of mind!<br/>
Shall these, shall these Atrides' mercy find?<br/>
Well hast thou known proud Troy's perfidious land,<br/>
And well her natives merit at thy hand!<br/>
Not one of all the race, nor sex, nor age,<br/>
Shall save a Trojan from our boundless rage:<br/>
Ilion shall perish whole, and bury all;<br/>
Her babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall;<br/>
A dreadful lesson of exampled fate,<br/>
To warn the nations, and to curb the great!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The monarch spoke; the words, with warmth address'd,<br/>
To rigid justice steel'd his brother's breast.<br/>
Fierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust;<br/>
The monarch's javelin stretch'd him in the dust,<br/>
Then pressing with his foot his panting heart,<br/>
Forth from the slain he tugg'd the reeking dart.<br/>
Old Nestor saw, and roused the warrior's rage;<br/>
"Thus, heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage;<br/>
No son of Mars descend, for servile gains,<br/>
To touch the booty, while a foe remains.<br/>
Behold yon glittering host, your future spoil!<br/>
First gain the conquest, then reward the toil."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now had Greece eternal fame acquired,<br/>
And frighted Troy within her walls, retired,<br/>
Had not sage Helenus her state redress'd,<br/>
Taught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.<br/>
Where Hector stood, with great Æneas join'd,<br/>
The seer reveal'd the counsels of his mind:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ye generous chiefs! on whom the immortals lay<br/>
The cares and glories of this doubtful day;<br/>
On whom your aids, your country's hopes depend;<br/>
Wise to consult, and active to defend!<br/>
Here, at our gates, your brave efforts unite,<br/>
Turn back the routed, and forbid the flight,<br/>
Ere yet their wives' soft arms the cowards gain,<br/>
The sport and insult of the hostile train.<br/>
When your commands have hearten'd every band,<br/>
Ourselves, here fix'd, will make the dangerous stand;<br/>
Press'd as we are, and sore of former fight,<br/>
These straits demand our last remains of might.<br/>
Meanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire,<br/>
And teach our mother what the gods require:<br/>
Direct the queen to lead the assembled train<br/>
Of Troy's chief matrons to Minerva's fane;<br/>
Unbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,<br/>
With offer'd vows, in Ilion's topmost tower.<br/>
The largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,<br/>
Most prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,<br/>
Before the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,<br/>
And twelve young heifers to her altars led:<br/>
If so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,<br/>
Our wives, our infants, and our city spare,<br/>
And far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,<br/>
That mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire;<br/>
Not thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread,<br/>
Sprung though he was from more than mortal bed;<br/>
Not thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,<br/>
In rage unbounded, and unmatch'd in might."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hector obedient heard: and, with a bound,<br/>
Leap'd from his trembling chariot to the ground;<br/>
Through all his host inspiring force he flies,<br/>
And bids the thunder of the battle rise.<br/>
With rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,<br/>
And turn the tide of conflict on the foe:<br/>
Fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;<br/>
All Greece recedes, and 'midst her triumphs fears;<br/>
Some god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,<br/>
Shot down avenging from the vault of stars.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus aloud: "Ye dauntless Dardans, hear!<br/>
And you whom distant nations send to war!<br/>
Be mindful of the strength your fathers bore;<br/>
Be still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.<br/>
One hour demands me in the Trojan wall,<br/>
To bid our altars flame, and victims fall:<br/>
Nor shall, I trust, the matrons' holy train,<br/>
And reverend elders, seek the gods in vain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, with ample strides the hero pass'd;<br/>
The shield's large orb behind his shoulder cast,<br/>
His neck o'ershading, to his ankle hung;<br/>
And as he march'd the brazen buckler rung.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),<br/>
Where daring Glaucus and great Tydeus' son<br/>
Between both armies met: the chiefs from far<br/>
Observed each other, and had mark'd for war.<br/>
Near as they drew, Tydides thus began:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?<br/>
Our eyes till now that aspect ne'er beheld,<br/>
Where fame is reap'd amid the embattled field;<br/>
Yet far before the troops thou dar'st appear,<br/>
And meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.<br/>
Unhappy they, and born of luckless sires,<br/>
Who tempt our fury when Minerva fires!<br/>
But if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,<br/>
Know with immortals we no more contend.<br/>
Not long Lycurgus view'd the golden light,<br/>
That daring man who mix'd with gods in fight.<br/>
Bacchus, and Bacchus' votaries, he drove,<br/>
With brandish'd steel, from Nyssa's sacred grove:<br/>
Their consecrated spears lay scatter'd round,<br/>
With curling vines and twisted ivy bound;<br/>
While Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,<br/>
And Thetis' arms received the trembling god.<br/>
Nor fail'd the crime the immortals' wrath to move;<br/>
(The immortals bless'd with endless ease above;)<br/>
Deprived of sight by their avenging doom,<br/>
Cheerless he breathed, and wander'd in the gloom,<br/>
Then sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,<br/>
A wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!<br/>
I brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth<br/>
Sustain thy life, and human be thy birth,<br/>
Bold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,<br/>
Approach, and enter the dark gates of death."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What, or from whence I am, or who my sire,<br/>
(Replied the chief,) can Tydeus' son inquire?<br/>
Like leaves on trees the race of man is found,<br/>
Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;<br/>
Another race the following spring supplies;<br/>
They fall successive, and successive rise:<br/>
So generations in their course decay;<br/>
So flourish these, when those are pass'd away.<br/>
But if thou still persist to search my birth,<br/>
Then hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"A city stands on Argos' utmost bound,<br/>
(Argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown'd,)<br/>
Aeolian Sisyphus, with wisdom bless'd,<br/>
In ancient time the happy wall possess'd,<br/>
Then call'd Ephyre: Glaucus was his son;<br/>
Great Glaucus, father of Bellerophon,<br/>
Who o'er the sons of men in beauty shined,<br/>
Loved for that valour which preserves mankind.<br/>
Then mighty Praetus Argos' sceptre sway'd,<br/>
Whose hard commands Bellerophon obey'd.<br/>
With direful jealousy the monarch raged,<br/>
And the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.<br/>
For him Antaea burn'd with lawless flame,<br/>
And strove to tempt him from the paths of fame:<br/>
In vain she tempted the relentless youth,<br/>
Endued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.<br/>
Fired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled,<br/>
And begg'd revenge for her insulted bed:<br/>
Incensed he heard, resolving on his fate;<br/>
But hospitable laws restrain'd his hate:<br/>
To Lycia the devoted youth he sent,<br/>
With tablets seal'd, that told his dire intent.<br/>
Now bless'd by every power who guards the good,<br/>
The chief arrived at Xanthus' silver flood:<br/>
There Lycia's monarch paid him honours due,<br/>
Nine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew.<br/>
But when the tenth bright morning orient glow'd,<br/>
The faithful youth his monarch's mandate show'd:<br/>
The fatal tablets, till that instant seal'd,<br/>
The deathful secret to the king reveal'd.<br/>
First, dire Chimaera's conquest was enjoin'd;<br/>
A mingled monster of no mortal kind!<br/>
Behind, a dragon's fiery tail was spread;<br/>
A goat's rough body bore a lion's head;<br/>
Her pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire;<br/>
Her gaping throat emits infernal fire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"This pest he slaughter'd, (for he read the skies,<br/>
And trusted heaven's informing prodigies,)<br/>
Then met in arms the Solymaean crew,<br/>
(Fiercest of men,) and those the warrior slew;<br/>
Next the bold Amazons' whole force defied;<br/>
And conquer'd still, for heaven was on his side.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Nor ended here his toils: his Lycian foes,<br/>
At his return, a treacherous ambush rose,<br/>
With levell'd spears along the winding shore:<br/>
There fell they breathless, and return'd no more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"At length the monarch, with repentant grief,<br/>
Confess'd the gods, and god-descended chief;<br/>
His daughter gave, the stranger to detain,<br/>
With half the honours of his ample reign:<br/>
The Lycians grant a chosen space of ground,<br/>
With woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown'd.<br/>
There long the chief his happy lot possess'd,<br/>
With two brave sons and one fair daughter bless'd;<br/>
(Fair e'en in heavenly eyes: her fruitful love<br/>
Crown'd with Sarpedon's birth the embrace of Jove;)<br/>
But when at last, distracted in his mind,<br/>
Forsook by heaven, forsaking humankind,<br/>
Wide o'er the Aleian field he chose to stray,<br/>
A long, forlorn, uncomfortable way!<br/>
Woes heap'd on woes consumed his wasted heart:<br/>
His beauteous daughter fell by Phoebe's dart;<br/>
His eldest born by raging Mars was slain,<br/>
In combat on the Solymaean plain.<br/>
Hippolochus survived: from him I came,<br/>
The honour'd author of my birth and name;<br/>
By his decree I sought the Trojan town;<br/>
By his instructions learn to win renown,<br/>
To stand the first in worth as in command,<br/>
To add new honours to my native land,<br/>
Before my eyes my mighty sires to place,<br/>
And emulate the glories of our race."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and transport fill'd Tydides' heart;<br/>
In earth the generous warrior fix'd his dart,<br/>
Then friendly, thus the Lycian prince address'd:<br/>
"Welcome, my brave hereditary guest!<br/>
Thus ever let us meet, with kind embrace,<br/>
Nor stain the sacred friendship of our race.<br/>
Know, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old;<br/>
OEneus the strong, Bellerophon the bold:<br/>
Our ancient seat his honour'd presence graced,<br/>
Where twenty days in genial rites he pass'd.<br/>
The parting heroes mutual presents left;<br/>
A golden goblet was thy grandsire's gift;<br/>
OEneus a belt of matchless work bestowed,<br/>
That rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glow'd.<br/>
(This from his pledge I learn'd, which, safely stored<br/>
Among my treasures, still adorns my board:<br/>
For Tydeus left me young, when Thebe's wall<br/>
Beheld the sons of Greece untimely fall.)<br/>
Mindful of this, in friendship let us join;<br/>
If heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,<br/>
My guest in Argos thou, and I in Lycia thine.<br/>
Enough of Trojans to this lance shall yield,<br/>
In the full harvest of yon ample field;<br/>
Enough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore;<br/>
But thou and Diomed be foes no more.<br/>
Now change we arms, and prove to either host<br/>
We guard the friendship of the line we boast."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, the gallant chiefs alight,<br/>
Their hands they join, their mutual faith they plight;<br/>
Brave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign'd,<br/>
(Jove warm'd his bosom, and enlarged his mind,)<br/>
For Diomed's brass arms, of mean device,<br/>
For which nine oxen paid, (a vulgar price,)<br/>
He gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,<br/>
A hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meantime the guardian of the Trojan state,<br/>
Great Hector, enter'd at the Scaean gate.<br/>
Beneath the beech-tree's consecrated shades,<br/>
The Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids<br/>
Around him flock'd, all press'd with pious care<br/>
For husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war.<br/>
He bids the train in long procession go,<br/>
And seek the gods, to avert the impending woe.<br/>
And now to Priam's stately courts he came,<br/>
Rais'd on arch'd columns of stupendous frame;<br/>
O'er these a range of marble structure runs,<br/>
The rich pavilions of his fifty sons,<br/>
In fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,<br/>
Opposed to those, where Priam's daughters sate.<br/>
Twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,<br/>
Of equal beauty, and of polish'd stone.<br/>
Hither great Hector pass'd, nor pass'd unseen<br/>
Of royal Hecuba, his mother-queen.<br/>
(With her Laodice, whose beauteous face<br/>
Surpass'd the nymphs of Troy's illustrious race.)<br/>
Long in a strict embrace she held her son,<br/>
And press'd his hand, and tender thus begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O Hector! say, what great occasion calls<br/>
My son from fight, when Greece surrounds our walls;<br/>
Com'st thou to supplicate the almighty power<br/>
With lifted hands, from Ilion's lofty tower?<br/>
Stay, till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown'd,<br/>
In Jove's high name, to sprinkle on the ground,<br/>
And pay due vows to all the gods around.<br/>
Then with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul,<br/>
And draw new spirits from the generous bowl;<br/>
Spent as thou art with long laborious fight,<br/>
The brave defender of thy country's right."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Far hence be Bacchus' gifts; (the chief rejoin'd;)<br/>
Inflaming wine, pernicious to mankind,<br/>
Unnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind.<br/>
Let chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice<br/>
To sprinkle to the gods, its better use.<br/>
By me that holy office were profaned;<br/>
Ill fits it me, with human gore distain'd,<br/>
To the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,<br/>
Or offer heaven's great Sire polluted praise.<br/>
You, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,<br/>
And burn rich odours in Minerva's fane.<br/>
The largest mantle your full wardrobes hold,<br/>
Most prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,<br/>
Before the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,<br/>
And twelve young heifers to her altar led.<br/>
So may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,<br/>
Our wives, our infants, and our city spare;<br/>
And far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,<br/>
Who mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire.<br/>
Be this, O mother, your religious care:<br/>
I go to rouse soft Paris to the war;<br/>
If yet not lost to all the sense of shame,<br/>
The recreant warrior hear the voice of fame.<br/>
Oh, would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace,<br/>
That pest of Troy, that ruin of our race!<br/>
Deep to the dark abyss might he descend,<br/>
Troy yet should flourish, and my sorrows end."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This heard, she gave command: and summon'd came<br/>
Each noble matron and illustrious dame.<br/>
The Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went,<br/>
Where treasured odours breathed a costly scent.<br/>
There lay the vestures of no vulgar art,<br/>
Sidonian maids embroider'd every part,<br/>
Whom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore,<br/>
With Helen touching on the Tyrian shore.<br/>
Here, as the queen revolved with careful eyes<br/>
The various textures and the various dyes,<br/>
She chose a veil that shone superior far,<br/>
And glow'd refulgent as the morning star.<br/>
Herself with this the long procession leads;<br/>
The train majestically slow proceeds.<br/>
Soon as to Ilion's topmost tower they come,<br/>
And awful reach the high Palladian dome,<br/>
Antenor's consort, fair Theano, waits<br/>
As Pallas' priestess, and unbars the gates.<br/>
With hands uplifted and imploring eyes,<br/>
They fill the dome with supplicating cries.<br/>
The priestess then the shining veil displays,<br/>
Placed on Minerva's knees, and thus she prays:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid,<br/>
Troy's strong defence, unconquer'd Pallas, aid!<br/>
Break thou Tydides' spear, and let him fall<br/>
Prone on the dust before the Trojan wall!<br/>
So twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke,<br/>
Shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.<br/>
But thou, atoned by penitence and prayer,<br/>
Ourselves, our infants, and our city spare!"<br/>
So pray'd the priestess in her holy fane;<br/>
So vow'd the matrons, but they vow'd in vain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While these appear before the power with prayers,<br/>
Hector to Paris' lofty dome repairs.<br/>
Himself the mansion raised, from every part<br/>
Assembling architects of matchless art.<br/>
Near Priam's court and Hector's palace stands<br/>
The pompous structure, and the town commands.<br/>
A spear the hero bore of wondrous strength,<br/>
Of full ten cubits was the lance's length,<br/>
The steely point with golden ringlets join'd,<br/>
Before him brandish'd, at each motion shined<br/>
Thus entering, in the glittering rooms he found<br/>
His brother-chief, whose useless arms lay round,<br/>
His eyes delighting with their splendid show,<br/>
Brightening the shield, and polishing the bow.<br/>
Beside him Helen with her virgins stands,<br/>
Guides their rich labours, and instructs their hands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Him thus inactive, with an ardent look<br/>
The prince beheld, and high-resenting spoke.<br/>
"Thy hate to Troy, is this the time to show?<br/>
(O wretch ill-fated, and thy country's foe!)<br/>
Paris and Greece against us both conspire,<br/>
Thy close resentment, and their vengeful ire.<br/>
For thee great Ilion's guardian heroes fall,<br/>
Till heaps of dead alone defend her wall,<br/>
For thee the soldier bleeds, the matron mourns,<br/>
And wasteful war in all its fury burns.<br/>
Ungrateful man! deserves not this thy care,<br/>
Our troops to hearten, and our toils to share?<br/>
Rise, or behold the conquering flames ascend,<br/>
And all the Phrygian glories at an end."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Brother, 'tis just, (replied the beauteous youth,)<br/>
Thy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth:<br/>
Yet charge my absence less, O generous chief!<br/>
On hate to Troy, than conscious shame and grief:<br/>
Here, hid from human eyes, thy brother sate,<br/>
And mourn'd, in secret, his and Ilion's fate.<br/>
'Tis now enough; now glory spreads her charms,<br/>
And beauteous Helen calls her chief to arms.<br/>
Conquest to-day my happier sword may bless,<br/>
'Tis man's to fight, but heaven's to give success.<br/>
But while I arm, contain thy ardent mind;<br/>
Or go, and Paris shall not lag behind."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, nor answer'd Priam's warlike son;<br/>
When Helen thus with lowly grace begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Oh, generous brother! (if the guilty dame<br/>
That caused these woes deserve a sister's name!)<br/>
Would heaven, ere all these dreadful deeds were done,<br/>
The day that show'd me to the golden sun<br/>
Had seen my death! why did not whirlwinds bear<br/>
The fatal infant to the fowls of air?<br/>
Why sunk I not beneath the whelming tide,<br/>
And midst the roarings of the waters died?<br/>
Heaven fill'd up all my ills, and I accursed<br/>
Bore all, and Paris of those ills the worst.<br/>
Helen at least a braver spouse might claim,<br/>
Warm'd with some virtue, some regard of fame!<br/>
Now tired with toils, thy fainting limbs recline,<br/>
With toils, sustain'd for Paris' sake and mine<br/>
The gods have link'd our miserable doom,<br/>
Our present woe, and infamy to come:<br/>
Wide shall it spread, and last through ages long,<br/>
Example sad! and theme of future song."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The chief replied: "This time forbids to rest;<br/>
The Trojan bands, by hostile fury press'd,<br/>
Demand their Hector, and his arm require;<br/>
The combat urges, and my soul's on fire.<br/>
Urge thou thy knight to march where glory calls,<br/>
And timely join me, ere I leave the walls.<br/>
Ere yet I mingle in the direful fray,<br/>
My wife, my infant, claim a moment's stay;<br/>
This day (perhaps the last that sees me here)<br/>
Demands a parting word, a tender tear:<br/>
This day, some god who hates our Trojan land<br/>
May vanquish Hector by a Grecian hand."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and pass'd with sad presaging heart<br/>
To seek his spouse, his soul's far dearer part;<br/>
At home he sought her, but he sought in vain;<br/>
She, with one maid of all her menial train,<br/>
Had hence retired; and with her second joy,<br/>
The young Astyanax, the hope of Troy,<br/>
Pensive she stood on Ilion's towery height,<br/>
Beheld the war, and sicken'd at the sight;<br/>
There her sad eyes in vain her lord explore,<br/>
Or weep the wounds her bleeding country bore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But he who found not whom his soul desired,<br/>
Whose virtue charm'd him as her beauty fired,<br/>
Stood in the gates, and ask'd "what way she bent<br/>
Her parting step? If to the fane she went,<br/>
Where late the mourning matrons made resort;<br/>
Or sought her sisters in the Trojan court?"<br/>
"Not to the court, (replied the attendant train,)<br/>
Nor mix'd with matrons to Minerva's fane:<br/>
To Ilion's steepy tower she bent her way,<br/>
To mark the fortunes of the doubtful day.<br/>
Troy fled, she heard, before the Grecian sword;<br/>
She heard, and trembled for her absent lord:<br/>
Distracted with surprise, she seem'd to fly,<br/>
Fear on her cheek, and sorrow in her eye.<br/>
The nurse attended with her infant boy,<br/>
The young Astyanax, the hope of Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hector this heard, return'd without delay;<br/>
Swift through the town he trod his former way,<br/>
Through streets of palaces, and walks of state;<br/>
And met the mourner at the Scaean gate.<br/>
With haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair.<br/>
His blameless wife, Aetion's wealthy heir<br/>
(Cilician Thebe great Aetion sway'd,<br/>
And Hippoplacus' wide extended shade):<br/>
The nurse stood near, in whose embraces press'd,<br/>
His only hope hung smiling at her breast,<br/>
Whom each soft charm and early grace adorn,<br/>
Fair as the new-born star that gilds the morn.<br/>
To this loved infant Hector gave the name<br/>
Scamandrius, from Scamander's honour'd stream;<br/>
Astyanax the Trojans call'd the boy,<br/>
From his great father, the defence of Troy.<br/>
Silent the warrior smiled, and pleased resign'd<br/>
To tender passions all his mighty mind;<br/>
His beauteous princess cast a mournful look,<br/>
Hung on his hand, and then dejected spoke;<br/>
Her bosom laboured with a boding sigh,<br/>
And the big tear stood trembling in her eye.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Too daring prince! ah, whither dost thou run?<br/>
Ah, too forgetful of thy wife and son!<br/>
And think'st thou not how wretched we shall be,<br/>
A widow I, a helpless orphan he?<br/>
For sure such courage length of life denies,<br/>
And thou must fall, thy virtue's sacrifice.<br/>
Greece in her single heroes strove in vain;<br/>
Now hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain.<br/>
O grant me, gods, ere Hector meets his doom,<br/>
All I can ask of heaven, an early tomb!<br/>
So shall my days in one sad tenor run,<br/>
And end with sorrows as they first begun.<br/>
No parent now remains my griefs to share,<br/>
No father's aid, no mother's tender care.<br/>
The fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire,<br/>
Laid Thebe waste, and slew my warlike sire!<br/>
His fate compassion in the victor bred;<br/>
Stern as he was, he yet revered the dead,<br/>
His radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil,<br/>
And laid him decent on the funeral pile;<br/>
Then raised a mountain where his bones were burn'd,<br/>
The mountain-nymphs the rural tomb adorn'd,<br/>
Jove's sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow<br/>
A barren shade, and in his honour grow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell;<br/>
In one sad day beheld the gates of hell;<br/>
While the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed,<br/>
Amid their fields the hapless heroes bled!<br/>
My mother lived to wear the victor's bands,<br/>
The queen of Hippoplacia's sylvan lands:<br/>
Redeem'd too late, she scarce beheld again<br/>
Her pleasing empire and her native plain,<br/>
When ah! oppress'd by life-consuming woe,<br/>
She fell a victim to Diana's bow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Yet while my Hector still survives, I see<br/>
My father, mother, brethren, all, in thee:<br/>
Alas! my parents, brothers, kindred, all<br/>
Once more will perish, if my Hector fall,<br/>
Thy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share:<br/>
Oh, prove a husband's and a father's care!<br/>
That quarter most the skilful Greeks annoy,<br/>
Where yon wild fig-trees join the wall of Troy;<br/>
Thou, from this tower defend the important post;<br/>
There Agamemnon points his dreadful host,<br/>
That pass Tydides, Ajax, strive to gain,<br/>
And there the vengeful Spartan fires his train.<br/>
Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given,<br/>
Or led by hopes, or dictated from heaven.<br/>
Let others in the field their arms employ,<br/>
But stay my Hector here, and guard his Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The chief replied: "That post shall be my care,<br/>
Not that alone, but all the works of war.<br/>
How would the sons of Troy, in arms renown'd,<br/>
And Troy's proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground<br/>
Attaint the lustre of my former name,<br/>
Should Hector basely quit the field of fame?<br/>
My early youth was bred to martial pains,<br/>
My soul impels me to the embattled plains!<br/>
Let me be foremost to defend the throne,<br/>
And guard my father's glories, and my own.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Yet come it will, the day decreed by fates!<br/>
(How my heart trembles while my tongue relates!)<br/>
The day when thou, imperial Troy! must bend,<br/>
And see thy warriors fall, thy glories end.<br/>
And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind,<br/>
My mother's death, the ruin of my kind,<br/>
Not Priam's hoary hairs defiled with gore,<br/>
Not all my brothers gasping on the shore;<br/>
As thine, Andromache! Thy griefs I dread:<br/>
I see thee trembling, weeping, captive led!<br/>
In Argive looms our battles to design,<br/>
And woes, of which so large a part was thine!<br/>
To bear the victor's hard commands, or bring<br/>
The weight of waters from Hyperia's spring.<br/>
There while you groan beneath the load of life,<br/>
They cry, ‘Behold the mighty Hector's wife!'<br/>
Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see,<br/>
Imbitters all thy woes, by naming me.<br/>
The thoughts of glory past, and present shame,<br/>
A thousand griefs shall waken at the name!<br/>
May I lie cold before that dreadful day,<br/>
Press'd with a load of monumental clay!<br/>
Thy Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep,<br/>
Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy<br/>
Stretch'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.<br/>
The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,<br/>
Scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.<br/>
With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,<br/>
And Hector hasted to relieve his child,<br/>
The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,<br/>
And placed the beaming helmet on the ground;<br/>
Then kiss'd the child, and, lifting high in air,<br/>
Thus to the gods preferr'd a father's prayer:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne,<br/>
And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!<br/>
Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,<br/>
To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,<br/>
Against his country's foes the war to wage,<br/>
And rise the Hector of the future age!<br/>
So when triumphant from successful toils<br/>
Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,<br/>
Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,<br/>
And say, ‘This chief transcends his father's fame:'<br/>
While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy,<br/>
His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,<br/>
Restored the pleasing burden to her arms;<br/>
Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,<br/>
Hush'd to repose, and with a smile survey'd.<br/>
The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,<br/>
She mingled with a smile a tender tear.<br/>
The soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd,<br/>
And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Andromache! my soul's far better part,<br/>
Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?<br/>
No hostile hand can antedate my doom,<br/>
Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.<br/>
Fix'd is the term to all the race of earth;<br/>
And such the hard condition of our birth:<br/>
No force can then resist, no flight can save,<br/>
All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.<br/>
No more—but hasten to thy tasks at home,<br/>
There guide the spindle, and direct the loom:<br/>
Me glory summons to the martial scene,<br/>
The field of combat is the sphere for men.<br/>
Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,<br/>
The first in danger as the first in fame."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes<br/>
His towery helmet, black with shading plumes.<br/>
His princess parts with a prophetic sigh,<br/>
Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye<br/>
That stream'd at every look; then, moving slow,<br/>
Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe.<br/>
There, while her tears deplored the godlike man,<br/>
Through all her train the soft infection ran;<br/>
The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,<br/>
And mourn the living Hector, as the dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But now, no longer deaf to honour's call,<br/>
Forth issues Paris from the palace wall.<br/>
In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray,<br/>
Swift through the town the warrior bends his way.<br/>
The wanton courser thus with reins unbound<br/>
Breaks from his stall, and beats the trembling ground;<br/>
Pamper'd and proud, he seeks the wonted tides,<br/>
And laves, in height of blood his shining sides;<br/>
His head now freed, he tosses to the skies;<br/>
His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies;<br/>
He snuffs the females in the distant plain,<br/>
And springs, exulting, to his fields again.<br/>
With equal triumph, sprightly, bold, and gay,<br/>
In arms refulgent as the god of day,<br/>
The son of Priam, glorying in his might,<br/>
Rush'd forth with Hector to the fields of fight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now, the warriors passing on the way,<br/>
The graceful Paris first excused his stay.<br/>
To whom the noble Hector thus replied:<br/>
"O chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied!<br/>
Thy power in war with justice none contest;<br/>
Known is thy courage, and thy strength confess'd.<br/>
What pity sloth should seize a soul so brave,<br/>
Or godlike Paris live a woman's slave!<br/>
My heart weeps blood at what the Trojans say,<br/>
And hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away.<br/>
Haste then, in all their glorious labours share,<br/>
For much they suffer, for thy sake, in war.<br/>
These ills shall cease, whene'er by Jove's decree<br/>
We crown the bowl to heaven and liberty:<br/>
While the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns,<br/>
And Greece indignant through her seas returns."<br/>

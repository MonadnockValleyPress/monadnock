<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book IV</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
And now proud Sparta with their wheels resounds,<br/>
Sparta whose walls a range of hills surrounds;<br/>
At the fair dome the rapid labour ends;<br/>
Where sate Atrides 'midst his bridal friends,<br/>
With double vows invoking Hymen's power,<br/>
To bless his son's and daughter's nuptial hour.
</p>
<p>
That day, to great Achilles' son resign'd,<br/>
Hermione, the fairest of her kind,<br/>
Was sent to crown the long-protracted joy,<br/>
Espoused before the final doom of Troy;<br/>
With steeds and gilded cars, a gorgeous train<br/>
Attend the nymphs to Phthia's distant reign.<br/>
Meanwhile at home, to Megapenthe's bed<br/>
The virgin choir Alector's daughter led.<br/>
Brave Megapenthes from a stolen amour<br/>
To great Atrides' age his handmaid bore;<br/>
To Helen's bed the gods alone assign<br/>
Hermione, to extend the regal line;<br/>
On whom a radiant pomp of Graces wait,<br/>
Resembling Venus in attractive state.
</p>
<p>
While this gay friendly troop the king surround,<br/>
With festival and mirth the roofs resound;<br/>
A bard amid the joyous circle sings<br/>
High airs attemper'd to the vocal strings;<br/>
Whilst warbling to the varied strain, advance<br/>
Two sprightly youths to form the bounding dance,<br/>
'Twas then, that issuing through the palace gate,<br/>
The splendid car roll'd slow in regal state:<br/>
On the bright eminence young Nestor shone,<br/>
And fast beside him great Ulysses' son;<br/>
Grave Eteoneus saw the pomp appear,<br/>
And speeding, thus address'd the royal ear;
</p>
<p>
"Two youths approach, whose semblant features prove<br/>
Their blood devolving from the source of Jove<br/>
Is due reception deign'd, or must they bend<br/>
Their doubtful course to seek a distant friend?"
</p>
<p>
"Insensate! (with a sigh the king replies,)<br/>
Too long, misjudging, have I thought thee wise<br/>
But sure relentless folly steels thy breast,<br/>
Obdurate to reject the stranger-guest;<br/>
To those dear hospitable rites a foe,<br/>
Which in my wanderings oft relieved my woe;<br/>
Fed by the bounty of another's board,<br/>
Till pitying Jove my native realm restored&mdash;<br/>
Straight be the coursers from the car released,<br/>
Conduct the youths to grace the genial feast."
</p>
<p>
The seneschal, rebuked, in haste withdrew;<br/>
With equal haste a menial train pursue:<br/>
Part led the coursers, from the car enlarged,<br/>
Each to a crib with choicest grain surcharged;<br/>
Part in a portico, profusely graced<br/>
With rich magnificence, the chariot placed;<br/>
Then to the dome the friendly pair invite,<br/>
Who eye the dazzling roofs with vast delight;<br/>
Resplendent as the blaze of summer noon,<br/>
Or the pale radiance of the midnight moon.<br/>
From room to room their eager view they bend<br/>
Thence to the bath, a beauteous pile, descend;<br/>
Where a bright damsel train attends the guests<br/>
With liquid odours, and embroider'd vests.<br/>
Refresh'd, they wait them to the bower of state,<br/>
Where, circled with his peers, Atrides sate;<br/>
Throned next the king, a fair attendant brings<br/>
The purest product of the crystal springs;<br/>
High on a massy vase of silver mould,<br/>
The burnish'd laver flames with solid gold,<br/>
In solid gold the purple vintage flows,<br/>
And on the board a second banquet rose.<br/>
When thus the king, with hospitable port;<br/>
"Accept this welcome to the Spartan court:<br/>
The waste of nature let the feast repair,<br/>
Then your high lineage and your names declare;<br/>
Say from what sceptred ancestry ye claim,<br/>
Recorded eminent in deathless fame,<br/>
For vulgar parents cannot stamp their race<br/>
With signatures of such majestic grace."
</p>
<p>
Ceasing, benevolent he straight assigns<br/>
The royal portion of the choicest chines<br/>
To each accepted friend; with grateful haste<br/>
They share the honours of the rich repast.<br/>
Sufficed, soft whispering thus to Nestor's son,<br/>
His head reclined, young Ithacus begun:
</p>
<p>
"View'st thou unmoved, O ever-honour'd most!<br/>
These prodigies of art, and wondrous cost!<br/>
Above, beneath, around the palace shines<br/>
The sunless treasure of exhausted mines;<br/>
The spoils of elephants the roofs inlay,<br/>
And studded amber darts the golden ray;<br/>
Such, and not nobler, in the realms above<br/>
My wonder dictates is the dome of Jove."
</p>
<p>
The monarch took the word, and grave replied:<br/>
"Presumptuous are the vaunts, and vain the pride<br/>
Of man, who dares in pomp with Jove contest,<br/>
Unchanged, immortal, and supremely blest!<br/>
With all my affluence, when my woes are weigh'd,<br/>
Envy will own the purchase dearly paid.<br/>
For eight slow-circling years, by tempests toss'd,<br/>
From Cypress to the far Phoenician coast<br/>
(Sidon the capital), I stretch'd my toil<br/>
Through regions fatten'd with the flows of Nile.<br/>
Next Aethiopia's utmost bound explore,<br/>
And the parch'd borders of the Arabian shore;<br/>
Then warp my voyage on the southern gales,<br/>
O'er the warm Lybian wave to spread my sails;<br/>
That happy clime, where each revolving year<br/>
The teeming ewes a triple offspring bear;<br/>
And two fair crescents of translucent horn<br/>
The brows of all their young increase adorn:<br/>
The shepherd swains, with sure abundance blest,<br/>
On the fat flock and rural dainties feast;<br/>
Nor want of herbage makes the dairy fail,<br/>
But every season fills the foaming pail.<br/>
Whilst, heaping unwash'd wealth, I distant roam,<br/>
The best of brothers, at his natal home,<br/>
By the dire fury of a traitress wife,<br/>
Ends the sad evening of a stormy life;<br/>
Whence, with incessant grief my soul annoy'd,<br/>
These riches are possess'd, but not enjoy'd!<br/>
My wars, the copious theme of every tongue,<br/>
To you your fathers have recorded long.<br/>
How favouring Heaven repaid my glorious toils<br/>
With a sack'd palace, and barbaric spoils.<br/>
Oh! had the gods so large a boon denied<br/>
And life, the just equivalent supplied<br/>
To those brave warriors, who, with glory fired<br/>
Far from their country, in my cause expired!<br/>
Still in short intervals of pleasing woe.<br/>
Regardful of the friendly dues I owe,<br/>
I to the glorious dead, for ever dear!<br/>
Indulge the tribute of a grateful tear.<br/>
But oh! Ulysses&mdash;deeper than the rest<br/>
That sad idea wounds my anxious breast!<br/>
My heart bleeds fresh with agonizing pain;<br/>
The bowl and tasteful viands tempt in vain;<br/>
Nor sleep's soft power can close my streaming eyes,<br/>
When imaged to my soul his sorrows rise.<br/>
No peril in my cause he ceased to prove,<br/>
His labours equall'd only by my love:<br/>
And both alike to bitter fortune born,<br/>
For him to suffer, and for me to mourn!<br/>
Whether he wanders on some friendly coast,<br/>
Or glides in Stygian gloom a pensive ghost,<br/>
No fame reveals; but, doubtful of his doom,<br/>
His good old sire with sorrow to the tomb<br/>
Declines his trembling steps; untimely care<br/>
Withers the blooming vigour of his heir;<br/>
And the chaste partner of his bed and throne<br/>
Wastes all her widow'd hours in tender moan."
</p>
<p>
While thus pathetic to the prince he spoke,<br/>
From the brave youth the streaming passion broke;<br/>
Studious to veil the grief, in vain repress'd,<br/>
His face he shrouded with his purple vest.<br/>
The conscious monarch pierced the coy disguise,<br/>
And view'd his filial love with vast surprise:<br/>
Dubious to press the tender theme, or wait<br/>
To hear the youth inquire his father's fate.<br/>
In this suspense bright Helen graced the room;<br/>
Before her breathed a gale of rich perfume.<br/>
So moves, adorn'd with each attractive grace,<br/>
The silver shafted goddess of the chase!<br/>
The seat of majesty Adraste brings,<br/>
With art illustrious, for the pomp of kings;<br/>
To spread the pall (beneath the regal chair)<br/>
Of softest wool, is bright Alcippe's care.<br/>
A silver canister, divinely wrought,<br/>
In her soft hands the beauteous Phylo brought;<br/>
To Sparta's queen of old the radiant vase<br/>
Alcandra gave, a pledge of royal grace;<br/>
For Polybus her lord (whose sovereign sway<br/>
The wealthy tribes of Pharian Thebes obey),<br/>
When to that court Atrides came, caress'd<br/>
With vast munificence the imperial guest:<br/>
Two lavers from the richest ore refined,<br/>
With silver tripods, the kind host assign'd;<br/>
And bounteous from the royal treasure told<br/>
Ten equal talents of refulgent gold.<br/>
Alcandra, consort of his high command,<br/>
A golden distaff gave to Helen's hand;<br/>
And that rich vase, with living sculpture wrought,<br/>
Which heap'd with wool the beauteous Phylo brought<br/>
The silken fleece, impurpled for the loom,<br/>
Rivall'd the hyacinth in vernal bloom.<br/>
The sovereign seat then Jove born Helen press'd,<br/>
And pleasing thus her sceptred lord address'd:
</p>
<p>
"Who grace our palace now, that friendly pair,<br/>
Speak they their lineage, or their names declare?<br/>
Uncertain of the truth, yet uncontroll'd,<br/>
Hear me the bodings of my breast unfold.<br/>
With wonder wrapp'd on yonder check I trace<br/>
The feature of the Ulyssean race:<br/>
Diffused o'er each resembling line appear,<br/>
In just similitude, the grace and air<br/>
Of young Telemachus! the lovely boy,<br/>
Who bless'd Ulysses with a father's joy,<br/>
What time the Greeks combined their social arms,<br/>
To avenge the stain of my ill-fated charms!"
</p>
<p>
"Just is thy thought, (the king assenting cries,)<br/>
Methinks Ulysses strikes my wondering eyes;<br/>
Full shines the father in the filial frame,<br/>
His port, his features, and his shape the same;<br/>
Such quick regards his sparkling eyes bestow;<br/>
Such wavy ringlets o'er his shoulders flow<br/>
And when he heard the long disastrous store<br/>
Of cares, which in my cause Ulysses bore;<br/>
Dismay'd, heart-wounded with paternal woes,<br/>
Above restraint the tide of sorrow rose;<br/>
Cautious to let the gushing grief appear,<br/>
His purple garment veil'd the falling tear."
</p>
<p>
"See there confess'd (Pisistratus replies)<br/>
The genuine worth of Ithacus the wise!<br/>
Of that heroic sire the youth is sprung,<br/>
But modest awe hath chain'd his timorous tongue.<br/>
Thy voice, O king! with pleased attention heard,<br/>
Is like the dictates of a god revered.<br/>
With him, at Nestor's high command, I came,<br/>
Whose age I honour with a parent's name.<br/>
By adverse destiny constrained to sue<br/>
For counsel and redress, he sues to you<br/>
Whatever ill the friendless orphan bears,<br/>
Bereaved of parents in his infant years,<br/>
Still must the wrong'd Telemachus sustain,<br/>
If, hopeful of your aid, he hopes in vain;<br/>
Affianced in your friendly power alone,<br/>
The youth would vindicate the vacant throne."
</p>
<p>
"Is Sparta blest, and these desiring eyes<br/>
View my friend's son? (the king exalting cries;)<br/>
Son of my friend, by glorious toils approved,<br/>
Whose sword was sacred to the man he loved;<br/>
Mirror of constant faith, revered and mourn'd&mdash;<br/>
When Troy was ruin'd, had the chief return'd,<br/>
No Greek an equal space had ere possess'd,<br/>
Of dear affection, in my grateful breast.<br/>
I, to confirm the mutual joys we shared,<br/>
For his abode a capital prepared;<br/>
Argos, the seat of sovereign rule, I chose;<br/>
Fair in the plan the future palace rose,<br/>
Where my Ulysses and his race might reign,<br/>
And portion to his tribes the wide domain,<br/>
To them my vassals had resign'd a soil,<br/>
With teeming plenty to reward their toil.<br/>
There with commutual zeal we both had strove<br/>
In acts of dear benevolence and love:<br/>
Brothers in peace, not rivals in command,<br/>
And death alone dissolved the friendly band!<br/>
Some envious power the blissful scene destroys;<br/>
Vanish'd are all the visionary joys;<br/>
The soul of friendship to my hope is lost,<br/>
Fated to wander from his natal coast!"
</p>
<p>
He ceased; a gush of grief began to rise:<br/>
Fast streams a tide from beauteous Helen's eyes;<br/>
Fast for the sire the filial sorrows flow;<br/>
The weeping monarch swells the mighty woe;<br/>
Thy cheeks, Pisistratus, the tears bedew,<br/>
While pictured so thy mind appear'd in view,<br/>
Thy martial brother; on the Phrygian plain<br/>
Extended pale, by swarthy Memnon slain!<br/>
But silence soon the son of Nestor broke,<br/>
And melting with fraternal pity, spoke:
</p>
<p>
"Frequent, O king, was Nestor wont to raise<br/>
And charm attention with thy copious praise;<br/>
To crowd thy various gifts, the sage assign'd<br/>
The glory of a firm capacious mind;<br/>
With that superior attribute control<br/>
This unavailing impotence of soul,<br/>
Let not your roof with echoing grief resound,<br/>
Now for the feast the friendly bowl is crown'd;<br/>
But when, from dewy shade emerging bright,<br/>
Aurora streaks the sky with orient light,<br/>
Let each deplore his dead; the rites of woe<br/>
Are all, alas! the living can bestow;<br/>
O'er the congenial dust enjoin'd to shear<br/>
The graceful curl, and drop the tender tear.<br/>
Then, mingling in the mournful pomp with you,<br/>
I'll pay my brother's ghost a warrior's due,<br/>
And mourn the brave Antilochus, a name<br/>
Not unrecorded in the rolls of fame;<br/>
With strength and speed superior form'd, in fight<br/>
To face the foe, or intercept his flight;<br/>
Too early snatch'd by fate ere known to me!<br/>
I boast a witness of his worth in thee."
</p>
<p>
"Young and mature! (the monarch thus rejoins,)<br/>
In thee renew'd the soul of Nestor shines;<br/>
Form'd by the care of that consummate sage,<br/>
In early bloom an oracle of age.<br/>
Whene'er his influence Jove vouchsafes to shower,<br/>
To bless the natal and the nuptial hour;<br/>
From the great sire transmissive to the race,<br/>
The boon devolving gives distinguish'd grace.<br/>
Such, happy Nestor! was thy glorious doom,<br/>
Around thee, full of years, thy offspring bloom.<br/>
Expert of arms, and prudent in debate;<br/>
The gifts of Heaven to guard thy hoary state.<br/>
But now let each becalm his troubled breast,<br/>
Wash, and partake serene the friendly feast.<br/>
To move thy suit, Telemachus, delay,<br/>
Till heaven's revolving lamp restores the day."
</p>
<p>
He said, Asphalion swift the laver brings;<br/>
Alternate, all partake the grateful springs;<br/>
Then from the rites of purity repair,<br/>
And with keen gust the savoury viands share.<br/>
Meantime, with genial joy to warm the soul,<br/>
Bright Helen mix'd a mirth inspiring bowl;<br/>
Temper'd with drugs of sovereign use, to assuage<br/>
The boiling bosom of tumultuous rage;<br/>
To clear the cloudy front of wrinkled Care,<br/>
And dry the tearful sluices of Despair;<br/>
Charm'd with that virtuous draught, the exalted mind<br/>
All sense of woe delivers to the wind.<br/>
Though on the blazing pile his parent lay,<br/>
Or a loved brother groan'd his life away,<br/>
Or darling son, oppress'd by ruffian force,<br/>
Fell breathless at his feet, a mangled corse;<br/>
From morn to eve, impassive and serene,<br/>
The man entranced would view the dreadful scene.<br/>
These drugs, so friendly to the joys of life,<br/>
Bright Helen learn'd from Thone's imperial wife;<br/>
Who sway'd the sceptre, where prolific Nile<br/>
With various simples clothes the fatten'd soil.<br/>
With wholesome herbage mix'd, the direful bane<br/>
Of vegetable venom taints the plain;<br/>
From Paeon sprung, their patron-god imparts<br/>
To all the Pharian race his healing arts.<br/>
The beverage now prepared to inspire the feast,<br/>
The circle thus the beauteous queen addressed:
</p>
<p>
"Throned in omnipotence, supremest Jove<br/>
Tempers the fates of human race above;<br/>
By the firm sanction of his sovereign will,<br/>
Alternate are decreed our good and ill.<br/>
To feastful mirth be this white hour assign'd.<br/>
And sweet discourse, the banquet of the mind<br/>
Myself, assisting in the social joy,<br/>
Will tell Ulysses' bold exploit in Troy,<br/>
Sole witness of the deed I now declare<br/>
Speak you (who saw) his wonders in the war.
</p>
<p>
"Seam'd o'er with wounds, which his own sabre gave,<br/>
In the vile habit of a village slave,<br/>
The foe deceived, he pass'd the tented plain,<br/>
In Troy to mingle with the hostile train.<br/>
In this attire secure from searching eyes,<br/>
Till happily piercing through the dark disguise,<br/>
The chief I challenged; he, whose practised wit<br/>
Knew all the serpent mazes of deceit,<br/>
Eludes my search; but when his form I view'd<br/>
Fresh from the bath, with fragrant oils renew'd,<br/>
His limbs in military purple dress'd,<br/>
Each brightening grace the genuine Greek confess'd.<br/>
A previous pledge of sacred faith obtain'd,<br/>
Till he the lines and Argive fleet regain'd,<br/>
To keep his stay conceal'd; the chief declared<br/>
The plans of war against the town prepared.<br/>
Exploring then the secrets of the state,<br/>
He learn'd what best might urge the Dardan fate;<br/>
And, safe returning to the Grecian host,<br/>
Sent many a shade to Pluto's dreary coast.<br/>
Loud grief resounded through the towers of Troy,<br/>
But my pleased bosom glow'd with secret joy:<br/>
For then, with dire remorse and conscious shame<br/>
I view'd the effects of that disastrous flame,<br/>
Which, kindled by the imperious queen of love,<br/>
Constrain'd me from my native realm to rove:<br/>
And oft in bitterness of soul deplored<br/>
My absent daughter and my dearer lord;<br/>
Admired among the first of human race,<br/>
For every gift of mind and manly grace."
</p>
<p>
"Right well (replied the king) your speech displays<br/>
The matchless merit of the chief you praise:<br/>
Heroes in various climes myself have found,<br/>
For martial deeds and depth of thought renown'd;<br/>
But Ithacus, unrivall'd in his claim,<br/>
May boast a title to the loudest fame:<br/>
In battle calm he guides the rapid storm,<br/>
Wise to resolve, and patient to perform.<br/>
What wondrous conduct in the chief appear'd,<br/>
When the vast fabric of the steed we rear'd!<br/>
Some demon, anxious for the Trojan doom,<br/>
Urged you with great Deiphobus to come,<br/>
To explore the fraud; with guile opposed to guile.<br/>
Slow-pacing thrice around the insidious pile,<br/>
Each noted leader's name you thrice invoke,<br/>
Your accent varying as their spouses spoke!<br/>
The pleasing sounds each latent warrior warm'd,<br/>
But most Tydides' and my heart alarm'd:<br/>
To quit the steed we both impatient press<br/>
Threatening to answer from the dark recess.<br/>
Unmoved the mind of Ithacus remain'd;<br/>
And the vain ardours of our love restrain'd;<br/>
But Anticlus, unable to control,<br/>
Spoke loud the language of his yearning soul:<br/>
Ulysses straight, with indignation fired<br/>
(For so the common care of Greece required),<br/>
Firm to his lips his forceful hands applied,<br/>
Till on his tongue the fluttering murmurs died.<br/>
Meantime Minerva, from the fraudful horse,<br/>
Back to the court of Priam bent your course."
</p>
<p>
"Inclement fate! (Telemachus replies,)<br/>
Frail is the boasted attribute of wise:<br/>
The leader mingling with the vulgar host,<br/>
Is in the common mass of matter lost!<br/>
But now let sleep the painful waste repair<br/>
Of sad reflection and corroding care."<br/>
He ceased; the menial fair that round her wait,<br/>
At Helen's beck prepare the room of state;<br/>
Beneath an ample portico they spread<br/>
The downy fleece to form the slumberous bed;<br/>
And o'er soft palls of purple grain unfold<br/>
Rich tapestry, stiff with interwoven gold:<br/>
Then, through the illumined dome, to balmy rest<br/>
The obsequious herald guides each princely guest;<br/>
While to his regal bower the king ascends,<br/>
And beauteous Helen on her lord attends.<br/>
Soon as the morn, in orient purple dress'd,<br/>
Unbarr'd the portal of the roseate east,<br/>
The monarch rose; magnificent to view,<br/>
The imperial mantle o'er his vest he threw;<br/>
The glittering zone athwart his shoulders cast,<br/>
A starry falchion low-depending graced;<br/>
Clasp'd on his feet the embroidered sandals shine;<br/>
And forth he moves, majestic and divine,<br/>
Instant to young Telemachus he press'd;<br/>
And thus benevolent his speech addressed:
</p>
<p>
"Say, royal youth, sincere of soul report<br/>
Whit cause hath led you to the Spartan court?<br/>
Do public or domestic care constrain<br/>
This toilsome voyage o'er the surgy main?"
</p>
<p>
"O highly-favour'd delegate of Jove!<br/>
(Replies the prince) inflamed with filial love,<br/>
And anxious hope, to hear my parent's doom,<br/>
A suppliant to your royal court I come:<br/>
Our sovereign seat a lewd usurping race<br/>
With lawless riot and misrule disgrace;<br/>
To pamper'd insolence devoted fall<br/>
Prime of the flock, and choicest of the stall:<br/>
For wild ambition wings their bold desire,<br/>
And all to mount the imperial bed aspire.<br/>
But prostrate I implore, O king! relate<br/>
The mournful series of my father's fate:<br/>
Each known disaster of the man disclose,<br/>
Born by his mother to a world of woes!<br/>
Recite them; nor in erring pity fear<br/>
To wound with storied grief the filial ear.<br/>
If e'er Ulysses, to reclaim your right,<br/>
Avow'd his zeal in council or in fight,<br/>
If Phrygian camps the friendly toils attest,<br/>
To the sire's merit give the son's request."
</p>
<p>
Deep from his inmost soul Atrides sigh'd,<br/>
And thus, indignant, to the prince replied:<br/>
"Heavens! would a soft, inglorious, dastard train<br/>
An absent hero's nuptial joys profane!<br/>
So with her young, amid the woodland shades,<br/>
A timorous hind the lion's court invades,<br/>
Leaves in the fatal lair the tender fawns,<br/>
Climbs the green cliff, or feeds the flowery lawns:<br/>
Meantime return'd, with dire remorseless sway,<br/>
The monarch-savage rends the trembling prey.<br/>
With equal fury, and with equal fame,<br/>
Ulysses soon shall reassert his claim.<br/>
O Jove supreme, whom gods and men revere!<br/>
And thou! to whom 'tis given to gild the sphere!<br/>
With power congenial join'd, propitious aid<br/>
The chief adopted by the martial maid!<br/>
Such to our wish the warrior soon restore,<br/>
As when contending on the Lesbian shore<br/>
His prowess Philomelidies confess'd,<br/>
And loud-acclaiming Greeks the victor bless'd;<br/>
Then soon the invaders of his bed and throne<br/>
Their love presumptuous shall with life atone.<br/>
With patient ear, O royal youth, attend<br/>
The storied labour of thy father's friend:<br/>
Fruitful of deeds, the copious tale is long,<br/>
But truth severe shall dictate to my tongue:<br/>
Learn what I heard the sea-born seer relate,<br/>
Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate.
</p>
<p>
"Long on the Egyptian coast by calms confined,<br/>
Heaven to my fleet refused a prosperous wind;<br/>
No vows had we preferr'd, nor victims slain!<br/>
For this the gods each favouring gale restrain<br/>
Jealous, to see their high behests obey'd;<br/>
Severe, if men the eternal rights evade.<br/>
High o'er a gulfy sea, the Pharian isle<br/>
Fronts the deep roar of disemboguing Nile:<br/>
Her distance from the shore, the course begun<br/>
At dawn, and ending with the setting sun,<br/>
A galley measures; when the stiffer gales<br/>
Rise on the poop, and fully stretch the sails.<br/>
There, anchor'd vessels safe in harbour lie,<br/>
Whilst limpid springs the failing cask supply.
</p>
<p>
"And now the twentieth sun, descending, laves<br/>
His glowing axle in the western waves:<br/>
Still with expanded sails we court in vain<br/>
Propitious winds to waft us o'er the main;<br/>
And the pale mariner at once deplores<br/>
His drooping vigour and exhausted stores.<br/>
When lo! a bright cerulean form appears,<br/>
Proteus her sire divine. With pity press'd,<br/>
Me sole the daughter of the deep address'd;<br/>
What time, with hunger pined, my absent mates<br/>
Roam the wide isle in search of rural cates,<br/>
Bait the barb'd steel, and from the fishy flood<br/>
Appease the afflictive fierce desire of food."
</p>
<p>
"'Whoe'er thou art (the azure goddess cries)<br/>
Thy conduct ill-deserves the praise of wise:<br/>
Is death thy choice, or misery thy boast,<br/>
That here inglorious, on a barren coast,<br/>
Thy brave associates droop, a meagre train,<br/>
With famine pale, and ask thy care in vain?'<br/>
"Struck with the loud reproach, I straight reply:<br/>
'Whate'er thy title in thy native sky,<br/>
A goddess sure! for more than moral grace<br/>
Speaks thee descendant of ethereal race;<br/>
Deem not that here of choice my fleet remains;<br/>
Some heavenly power averse my stay constrains:<br/>
O, piteous of my fate, vouchsafe to show<br/>
(For what's sequester'd from celestial view?)<br/>
What power becalms the innavigable seas?<br/>
What guilt provokes him, and what vows appease?'
</p>
<p>
"I ceased, when affable the goddess cried:<br/>
'Observe, and in the truths I speak confide;<br/>
The oracular seer frequents the Pharian coast,<br/>
From whose high bed my birth divine I boast;<br/>
Proteus, a name tremendous o'er the main,<br/>
The delegate of Neptune's watery reign.<br/>
Watch with insidious care his known abode;<br/>
There fast in chains constrain the various god;<br/>
Who bound, obedient to superior force,<br/>
Unerring will prescribe your destined course.<br/>
If, studious on your realms, you then demand<br/>
Their state, since last you left your natal land,<br/>
Instant the god obsequious will disclose<br/>
Bright tracts of glory or a cloud of woes.'
</p>
<p>
"She ceased; and suppliant thus I made reply:<br/>
'O goddess! on thy aid my hopes rely;<br/>
Dictate propitious to my duteous ear,<br/>
What arts can captivate the changeful seer;<br/>
For perilous the assay, unheard the toil,<br/>
To elude the prescience of a god by guile.'
</p>
<p>
"Thus to the goddess mild my suit I end.<br/>
Then she: 'Obedient to my rule attend:<br/>
When through the zone of heaven the mounted sun<br/>
Hath journeyed half, and half remains to run;<br/>
The seer, while zephyrs curl the swelling deep,<br/>
Basks on the breezy shore, in grateful sleep,<br/>
His oozy limbs. Emerging from the wave,<br/>
The Phocas swift surround his rocky cave,<br/>
Frequent and full; the consecrated train<br/>
Of her, whose azure trident awes the main;<br/>
There wallowing warm, the enormous herd exhales<br/>
An oily steam, and taints the noontide gales.<br/>
To that recess, commodious for surprise,<br/>
When purple light shall next suffuse the skies,<br/>
With me repair; and from thy warrior-band<br/>
Three chosen chiefs of dauntless soul command;<br/>
Let their auxiliar force befriend the toil;<br/>
For strong the god, and perfected in guile.<br/>
Stretch'd on the shelly shore, he first surveys<br/>
The flouncing herd ascending from the seas;<br/>
Their number summ'd, reposed in sleep profound<br/>
The scaly charge their guardian god surround;<br/>
So with his battening flocks the careful swain<br/>
Abides pavilion'd on the grassy plain.<br/>
With powers united, obstinately bold,<br/>
Invade him, couch'd amid the scaly fold;<br/>
Instant he wears, elusive of the rape,<br/>
The mimic force of every savage shape;<br/>
Or glides with liquid lapse a murmuring stream,<br/>
Or, wrapp'd in flame, he glows at every limb.<br/>
Yet, still retentive, with redoubled might,<br/>
Through each vain passive form constrain his flight<br/>
But when, his native shape renamed, he stands<br/>
Patient of conquest, and your cause demands;<br/>
The cause that urged the bold attempt declare,<br/>
And soothe the vanquish'd with a victor's prayer.<br/>
The bands releas'd, implore the seer to say<br/>
What godhead interdicts the watery way.<br/>
Who, straight propitious, in prophetic strain<br/>
Will teach you to repass the unmeasured main.'<br/>
She ceased, and bounding from the shelfy shore,<br/>
Round the descending nymph the waves resounding roar.
</p>
<p>
"High wrapp'd in wonder of the future deed,<br/>
with joy impetuous to the port I speed:<br/>
The wants of nature with repast suffice,<br/>
Till night with grateful shade involved the skies,<br/>
And shed ambrosial dews. Fast by the deep,<br/>
Along the tented shore, in balmy sleep,<br/>
Our cares were lost. When o'er the eastern lawn,<br/>
In saffron robes, the daughter of the dawn<br/>
Advanced her rosy steps, before the bay<br/>
Due ritual honours to the gods I pay;<br/>
Then seek the place the sea-born nymph assign'd,<br/>
With three associates of undaunted mind.<br/>
Arrived, to form along the appointed strand<br/>
For each a bed, she scoops the hilly sand;<br/>
Then, from her azure cave the finny spoils<br/>
Of four vast Phocae takes, to veil her wiles;<br/>
Beneath the finny spoils extended prone,<br/>
Hard toil! the prophet's piercing eye to shun;<br/>
New from the corse, the scaly frauds diffuse<br/>
Unsavoury stench of oil, and brackish ooze;<br/>
But the bright sea-maid's gentle power implored,<br/>
With nectar'd drops the sickening sense restored.
</p>
<p>
"Thus till the sun had travell'd half the skies,<br/>
Ambush'd we lie, and wait the bold emprise;<br/>
When, thronging quick to bask in open air,<br/>
The flocks of ocean to the strand repair;<br/>
Couch'd on the sunny sand, the monsters sleep;<br/>
Then Proteus, mounting from the hoary deep,<br/>
Surveys his charge, unknowing of deceit;<br/>
(In order told, we make the sum complete.)<br/>
Pleased with the false review, secure he lies,<br/>
And leaden slumbers press his drooping eyes.<br/>
Rushing impetuous forth, we straight prepare<br/>
A furious onset with the sound of war,<br/>
And shouting seize the god; our force to evade,<br/>
His various arts he soon resumes in aid;<br/>
A lion now, he curls a surgy mane;<br/>
Sudden our hands a spotted pard restrain;<br/>
Then, arm'd with tusks, and lightning in his eyes,<br/>
A boar's obscener shape the god belies;<br/>
On spiry volumes, there a dragon rides;<br/>
Here, from our strict embrace a stream he glides.<br/>
At last, sublime, his stately growth he rears<br/>
A tree, and well-dissembled foliage wears.<br/>
Vain efforts with superior power compress'd,<br/>
Me with reluctance thus the seer address'd;<br/>
'Say, son of Atreus, say what god inspired<br/>
This daring fraud, and what the boon desired?'<br/>
I thus: 'O thou, whose certain eye foresees<br/>
The fix'd event of fate's remote decrees;<br/>
After long woes, and various toil endured,<br/>
Still on this desert isle my fleet is moor'd,<br/>
Unfriended of the gales. All-knowing, say,<br/>
What godhead interdicts the watery way?<br/>
What vows repentant will the power appease,<br/>
To speed a prosperous voyage o'er the seas.'
</p>
<p>
"'To Jove (with stern regard the god replies)<br/>
And all the offended synod of the skies,<br/>
Just hecatombs with due devotion slain,<br/>
Thy guilt absolved, a prosperous voyage gain.<br/>
To the firm sanction of thy fate attend!<br/>
An exile thou, nor cheering face of friend,<br/>
Nor sight of natal shore, nor regal dome,<br/>
Shalt yet enjoy, but still art doom'd to roam.<br/>
Once more the Nile, who from the secret source<br/>
Of Jove's high seat descends with sweepy force,<br/>
Must view his billows white beneath thy oar,<br/>
And altars blaze along his sanguine shore.<br/>
Then will the gods with holy pomp adored,<br/>
To thy long vows a safe return accord.'
</p>
<p>
"He ceased: heart wounded with afflictive pain,<br/>
(Doom'd to repeat the perils of the main,<br/>
A shelfy track and long!) 'O seer' I cry,<br/>
'To the stern sanction of the offended sky<br/>
My prompt obedience bows. But deign to say<br/>
What fate propitious, or what dire dismay,<br/>
Sustain those peers, the relics of our host,<br/>
Whom I with Nestor on the Phrygian coast<br/>
Embracing left? Must I the warriors weep,<br/>
Whelm'd in the bottom of the monstrous deep?<br/>
Or did the kind domestic friend deplore<br/>
The breathless heroes on their native shore?
</p>
<p>
"'Press not too far,' replied the god: 'but cease<br/>
To know what, known, will violate thy peace;<br/>
Too curious of their doom! with friendly woe<br/>
Thy breast will heave, and tears eternal flow.<br/>
Part live! the rest, a lamentable train!<br/>
Range the dark bounds of Pluto's dreary reign.<br/>
Two, foremost in the roll of Mars renown'd,<br/>
Whose arms with conquest in thy cause were crown'd,<br/>
Fell by disastrous fate: by tempests toss'd,<br/>
A third lives wretched on a distant coast.
</p>
<p>
"By Neptune rescued from Minerva's hate,<br/>
On Gyrae, safe Oilean Ajax sate,<br/>
His ship o'erwhelm'd; but, frowning on the floods,<br/>
Impious he roar'd defiance to the gods;<br/>
To his own prowess all the glory gave:<br/>
The power defrauding who vouchsafed to save.<br/>
This heard the raging ruler of the main;<br/>
His spear, indignant for such high disdain,<br/>
He launched; dividing with his forky mace<br/>
The aërial summit from the marble base:<br/>
The rock rush'd seaward, with impetuous roar<br/>
Ingulf'd, and to the abyss the boaster bore.
</p>
<p>
"By Juno's guardian aid, the watery vast,<br/>
Secure of storms, your royal brother pass'd,<br/>
Till, coasting nigh the cape where Malen shrouds<br/>
Her spiry cliffs amid surrounding clouds,<br/>
A whirling gust tumultuous from the shore<br/>
Across the deep his labouring vessel bore.<br/>
In an ill-fated hour the coast he gain'd,<br/>
Where late in regal pomp Thyestes reigned;<br/>
But, when his hoary honours bow'd to fate,<br/>
Ægysthus govern'd in paternal state,<br/>
The surges now subside, the tempest ends;<br/>
From his tall ship the king of men descends;<br/>
There fondly thinks the gods conclude his toil:<br/>
Far from his own domain salutes the soil;<br/>
With rapture oft the verge of Greece reviews,<br/>
And the dear turf with tears of joy bedews.<br/>
Him, thus exulting on the distant stand,<br/>
A spy distinguish'd from his airy stand;<br/>
To bribe whose vigilance, Ægysthus told<br/>
A mighty sum of ill-persuading gold:<br/>
There watch'd this guardian of his guilty fear,<br/>
Till the twelfth moon had wheel'd her pale career;<br/>
And now, admonish'd by his eye, to court<br/>
With terror wing'd conveys the dread report.<br/>
Of deathful arts expert, his lord employs<br/>
The ministers of blood in dark surprise;<br/>
And twenty youths, in radiant mail incased,<br/>
Close ambush'd nigh the spacious hall he placed.<br/>
Then bids prepare the hospitable treat:<br/>
Vain shows of love to veil his felon hate!<br/>
To grace the victor's welcome from the wars,<br/>
A train of coursers and triumphal cars<br/>
Magnificent he leads: the royal guest,<br/>
Thoughtless of ill, accepts the fraudful feast.<br/>
The troop forth-issuing from the dark recess,<br/>
With homicidal rage the king oppress!<br/>
So, whilst he feeds luxurious in the stall,<br/>
The sovereign of the herd is doomed to fall,<br/>
The partners of his fame and toils at Troy,<br/>
Around their lord, a mighty ruin, lie:<br/>
Mix'd with the brave, the base invaders bleed;<br/>
Ægysthus sole survives to boast the deed.'
</p>
<p>
"He said: chill horrors shook my shivering soul,<br/>
Rack'd with convulsive pangs in dust I roll;<br/>
And hate, in madness of extreme despair,<br/>
To view the sun, or breathe the vital air.<br/>
But when, superior to the rage of woe,<br/>
I stood restored and tears had ceased to flow,<br/>
Lenient of grief the pitying god began:<br/>
'Forget the brother, and resume the man.<br/>
To Fate's supreme dispose the dead resign,<br/>
That care be Fate's, a speedy passage thine<br/>
Still lives the wretch who wrought the death deplored,<br/>
But lives a victim for thy vengeful sword;<br/>
Unless with filial rage Orestes glow,<br/>
And swift prevent the meditated blow:<br/>
You timely will return a welcome guest,<br/>
With him to share the sad funereal feast.'
</p>
<p>
"He said: new thoughts my beating heart employ,<br/>
My gloomy soul receives a gleam of joy.<br/>
Fair hope revives; and eager I address'd<br/>
The prescient godhead to reveal the rest:<br/>
'The doom decreed of those disastrous two<br/>
I've heard with pain, but oh! the tale pursue;<br/>
What third brave son of Mars the Fates constrain<br/>
To roam the howling desert of the main;<br/>
Or, in eternal shade of cold he lies,<br/>
Provoke new sorrows from these grateful eyes.'
</p>
<p>
"'That chief (rejoin'd the god) his race derives<br/>
From Ithaca, and wondrous woes survives;<br/>
Laertes' son: girt with circumfluous tides,<br/>
He still calamitous constraint abides.<br/>
Him in Calypso's cave of late I view'd,<br/>
When streaming grief his faded cheek bedow'd.<br/>
But vain his prayer, his arts are vain, to move<br/>
The enamour'd goddess, or elude her love:<br/>
His vessel sunk, and dear companions lost,<br/>
He lives reluctant on a foreign coast.<br/>
But oh, beloved by Heaven! reserved to thee<br/>
A happier lot the smiling Fates decree:<br/>
Free from that law, beneath whose mortal sway<br/>
Matter is changed, and varying forms decay,<br/>
Elysium shall be thine: the blissful plains<br/>
Of utmost earth, where Rhadamanthus reigns.<br/>
Joys ever young, unmix'd with pain or fear,<br/>
Fill the wide circle of the eternal year:<br/>
Stern winter smiles on that auspicious clime:<br/>
The fields are florid with unfading prime;<br/>
From the bleak pole no winds inclement blow,<br/>
Mould the round hail, or flake the fleecy snow;<br/>
But from the breezy deep the blest inhale<br/>
The fragrant murmurs of the western gale.<br/>
This grace peculiar will the gods afford<br/>
To thee, the son of Jove, and beauteous Helen's lord.'
</p>
<p>
"He ceased, and plunging in the vast profound,<br/>
Beneath the god and whirling billows bound.<br/>
Then speeding back, involved in various thought,<br/>
My friends attending at the shore I sought,<br/>
Arrived, the rage of hunger we control<br/>
Till night with silent shade invests the pole;<br/>
Then lose the cares of life in pleasing rest.<br/>
Soon as the morn reveals the roseate east,<br/>
With sails we wing the masts, our anchors weigh,<br/>
Unmoor the fleet, and rush into the sea.<br/>
Ranged on the banks, beneath our equal oars<br/>
White curl the waves, and the vex'd ocean roars<br/>
Then, steering backward from the Pharian isle,<br/>
We gain the stream of Jove-descended Nile;<br/>
There quit the ships, and on the destined shore<br/>
With ritual hecatombs the gods adore;<br/>
Their wrath atoned, to Agamemnon's name<br/>
A cenotaph I raise of deathless fame.<br/>
These rites to piety and grief discharged,<br/>
The friendly gods a springing gale enlarged;<br/>
The fleet swift tilting o'er the surges flew,<br/>
Till Grecian cliffs appear'd a blissful view!
</p>
<p>
"Thy patient ear hath heard me long relate<br/>
A story, fruitful of disastrous fate.<br/>
And now, young prince, indulge my fond request;<br/>
Be Sparta honoured with his royal guest,<br/>
Till, from his eastern goal, the joyous sun<br/>
His twelfth diurnal race begins to run.<br/>
Meantime my train the friendly gifts prepare,<br/>
The sprightly coursers and a polish'd car;<br/>
With these a goblet of capacious mould,<br/>
Figured with art to dignify the gold<br/>
(Form'd for libation to the gods), shall prove<br/>
A pledge and monument of sacred love."
</p>
<p>
"My quick return (young Ithacus rejoin'd),<br/>
Damps the warm wishes of my raptured mind;<br/>
Did not my fate my needful haste constrain,<br/>
Charm'd by your speech so graceful and humane,<br/>
Lost in delight the circling year would roll,<br/>
While deep attention fix'd my listening soul.<br/>
But now to Pyle permit my destined way,<br/>
My loved associates chide my long delay:<br/>
In dear remembrance of your royal grace,<br/>
I take the present of the promised vase;<br/>
The coursers, for the champaign sports retain;<br/>
That gift our barren rocks will render vain:<br/>
Horrid with cliffs, our meagre land allows<br/>
Thin herbage for the mountain goat to browse,<br/>
But neither mead nor plain supplies, to feed<br/>
The sprightly courser, or indulge his speed:<br/>
To sea-surrounded realms the gods assign<br/>
Small tract of fertile lawn, the least to mine."
</p>
<p>
His hand the king with tender passion press'd,<br/>
And, smiling, thus the royal youth address'd:<br/>
"O early worth! a soul so wise, and young,<br/>
Proclaims you from the sage Ulysses sprung.<br/>
Selected from my stores, of matchless price,<br/>
An urn shall recompense your prudent choice;<br/>
By Vulcan's art, the verge with gold enchased.<br/>
A pledge the sceptred power of Sidon gave,<br/>
When to his realm I plough'd the orient wave."
</p>
<p>
Thus they alternate; while, with artful care,<br/>
The menial train the regal feast prepare.<br/>
The firstlings of the flock are doom'd to die:<br/>
Rich fragrant wines the cheering bowl supply;<br/>
A female band the gift of Ceres bring;<br/>
And the gilt roofs with genial triumph ring.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in Ithaca, the suitor powers<br/>
In active games divide their jovial hours;<br/>
In areas varied with mosaic art,<br/>
Some whirl the disk, and some the javelin dart,<br/>
Aside, sequester'd from the vast resort,<br/>
Antinous sole spectator of the sport;<br/>
With great Eurymachus, of worth confess'd,<br/>
And high descent, superior to the rest;<br/>
Whom young Noëmon lowly thus address'd:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"My ship, equipp'd within the neighboring port,<br/>
The prince, departing for the Pylian court,<br/>
Requested for his speed; but, courteous, say<br/>
When steers he home, or why this long delay?<br/>
For Elis I should sail with utmost speed,<br/>
To import twelve mares which there luxurious feed,<br/>
And twelve young mules, a strong laborious race,<br/>
New to the plow, unpractised in the trace."
</p>
<p>
Unknowing of the course to Pyle design'd,<br/>
A sudden horror seized on either mind;<br/>
The prince in rural bower they fondly thought,<br/>
Numbering his flocks and herds, not far remote.<br/>
"Relate (Antinous cries), devoid of guile,<br/>
When spread the prince his sale for distant Pyle?<br/>
Did chosen chiefs across the gulfy main<br/>
Attend his voyage, or domestic train?<br/>
Spontaneous did you speed his secret course,<br/>
Or was the vessel seized by fraud or force?"
</p>
<p>
"With willing duty, not reluctant mind<br/>
(Noëmon cried), the vessel was resign'd,<br/>
Who, in the balance, with the great affairs<br/>
Of courts presume to weigh their private cares?<br/>
With him, the peerage next in power to you;<br/>
And Mentor, captain of the lordly crew,<br/>
Or some celestial in his reverend form,<br/>
Safe from the secret rock and adverse storm,<br/>
Pilots the course; for when the glimmering ray<br/>
Of yester dawn disclosed the tender day,<br/>
Mentor himself I saw, and much admired,"<br/>
Then ceased the youth, and from the court retired.
</p>
<p>
Confounded and appall'd, the unfinish'd game<br/>
The suitors quit, and all to council came.<br/>
Antinous first the assembled peers address'd.<br/>
Rage sparkling in his eyes, and burning in his breast
</p>
<p>
"O shame to manhood! shall one daring boy<br/>
The scheme of all our happiness destroy?<br/>
Fly unperceived, seducing half the flower<br/>
Of nobles, and invite a foreign power?<br/>
The ponderous engine raised to crush us all,<br/>
Recoiling, on his head is sure to fall.<br/>
Instant prepare me, on the neighbouring strand,<br/>
With twenty chosen mates a vessel mann'd;<br/>
For ambush'd close beneath the Samian shore<br/>
His ship returning shall my spies explore;<br/>
He soon his rashness shall with life atone,<br/>
Seek for his father's fate, but find his own."
</p>
<p>
With vast applause the sentence all approve;<br/>
Then rise, and to the feastful hall remove;<br/>
Swift to the queen the herald Medon ran,<br/>
Who heard the consult of the dire divan:<br/>
Before her dome the royal matron stands,<br/>
And thus the message of his haste demands;
</p>
<p>
"What will the suitors? must my servant-train<br/>
The allotted labours of the day refrain,<br/>
For them to form some exquisite repast?<br/>
Heaven grant this festival may prove their last!<br/>
Or, if they still must live, from me remove<br/>
The double plague of luxury and love!<br/>
Forbear, ye sons of insolence! forbear,<br/>
In riot to consume a wretched heir.<br/>
In the young soul illustrious thought to raise,<br/>
Were ye not tutor'd with Ulysses' praise?<br/>
Have not your fathers oft my lord defined,<br/>
Gentle of speech, beneficent of mind?<br/>
Some kings with arbitrary rage devour,<br/>
Or in their tyrant-minions vest the power;<br/>
Ulysses let no partial favours fall,<br/>
The people's parent, he protected all;<br/>
But absent now, perfidious and ingrate!<br/>
His stores ye ravage, and usurp his state."
</p>
<p>
He thus: "O were the woes you speak the worst!<br/>
They form a deed more odious and accursed;<br/>
More dreadful than your boding soul divines;<br/>
But pitying Jove avert the dire designs!<br/>
The darling object of your royal care<br/>
Is marked to perish in a deathful snare;<br/>
Before he anchors in his native port,<br/>
From Pyle re-sailing and the Spartan court;<br/>
Horrid to speak! in ambush is decreed<br/>
The hope and heir of Ithaca to bleed!"
</p>
<p>
Sudden she sunk beneath the weighty woes,<br/>
The vital streams a chilling horror froze;<br/>
The big round tear stands trembling in her eye,<br/>
And on her tongue imperfect accents die.<br/>
At length in tender language interwove<br/>
With sighs, she thus expressed her anxious love;<br/>
"Why rarely would my son his fate explore,<br/>
Ride the wild waves, and quit the safer shore?<br/>
Did he with all the greatly wretched, crave<br/>
A blank oblivion, and untimely grave?"
</p>
<p>
"Tis not (replied the sage) to Medon given<br/>
To know, if some inhabitant of heaven<br/>
In his young breast the daring thought inspired<br/>
Or if, alone with filial duty fired,<br/>
The winds and waves he tempts in early bloom,<br/>
Studious to learn his absent father's doom."
</p>
<p>
The sage retired: unable to control<br/>
The mighty griefs that swell her labouring soul<br/>
Rolling convulsive on the floor is seen<br/>
The piteous object of a prostrate queen.<br/>
Words to her dumb complaint a pause supplies,<br/>
And breath, to waste in unavailing cries.<br/>
Around their sovereign wept the menial fair,<br/>
To whom she thus address'd her deep despair:
</p>
<p>
"Behold a wretch whom all the gods consign<br/>
To woe! Did ever sorrows equal mine?<br/>
Long to my joys my dearest lord is lost,<br/>
His country's buckler, and the Grecian boast;<br/>
Now from my fond embrace, by tempests torn,<br/>
Our other column of the state is borne;<br/>
Nor took a kind adieu, nor sought consent!&mdash;<br/>
Unkind confederates in his dire intent!<br/>
Ill suits it with your shows of duteous zeal,<br/>
From me the purposed voyage to conceal;<br/>
Though at the solemn midnight hour he rose,<br/>
Why did you fear to trouble my repose?<br/>
He either had obey'd my fond desire,<br/>
Or seen his mother pierced with grief expire.<br/>
Bid Dolius quick attend, the faithful slave<br/>
Whom to my nuptial train Icarius gave<br/>
To tend the fruit groves: with incessant speed<br/>
He shall this violence of death decreed<br/>
To good Laertes tell. Experienced age<br/>
May timely intercept the ruffian rage.<br/>
Convene the tribes the murderous plot reveal,<br/>
And to their power to save his race appeal."
</p>
<p>
Then Euryclea thus: "My dearest dread;<br/>
Though to the sword I bow this hoary head,<br/>
Or if a dungeon be the pain decreed,<br/>
I own me conscious of the unpleasing deed;<br/>
Auxiliar to his flight, my aid implored,<br/>
With wine and viands I the vessel stored;<br/>
A solemn oath, imposed, the secret seal'd,<br/>
Till the twelfth dawn the light of day reveal'd.<br/>
Dreading the effect of a fond mother's fear,<br/>
He dared not violate your royal ear.<br/>
But bathe, and, in imperial robes array'd,<br/>
Pay due devotions to the martial maid,<br/>
And rest affianced in her guardian aid.<br/>
Send not to good Laertes, nor engage<br/>
In toils of state the miseries of age:<br/>
Tis impious to surmise the powers divine<br/>
To ruin doom the Jove-descended line;<br/>
Long shall the race of just Arcesius reign,<br/>
And isles remote enlarge his old domain."
</p>
<p>
The queen her speech with calm attention hears,<br/>
Her eyes restrain the silver-streaming tears:<br/>
She bathes, and robed, the sacred dome ascends;<br/>
Her pious speed a female train attends:<br/>
The salted cakes in canisters are laid,<br/>
And thus the queen invokes Minerva's aid;
</p>
<p>
"Daughter divine of Jove, whose arm can wield<br/>
The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield<br/>
If e'er Ulysses to thy fane preferr'd<br/>
The best and choicest of his flock and herd;<br/>
Hear, goddess, hear, by those oblations won;<br/>
And for the pious sire preserve the son;<br/>
His wish'd return with happy power befriend,<br/>
And on the suitors let thy wrath descend."
</p>
<p>
She ceased; shrill ecstasies of joy declare<br/>
The favouring goddess present to the prayer;<br/>
The suitors heard, and deem'd the mirthful voice<br/>
A signal of her hymeneal choice;<br/>
Whilst one most jovial thus accosts the board:
</p>
<p>
"Too late the queen selects a second lord;<br/>
In evil hour the nuptial rite intends,<br/>
When o'er her son disastrous death impends."<br/>
Thus he, unskill'd of what the fates provide!<br/>
But with severe rebuke Antinous cried:
</p>
<p>
"These empty vaunts will make the voyage vain:<br/>
Alarm not with discourse the menial train:<br/>
The great event with silent hope attend,<br/>
Our deeds alone our counsel must commend."<br/>
His speech thus ended short, he frowning rose,<br/>
And twenty chiefs renowned for valour chose;<br/>
Down to the strand he speeds with haughty strides,<br/>
Where anchor'd in the bay the vessel rides,<br/>
Replete with mail and military store,<br/>
In all her tackle trim to quit the shore.<br/>
The desperate crew ascend, unfurl the sails<br/>
(The seaward prow invites the tardy gales);<br/>
Then take repast till Hesperus display'd<br/>
His golden circlet, in the western shade.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the queen, without reflection due,<br/>
Heart-wounded, to the bed of state withdrew:<br/>
In her sad breast the prince's fortunes roll,<br/>
And hope and doubt alternate seize her soul.<br/>
So when the woodman's toil her cave surrounds,<br/>
And with the hunter's cry the grove resounds,<br/>
With grief and rage the mother-lion stung,<br/>
Fearless herself, yet trembles for her young,<br/>
While pensive in the silent slumberous shade,<br/>
Sleep's gentle powers her drooping eyes invade;<br/>
Minerva, life-like, on embodied air<br/>
Impress'd the form of Iphthima the fair;<br/>
(Icarius' daughter she, whose blooming charms<br/>
Allured Eumelus to her virgin arms;<br/>
A sceptred lord, who o'er the fruitful plain<br/>
Of Thessaly wide stretched his ample reign:)<br/>
As Pallas will'd, along the sable skies,<br/>
To calm the queen, the phantom sister flies.<br/>
Swift on the regal dome, descending right,<br/>
The bolted valves are pervious to her flight.<br/>
Close to her head the pleasing vision stands,<br/>
And thus performs Minerva's high commands
</p>
<p>
"O why, Penelope, this causeless fear,<br/>
To render sleep's soft blessing unsincere?<br/>
Alike devote to sorrow's dire extreme<br/>
The day-reflection, and the midnight-dream!<br/>
Thy son the gods propitious will restore,<br/>
And bid thee cease his absence to deplore."
</p>
<p>
To whom the queen (whilst yet in pensive mind<br/>
Was in the silent gates of sleep confined):<br/>
"O sister to my soul forever dear,<br/>
Why this first visit to reprove my fear?<br/>
How in a realm so distant should you know<br/>
From what deep source my ceaseless sorrows flow?<br/>
To all my hope my royal lord is lost,<br/>
His country's buckler, and the Grecian boast;<br/>
And with consummate woe to weigh me down,<br/>
The heir of all his honours and his crown,<br/>
My darling son is fled! an easy prey<br/>
To the fierce storms, or men more fierce than they;<br/>
Who, in a league of blood associates sworn,<br/>
Will intercept the unwary youth's return."
</p>
<p>
"Courage resume (the shadowy form replied);<br/>
In the protecting care of Heaven confide;<br/>
On him attends the blue eyed martial maid:<br/>
What earthly can implore a surer aid?<br/>
Me now the guardian goddess deigns to send,<br/>
To bid thee patient his return attend."
</p>
<p>
The queen replies: "If in the blest abodes,<br/>
A goddess, thou hast commerce with the gods;<br/>
Say, breathes my lord the blissful realm of light,<br/>
Or lies he wrapp'd in ever-during night?"
</p>
<p>
"Inquire not of his doom, (the phantom cries,)<br/>
I speak not all the counsel of the skies;<br/>
Nor must indulge with vain discourse, or long,<br/>
The windy satisfaction of the tongue."
</p>
<p>
Swift through the valves the visionary fair<br/>
Repass'd, and viewless mix'd with common air.<br/>
The queen awakes, deliver'd of her woes;<br/>
With florid joy her heart dilating glows:<br/>
The vision, manifest of future fate,<br/>
Makes her with hope her son's arrival wait.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the suitors plough the watery plain,<br/>
Telemachus in thought already slain!<br/>
When sight of lessening Ithaca was lost<br/>
Their sail directed for the Samian coast<br/>
A small but verdant isle appear'd in view,<br/>
And Asteris the advancing pilot knew;<br/>
An ample port the rocks projected form,<br/>
To break the rolling waves and ruffling storm:<br/>
That safe recess they gain with happy speed,<br/>
And in close ambush wait the murderous deed.

<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XVI</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
So warr'd both armies on the ensanguined shore,<br/>
While the black vessels smoked with human gore.<br/>
Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;<br/>
The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes.<br/>
Not faster, trickling to the plains below,<br/>
From the tall rock the sable waters flow.<br/>
Divine Pelides, with compassion moved.<br/>
Thus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears,<br/>
That flows so fast in these unmanly tears?<br/>
No girl, no infant whom the mother keeps<br/>
From her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps;<br/>
Not more the mother's soul, that infant warms,<br/>
Clung to her knees, and reaching at her arms,<br/>
Than thou hast mine! Oh tell me, to what end<br/>
Thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Griev'st thou for me, or for my martial band?<br/>
Or come sad tidings from our native land?<br/>
Our fathers live (our first, most tender care),<br/>
Thy good Menoetius breathes the vital air,<br/>
And hoary Peleus yet extends his days;<br/>
Pleased in their age to hear their children's praise.<br/>
Or may some meaner cause thy pity claim?<br/>
Perhaps yon relics of the Grecian name,<br/>
Doom'd in their ships to sink by fire and sword,<br/>
And pay the forfeit of their haughty lord?<br/>
Whate'er the cause, reveal thy secret care,<br/>
And speak those sorrows which a friend would share."<br/>
A sigh that instant from his bosom broke,<br/>
Another follow'd, and Patroclus spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Let Greece at length with pity touch thy breast,<br/>
Thyself a Greek; and, once, of Greeks the best!<br/>
Lo! every chief that might her fate prevent,<br/>
Lies pierced with wounds, and bleeding in his tent:<br/>
Eurypylus, Tydides, Atreus' son,<br/>
And wise Ulysses, at the navy groan,<br/>
More for their country's wounds than for their own.<br/>
Their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease,<br/>
Thy breast alone no lenitives appease.<br/>
May never rage like thine my soul enslave,<br/>
O great in vain! unprofitably brave!<br/>
Thy country slighted in her last distress,<br/>
What friend, what man, from thee shall hope redress?<br/>
No—men unborn, and ages yet behind,<br/>
Shall curse that fierce, that unforgiving mind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O man unpitying! if of man thy race;<br/>
But sure thou spring'st not from a soft embrace,<br/>
Nor ever amorous hero caused thy birth,<br/>
Nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth:<br/>
Some rugged rock's hard entrails gave thee form,<br/>
And raging seas produced thee in a storm,<br/>
A soul well suiting that tempestuous kind,<br/>
So rough thy manners, so untamed thy mind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"If some dire oracle thy breast alarm,<br/>
If aught from Jove, or Thetis, stop thy arm,<br/>
Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,<br/>
If I but lead the Myrmidonian line:<br/>
Clad in thy dreadful arms if I appear,<br/>
Proud Troy shall tremble, and desert the war;<br/>
Without thy person Greece shall win the day,<br/>
And thy mere image chase her foes away.<br/>
Press'd by fresh forces, her o'erlabour'd train<br/>
Shall quit the ships, and Greece respire again."<br/>
Thus, blind to fate! with supplicating breath,<br/>
Thou begg'st his arms, and in his arms thy death.<br/>
Unfortunately good! a boding sigh<br/>
Thy friend return'd; and with it, this reply:<br/>
"Patroclus! thy Achilles knows no fears;<br/>
Nor words from Jove nor oracles he hears;<br/>
Nor aught a mother's caution can suggest;<br/>
The tyrant's pride lies rooted in my breast.<br/>
My wrongs, my wrongs, my constant thought engage,<br/>
Those, my sole oracles, inspire my rage:<br/>
I made him tyrant: gave him power to wrong<br/>
Even me: I felt it; and shall feel it long.<br/>
The maid, my black-eyed maid, he forced away,<br/>
Due to the toils of many a well-fought day;<br/>
Due to my conquest of her father's reign;<br/>
Due to the votes of all the Grecian train.<br/>
From me he forced her; me, the bold and brave,<br/>
Disgraced, dishonour'd, like the meanest slave.<br/>
But bear we this—the wrongs I grieve are past;<br/>
'Tis time our fury should relent at last:<br/>
I fix'd its date; the day I wish'd appears:<br/>
How Hector to my ships his battle bears,<br/>
The flames my eyes, the shouts invade my ears.<br/>
Go then, Patroclus! court fair honour's charms<br/>
In Troy's famed fields, and in Achilles' arms:<br/>
Lead forth my martial Myrmidons to fight,<br/>
Go save the fleets, and conquer in my right.<br/>
See the thin relics of their baffled band<br/>
At the last edge of yon deserted land!<br/>
Behold all Ilion on their ships descends;<br/>
How the cloud blackens, how the storm impends!<br/>
It was not thus, when, at my sight amazed,<br/>
Troy saw and trembled, as this helmet blazed:<br/>
Had not the injurious king our friendship lost,<br/>
Yon ample trench had buried half her host.<br/>
No camps, no bulwarks now the Trojans fear,<br/>
Those are not dreadful, no Achilles there;<br/>
No longer flames the lance of Tydeus' son;<br/>
No more your general calls his heroes on:<br/>
Hector, alone, I hear; his dreadful breath<br/>
Commands your slaughter, or proclaims your death.<br/>
Yet now, Patroclus, issue to the plain:<br/>
Now save the ships, the rising fires restrain,<br/>
And give the Greeks to visit Greece again.<br/>
But heed my words, and mark a friend's command,<br/>
Who trusts his fame and honours in thy hand,<br/>
And from thy deeds expects the Achaian host<br/>
Shall render back the beauteous maid he lost:<br/>
Rage uncontroll'd through all the hostile crew,<br/>
But touch not Hector, Hector is my due.<br/>
Though Jove in thunder should command the war,<br/>
Be just, consult my glory, and forbear.<br/>
The fleet once saved, desist from further chase,<br/>
Nor lead to Ilion's walls the Grecian race;<br/>
Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy;<br/>
Some god, like Phoebus, ever kind to Troy.<br/>
Let Greece, redeem'd from this destructive strait,<br/>
Do her own work; and leave the rest to fate.<br/>
O! would to all the immortal powers above,<br/>
Apollo, Pallas, and almighty Jove!<br/>
That not one Trojan might be left alive,<br/>
And not a Greek of all the race survive:<br/>
Might only we the vast destruction shun,<br/>
And only we destroy the accursed town!"<br/>
Such conference held the chiefs; while on the strand<br/>
Great Jove with conquest crown'd the Trojan band.<br/>
Ajax no more the sounding storm sustain'd,<br/>
So thick the darts an iron tempest rain'd:<br/>
On his tired arm the weighty buckler hung;<br/>
His hollow helm with falling javelins rung;<br/>
His breath, in quick short pantings, comes and goes;<br/>
And painful sweat from all his members flows.<br/>
Spent and o'erpower'd, he barely breathes at most;<br/>
Yet scarce an army stirs him from his post;<br/>
Dangers on dangers all around him glow,<br/>
And toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Say, Muses, throned above the starry frame,<br/>
How first the navy blazed with Trojan flame?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Stern Hector waved his sword, and standing near,<br/>
Where furious Ajax plied his ashen spear,<br/>
Full on the lance a stroke so justly sped,<br/>
That the broad falchion lopp'd its brazen head;<br/>
His pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain;<br/>
The brazen head falls sounding on the plain.<br/>
Great Ajax saw, and own'd the hand divine;<br/>
Confessing Jove, and trembling at the sign,<br/>
Warn'd he retreats. Then swift from all sides pour<br/>
The hissing brands; thick streams the fiery shower;<br/>
O'er the high stern the curling volumes rise,<br/>
And sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Divine Achilles view'd the rising flames,<br/>
And smote his thigh, and thus aloud exclaims:<br/>
"Arm, arm, Patroclus! Lo, the blaze aspires!<br/>
The glowing ocean reddens with the fires.<br/>
Arm, ere our vessels catch the spreading flame;<br/>
Arm, ere the Grecians be no more a name;<br/>
I haste to bring the troops."—The hero said;<br/>
The friend with ardour and with joy obey'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He cased his limbs in brass; and first around<br/>
His manly legs, with silver buckles bound<br/>
The clasping greaves; then to his breast applies<br/>
The flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes;<br/>
Emblazed with studs of gold his falchion shone<br/>
In the rich belt, as in a starry zone:<br/>
Achilles' shield his ample shoulders spread,<br/>
Achilles' helmet nodded o'er his head:<br/>
Adorn'd in all his terrible array,<br/>
He flash'd around intolerable day.<br/>
Alone untouch'd, Pelides' javelin stands,<br/>
Not to be poised but by Pelides' hands:<br/>
From Pelion's shady brow the plant entire<br/>
Old Chiron rent, and shaped it for his sire;<br/>
Whose son's great arm alone the weapon wields,<br/>
The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The brave Automedon (an honour'd name,<br/>
The second to his lord in love and fame,<br/>
In peace his friend, and partner of the war)<br/>
The winged coursers harness'd to the car;<br/>
Xanthus and Balius, of immortal breed,<br/>
Sprung from the wind, and like the wind in speed.<br/>
Whom the wing'd harpy, swift Podarge, bore,<br/>
By Zephyr pregnant on the breezy shore:<br/>
Swift Pedasus was added to their side,<br/>
(Once great Aetion's, now Achilles' pride)<br/>
Who, like in strength, in swiftness, and in grace,<br/>
A mortal courser match'd the immortal race.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Achilles speeds from tent to tent, and warms<br/>
His hardy Myrmidons to blood and arms.<br/>
All breathing death, around the chief they stand,<br/>
A grim, terrific, formidable band:<br/>
Grim as voracious wolves, that seek the springs<br/>
When scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings;<br/>
When some tall stag, fresh-slaughtered in the wood,<br/>
Has drench'd their wide insatiate throats with blood,<br/>
To the black fount they rush, a hideous throng,<br/>
With paunch distended, and with lolling tongue,<br/>
Fire fills their eye, their black jaws belch the gore,<br/>
And gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more.<br/>
Like furious, rush'd the Myrmidonian crew,<br/>
Such their dread strength, and such their deathful view.<br/>
</p>
<p>
High in the midst the great Achilles stands,<br/>
Directs their order, and the war commands.<br/>
He, loved of Jove, had launch'd for Ilion's shores<br/>
Full fifty vessels, mann'd with fifty oars:<br/>
Five chosen leaders the fierce bands obey,<br/>
Himself supreme in valour, as in sway.<br/>
</p>
<p>
First march'd Menestheus, of celestial birth,<br/>
Derived from thee, whose waters wash the earth,<br/>
Divine Sperchius! Jove-descended flood!<br/>
A mortal mother mixing with a god.<br/>
Such was Menestheus, but miscall'd by fame<br/>
The son of Borus, that espoused the dame.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Eudorus next; whom Polymele the gay,<br/>
Famed in the graceful dance, produced to-day.<br/>
Her, sly Cellenius loved: on her would gaze,<br/>
As with swift step she form'd the running maze:<br/>
To her high chamber from Diana's quire,<br/>
The god pursued her, urged, and crown'd his fire.<br/>
The son confess'd his father's heavenly race,<br/>
And heir'd his mother's swiftness in the chase.<br/>
Strong Echecleus, bless'd in all those charms<br/>
That pleased a god, succeeded to her arms;<br/>
Not conscious of those loves, long hid from fame,<br/>
With gifts of price he sought and won the dame;<br/>
Her secret offspring to her sire she bare;<br/>
Her sire caress'd him with a parent's care.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pisander follow'd; matchless in his art<br/>
To wing the spear, or aim the distant dart;<br/>
No hand so sure of all the Emathian line,<br/>
Or if a surer, great Patroclus! thine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The fourth by Phoenix' grave command was graced,<br/>
Laerces' valiant offspring led the last.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Soon as Achilles with superior care<br/>
Had call'd the chiefs, and order'd all the war,<br/>
This stern remembrance to his troops he gave:<br/>
"Ye far-famed Myrmidons, ye fierce and brave!<br/>
Think with what threats you dared the Trojan throng,<br/>
Think what reproach these ears endured so long;<br/>
‘Stern son of Peleus, (thus ye used to say,<br/>
While restless, raging, in your ships you lay)<br/>
Oh nursed with gall, unknowing how to yield;<br/>
Whose rage defrauds us of so famed a field:<br/>
If that dire fury must for ever burn,<br/>
What make we here? Return, ye chiefs, return!'<br/>
Such were your words—Now, warriors! grieve no more,<br/>
Lo there the Trojans; bathe your swords in gore!<br/>
This day shall give you all your soul demands,<br/>
Glut all your hearts, and weary all your hands!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus while he roused the fire in every breast,<br/>
Close and more close the listening cohorts press'd;<br/>
Ranks wedged in ranks; of arms a steely ring<br/>
Still grows, and spreads, and thickens round the king.<br/>
As when a circling wall the builder forms,<br/>
Of strength defensive against wind and storms,<br/>
Compacted stones the thickening work compose,<br/>
And round him wide the rising structure grows:<br/>
So helm to helm, and crest to crest they throng,<br/>
Shield urged on shield, and man drove man along;<br/>
Thick, undistinguish'd plumes, together join'd,<br/>
Float in one sea, and wave before the wind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Far o'er the rest in glittering pomp appear,<br/>
There bold Automedon, Patroclus here;<br/>
Brothers in arms, with equal fury fired;<br/>
Two friends, two bodies with one soul inspired.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But mindful of the gods, Achilles went<br/>
To the rich coffer in his shady tent;<br/>
There lay on heaps his various garments roll'd,<br/>
And costly furs, and carpets stiff with gold,<br/>
(The presents of the silver-footed dame)<br/>
From thence he took a bowl, of antique frame,<br/>
Which never man had stained with ruddy wine,<br/>
Nor raised in offerings to the power divine,<br/>
But Peleus' son; and Peleus' son to none<br/>
Had raised in offerings, but to Jove alone.<br/>
This tinged with sulphur, sacred first to flame,<br/>
He purged; and wash'd it in the running stream.<br/>
Then cleansed his hands; and fixing for a space<br/>
His eyes on heaven, his feet upon the place<br/>
Of sacrifice, the purple draught he pour'd<br/>
Forth in the midst; and thus the god implored:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O thou supreme! high-throned all height above!<br/>
O great Pelasgic, Dodonaean Jove!<br/>
Who 'midst surrounding frosts, and vapours chill,<br/>
Presid'st on bleak Dodona's vocal hill:<br/>
(Whose groves the Selli, race austere! surround,<br/>
Their feet unwash'd, their slumbers on the ground;<br/>
Who hear, from rustling oaks, thy dark decrees;<br/>
And catch the fates, low-whispered in the breeze;)<br/>
Hear, as of old! Thou gav'st, at Thetis' prayer,<br/>
Glory to me, and to the Greeks despair.<br/>
Lo, to the dangers of the fighting field<br/>
The best, the dearest of my friends, I yield,<br/>
Though still determined, to my ships confined;<br/>
Patroclus gone, I stay but half behind.<br/>
Oh! be his guard thy providential care,<br/>
Confirm his heart, and string his arm to war:<br/>
Press'd by his single force let Hector see<br/>
His fame in arms not owing all to me.<br/>
But when the fleets are saved from foes and fire,<br/>
Let him with conquest and renown retire;<br/>
Preserve his arms, preserve his social train,<br/>
And safe return him to these eyes again!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Great Jove consents to half the chief's request,<br/>
But heaven's eternal doom denies the rest;<br/>
To free the fleet was granted to his prayer;<br/>
His safe return, the winds dispersed in air.<br/>
Back to his tent the stern Achilles flies,<br/>
And waits the combat with impatient eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the troops beneath Patroclus' care,<br/>
Invade the Trojans, and commence the war.<br/>
As wasps, provoked by children in their play,<br/>
Pour from their mansions by the broad highway,<br/>
In swarms the guiltless traveller engage,<br/>
Whet all their stings, and call forth all their rage:<br/>
All rise in arms, and, with a general cry,<br/>
Assert their waxen domes, and buzzing progeny.<br/>
Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms,<br/>
So loud their clamours, and so keen their arms:<br/>
Their rising rage Patroclus' breath inspires,<br/>
Who thus inflames them with heroic fires:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O warriors, partners of Achilles' praise!<br/>
Be mindful of your deeds in ancient days;<br/>
Your godlike master let your acts proclaim,<br/>
And add new glories to his mighty name.<br/>
Think your Achilles sees you fight: be brave,<br/>
And humble the proud monarch whom you save."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Joyful they heard, and kindling as he spoke,<br/>
Flew to the fleet, involved in fire and smoke.<br/>
From shore to shore the doubling shouts resound,<br/>
The hollow ships return a deeper sound.<br/>
The war stood still, and all around them gazed,<br/>
When great Achilles' shining armour blazed:<br/>
Troy saw, and thought the dread Achilles nigh,<br/>
At once they see, they tremble, and they fly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then first thy spear, divine Patroclus! flew,<br/>
Where the war raged, and where the tumult grew.<br/>
Close to the stern of that famed ship which bore<br/>
Unbless'd Protesilaus to Ilion's shore,<br/>
The great Paeonian, bold Pyrechmes stood;<br/>
(Who led his bands from Axius' winding flood;)<br/>
His shoulder-blade receives the fatal wound;<br/>
The groaning warrior pants upon the ground.<br/>
His troops, that see their country's glory slain,<br/>
Fly diverse, scatter'd o'er the distant plain.<br/>
Patroclus' arm forbids the spreading fires,<br/>
And from the half-burn'd ship proud Troy retires;<br/>
Clear'd from the smoke the joyful navy lies;<br/>
In heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies;<br/>
Triumphant Greece her rescued decks ascends,<br/>
And loud acclaim the starry region rends.<br/>
So when thick clouds enwrap the mountain's head,<br/>
O'er heaven's expanse like one black ceiling spread;<br/>
Sudden the Thunderer, with a flashing ray,<br/>
Bursts through the darkness, and lets down the day:<br/>
The hills shine out, the rocks in prospect rise,<br/>
And streams, and vales, and forests, strike the eyes;<br/>
The smiling scene wide opens to the sight,<br/>
And all the unmeasured ether flames with light.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But Troy repulsed, and scatter'd o'er the plains,<br/>
Forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains.<br/>
Now every Greek some hostile hero slew,<br/>
But still the foremost, bold Patroclus flew:<br/>
As Areilycus had turn'd him round,<br/>
Sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound;<br/>
The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown,<br/>
The thigh transfix'd, and broke the brittle bone:<br/>
Headlong he fell. Next, Thoas was thy chance;<br/>
Thy breast, unarm'd, received the Spartan lance.<br/>
Phylides' dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)<br/>
His blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,<br/>
Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;<br/>
In darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In equal arms two sons of Nestor stand,<br/>
And two bold brothers of the Lycian band:<br/>
By great Antilochus, Atymnius dies,<br/>
Pierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies,<br/>
Kind Maris, bleeding in his brother's wound,<br/>
Defends the breathless carcase on the ground;<br/>
Furious he flies, his murderer to engage:<br/>
But godlike Thrasimed prevents his rage,<br/>
Between his arm and shoulder aims a blow;<br/>
His arm falls spouting on the dust below:<br/>
He sinks, with endless darkness cover'd o'er:<br/>
And vents his soul, effused with gushing gore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,<br/>
Sarpedon's friends, Amisodarus' seed;<br/>
Amisodarus, who, by Furies led,<br/>
The bane of men, abhorr'd Chimaera bred;<br/>
Skill'd in the dart in vain, his sons expire,<br/>
And pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Stopp'd in the tumult Cleobulus lies,<br/>
Beneath Oileus' arm, a living prize;<br/>
A living prize not long the Trojan stood;<br/>
The thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood:<br/>
Plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies;<br/>
Black death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,<br/>
Lycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came;<br/>
In vain their javelins at each other flew,<br/>
Now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.<br/>
On the plumed crest of his Boeotian foe<br/>
The daring Lycon aim'd a noble blow;<br/>
The sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped<br/>
Full on the juncture of the neck and head:<br/>
The head, divided by a stroke so just,<br/>
Hung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O'ertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds,<br/>
Pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;<br/>
Back from the car he tumbles to the ground:<br/>
His swimming eyes eternal shades surround.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next Erymas was doom'd his fate to feel,<br/>
His open'd mouth received the Cretan steel:<br/>
Beneath the brain the point a passage tore,<br/>
Crash'd the thin bones, and drown'd the teeth in gore:<br/>
His mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood;<br/>
He sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As when the flocks neglected by the swain,<br/>
Or kids, or lambs, lie scatter'd o'er the plain,<br/>
A troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey,<br/>
And rend the trembling, unresisting prey:<br/>
Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came;<br/>
Troy fled, unmindful of her former fame.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But still at Hector godlike Ajax aim'd,<br/>
Still, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed.<br/>
The Trojan chief, experienced in the field,<br/>
O'er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield,<br/>
Observed the storm of darts the Grecians pour,<br/>
And on his buckler caught the ringing shower:<br/>
He sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise,<br/>
Yet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As when the hand of Jove a tempest forms,<br/>
And rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms,<br/>
Dark o'er the fields the ascending vapour flies,<br/>
And shades the sun, and blots the golden skies:<br/>
So from the ships, along the dusky plain,<br/>
Dire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train.<br/>
Even Hector fled; through heads of disarray<br/>
The fiery coursers forced their lord away:<br/>
While far behind his Trojans fall confused;<br/>
Wedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised:<br/>
Chariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes<br/>
Shock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.<br/>
In vain they labour up the steepy mound;<br/>
Their charioteers lie foaming on the ground.<br/>
Fierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies;<br/>
Tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies;<br/>
Thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight;<br/>
Clouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch'd from sight.<br/>
The affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down,<br/>
Scour o'er the fields, and stretch to reach the town.<br/>
Loud o'er the rout was heard the victor's cry,<br/>
Where the war bleeds, and where the thickest die,<br/>
Where horse and arms, and chariots lie o'erthrown,<br/>
And bleeding heroes under axles groan.<br/>
No stop, no check, the steeds of Peleus knew:<br/>
From bank to bank the immortal coursers flew.<br/>
High-bounding o'er the fosse, the whirling car<br/>
Smokes through the ranks, o'ertakes the flying war,<br/>
And thunders after Hector; Hector flies,<br/>
Patroclus shakes his lance; but fate denies.<br/>
Not with less noise, with less impetuous force,<br/>
The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course,<br/>
Than when in autumn Jove his fury pours,<br/>
And earth is loaden with incessant showers;<br/>
(When guilty mortals break the eternal laws,<br/>
Or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;)<br/>
From their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,<br/>
And opens all the flood-gates of the skies:<br/>
The impetuous torrents from their hills obey,<br/>
Whole fields are drown'd, and mountains swept away;<br/>
Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main;<br/>
And trembling man sees all his labours vain!<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now the chief (the foremost troops repell'd)<br/>
Back to the ships his destined progress held,<br/>
Bore down half Troy in his resistless way,<br/>
And forced the routed ranks to stand the day.<br/>
Between the space where silver Simois flows,<br/>
Where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose,<br/>
All grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands,<br/>
And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.<br/>
First Pronous died beneath his fiery dart,<br/>
Which pierced below the shield his valiant heart.<br/>
Thestor was next, who saw the chief appear,<br/>
And fell the victim of his coward fear;<br/>
Shrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye,<br/>
Nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly;<br/>
Patroclus mark'd him as he shunn'd the war,<br/>
And with unmanly tremblings shook the car,<br/>
And dropp'd the flowing reins. Him 'twixt the jaws,<br/>
The javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws.<br/>
As on a rock that overhangs the main,<br/>
An angler, studious of the line and cane,<br/>
Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore:<br/>
Not with less ease the barbed javelin bore<br/>
The gaping dastard; as the spear was shook,<br/>
He fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next on Eryalus he flies; a stone,<br/>
Large as a rock, was by his fury thrown:<br/>
Full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,<br/>
And burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:<br/>
Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell,<br/>
And death involved him with the shades of hell.<br/>
Then low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie;<br/>
Ipheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die;<br/>
Amphoterus and Erymas succeed;<br/>
And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.<br/>
Where'er he moves, the growing slaughters spread<br/>
In heaps on heaps a monument of dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld<br/>
Grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,<br/>
With this reproach his flying host he warms:<br/>
"Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!<br/>
Forsake, inglorious, the contended plain;<br/>
This hand unaided shall the war sustain:<br/>
The task be mine this hero's strength to try,<br/>
Who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:<br/>
Patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.<br/>
As when two vultures on the mountain's height<br/>
Stoop with resounding pinions to the fight;<br/>
They cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;<br/>
The desert echoes, and the rocks reply:<br/>
The warriors thus opposed in arms, engage<br/>
With equal clamours, and with equal rage.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Jove view'd the combat: whose event foreseen,<br/>
He thus bespoke his sister and his queen:<br/>
"The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,<br/>
My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:<br/>
Already on the verge of death he stands,<br/>
His life is owed to fierce Patroclus' hands,<br/>
What passions in a parent's breast debate!<br/>
Say, shall I snatch him from impending fate,<br/>
And send him safe to Lycia, distant far<br/>
From all the dangers and the toils of war;<br/>
Or to his doom my bravest offspring yield,<br/>
And fatten, with celestial blood, the field?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:<br/>
"What words are these, O sovereign of the skies!<br/>
Short is the date prescribed to mortal man;<br/>
Shall Jove for one extend the narrow span,<br/>
Whose bounds were fix'd before his race began?<br/>
How many sons of gods, foredoom'd to death,<br/>
Before proud Ilion must resign their breath!<br/>
Were thine exempt, debate would rise above,<br/>
And murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.<br/>
Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;<br/>
And when the ascending soul has wing'd her flight,<br/>
Let Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,<br/>
The breathless body to his native land.<br/>
His friends and people, to his future praise,<br/>
A marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,<br/>
And lasting honours to his ashes give;<br/>
His fame ('tis all the dead can have) shall live."<br/>
</p>
<p>
She said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,<br/>
Assents to fate, and ratifies the doom.<br/>
Then touch'd with grief, the weeping heavens distill'd<br/>
A shower of blood o'er all the fatal field:<br/>
The god, his eyes averting from the plain,<br/>
Laments his son, predestined to be slain,<br/>
Far from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign.<br/>
Now met in arms, the combatants appear;<br/>
Each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;<br/>
From strong Patroclus' hand the javelin fled,<br/>
And pass'd the groin of valiant Thrasymed;<br/>
The nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,<br/>
He falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.<br/>
Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw:<br/>
The first aloof with erring fury flew,<br/>
The next transpierced Achilles' mortal steed,<br/>
The generous Pedasus of Theban breed:<br/>
Fix'd in the shoulder's joint, he reel'd around,<br/>
Roll'd in the bloody dust, and paw'd the slippery ground.<br/>
His sudden fall the entangled harness broke;<br/>
Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook:<br/>
When bold Automedon, to disengage<br/>
The starting coursers, and restrain their rage,<br/>
Divides the traces with his sword, and freed<br/>
The encumbered chariot from the dying steed:<br/>
The rest move on, obedient to the rein:<br/>
The car rolls slowly o'er the dusty plain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:<br/>
And first Sarpedon whirl'd his weighty lance,<br/>
Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,<br/>
And spent in empty air its dying force.<br/>
Not so Patroclus' never-erring dart;<br/>
Aim'd at his breast it pierced a mortal part,<br/>
Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.<br/>
Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,<br/>
Or pine (fit mast for some great admiral)<br/>
Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound<br/>
It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,<br/>
Thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,<br/>
Before his chariot stretch'd his form divine:<br/>
He grasp'd the dust distain'd with streaming gore,<br/>
And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.<br/>
So lies a bull beneath the lion's paws,<br/>
While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws<br/>
The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;<br/>
Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then to the leader of the Lycian band<br/>
The dying chief address'd his last command;<br/>
"Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare<br/>
The glorious dangers of destructive war,<br/>
To lead my troops, to combat at their head,<br/>
Incite the living, and supply the dead.<br/>
Tell them, I charged them with my latest breath<br/>
Not unrevenged to bear Sarpedon's death.<br/>
What grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,<br/>
If these spoil'd arms adorn a Grecian foe!<br/>
Then as a friend, and as a warrior fight;<br/>
Defend my body, conquer in my right:<br/>
That, taught by great examples, all may try<br/>
Like thee to vanquish, or like me to die."<br/>
He ceased; the Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,<br/>
And his eyes darken'd with the shades of death.<br/>
The insulting victor with disdain bestrode<br/>
The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;<br/>
Then drew the weapon from his panting heart,<br/>
The reeking fibres clinging to the dart;<br/>
From the wide wound gush'd out a stream of blood,<br/>
And the soul issued in the purple flood.<br/>
His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,<br/>
Unguided now, their mighty master slain.<br/>
All-impotent of aid, transfix'd with grief,<br/>
Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:<br/>
His painful arm, yet useless with the smart<br/>
Inflicted late by Teucer's deadly dart,<br/>
Supported on his better hand he stay'd:<br/>
To Phoebus then ('twas all he could) he pray'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia's coast,<br/>
Or sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast,<br/>
Powerful alike to ease the wretch's smart;<br/>
O hear me! god of every healing art!<br/>
Lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,<br/>
That thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,<br/>
I stand unable to sustain the spear,<br/>
And sigh, at distance from the glorious war.<br/>
Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laid,<br/>
Nor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;<br/>
But thou, O god of health! thy succour lend,<br/>
To guard the relics of my slaughter'd friend:<br/>
For thou, though distant, canst restore my might,<br/>
To head my Lycians, and support the fight."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,<br/>
His heavenly hand restrain'd the flux of blood;<br/>
He drew the dolours from the wounded part,<br/>
And breathed a spirit in his rising heart.<br/>
Renew'd by art divine, the hero stands,<br/>
And owns the assistance of immortal hands.<br/>
First to the fight his native troops he warms,<br/>
Then loudly calls on Troy's vindictive arms;<br/>
With ample strides he stalks from place to place;<br/>
Now fires Agenor, now Polydamas:<br/>
Æneas next, and Hector he accosts;<br/>
Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?<br/>
Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!<br/>
Those generous friends, who, from their country far,<br/>
Breathe their brave souls out in another's war.<br/>
See! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies,<br/>
In action valiant, and in council wise,<br/>
Who guarded right, and kept his people free;<br/>
To all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee!<br/>
Stretch'd by Patroclus' arm on yonder plains,<br/>
O save from hostile rage his loved remains!<br/>
Ah let not Greece his conquer'd trophies boast,<br/>
Nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke: each leader in his grief partook:<br/>
Troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.<br/>
Transfix'd with deep regret, they view o'erthrown<br/>
At once his country's pillar, and their own;<br/>
A chief, who led to Troy's beleaguer'd wall<br/>
A host of heroes, and outshined them all.<br/>
Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,<br/>
And with superior vengeance greatly glows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But o'er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,<br/>
And rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Heroes, be men; be what you were before;<br/>
Or weigh the great occasion, and be more.<br/>
The chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,<br/>
Lies pale in death, extended on the field.<br/>
To guard his body Troy in numbers flies;<br/>
'Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.<br/>
Haste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,<br/>
And send the living Lycians to the dead."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The heroes kindle at his fierce command;<br/>
The martial squadrons close on either hand:<br/>
Here Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms,<br/>
Thessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms.<br/>
With horrid shouts they circle round the slain;<br/>
The clash of armour rings o'er all the plain.<br/>
Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,<br/>
O'er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,<br/>
And round his son confounds the warring hosts,<br/>
His fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls;<br/>
Agacleus' son, from Budium's lofty walls;<br/>
Who chased for murder thence a suppliant came<br/>
To Peleus, and the silver-footed dame;<br/>
Now sent to Troy, Achilles' arms to aid,<br/>
He pays due vengeance to his kinsman's shade.<br/>
Soon as his luckless hand had touch'd the dead,<br/>
A rock's large fragment thunder'd on his head;<br/>
Hurl'd by Hectorean force it cleft in twain<br/>
His shatter'd helm, and stretch'd him o'er the slain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came,<br/>
And, like an eagle darting at his game,<br/>
Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band.<br/>
What grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,<br/>
O generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown,<br/>
At Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,<br/>
Which sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near<br/>
That arm, drew back; and Hector learn'd to fear.<br/>
Far as an able hand a lance can throw,<br/>
Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe;<br/>
So far the Trojans from their lines retired;<br/>
Till Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.<br/>
Then Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,<br/>
The only hope of Chalcon's trembling age;<br/>
Wide o'er the land was stretch'd his large domain,<br/>
With stately seats, and riches blest in vain:<br/>
Him, bold with youth, and eager to pursue<br/>
The flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew;<br/>
Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,<br/>
He fell, and falling made the fields resound.<br/>
The Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain;<br/>
With conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain,<br/>
And crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose;<br/>
An iron circle round the carcase grows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then brave Laogonus resign'd his breath,<br/>
Despatch'd by Merion to the shades of death:<br/>
On Ida's holy hill he made abode,<br/>
The priest of Jove, and honour'd like his god.<br/>
Between the jaw and ear the javelin went;<br/>
The soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.<br/>
His spear Æneas at the victor threw,<br/>
Who stooping forward from the death withdrew;<br/>
The lance hiss'd harmless o'er his covering shield,<br/>
And trembling struck, and rooted in the field;<br/>
There yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,<br/>
Sent by the great Æneas' arm in vain.<br/>
"Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries)<br/>
And skill'd in dancing to dispute the prize,<br/>
My spear, the destined passage had it found,<br/>
Had fix'd thy active vigour to the ground."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O valiant leader of the Dardan host!<br/>
(Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast)<br/>
Strong as you are, 'tis mortal force you trust,<br/>
An arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.<br/>
And if to this my lance thy fate be given,<br/>
Vain are thy vaunts; success is still from heaven:<br/>
This, instant, sends thee down to Pluto's coast;<br/>
Mine is the glory, his thy parting ghost."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O friend (Menoetius' son this answer gave)<br/>
With words to combat, ill befits the brave;<br/>
Not empty boasts the sons of Troy repel,<br/>
Your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell.<br/>
To speak, beseems the council; but to dare<br/>
In glorious action, is the task of war."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, Patroclus to the battle flies;<br/>
Great Merion follows, and new shouts arise:<br/>
Shields, helmets rattle, as the warriors close;<br/>
And thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows.<br/>
As through the shrilling vale, or mountain ground,<br/>
The labours of the woodman's axe resound;<br/>
Blows following blows are heard re-echoing wide,<br/>
While crackling forests fall on every side:<br/>
Thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms,<br/>
So fell the warriors, and so rung their arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now great Sarpedon on the sandy shore,<br/>
His heavenly form defaced with dust and gore,<br/>
And stuck with darts by warring heroes shed,<br/>
Lies undistinguish'd from the vulgar dead.<br/>
His long-disputed corse the chiefs enclose,<br/>
On every side the busy combat grows;<br/>
Thick as beneath some shepherd's thatch'd abode<br/>
(The pails high foaming with a milky flood)<br/>
The buzzing flies, a persevering train,<br/>
Incessant swarm, and chased return again.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Jove view'd the combat with a stern survey,<br/>
And eyes that flash'd intolerable day.<br/>
Fix'd on the field his sight, his breast debates<br/>
The vengeance due, and meditates the fates:<br/>
Whether to urge their prompt effect, and call<br/>
The force of Hector to Patroclus' fall,<br/>
This instant see his short-lived trophies won,<br/>
And stretch him breathless on his slaughter'd son;<br/>
Or yet, with many a soul's untimely flight,<br/>
Augment the fame and horror of the fight.<br/>
To crown Achilles' valiant friend with praise<br/>
At length he dooms; and, that his last of days<br/>
Shall set in glory, bids him drive the foe;<br/>
Nor unattended see the shades below.<br/>
Then Hector's mind he fills with dire dismay;<br/>
He mounts his car, and calls his hosts away;<br/>
Sunk with Troy's heavy fates, he sees decline<br/>
The scales of Jove, and pants with awe divine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled,<br/>
And left their monarch with the common dead:<br/>
Around, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall<br/>
Of carnage rises, as the heroes fall.<br/>
(So Jove decreed!) At length the Greeks obtain<br/>
The prize contested, and despoil the slain.<br/>
The radiant arms are by Patroclus borne;<br/>
Patroclus' ships the glorious spoils adorn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus to Phoebus, in the realms above,<br/>
Spoke from his throne the cloud-compelling Jove:<br/>
"Descend, my Phoebus! on the Phrygian plain,<br/>
And from the fight convey Sarpedon slain;<br/>
Then bathe his body in the crystal flood,<br/>
With dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with blood;<br/>
O'er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed,<br/>
And with celestial robes adorn the dead.<br/>
Those rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath<br/>
To the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death.<br/>
They to his friends the immortal charge shall bear;<br/>
His friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear:<br/>
What honour mortals after death receive,<br/>
Those unavailing honours we may give!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Apollo bows, and from mount Ida's height,<br/>
Swift to the field precipitates his flight;<br/>
Thence from the war the breathless hero bore,<br/>
Veil'd in a cloud, to silver Simois' shore;<br/>
There bathed his honourable wounds, and dress'd<br/>
His manly members in the immortal vest;<br/>
And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews<br/>
Restores his freshness, and his form renews.<br/>
Then Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race,<br/>
Of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace,<br/>
Received Sarpedon, at the god's command,<br/>
And in a moment reach'd the Lycian land;<br/>
The corse amidst his weeping friends they laid,<br/>
Where endless honours wait the sacred shade.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains,<br/>
With foaming coursers, and with loosen'd reins.<br/>
Fierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew,<br/>
Ah blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew:<br/>
Against what fate and powerful Jove ordain,<br/>
Vain was thy friend's command, thy courage vain.<br/>
For he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll'd<br/>
Dismay the mighty, and confound the bold;<br/>
The god who gives, resumes, and orders all,<br/>
He urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Who first, brave hero! by that arm was slain,<br/>
Who last beneath thy vengeance press'd the plain;<br/>
When heaven itself thy fatal fury led,<br/>
And call'd to fill the number of the dead?<br/>
Adrestus first; Autonous then succeeds;<br/>
Echeclus follows; next young Megas bleeds,<br/>
Epistor, Melanippus, bite the ground;<br/>
The slaughter, Elasus and Mulius crown'd:<br/>
Then sunk Pylartes to eternal night;<br/>
The rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now Troy had stoop'd beneath his matchless power,<br/>
But flaming Phoebus kept the sacred tower.<br/>
Thrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;<br/>
His blazing aegis thrice Apollo shook;<br/>
He tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud,<br/>
A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall<br/>
Defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;<br/>
Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,<br/>
Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles' hand."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;<br/>
The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.<br/>
While Hector, checking at the Scaean gates<br/>
His panting coursers, in his breast debates,<br/>
Or in the field his forces to employ,<br/>
Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.<br/>
Thus while he thought, beside him Phoebus stood,<br/>
In Asius' shape, who reigned by Sangar's flood;<br/>
(Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,<br/>
A valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)<br/>
Thus he accosts him. "What a shameful sight!<br/>
God! is it Hector that forbears the fight?<br/>
Were thine my vigour this successful spear<br/>
Should soon convince thee of so false a fear.<br/>
Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,<br/>
And in Patroclus' blood efface thy shame.<br/>
Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,<br/>
And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,<br/>
And plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.<br/>
He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;<br/>
The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.<br/>
The god the Grecians' sinking souls depress'd,<br/>
And pour'd swift spirits through each Trojan breast.<br/>
Patroclus lights, impatient for the fight;<br/>
A spear his left, a stone employs his right:<br/>
With all his nerves he drives it at the foe.<br/>
Pointed above, and rough and gross below:<br/>
The falling ruin crush'd Cebrion's head,<br/>
The lawless offspring of king Priam's bed;<br/>
His front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish'd wound:<br/>
The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.<br/>
The charioteer, while yet he held the rein,<br/>
Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.<br/>
To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,<br/>
While the proud victor thus his fall derides.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!<br/>
What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!<br/>
Mark with what ease they sink into the sand!<br/>
Pity that all their practice is by land!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,<br/>
To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:<br/>
Swift as a lion, terrible and bold,<br/>
That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;<br/>
Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,<br/>
And from his fatal courage finds his bane.<br/>
At once bold Hector leaping from his car,<br/>
Defends the body, and provokes the war.<br/>
Thus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage,<br/>
Two lordly rulers of the wood engage;<br/>
Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,<br/>
And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.<br/>
Stern Hector fastens on the warrior's head,<br/>
And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:<br/>
While all around, confusion, rage, and fright,<br/>
Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.<br/>
So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud<br/>
In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;<br/>
Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,<br/>
The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;<br/>
This way and that, the rattling thicket bends,<br/>
And the whole forest in one crash descends.<br/>
Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,<br/>
In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.<br/>
Darts shower'd on darts, now round the carcase ring;<br/>
Now flights of arrows bounding from the string:<br/>
Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,<br/>
Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.<br/>
But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,<br/>
Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,<br/>
And, stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven<br/>
His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;<br/>
While on each host with equal tempests fell<br/>
The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.<br/>
But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,<br/>
Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train.<br/>
Then from amidst the tumult and alarms,<br/>
They draw the conquer'd corse and radiant arms.<br/>
Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows,<br/>
And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.<br/>
Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,<br/>
And thrice three heroes at each onset slew.<br/>
There ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine<br/>
The last, black remnant of so bright a line:<br/>
Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;<br/>
Death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!<br/>
</p>
<p>
For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,<br/>
Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind.<br/>
The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;<br/>
His eyes flash sparkles, his stunn'd senses reel<br/>
In giddy darkness; far to distance flung,<br/>
His bounding helmet on the champaign rung.<br/>
Achilles' plume is stain'd with dust and gore;<br/>
That plume which never stoop'd to earth before;<br/>
Long used, untouch'd, in fighting fields to shine,<br/>
And shade the temples of the mad divine.<br/>
Jove dooms it now on Hector's helm to nod;<br/>
Not long—for fate pursues him, and the god.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His spear in shivers falls; his ample shield<br/>
Drops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:<br/>
The corslet his astonish'd breast forsakes:<br/>
Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;<br/>
Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:<br/>
Such is the force of more than mortal hands!<br/>
</p>
<p>
A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,<br/>
From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;<br/>
Famed for the manage of the foaming horse,<br/>
Skill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course:<br/>
Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,<br/>
While yet he learn'd his rudiments of war.<br/>
His venturous spear first drew the hero's gore;<br/>
He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.<br/>
Nor, though disarm'd, Patroclus' fury stood:<br/>
But swift withdrew the long-protended wood.<br/>
And turn'd him short, and herded in the crowd.<br/>
Thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,<br/>
Wounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,<br/>
Retires for succour to his social train,<br/>
And flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.<br/>
Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,<br/>
Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:<br/>
The lance arrests him with a mortal wound;<br/>
He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.<br/>
With him all Greece was sunk; that moment all<br/>
Her yet-surviving heroes seem'd to fall.<br/>
So, scorch'd with heat, along the desert score,<br/>
The roaming lion meets a bristly boar,<br/>
Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,<br/>
With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear'd with blood;<br/>
At length the sovereign savage wins the strife;<br/>
And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.<br/>
Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown,<br/>
So many lives effused, expires his own.<br/>
As dying now at Hector's feet he lies,<br/>
He sternly views him, and triumphant cries:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy<br/>
Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy;<br/>
The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames,<br/>
And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.<br/>
Unthinking man! I fought those towers to free,<br/>
And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:<br/>
But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;<br/>
Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid;<br/>
Though much at parting that great chief might say,<br/>
And much enjoin thee, this important day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
‘Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),<br/>
Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.'<br/>
He spoke, Patroclus march'd, and thus he sped."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,<br/>
With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!<br/>
Jove's and Apollo's is this deed, not thine;<br/>
To heaven is owed whate'er your own you call,<br/>
And heaven itself disarm'd me ere my fall.<br/>
Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,<br/>
Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight:<br/>
By fate and Phoebus was I first o'erthrown,<br/>
Euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.<br/>
But thou, imperious! hear my latest breath;<br/>
The gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death:<br/>
Insulting man, thou shalt be soon as I;<br/>
Black fate o'erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;<br/>
Even now on life's last verge I see thee stand,<br/>
I see thee fall, and by Achilles' hand."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He faints: the soul unwilling wings her way,<br/>
(The beauteous body left a load of clay)<br/>
Flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast;<br/>
A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Hector pausing, as his eyes he fed<br/>
On the pale carcase, thus address'd the dead:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"From whence this boding speech, the stern decree<br/>
Of death denounced, or why denounced to me?<br/>
Why not as well Achilles' fate be given<br/>
To Hector's lance? Who knows the will of heaven?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pensive he said; then pressing as he lay<br/>
His breathless bosom, tore the lance away;<br/>
And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spear<br/>
He shakes, and charges the bold charioteer.<br/>
But swift Automedon with loosen'd reins<br/>
Rapt in the chariot o'er the distant plains,<br/>
Far from his rage the immortal coursers drove;<br/>
The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove.<br/>

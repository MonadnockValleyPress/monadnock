<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book VIII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Aurora now, fair daughter of the dawn,<br/>
Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn;<br/>
When Jove convened the senate of the skies,<br/>
Where high Olympus' cloudy tops arise,<br/>
The sire of gods his awful silence broke;<br/>
The heavens attentive trembled as he spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Celestial states! immortal gods! give ear,<br/>
Hear our decree, and reverence what ye hear;<br/>
The fix'd decree which not all heaven can move;<br/>
Thou, fate! fulfil it! and, ye powers, approve!<br/>
What god but enters yon forbidden field,<br/>
Who yields assistance, or but wills to yield,<br/>
Back to the skies with shame he shall be driven,<br/>
Gash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven;<br/>
Or far, oh far, from steep Olympus thrown,<br/>
Low in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan,<br/>
With burning chains fix'd to the brazen floors,<br/>
And lock'd by hell's inexorable doors;<br/>
As deep beneath the infernal centre hurl'd,<br/>
As from that centre to the ethereal world.<br/>
Let him who tempts me, dread those dire abodes:<br/>
And know, the Almighty is the god of gods.<br/>
League all your forces, then, ye powers above,<br/>
Join all, and try the omnipotence of Jove.<br/>
Let down our golden everlasting chain<br/>
Whose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and main<br/>
Strive all, of mortal and immortal birth,<br/>
To drag, by this, the Thunderer down to earth:<br/>
Ye strive in vain! if I but stretch this hand,<br/>
I heave the gods, the ocean, and the land;<br/>
I fix the chain to great Olympus' height,<br/>
And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!<br/>
For such I reign, unbounded and above;<br/>
And such are men, and gods, compared to Jove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The all-mighty spoke, nor durst the powers reply:<br/>
A reverend horror silenced all the sky;<br/>
Trembling they stood before their sovereign's look;<br/>
At length his best-beloved, the power of wisdom, spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O first and greatest! God, by gods adored<br/>
We own thy might, our father and our lord!<br/>
But, ah! permit to pity human state:<br/>
If not to help, at least lament their fate.<br/>
From fields forbidden we submiss refrain,<br/>
With arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain;<br/>
Yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move,<br/>
Or all must perish in the wrath of Jove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The cloud-compelling god her suit approved,<br/>
And smiled superior on his best beloved;<br/>
Then call'd his coursers, and his chariot took;<br/>
The stedfast firmament beneath them shook:<br/>
Rapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot roll'd;<br/>
Brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold:<br/>
Of heaven's undrossy gold the gods array,<br/>
Refulgent, flash'd intolerable day.<br/>
High on the throne he shines: his coursers fly<br/>
Between the extended earth and starry sky.<br/>
But when to Ida's topmost height he came,<br/>
(Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,)<br/>
Where o'er her pointed summits proudly raised,<br/>
His fane breathed odours, and his altar blazed:<br/>
There, from his radiant car, the sacred sire<br/>
Of gods and men released the steeds of fire:<br/>
Blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced;<br/>
High on the cloudy point his seat he placed;<br/>
Thence his broad eye the subject world surveys,<br/>
The town, and tents, and navigable seas.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now had the Grecians snatch'd a short repast,<br/>
And buckled on their shining arms with haste.<br/>
Troy roused as soon; for on this dreadful day<br/>
The fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay.<br/>
The gates unfolding pour forth all their train;<br/>
Squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain:<br/>
Men, steeds, and chariots shake the trembling ground,<br/>
The tumult thickens, and the skies resound;<br/>
And now with shouts the shocking armies closed,<br/>
To lances lances, shields to shields opposed,<br/>
Host against host with shadowy legends drew,<br/>
The sounding darts in iron tempests flew;<br/>
Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries,<br/>
Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise;<br/>
With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,<br/>
And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.<br/>
Long as the morning beams, increasing bright,<br/>
O'er heaven's clear azure spread the sacred light,<br/>
Commutual death the fate of war confounds,<br/>
Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.<br/>
But when the sun the height of heaven ascends,<br/>
The sire of gods his golden scales suspends,<br/>
With equal hand: in these explored the fate<br/>
Of Greece and Troy, and poised the mighty weight:<br/>
Press'd with its load, the Grecian balance lies<br/>
Low sunk on earth, the Trojan strikes the skies.<br/>
Then Jove from Ida's top his horrors spreads;<br/>
The clouds burst dreadful o'er the Grecian heads;<br/>
Thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls;<br/>
Their strength he withers, and unmans their souls.<br/>
Before his wrath the trembling hosts retire;<br/>
The gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.<br/>
Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear,<br/>
Nor each stern Ajax, thunderbolts of war:<br/>
Nor he, the king of war, the alarm sustain'd<br/>
Nestor alone, amidst the storm remain'd.<br/>
Unwilling he remain'd, for Paris' dart<br/>
Had pierced his courser in a mortal part;<br/>
Fix'd in the forehead, where the springing mane<br/>
Curl'd o'er the brow, it stung him to the brain;<br/>
Mad with his anguish, he begins to rear,<br/>
Paw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air.<br/>
Scarce had his falchion cut the reins, and freed<br/>
The encumber'd chariot from the dying steed,<br/>
When dreadful Hector, thundering through the war,<br/>
Pour'd to the tumult on his whirling car.<br/>
That day had stretch'd beneath his matchless hand<br/>
The hoary monarch of the Pylian band,<br/>
But Diomed beheld; from forth the crowd<br/>
He rush'd, and on Ulysses call'd aloud:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Whither, oh whither does Ulysses run?<br/>
Oh, flight unworthy great Laertes' son!<br/>
Mix'd with the vulgar shall thy fate be found,<br/>
Pierced in the back, a vile, dishonest wound?<br/>
Oh turn and save from Hector's direful rage<br/>
The glory of the Greeks, the Pylian sage."<br/>
His fruitless words are lost unheard in air,<br/>
Ulysses seeks the ships, and shelters there.<br/>
But bold Tydides to the rescue goes,<br/>
A single warrior midst a host of foes;<br/>
Before the coursers with a sudden spring<br/>
He leap'd, and anxious thus bespoke the king:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Great perils, father! wait the unequal fight;<br/>
These younger champions will oppress thy might.<br/>
Thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow,<br/>
Weak is thy servant, and thy coursers slow.<br/>
Then haste, ascend my seat, and from the car<br/>
Observe the steeds of Tros, renown'd in war.<br/>
Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,<br/>
To dare the fight, or urge the rapid race:<br/>
These late obey'd Ã†neas' guiding rein;<br/>
Leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train;<br/>
With these against yon Trojans will we go,<br/>
Nor shall great Hector want an equal foe;<br/>
Fierce as he is, even he may learn to fear<br/>
The thirsty fury of my flying spear."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus said the chief; and Nestor, skill'd in war,<br/>
Approves his counsel, and ascends the car:<br/>
The steeds he left, their trusty servants hold;<br/>
Eurymedon, and Sthenelus the bold:<br/>
The reverend charioteer directs the course,<br/>
And strains his aged arm to lash the horse.<br/>
Hector they face; unknowing how to fear,<br/>
Fierce he drove on; Tydides whirl'd his spear.<br/>
The spear with erring haste mistook its way,<br/>
But plunged in Eniopeus' bosom lay.<br/>
His opening hand in death forsakes the rein;<br/>
The steeds fly back: he falls, and spurns the plain.<br/>
Great Hector sorrows for his servant kill'd,<br/>
Yet unrevenged permits to press the field;<br/>
Till, to supply his place and rule the car,<br/>
Rose Archeptolemus, the fierce in war.<br/>
And now had death and horror cover'd all;<br/>
Like timorous flocks the Trojans in their wall<br/>
Inclosed had bled: but Jove with awful sound<br/>
Roll'd the big thunder o'er the vast profound:<br/>
Full in Tydides' face the lightning flew;<br/>
The ground before him flamed with sulphur blue;<br/>
The quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight;<br/>
And Nestor's trembling hand confess'd his fright:<br/>
He dropp'd the reins: and, shook with sacred dread,<br/>
Thus, turning, warn'd the intrepid Diomed:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O chief! too daring in thy friend's defence<br/>
Retire advised, and urge the chariot hence.<br/>
This day, averse, the sovereign of the skies<br/>
Assists great Hector, and our palm denies.<br/>
Some other sun may see the happier hour,<br/>
When Greece shall conquer by his heavenly power.<br/>
'Tis not in man his fix'd decree to move:<br/>
The great will glory to submit to Jove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O reverend prince! (Tydides thus replies)<br/>
Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.<br/>
But ah, what grief! should haughty Hector boast<br/>
I fled inglorious to the guarded coast.<br/>
Before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,<br/>
O'erwhelm me, earth; and hide a warrior's shame!"<br/>
To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:<br/>
"Gods! can thy courage fear the Phrygian's pride?<br/>
Hector may vaunt, but who shall heed the boast?<br/>
Not those who felt thy arm, the Dardan host,<br/>
Nor Troy, yet bleeding in her heroes lost;<br/>
Not even a Phrygian dame, who dreads the sword<br/>
That laid in dust her loved, lamented lord."<br/>
He said, and, hasty, o'er the gasping throng<br/>
Drives the swift steeds: the chariot smokes along;<br/>
The shouts of Trojans thicken in the wind;<br/>
The storm of hissing javelins pours behind.<br/>
Then with a voice that shakes the solid skies,<br/>
Pleased, Hector braves the warrior as he flies.<br/>
"Go, mighty hero! graced above the rest<br/>
In seats of council and the sumptuous feast:<br/>
Now hope no more those honours from thy train;<br/>
Go less than woman, in the form of man!<br/>
To scale our walls, to wrap our towers in flames,<br/>
To lead in exile the fair Phrygian dames,<br/>
Thy once proud hopes, presumptuous prince! are fled;<br/>
This arm shall reach thy heart, and stretch thee dead."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now fears dissuade him, and now hopes invite.<br/>
To stop his coursers, and to stand the fight;<br/>
Thrice turn'd the chief, and thrice imperial Jove<br/>
On Ida's summits thunder'd from above.<br/>
Great Hector heard; he saw the flashing light,<br/>
(The sign of conquest,) and thus urged the fight:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hear, every Trojan, Lycian, Dardan band,<br/>
All famed in war, and dreadful hand to hand.<br/>
Be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won,<br/>
Your great forefathers' glories, and your own.<br/>
Heard ye the voice of Jove? Success and fame<br/>
Await on Troy, on Greece eternal shame.<br/>
In vain they skulk behind their boasted wall,<br/>
Weak bulwarks; destined by this arm to fall.<br/>
High o'er their slighted trench our steeds shall bound,<br/>
And pass victorious o'er the levell'd mound.<br/>
Soon as before yon hollow ships we stand,<br/>
Fight each with flames, and toss the blazing brand;<br/>
Till, their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires,<br/>
All Greece, encompass'd, in one blaze expires."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Furious he said; then bending o'er the yoke,<br/>
Encouraged his proud steeds, while thus he spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Now, Xanthus, Ã†thon, Lampus, urge the chase,<br/>
And thou, Podargus! prove thy generous race;<br/>
Be fleet, be fearless, this important day,<br/>
And all your master's well-spent care repay.<br/>
For this, high-fed, in plenteous stalls ye stand,<br/>
Served with pure wheat, and by a princess' hand;<br/>
For this my spouse, of great Aetion's line,<br/>
So oft has steep'd the strengthening grain in wine.<br/>
Now swift pursue, now thunder uncontroll'd:<br/>
Give me to seize rich Nestor's shield of gold;<br/>
From Tydeus' shoulders strip the costly load,<br/>
Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god:<br/>
These if we gain, then victory, ye powers!<br/>
This night, this glorious night, the fleet is ours!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
That heard, deep anguish stung Saturnia's soul;<br/>
She shook her throne, that shook the starry pole:<br/>
And thus to Neptune: "Thou, whose force can make<br/>
The stedfast earth from her foundations shake,<br/>
Seest thou the Greeks by fates unjust oppress'd,<br/>
Nor swells thy heart in that immortal breast?<br/>
Yet Ã†gae, Helice, thy power obey,<br/>
And gifts unceasing on thine altars lay.<br/>
Would all the deities of Greece combine,<br/>
In vain the gloomy Thunderer might repine:<br/>
Sole should he sit, with scarce a god to friend,<br/>
And see his Trojans to the shades descend:<br/>
Such be the scene from his Idaean bower;<br/>
Ungrateful prospect to the sullen power!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Neptune with wrath rejects the rash design:<br/>
"What rage, what madness, furious queen! is thine?<br/>
I war not with the highest. All above<br/>
Submit and tremble at the hand of Jove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now godlike Hector, to whose matchless might<br/>
Jove gave the glory of the destined fight,<br/>
Squadrons on squadrons drives, and fills the fields<br/>
With close-ranged chariots, and with thicken'd shields.<br/>
Where the deep trench in length extended lay,<br/>
Compacted troops stand wedged in firm array,<br/>
A dreadful front! they shake the brands, and threat<br/>
With long-destroying flames the hostile fleet.<br/>
The king of men, by Juno's self inspired,<br/>
Toil'd through the tents, and all his army fired.<br/>
Swift as he moved, he lifted in his hand<br/>
His purple robe, bright ensign of command.<br/>
High on the midmost bark the king appear'd:<br/>
There, from Ulysses' deck, his voice was heard:<br/>
To Ajax and Achilles reach'd the sound,<br/>
Whose distant ships the guarded navy bound.<br/>
"O Argives! shame of human race! (he cried:<br/>
The hollow vessels to his voice replied,)<br/>
Where now are all your glorious boasts of yore,<br/>
Your hasty triumphs on the Lemnian shore?<br/>
Each fearless hero dares a hundred foes,<br/>
While the feast lasts, and while the goblet flows;<br/>
But who to meet one martial man is found,<br/>
When the fight rages, and the flames surround?<br/>
O mighty Jove! O sire of the distress'd!<br/>
Was ever king like me, like me oppress'd?<br/>
With power immense, with justice arm'd in vain;<br/>
My glory ravish'd, and my people slain!<br/>
To thee my vows were breathed from every shore;<br/>
What altar smoked not with our victims' gore?<br/>
With fat of bulls I fed the constant flame,<br/>
And ask'd destruction to the Trojan name.<br/>
Now, gracious god! far humbler our demand;<br/>
Give these at least to 'scape from Hector's hand,<br/>
And save the relics of the Grecian land!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus pray'd the king, and heaven's great father heard<br/>
His vows, in bitterness of soul preferr'd:<br/>
The wrath appeased, by happy signs declares,<br/>
And gives the people to their monarch's prayers.<br/>
His eagle, sacred bird of heaven! he sent,<br/>
A fawn his talons truss'd, (divine portent!)<br/>
High o'er the wondering hosts he soar'd above,<br/>
Who paid their vows to Panomphaean Jove;<br/>
Then let the prey before his altar fall;<br/>
The Greeks beheld, and transport seized on all:<br/>
Encouraged by the sign, the troops revive,<br/>
And fierce on Troy with doubled fury drive.<br/>
Tydides first, of all the Grecian force,<br/>
O'er the broad ditch impell'd his foaming horse,<br/>
Pierced the deep ranks, their strongest battle tore,<br/>
And dyed his javelin red with Trojan gore.<br/>
Young Agelaus (Phradmon was his sire)<br/>
With flying coursers shunn'd his dreadful ire;<br/>
Struck through the back, the Phrygian fell oppress'd;<br/>
The dart drove on, and issued at his breast:<br/>
Headlong he quits the car: his arms resound;<br/>
His ponderous buckler thunders on the ground.<br/>
Forth rush a tide of Greeks, the passage freed;<br/>
The Atridae first, the Ajaces next succeed:<br/>
Meriones, like Mars in arms renown'd,<br/>
And godlike Idomen, now passed the mound;<br/>
Evaemon's son next issues to the foe,<br/>
And last young Teucer with his bended bow.<br/>
Secure behind the Telamonian shield<br/>
The skilful archer wide survey'd the field,<br/>
With every shaft some hostile victim slew,<br/>
Then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew:<br/>
The conscious infant so, when fear alarms,<br/>
Retires for safety to the mother's arms.<br/>
Thus Ajax guards his brother in the field,<br/>
Moves as he moves, and turns the shining shield.<br/>
Who first by Teucer's mortal arrows bled?<br/>
Orsilochus; then fell Ormenus dead:<br/>
The godlike Lycophon next press'd the plain,<br/>
With Chromius, Daetor, Ophelestes slain:<br/>
Bold Hamopaon breathless sunk to ground;<br/>
The bloody pile great Melanippus crown'd.<br/>
Heaps fell on heaps, sad trophies of his art,<br/>
A Trojan ghost attending every dart.<br/>
Great Agamemnon views with joyful eye<br/>
The ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly:<br/>
"O youth forever dear! (the monarch cried)<br/>
Thus, always thus, thy early worth be tried;<br/>
Thy brave example shall retrieve our host,<br/>
Thy country's saviour, and thy father's boast!<br/>
Sprung from an alien's bed thy sire to grace,<br/>
The vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace:<br/>
Proud of his boy, he own'd the generous flame,<br/>
And the brave son repays his cares with fame.<br/>
Now hear a monarch's vow: If heaven's high powers<br/>
Give me to raze Troy's long-defended towers;<br/>
Whatever treasures Greece for me design,<br/>
The next rich honorary gift be thine:<br/>
Some golden tripod, or distinguished car,<br/>
With coursers dreadful in the ranks of war:<br/>
Or some fair captive, whom thy eyes approve,<br/>
Shall recompense the warrior's toils with love."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To this the chief: "With praise the rest inspire,<br/>
Nor urge a soul already fill'd with fire.<br/>
What strength I have, be now in battle tried,<br/>
Till every shaft in Phrygian blood be dyed.<br/>
Since rallying from our wall we forced the foe,<br/>
Still aim'd at Hector have I bent my bow:<br/>
Eight forky arrows from this hand have fled,<br/>
And eight bold heroes by their points lie dead:<br/>
But sure some god denies me to destroy<br/>
This fury of the field, this dog of Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and twang'd the string. The weapon flies<br/>
At Hector's breast, and sings along the skies:<br/>
He miss'd the mark; but pierced Gorgythio's heart,<br/>
And drench'd in royal blood the thirsty dart.<br/>
(Fair Castianira, nymph of form divine,<br/>
This offspring added to king Priam's line.)<br/>
As full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,<br/>
Decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain;<br/>
So sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depress'd<br/>
Beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.<br/>
Another shaft the raging archer drew,<br/>
That other shaft with erring fury flew,<br/>
(From Hector, Phoebus turn'd the flying wound,)<br/>
Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:<br/>
Thy breast, brave Archeptolemus! it tore,<br/>
And dipp'd its feathers in no vulgar gore.<br/>
Headlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms<br/>
The steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.<br/>
Hector with grief his charioteer beheld<br/>
All pale and breathless on the sanguine field:<br/>
Then bids Cebriones direct the rein,<br/>
Quits his bright car, and issues on the plain.<br/>
Dreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,<br/>
And rush'd on Teucer with the lifted rock.<br/>
The youth already strain'd the forceful yew;<br/>
The shaft already to his shoulder drew;<br/>
The feather in his hand, just wing'd for flight,<br/>
Touch'd where the neck and hollow chest unite;<br/>
There, where the juncture knits the channel bone,<br/>
The furious chief discharged the craggy stone:<br/>
The bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,<br/>
And his numb'd hand dismiss'd his useless bow.<br/>
He fell: but Ajax his broad shield display'd,<br/>
And screen'd his brother with the mighty shade;<br/>
Till great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore<br/>
The batter'd archer groaning to the shore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Troy yet found grace before the Olympian sire,<br/>
He arm'd their hands, and fill'd their breasts with fire.<br/>
The Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,<br/>
Or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.<br/>
First of the foe, great Hector march'd along,<br/>
With terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.<br/>
As the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,<br/>
With beating bosom, and with eager pace,<br/>
Hangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,<br/>
Guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;<br/>
Thus oft the Grecians turn'd, but still they flew;<br/>
Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.<br/>
When flying they had pass'd the trench profound,<br/>
And many a chief lay gasping on the ground;<br/>
Before the ships a desperate stand they made,<br/>
And fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.<br/>
Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:<br/>
His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame<br/>
That wither'd all their host: like Mars he stood:<br/>
Dire as the monster, dreadful as the god!<br/>
Their strong distress the wife of Jove survey'd;<br/>
Then pensive thus, to war's triumphant maid:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield<br/>
The avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!<br/>
Now, in this moment of her last despair,<br/>
Shall wretched Greece no more confess our care,<br/>
Condemn'd to suffer the full force of fate,<br/>
And drain the dregs of heaven's relentless hate?<br/>
Gods! shall one raging hand thus level all?<br/>
What numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!<br/>
What power divine shall Hector's wrath assuage?<br/>
Still swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
So spake the imperial regent of the skies;<br/>
To whom the goddess with the azure eyes:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Long since had Hector stain'd these fields with gore,<br/>
Stretch'd by some Argive on his native shore:<br/>
But he above, the sire of heaven, withstands,<br/>
Mocks our attempts, and slights our just demands;<br/>
The stubborn god, inflexible and hard,<br/>
Forgets my service and deserved reward:<br/>
Saved I, for this, his favourite son distress'd,<br/>
By stern Eurystheus with long labours press'd?<br/>
He begg'd, with tears he begg'd, in deep dismay;<br/>
I shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day.<br/>
Oh had my wisdom known this dire event,<br/>
When to grim Pluto's gloomy gates he went;<br/>
The triple dog had never felt his chain,<br/>
Nor Styx been cross'd, nor hell explored in vain.<br/>
Averse to me of all his heaven of gods,<br/>
At Thetis' suit the partial Thunderer nods;<br/>
To grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,<br/>
My hopes are frustrate, and my Greeks undone.<br/>
Some future day, perhaps, he may be moved<br/>
To call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.<br/>
Haste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;<br/>
Myself will arm, and thunder at thy side.<br/>
Then, goddess! say, shall Hector glory then?<br/>
(That terror of the Greeks, that man of men)<br/>
When Juno's self, and Pallas shall appear,<br/>
All dreadful in the crimson walks of war!<br/>
What mighty Trojan then, on yonder shore,<br/>
Expiring, pale, and terrible no more,<br/>
Shall feast the fowls, and glut the dogs with gore?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
She ceased, and Juno rein'd the steeds with care:<br/>
(Heaven's awful empress, Saturn's other heir:)<br/>
Pallas, meanwhile, her various veil unbound,<br/>
With flowers adorn'd, with art immortal crown'd;<br/>
The radiant robe her sacred fingers wove<br/>
Floats in rich waves, and spreads the court of Jove.<br/>
Her father's arms her mighty limbs invest,<br/>
His cuirass blazes on her ample breast.<br/>
The vigorous power the trembling car ascends:<br/>
Shook by her arm, the massy javelin bends:<br/>
Huge, ponderous, strong! that when her fury burns<br/>
Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Saturnia lends the lash; the coursers fly;<br/>
Smooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky.<br/>
Heaven's gates spontaneous open to the powers,<br/>
Heaven's golden gates, kept by the winged Hours.<br/>
Commission'd in alternate watch they stand,<br/>
The sun's bright portals and the skies command;<br/>
Close, or unfold, the eternal gates of day<br/>
Bar heaven with clouds, or roll those clouds away.<br/>
The sounding hinges ring, the clouds divide.<br/>
Prone down the steep of heaven their course they guide.<br/>
But Jove, incensed, from Ida's top survey'd,<br/>
And thus enjoin'd the many-colour'd maid.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thaumantia! mount the winds, and stop their car;<br/>
Against the highest who shall wage the war?<br/>
If furious yet they dare the vain debate,<br/>
Thus have I spoke, and what I speak is fate:<br/>
Their coursers crush'd beneath the wheels shall lie,<br/>
Their car in fragments, scatter'd o'er the sky:<br/>
My lightning these rebellious shall confound,<br/>
And hurl them flaming, headlong, to the ground,<br/>
Condemn'd for ten revolving years to weep<br/>
The wounds impress'd by burning thunder deep.<br/>
So shall Minerva learn to fear our ire,<br/>
Nor dare to combat hers and nature's sire.<br/>
For Juno, headstrong and imperious still,<br/>
She claims some title to transgress our will."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift as the wind, the various-colour'd maid<br/>
From Ida's top her golden wings display'd;<br/>
To great Olympus' shining gate she flies,<br/>
There meets the chariot rushing down the skies,<br/>
Restrains their progress from the bright abodes,<br/>
And speaks the mandate of the sire of gods.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What frenzy goddesses! what rage can move<br/>
Celestial minds to tempt the wrath of Jove?<br/>
Desist, obedient to his high command:<br/>
This is his word; and know his word shall stand:<br/>
His lightning your rebellion shall confound,<br/>
And hurl ye headlong, flaming, to the ground;<br/>
Your horses crush'd beneath the wheels shall lie,<br/>
Your car in fragments scatter'd o'er the sky;<br/>
Yourselves condemn'd ten rolling years to weep<br/>
The wounds impress'd by burning thunder deep.<br/>
So shall Minerva learn to fear his ire,<br/>
Nor dare to combat hers and nature's sire.<br/>
For Juno, headstrong and imperious still,<br/>
She claims some title to transgress his will:<br/>
But thee, what desperate insolence has driven<br/>
To lift thy lance against the king of heaven?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, mounting on the pinions of the wind,<br/>
She flew; and Juno thus her rage resign'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield<br/>
The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield!<br/>
No more let beings of superior birth<br/>
Contend with Jove for this low race of earth;<br/>
Triumphant now, now miserably slain,<br/>
They breathe or perish as the fates ordain:<br/>
But Jove's high counsels full effect shall find;<br/>
And, ever constant, ever rule mankind."<br/>
</p>
<p>
She spoke, and backward turn'd her steeds of light,<br/>
Adorn'd with manes of gold, and heavenly bright.<br/>
The Hours unloosed them, panting as they stood,<br/>
And heap'd their mangers with ambrosial food.<br/>
There tied, they rest in high celestial stalls;<br/>
The chariot propp'd against the crystal walls,<br/>
The pensive goddesses, abash'd, controll'd,<br/>
Mix with the gods, and fill their seats of gold.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now the Thunderer meditates his flight<br/>
From Ida's summits to the Olympian height.<br/>
Swifter than thought, the wheels instinctive fly,<br/>
Flame through the vast of air, and reach the sky.<br/>
'Twas Neptune's charge his coursers to unbrace,<br/>
And fix the car on its immortal base;<br/>
There stood the chariot, beaming forth its rays,<br/>
Till with a snowy veil he screen'd the blaze.<br/>
He, whose all-conscious eyes the world behold,<br/>
The eternal Thunderer sat, enthroned in gold.<br/>
High heaven the footstool of his feet he makes,<br/>
And wide beneath him all Olympus shakes.<br/>
Trembling afar the offending powers appear'd,<br/>
Confused and silent, for his frown they fear'd.<br/>
He saw their soul, and thus his word imparts:<br/>
"Pallas and Juno! say, why heave your hearts?<br/>
Soon was your battle o'er: proud Troy retired<br/>
Before your face, and in your wrath expired.<br/>
But know, whoe'er almighty power withstand!<br/>
Unmatch'd our force, unconquer'd is our hand:<br/>
Who shall the sovereign of the skies control?<br/>
Not all the gods that crown the starry pole.<br/>
Your hearts shall tremble, if our arms we take,<br/>
And each immortal nerve with horror shake.<br/>
For thus I speak, and what I speak shall stand;<br/>
What power soe'er provokes our lifted hand,<br/>
On this our hill no more shall hold his place;<br/>
Cut off, and exiled from the ethereal race."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Juno and Pallas grieving hear the doom,<br/>
But feast their souls on Ilion's woes to come.<br/>
Though secret anger swell'd Minerva's breast,<br/>
The prudent goddess yet her wrath repress'd;<br/>
But Juno, impotent of rage, replies:<br/>
"What hast thou said, O tyrant of the skies!<br/>
Strength and omnipotence invest thy throne;<br/>
'Tis thine to punish; ours to grieve alone.<br/>
For Greece we grieve, abandon'd by her fate<br/>
To drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate.<br/>
From fields forbidden we submiss refrain,<br/>
With arms unaiding see our Argives slain;<br/>
Yet grant our counsels still their breasts may move,<br/>
Lest all should perish in the rage of Jove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The goddess thus; and thus the god replies,<br/>
Who swells the clouds, and blackens all the skies:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"The morning sun, awaked by loud alarms,<br/>
Shall see the almighty Thunderer in arms.<br/>
What heaps of Argives then shall load the plain,<br/>
Those radiant eyes shall view, and view in vain.<br/>
Nor shall great Hector cease the rage of fight,<br/>
The navy flaming, and thy Greeks in flight,<br/>
Even till the day when certain fates ordain<br/>
That stern Achilles (his Patroclus slain)<br/>
Shall rise in vengeance, and lay waste the plain.<br/>
For such is fate, nor canst thou turn its course<br/>
With all thy rage, with all thy rebel force.<br/>
Fly, if thy wilt, to earth's remotest bound,<br/>
Where on her utmost verge the seas resound;<br/>
Where cursed Iapetus and Saturn dwell,<br/>
Fast by the brink, within the streams of hell;<br/>
No sun e'er gilds the gloomy horrors there;<br/>
No cheerful gales refresh the lazy air:<br/>
There arm once more the bold Titanian band;<br/>
And arm in vain; for what I will, shall stand."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light,<br/>
And drew behind the cloudy veil of night:<br/>
The conquering Trojans mourn his beams decay'd;<br/>
The Greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The victors keep the field; and Hector calls<br/>
A martial council near the navy walls;<br/>
These to Scamander's bank apart he led,<br/>
Where thinly scatter'd lay the heaps of dead.<br/>
The assembled chiefs, descending on the ground,<br/>
Attend his order, and their prince surround.<br/>
A massy spear he bore of mighty strength,<br/>
Of full ten cubits was the lance's length;<br/>
The point was brass, refulgent to behold,<br/>
Fix'd to the wood with circling rings of gold:<br/>
The noble Hector on his lance reclined,<br/>
And, bending forward, thus reveal'd his mind:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ye valiant Trojans, with attention hear!<br/>
Ye Dardan bands, and generous aids, give ear!<br/>
This day, we hoped, would wrap in conquering flame<br/>
Greece with her ships, and crown our toils with fame.<br/>
But darkness now, to save the cowards, falls,<br/>
And guards them trembling in their wooden walls.<br/>
Obey the night, and use her peaceful hours<br/>
Our steeds to forage, and refresh our powers.<br/>
Straight from the town be sheep and oxen sought,<br/>
And strengthening bread and generous wine be brought.<br/>
Wide o'er the field, high blazing to the sky,<br/>
Let numerous fires the absent sun supply,<br/>
The flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise,<br/>
Till the bright morn her purple beam displays;<br/>
Lest, in the silence and the shades of night,<br/>
Greece on her sable ships attempt her flight.<br/>
Not unmolested let the wretches gain<br/>
Their lofty decks, or safely cleave the main;<br/>
Some hostile wound let every dart bestow,<br/>
Some lasting token of the Phrygian foe,<br/>
Wounds, that long hence may ask their spouses' care.<br/>
And warn their children from a Trojan war.<br/>
Now through the circuit of our Ilion wall,<br/>
Let sacred heralds sound the solemn call;<br/>
To bid the sires with hoary honours crown'd,<br/>
And beardless youths, our battlements surround.<br/>
Firm be the guard, while distant lie our powers,<br/>
And let the matrons hang with lights the towers;<br/>
Lest, under covert of the midnight shade,<br/>
The insidious foe the naked town invade.<br/>
Suffice, to-night, these orders to obey;<br/>
A nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day.<br/>
The gods, I trust, shall give to Hector's hand<br/>
From these detested foes to free the land,<br/>
Who plough'd, with fates averse, the watery way:<br/>
For Trojan vultures a predestined prey.<br/>
Our common safety must be now the care;<br/>
But soon as morning paints the fields of air,<br/>
Sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage,<br/>
And the fired fleet behold the battle rage.<br/>
Then, then shall Hector and Tydides prove<br/>
Whose fates are heaviest in the scales of Jove.<br/>
To-morrow's light (O haste the glorious morn!)<br/>
Shall see his bloody spoils in triumph borne,<br/>
With this keen javelin shall his breast be gored,<br/>
And prostrate heroes bleed around their lord.<br/>
Certain as this, oh! might my days endure,<br/>
From age inglorious, and black death secure;<br/>
So might my life and glory know no bound,<br/>
Like Pallas worshipp'd, like the sun renown'd!<br/>
As the next dawn, the last they shall enjoy,<br/>
Shall crush the Greeks, and end the woes of Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The leader spoke. From all his host around<br/>
Shouts of applause along the shores resound.<br/>
Each from the yoke the smoking steeds untied,<br/>
And fix'd their headstalls to his chariot-side.<br/>
Fat sheep and oxen from the town are led,<br/>
With generous wine, and all-sustaining bread,<br/>
Full hecatombs lay burning on the shore:<br/>
The winds to heaven the curling vapours bore.<br/>
Ungrateful offering to the immortal powers!<br/>
Whose wrath hung heavy o'er the Trojan towers:<br/>
Nor Priam nor his sons obtain'd their grace;<br/>
Proud Troy they hated, and her guilty race.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The troops exulting sat in order round,<br/>
And beaming fires illumined all the ground.<br/>
As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,<br/>
O'er heaven's pure azure spreads her sacred light,<br/>
When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,<br/>
And not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene,<br/>
Around her throne the vivid planets roll,<br/>
And stars unnumber'd gild the glowing pole,<br/>
O'er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,<br/>
And tip with silver every mountain's head:<br/>
Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,<br/>
A flood of glory bursts from all the skies:<br/>
The conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,<br/>
Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.<br/>
So many flames before proud Ilion blaze,<br/>
And lighten glimmering Xanthus with their rays.<br/>
The long reflections of the distant fires<br/>
Gleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires.<br/>
A thousand piles the dusky horrors gild,<br/>
And shoot a shady lustre o'er the field.<br/>
Full fifty guards each flaming pile attend,<br/>
Whose umber'd arms, by fits, thick flashes send,<br/>
Loud neigh the coursers o'er their heaps of corn,<br/>
And ardent warriors wait the rising morn.<br/>

<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book X</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
"At length we reach'd Æolias's sea-girt shore,<br/>
Where great Hippotades the sceptre bore,<br/>
A floating isle! high-raised by toil divine,<br/>
Strong walls of brass the rocky coast confine.<br/>
Six blooming youths, in private grandeur bred,<br/>
And six fair daughters, graced the royal bed;<br/>
These sons their sisters wed, and all remain<br/>
Their parents' pride, and pleasure of their reign.<br/>
All day they feast, all day the bowls flow round,<br/>
And joy and music through the isle resound;<br/>
At night each pair on splendid carpets lay,<br/>
And crown'd with love the pleasures of the day.<br/>
This happy port affords our wandering fleet<br/>
A month's reception, and a safe retreat.<br/>
Full oft the monarch urged me to relate<br/>
The fall of Ilion, and the Grecian fate;<br/>
Full oft I told: at length for parting moved;<br/>
The king with mighty gifts my suit approved.<br/>
The adverse winds in leathern bags he braced,<br/>
Compress'd their force, and lock'd each struggling blast.<br/>
For him the mighty sire of gods assign'd<br/>
The tempest's lord, the tyrant of the wind;<br/>
His word alone the listening storms obey,<br/>
To smooth the deep, or swell the foamy sea.<br/>
These in my hollow ship the monarch hung,<br/>
Securely fetter'd by a silver thong:<br/>
But Zephyrus exempt, with friendly gales<br/>
He charged to fill, and guide the swelling sails:<br/>
Rare gift! but O, what gift to fools avails!
</p>
<p>
"Nine prosperous days we plied the labouring oar;<br/>
The tenth presents our welcome native shore:<br/>
The hills display the beacon's friendly light,<br/>
And rising mountains gain upon our sight.<br/>
Then first my eyes, by watchful toils oppress'd,<br/>
Complied to take the balmy gifts of rest:<br/>
Then first my hands did from the rudder part<br/>
(So much the love of home possess'd my heart):<br/>
When lo! on board a fond debate arose;<br/>
What rare device those vessels might inclose?<br/>
What sum, what prize from Æolus I brought?<br/>
Whilst to his neighbour each express'd his thought:
</p>
<p>
"'Say, whence ye gods, contending nations strive<br/>
Who most shall please, who most our hero give?<br/>
Long have his coffers groan'd with Trojan spoils:<br/>
Whilst we, the wretched partners of his toils,<br/>
Reproach'd by want, our fruitless labours mourn,<br/>
And only rich in barren fame return.<br/>
Now Æolus, ye see, augments his store:<br/>
But come, my friends, these mystic gifts explore,'<br/>
They said: and (oh cursed fate!) the thongs unbound!<br/>
The gushing tempest sweeps the ocean round;<br/>
Snatch'd in the whirl, the hurried navy flew,<br/>
The ocean widen'd and the shores withdrew.<br/>
Roused from my fatal sleep I long debate<br/>
If still to live, or desperate plunge to fate;<br/>
Thus doubting, prostrate on the deck I lay,<br/>
Till all the coward thoughts of death gave way.
</p>
<p>
"Meanwhile our vessels plough the liquid plain,<br/>
And soon the known AEolian coast regain;<br/>
Our groan the rocks remurmur'd to the main.<br/>
We leap'd on shore, and with a scanty feast<br/>
Our thirst and hunger hastily repress'd;<br/>
That done, two chosen heralds straight attend<br/>
Our second progress to my royal friend;<br/>
And him amidst his jovial sons we found;<br/>
The banquet steaming, and the goblets crown'd;<br/>
There humbly stoop'd with conscious shame and awe,<br/>
Nor nearer than the gate presumed to draw.<br/>
But soon his sons their well-known guest descried,<br/>
And starting from their couches loudly cried:<br/>
'Ulysses here! what demon could'st thou meet<br/>
To thwart thy passage, and repel thy fleet?<br/>
Wast thou not furnish'd by our choicest care<br/>
For Greece, for home and all thy soul held dear?'<br/>
Thus they, In silence long my fate I mourn'd;<br/>
At length these words with accents low return'd:<br/>
`Me, lock'd in sleep, my faithless crew bereft<br/>
Of all the blessing of your godlike gift!<br/>
But grant, oh grant, our loss we may retrieve;<br/>
A favour you, and you alone can give.'
</p>
<p>
"Thus I with art to move their pity tried,<br/>
And touch'd the youths; but their stern sire replied:<br/>
'Vile wretch, begone! this instant I command<br/>
Thy fleet accursed to leave our hallow'd land.<br/>
His baneful suit pollutes these bless'd abodes,<br/>
Whose fate proclaims him hateful to the gods.'
</p>
<p>
"Thus fierce he said: we sighing went our way,<br/>
And with desponding hearts put off to sea.<br/>
The sailors spent with toils their folly mourn,<br/>
But mourn in vain; no prospect of return<br/>
Six days and nights a doubtful course we steer,<br/>
The next proud Lamos' stately towers appear,<br/>
And Laestrygonia's gates arise distinct in air.<br/>
The shepherd, quitting here at night the plain,<br/>
Calls, to succeed his cares, the watchful swain;<br/>
But he that scorns the chains of sleep to wear,<br/>
And adds the herdsman's to the shepherd's care,<br/>
So near the pastures, and so short the way,<br/>
His double toils may claim a double pay,<br/>
And join the labours of the night and day.
</p>
<p>
"Within a long recess a bay there lies,<br/>
Edged round with cliffs high pointing to the skies;<br/>
The jutting shores that swell on either side<br/>
Contract its mouth, and break the rushing tide.<br/>
Our eager sailors seize the fair retreat,<br/>
And bound within the port their crowded fleet:<br/>
For here retired the sinking billows sleep,<br/>
And smiling calmness silver'd o'er the deep.<br/>
I only in the bay refused to moor,<br/>
And fix'd without, my halsers to the shore.
</p>
<p>
"From thence we climb'd a point, whose airy brow<br/>
Commands the prospect of the plains below;<br/>
No tracks of beasts, or signs of men, we found,<br/>
But smoky volumes rolling from the ground.<br/>
Two with our herald thither we command,<br/>
With speed to learn what men possess'd the land.<br/>
They went, and kept the wheel's smooth-beaten road<br/>
Which to the city drew the mountain wood;<br/>
When lo! they met, beside a crystal spring,<br/>
The daughter of Antiphates the king;<br/>
She to Artacia's silver streams came down;<br/>
(Artacia's streams alone supply the town);<br/>
The damsel they approach, and ask'd what race<br/>
The people were? who monarch of the place?<br/>
With joy the maid the unwary strangers heard<br/>
And show'd them where the royal dome appear'd.<br/>
They went; but as they entering saw the queen<br/>
Of size enormous, and terrific mien<br/>
(Not yielding to some bulky mountain's height),<br/>
A sudden horror struck their aching sight.<br/>
Swift at her call her husband scour'd away<br/>
To wreak his hunger on the destined prey;<br/>
One for his food the raging glutton slew,<br/>
But two rush'd out, and to the navy flew.
</p>
<p>
"Balk'd of his prey, the yelling monster flies,<br/>
And fills the city with his hideous cries;<br/>
A ghastly band of giants hear the roar,<br/>
And, pouring down the mountains, crowd the shore.<br/>
Fragments they rend from off the craggy brow<br/>
And dash the ruins on the ships below;<br/>
The crackling vessels burst; hoarse groans arise,<br/>
And mingled horrors echo to the skies;<br/>
The men like fish, they struck upon the flood,<br/>
And cramm'd their filthy throats with human food.<br/>
Whilst thus their fury rages at the bay,<br/>
My sword our cables cut, I call'd to weigh;<br/>
And charged my men, as they from fate would fly,<br/>
Each nerve to strain, each bending oar to ply.<br/>
The sailors catch the word, their oars they seize,<br/>
And sweep with equal strokes the smoky seas;<br/>
Clear of the rocks the impatient vessel flies;<br/>
Whilst in the port each wretch encumber'd dies.<br/>
With earnest haste my frighted sailors press,<br/>
While kindling transports glow'd at our success;<br/>
But the sad fate that did our friends destroy,<br/>
Cool'd every breast, and damp'd the rising joy.
</p>
<p>
"Now dropp'd our anchors in the Ææan bay,<br/>
Where Circe dwelt, the daughter of the Day!<br/>
Her mother Perse, of old Ocean's strain,<br/>
Thus from the Sun descended, and the Main<br/>
(From the same lineage stern Aeaetes came,<br/>
The far-famed brother of the enchantress dame);<br/>
Goddess, the queen, to whom the powers belong<br/>
Of dreadful magic and commanding song.<br/>
Some god directing to this peaceful bay<br/>
Silent we came, and melancholy lay,<br/>
Spent and o'erwatch'd. Two days and nights roll'd on,<br/>
And now the third succeeding morning shone.<br/>
I climb'd a cliff, with spear and sword in hand,<br/>
Whose ridge o'erlook'd a shady length of land;<br/>
To learn if aught of mortal works appear,<br/>
Or cheerful voice of mortal strike the ear?<br/>
From the high point I mark'd, in distant view,<br/>
A stream of curling smoke ascending blue,<br/>
And spiry tops, the tufted trees above,<br/>
Of Circe's palace bosom'd in the grove.
</p>
<p>
"Thither to haste, the region to explore,<br/>
Was first my thought: but speeding back to shore<br/>
I deem'd it best to visit first my crew,<br/>
And send our spies the dubious coast to view.<br/>
As down the hill I solitary go,<br/>
Some power divine, who pities human woe,<br/>
Sent a tall stag, descending from the wood,<br/>
To cool his fervour in the crystal flood;<br/>
Luxuriant on the wave-worn bank he lay,<br/>
Stretch'd forth and panting in the sunny ray.<br/>
I launch'd my spear, and with a sudden wound<br/>
Transpierced his back, and fix'd him to the ground.<br/>
He falls, and mourns his fate with human cries:<br/>
Through the wide wound the vital spirit flies.<br/>
I drew, and casting on the river's side<br/>
The bloody spear, his gather'd feet I tied<br/>
With twining osiers which the bank supplied.<br/>
An ell in length the pliant wisp I weaved,<br/>
And the huge body on my shoulders heaved:<br/>
Then leaning on my spear with both my hands,<br/>
Upbore my load, and press'd the sinking sands<br/>
With weighty steps, till at the ship I threw<br/>
The welcome burden, and bespoke my crew:
</p>
<p>
"'Cheer up, my friends! it is not yet our fate<br/>
To glide with ghosts through Pluto's gloomy gate.<br/>
Food in the desert land, behold! is given!<br/>
Live, and enjoy the providence of heaven.'
</p>
<p>
"The joyful crew survey his mighty size,<br/>
And on the future banquet feast their eyes,<br/>
As huge in length extended lay the beast;<br/>
Then wash their hands, and hasten to the feast.<br/>
There, till the setting sun roll'd down the light,<br/>
They sate indulging in the genial rite.<br/>
When evening rose, and darkness cover'd o'er<br/>
The face of things, we slept along the shore.<br/>
But when the rosy morning warm'd the east,<br/>
My men I summon'd, and these words address'd:<br/>
"'Followers and friends, attend what I propose:<br/>
Ye sad companions of Ulysses' woes!<br/>
We know not here what land before us lies,<br/>
Or to what quarter now we turn our eyes,<br/>
Or where the sun shall set, or where shall rise.<br/>
Here let us think (if thinking be not vain)<br/>
If any counsel, any hope remain.<br/>
Alas! from yonder promontory's brow<br/>
I view'd the coast, a region flat and low;<br/>
An isle encircled with the boundless flood;<br/>
A length of thickets, and entangled wood.<br/>
Some smoke I saw amid the forest rise,<br/>
And all around it only seas and skies!'
</p>
<p>
"With broken hearts my sad companions stood,<br/>
Mindful of Cyclops and his human food,<br/>
And horrid Laestrygons, the men of blood.<br/>
Presaging tears apace began to rain;<br/>
But tears in mortal miseries are vain.<br/>
In equal parts I straight divide my band,<br/>
And name a chief each party to command;<br/>
I led the one, and of the other side<br/>
Appointed brave Eurylochus the guide.<br/>
Then in the brazen helm the lots we throw,<br/>
And fortune casts Eurylochus to go;<br/>
He march'd with twice eleven in his train;<br/>
Pensive they march, and pensive we remain.
</p>
<p>
"The palace in a woody vale they found,<br/>
High raised of stone; a shaded space around;<br/>
Where mountain wolves and brindled lions roam,<br/>
(By magic tamed,) familiar to the dome.<br/>
With gentle blandishment our men they meet,<br/>
And wag their tails, and fawning lick their feet.<br/>
As from some feast a man returning late,<br/>
His faithful dogs all meet him at the gate,<br/>
Rejoicing round, some morsel to receive,<br/>
(Such as the good man ever used to give,)<br/>
Domestic thus the grisly beasts drew near;<br/>
They gaze with wonder not unmix'd with fear.<br/>
Now on the threshold of the dome they stood,<br/>
And heard a voice resounding through the wood:<br/>
Placed at her loom within, the goddess sung;<br/>
The vaulted roofs and solid pavement rung.<br/>
O'er the fair web the rising figures shine,<br/>
Immortal labour! worthy hands divine.<br/>
Polites to the rest the question moved<br/>
(A gallant leader, and a man I loved):
</p>
<p>
"'What voice celestial, chanting to the loom<br/>
(Or nymph, or goddess), echoes from the room?<br/>
Say, shall we seek access?' With that they call;<br/>
And wide unfold the portals of the hall.
</p>
<p>
"The goddess, rising, asks her guests to stay,<br/>
Who blindly follow where she leads the way.<br/>
Eurylochus alone of all the band,<br/>
Suspecting fraud, more prudently remain'd.<br/>
On thrones around with downy coverings graced,<br/>
With semblance fair, the unhappy men she placed.<br/>
Milk newly press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,<br/>
And honey fresh, and Pramnian wines the treat:<br/>
But venom'd was the bread, and mix'd the bowl,<br/>
With drugs of force to darken all the soul:<br/>
Soon in the luscious feast themselves they lost,<br/>
And drank oblivion of their native coast.<br/>
Instant her circling wand the goddess waves,<br/>
To hogs transforms them, and the sty receives.<br/>
No more was seen the human form divine;<br/>
Head, face, and members, bristle into swine:<br/>
Still cursed with sense, their minds remain alone,<br/>
And their own voice affrights them when they groan.<br/>
Meanwhile the goddess in disdain bestows<br/>
The mast and acorn, brutal food! and strows<br/>
The fruits and cornel, as their feast, around;<br/>
Now prone and grovelling on unsavoury ground.
</p>
<p>
"Eurylochus, with pensive steps and slow.<br/>
Aghast returns; the messenger of woe,<br/>
And bitter fate. To speak he made essay,<br/>
In vain essay'd, nor would his tongue obey.<br/>
His swelling heart denied the words their way:<br/>
But speaking tears the want of words supply,<br/>
And the full soul bursts copious from his eye.<br/>
Affrighted, anxious for our fellows' fates,<br/>
We press to hear what sadly he relates:
</p>
<p>
"We went, Ulysses! (such was thy command)<br/>
Through the lone thicket and the desert land.<br/>
A palace in a woody vale we found<br/>
Brown with dark forests, and with shades around.<br/>
A voice celestial echoed through the dome,<br/>
Or nymph or goddess, chanting to the loom.<br/>
Access we sought, nor was access denied:<br/>
Radiant she came: the portals open'd wide:<br/>
The goddess mild invites the guests to stay:<br/>
They blindly follow where she leads the way.<br/>
I only wait behind of all the train:<br/>
I waited long, and eyed the doors in vain:<br/>
The rest are vanish'd, none repass'd the gate,<br/>
And not a man appears to tell their fate.'
</p>
<p>
"I heard, and instant o'er my shoulder flung<br/>
The belt in which my weighty falchion hung<br/>
(A beamy blade): then seized the bended bow,<br/>
And bade him guide the way, resolved to go.<br/>
He, prostrate falling, with both hands embraced<br/>
My knees, and weeping thus his suit address'd:
</p>
<p>
"'O king, beloved of Jove, thy servant spare,<br/>
And ah, thyself the rash attempt forbear!<br/>
Never, alas! thou never shalt return,<br/>
Or see the wretched for whose loss we mourn.<br/>
With what remains from certain ruin fly,<br/>
And save the few not fated yet to die.'
</p>
<p>
"I answer'd stern: 'Inglorious then remain,<br/>
Here feast and loiter, and desert thy train.<br/>
Alone, unfriended, will I tempt my way;<br/>
The laws of fate compel, and I obey.'<br/>
This said, and scornful turning from the shore<br/>
My haughty step, I stalk'd the valley o'er.<br/>
Till now approaching nigh the magic bower,<br/>
Where dwelt the enchantress skill'd in herbs of power,<br/>
A form divine forth issued from the wood<br/>
(Immortal Hermes with the golden rod)<br/>
In human semblance. On his bloomy face<br/>
Youth smiled celestial, with each opening grace.<br/>
He seized my hand, and gracious thus began:<br/>
'Ah whither roam'st thou, much-enduring man?<br/>
O blind to fate! what led thy steps to rove<br/>
The horrid mazes of this magic grove?<br/>
Each friend you seek in yon enclosure lies,<br/>
All lost their form, and habitants of sties.<br/>
Think'st thou by wit to model their escape?<br/>
Sooner shalt thou, a stranger to thy shape,<br/>
Fall prone their equal: first thy danger know,<br/>
Then take the antidote the gods bestow.<br/>
The plant I give through all the direful bower<br/>
Shall guard thee, and avert the evil hour.<br/>
Now hear her wicked arts: Before thy eyes<br/>
The bowl shall sparkle, and the banquet rise;<br/>
Take this, nor from the faithless feast abstain,<br/>
For temper'd drugs and poison shall be vain.<br/>
Soon as she strikes her wand, and gives the word,<br/>
Draw forth and brandish thy refulgent sword,<br/>
And menace death: those menaces shall move<br/>
Her alter'd mind to blandishment and love.<br/>
Nor shun the blessing proffer'd to thy arms,<br/>
Ascend her bed, and taste celestial charms;<br/>
So shall thy tedious toils a respite find,<br/>
And thy lost friends return to human kind.<br/>
But swear her first by those dread oaths that tie<br/>
The powers below, the blessed in the sky;<br/>
Lest to thee naked secret fraud be meant,<br/>
Or magic bind thee cold and impotent.'
</p>
<p>
"Thus while he spoke, the sovereign plant he drew<br/>
Where on the all-bearing earth unmark'd it grew,<br/>
And show'd its nature and its wondrous power:<br/>
Black was the root, but milky white the flower;<br/>
Moly the name, to mortals hard to find,<br/>
But all is easy to the ethereal kind.<br/>
This Hermes gave, then, gliding off the glade,<br/>
Shot to Olympus from the woodland shade.<br/>
While, full of thought, revolving fates to come,<br/>
I speed my passage to the enchanted dome.<br/>
Arrived, before the lofty gates I stay'd;<br/>
The lofty gates the goddess wide display'd;<br/>
She leads before, and to the feast invites;<br/>
I follow sadly to the magic rites.<br/>
Radiant with starry studs, a silver seat<br/>
Received my limbs: a footstool eased my feet,<br/>
She mix'd the potion, fraudulent of soul;<br/>
The poison mantled in the golden bowl.<br/>
I took, and quaff'd it, confident in heaven.<br/>
Then waved the wand, and then the word was given.<br/>
'Hence to thy fellows! (dreadful she began:)<br/>
Go, be a beast!'&mdash;I heard, and yet was man.
</p>
<p>
"Then, sudden whirling, like a waving flame,<br/>
My beamy falchion, I assault the dame.<br/>
Struck with unusual fear, she trembling cries,<br/>
She faints, she falls; she lifts her weeping eyes.
</p>
<p>
"'What art thou? say! from whence, from whom you came?<br/>
O more than human! tell thy race, thy name.<br/>
Amazing strength, these poisons to sustain!<br/>
Not mortal thou, nor mortal is thy brain.<br/>
Or art thou he, the man to come (foretold<br/>
By Hermes, powerful with the wand of gold),<br/>
The man from Troy, who wander'd ocean round;<br/>
The man for wisdom's various arts renown'd,<br/>
Ulysses? Oh! thy threatening fury cease;<br/>
Sheathe thy bright sword, and join our hands in peace!<br/>
Let mutual joys our mutual trust combine,<br/>
And love, and love-born confidence, be thine.'
</p>
<p>
"'And how, dread Circe! (furious I rejoin)<br/>
Can love, and love-born confidence, be mine,<br/>
Beneath thy charms when my companions groan,<br/>
Transform'd to beasts, with accents not their own?<br/>
O thou of fraudful heart, shall I be led<br/>
To share thy feast-rites, or ascend thy bed;<br/>
That, all unarm'd, thy vengeance may have vent,<br/>
And magic bind me, cold and impotent?<br/>
Celestial as thou art, yet stand denied;<br/>
Or swear that oath by which the gods are tied,<br/>
Swear, in thy soul no latent frauds remain,<br/>
Swear by the vow which never can be vain.'
</p>
<p>
"The goddess swore: then seized my hand, and led<br/>
To the sweet transports of the genial bed.<br/>
Ministrant to the queen, with busy care<br/>
Four faithful handmaids the soft rites prepare;<br/>
Nymphs sprung from fountains, or from shady woods,<br/>
Or the fair offspring of the sacred floods.<br/>
One o'er the couches painted carpets threw,<br/>
Whose purple lustre glow'd against the view:<br/>
White linen lay beneath. Another placed<br/>
The silver stands, with golden flaskets graced:<br/>
With dulcet beverage this the beaker crown'd,<br/>
Fair in the midst, with gilded cups around:<br/>
That in the tripod o'er the kindled pile<br/>
The water pours; the bubbling waters boil;<br/>
An ample vase receives the smoking wave;<br/>
And, in the bath prepared, my limbs I lave:<br/>
Reviving sweets repair the mind's decay,<br/>
And take the painful sense of toil away.<br/>
A vest and tunic o'er me next she threw,<br/>
Fresh from the bath, and dropping balmy dew;<br/>
Then led and placed me on the sovereign seat,<br/>
With carpets spread; a footstool at my feet.<br/>
The golden ewer a nymph obsequious brings,<br/>
Replenish'd from the cool translucent springs;<br/>
With copious water the bright vase supplies<br/>
A silver laver of capacious size.<br/>
I wash'd. The table in fair order spread,<br/>
They heap the glittering canisters with bread:<br/>
Viands of various kinds allure the taste,<br/>
Of choicest sort and savour, rich repast!<br/>
Circe in vain invites the feast to share;<br/>
Absent I ponder, and absorb'd in care;<br/>
While scenes of woe rose anxious in my breast,<br/>
The queen beheld me, and these words address'd:
</p>
<p>
"'Why sits Ulysses silent and apart,<br/>
Some hoard of grief close harbour'd at his heart<br/>
Untouch'd before thee stand the cates divine,<br/>
And unregarded laughs the rosy wine.<br/>
Can yet a doubt or any dread remain,<br/>
When sworn that oath which never can be vain?'
</p>
<p>
"I answered: 'Goddess! human is my breast,<br/>
By justice sway'd, by tender pity press'd:<br/>
Ill fits it me, whose friends are sunk to beasts,<br/>
To quaff thy bowls, or riot in thy feasts.<br/>
Me would'st thou please? for them thy cares employ,<br/>
And them to me restore, and me to joy.'
</p>
<p>
"With that she parted: in her potent hand<br/>
She bore the virtue of the magic wand.<br/>
Then, hastening to the sties, set wide the door,<br/>
Urged forth, and drove the bristly herd before;<br/>
Unwieldy, out they rush'd with general cry,<br/>
Enormous beasts, dishonest to the eye.<br/>
Now touch'd by counter-charms they change again,<br/>
And stand majestic, and recall'd to men.<br/>
Those hairs of late that bristled every part,<br/>
Fall off, miraculous effect of art!<br/>
Till all the form in full proportion rise,<br/>
More young, more large, more graceful to my eyes.<br/>
They saw, they knew me, and with eager pace<br/>
Clung to their master in a long embrace:<br/>
Sad, pleasing sight! with tears each eye ran o'er,<br/>
And sobs of joy re-echoed through the bower;<br/>
E'en Circe wept, her adamantine heart<br/>
Felt pity enter, and sustain'd her part.
</p>
<p>
"'Son of Laertes! (then the queen began)<br/>
Oh much-enduring, much experienced man!<br/>
Haste to thy vessel on the sea-beat shore,<br/>
Unload thy treasures, and the galley moor;<br/>
Then bring thy friends, secure from future harms,<br/>
And in our grottoes stow thy spoils and arms,'
</p>
<p>
"She said. Obedient to her high command<br/>
I quit the place, and hasten to the strand,<br/>
My sad companions on the beach I found,<br/>
Their wistful eyes in floods of sorrow drown'd.
</p>
<p>
"As from fresh pastures and the dewy field<br/>
(When loaded cribs their evening banquet yield)<br/>
The lowing herds return; around them throng<br/>
With leaps and bounds their late imprison'd young,<br/>
Rush to their mothers with unruly joy,<br/>
And echoing hills return the tender cry:<br/>
So round me press'd, exulting at my sight,<br/>
With cries and agonies of wild delight,<br/>
The weeping sailors; nor less fierce their joy<br/>
Than if return'd to Ithaca from Troy.<br/>
'Ah master! ever honour'd, ever dear!<br/>
(These tender words on every side I hear)<br/>
What other joy can equal thy return?<br/>
Not that loved country for whose sight we mourn,<br/>
The soil that nursed us, and that gave us breath:<br/>
But ah! relate our lost companions' death.'
</p>
<p>
"I answer'd cheerful: 'Haste, your galley moor,<br/>
And bring our treasures and our arms ashore:<br/>
Those in yon hollow caverns let us lay,<br/>
Then rise, and follow where I lead the way.<br/>
Your fellows live; believe your eyes, and come<br/>
To taste the joys of Circe's sacred dome.'
</p>
<p>
"With ready speed the joyful crew obey:<br/>
Alone Eurylochus persuades their stay.
</p>
<p>
"'Whither (he cried), ah whither will ye run?<br/>
Seek ye to meet those evils ye should shun?<br/>
Will you the terrors of the dome explore,<br/>
In swine to grovel, or in lions roar,<br/>
Or wolf-like howl away the midnight hour<br/>
In dreadful watch around the magic bower?<br/>
Remember Cyclops, and his bloody deed;<br/>
The leader's rashness made the soldiers bleed.'
</p>
<p>
"I heard incensed, and first resolved to speed<br/>
My flying falchion at the rebel's head.<br/>
Dear as he was, by ties of kindred bound,<br/>
This hand had stretch'd him breathless on the ground.<br/>
But all at once my interposing train<br/>
For mercy pleaded, nor could plead in vain.<br/>
'Leave here the man who dares his prince desert,<br/>
Leave to repentance and his own sad heart,<br/>
To guard the ship. Seek we the sacred shades<br/>
Of Circe's palace, where Ulysses leads.'
</p>
<p>
"This with one voice declared, the rising train<br/>
Left the black vessel by the murmuring main.<br/>
Shame touch'd Eurylochus' alter'd breast:<br/>
He fear'd my threats, and follow'd with the rest.
</p>
<p>
"Meanwhile the goddess, with indulgent cares<br/>
And social joys, the late transform'd repairs;<br/>
The bath, the feast, their fainting soul renews:<br/>
Rich in refulgent robes, and dropping balmy dews:<br/>
Brightening with joy, their eager eyes behold,<br/>
Each other's face, and each his story told;<br/>
Then gushing tears the narrative confound,<br/>
And with their sobs the vaulted roof resound.<br/>
When hush'd their passion, thus the goddess cries:<br/>
'Ulysses, taught by labours to be wise,<br/>
Let this short memory of grief suffice.<br/>
To me are known the various woes ye bore.<br/>
In storms by sea, in perils on the shore;<br/>
Forget whatever was in Fortune's power,<br/>
And share the pleasures of this genial hour.<br/>
Such be your mind as ere ye left your coast,<br/>
Or learn'd to sorrow for a country lost.<br/>
Exiles and wanderers now, where'er ye go,<br/>
Too faithful memory renews your woe:<br/>
The cause removed, habitual griefs remain,<br/>
And the soul saddens by the use of pain.'
</p>
<p>
"Her kind entreaty moved the general breast;<br/>
Tired with long toil, we willing sunk to rest.<br/>
We plied the banquet, and the bowl we crown'd,<br/>
Till the full circle of the year came round.<br/>
But when the seasons following in their train,<br/>
Brought back the months, the days, and hours again;<br/>
As from a lethargy at once they rise,<br/>
And urge their chief with animating cries:
</p>
<p>
"'Is this, Ulysses, our inglorious lot?<br/>
And is the name of Ithaca forgot?<br/>
Shall never the dear land in prospect rise,<br/>
Or the loved palace glitter in our eyes?'<br/>
"Melting I heard; yet till the sun's decline<br/>
Prolong'd the feast, and quaff'd the rosy wine<br/>
But when the shades came on at evening hour,<br/>
And all lay slumbering in the dusky bower,<br/>
I came a suppliant to fair Circe's bed,<br/>
The tender moment seized, and thus I said:<br/>
'Be mindful, goddess! of thy promise made;<br/>
Must sad Ulysses ever be delay'd?<br/>
Around their lord my sad companions mourn,<br/>
Each breast beats homeward, anxious to return:<br/>
If but a moment parted from thy eyes,<br/>
Their tears flow round me, and my heart complies.'
</p>
<p>
"'Go then (she cried), ah go! yet think, not I,<br/>
Not Circe, but the Fates, your wish deny.<br/>
Ah, hope not yet to breathe thy native air!<br/>
Far other journey first demands thy care;<br/>
To tread the uncomfortable paths beneath,<br/>
And view the realms of darkness and of death.<br/>
There seek the Theban bard, deprived of sight;<br/>
Within, irradiate with prophetic light;<br/>
To whom Persephone, entire and whole,<br/>
Gave to retain the unseparated soul:<br/>
The rest are forms, of empty ether made;<br/>
Impassive semblance, and a flitting shade.'
</p>
<p>
"Struck at the word, my very heart was dead:<br/>
Pensive I sate: my tears bedew'd the bed:<br/>
To hate the light and life my soul begun,<br/>
And saw that all was grief beneath the sun:<br/>
Composed at length the gushing tears suppress'd,<br/>
And my toss'd limbs now wearied into rest.<br/>
'How shall I tread (I cried), ah, Circe! say,<br/>
The dark descent, and who shall guide the way?<br/>
Can living eyes behold the realms below?<br/>
What bark to waft me, and what wind to blow?'
</p>
<p>
"'Thy fated road (the magic power replied),<br/>
Divine Ulysses! ask no mortal guide.<br/>
Rear but the mast, the spacious sail display,<br/>
The northern winds shall wing thee on thy way.<br/>
Soon shalt thou reach old Ocean's utmost ends,<br/>
Where to the main the shelving shore descends;<br/>
The barren trees of Proserpine's black woods,<br/>
Poplars and willows trembling o'er the floods:<br/>
There fix thy vessel in the lonely bay,<br/>
And enter there the kingdoms void of day,<br/>
Where Phlegethon's loud torrents, rushing down,<br/>
Hiss in the flaming gulf of Acheron;<br/>
And where, slow rolling from the Stygian bed,<br/>
Cocytus' lamentable waters spread:<br/>
Where the dark rock o'erhangs the infernal lake,<br/>
And mingling streams eternal murmurs make.<br/>
First draw thy falchion, and on every side<br/>
Trench the black earth a cubit long and wide:<br/>
To all the shades around libations pour,<br/>
And o'er the ingredients strew the hallow'd flour:<br/>
New wine and milk, with honey temper'd bring,<br/>
And living water from the crystal spring.<br/>
Then the wan shades and feeble ghosts implore,<br/>
With promised offerings on thy native shore;<br/>
A barren cow, the stateliest of the isle,<br/>
And heap'd with various wealth, a blazing pile:<br/>
These to the rest; but to the seer must bleed<br/>
A sable ram, the pride of all thy breed.<br/>
These solemn vows and holy offerings paid<br/>
To all the phantom nations of the dead,<br/>
Be next thy care the sable sheep to place<br/>
Full o'er the pit, and hellward turn their face:<br/>
But from the infernal rite thine eye withdraw,<br/>
And back to Ocean glance with reverend awe.<br/>
Sudden shall skim along the dusky glades<br/>
Thin airy shoals, and visionary shades.<br/>
Then give command the sacrifice to haste,<br/>
Let the flay'd victims in the flame be cast,<br/>
And sacred vows and mystic song applied<br/>
To grisly Pluto and his gloomy bride.<br/>
Wide o'er the pool thy falchion waved around<br/>
Shall drive the spectres from unbidden ground:<br/>
The sacred draught shall all the dead forbear,<br/>
Till awful from the shades arise the seer.<br/>
Let him, oraculous, the end, the way,<br/>
The turns of all thy future fate display,<br/>
Thy pilgrimage to come, and remnant of thy day.'
</p>
<p>
"So speaking, from the ruddy orient shone<br/>
The morn, conspicuous on her golden throne.<br/>
The goddess with a radiant tunic dress'd<br/>
My limbs, and o'er me cast a silken vest.<br/>
Long flowing robes, of purest white, array<br/>
The nymph, that added lustre to the day:<br/>
A tiar wreath'd her head with many a fold;<br/>
Her waist was circled with a zone of gold.<br/>
Forth issuing then, from place to place I flew;<br/>
Rouse man by man, and animate my crew.<br/>
'Rise, rise, my mates! 'tis Circe gives command:<br/>
Our journey calls us; haste, and quit the land.'<br/>
All rise and follow, yet depart not all,<br/>
For Fate decreed one wretched man to fall.
</p>
<p>
"A youth there was, Elpenor was he named,<br/>
Not much for sense, nor much for courage famed:<br/>
The youngest of our band, a vulgar soul,<br/>
Born but to banquet, and to drain the bowl.<br/>
He, hot and careless, on a turret's height<br/>
With sleep repair'd the long debauch of night:<br/>
The sudden tumult stirred him where he lay,<br/>
And down he hasten'd, but forgot the way;<br/>
Full headlong from the roof the sleeper fell,<br/>
And snapp'd the spinal joint, and waked in hell.
</p>
<p>
"The rest crowd round me with an eager look;<br/>
I met them with a sigh, and thus bespoke:<br/>
'Already, friends! ye think your toils are o'er,<br/>
Your hopes already touch your native shore:<br/>
Alas! far otherwise the nymph declares,<br/>
Far other journey first demands our cares;<br/>
To tread the uncomfortable paths beneath,<br/>
The dreary realms of darkness and of death;<br/>
To seek Tiresias' awful shade below,<br/>
And thence our fortunes and our fates to know.'
</p>
<p>
"My sad companions heard in deep despair;<br/>
Frantic they tore their manly growth of hair;<br/>
To earth they fell: the tears began to rain;<br/>
But tears in mortal miseries are vain,<br/>
Sadly they fared along the sea-beat shore;<br/>
Still heaved their hearts, and still their eyes ran o'er.<br/>
The ready victims at our bark we found,<br/>
The sable ewe and ram together bound.<br/>
For swift as thought the goddess had been there,<br/>
And thence had glided, viewless as the air:<br/>
The paths of gods what mortal can survey?<br/>
Who eyes their motion? who shall trace their way?"

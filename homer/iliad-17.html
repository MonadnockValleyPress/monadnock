<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XVII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,<br/>
Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.<br/>
Great Menelaus, touch'd with generous woe,<br/>
Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe.<br/>
Thus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,<br/>
Fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;<br/>
And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)<br/>
Turns, and re-turns her, with a mother's care,<br/>
Opposed to each that near the carcase came,<br/>
His broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The son of Panthus, skill'd the dart to send,<br/>
Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.<br/>
"This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;<br/>
Warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:<br/>
To me the spoils my prowess won, resign:<br/>
Depart with life, and leave the glory mine."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn'd<br/>
With generous anguish, and in scorn return'd:<br/>
"Laugh'st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,<br/>
When mortals boast of prowess not their own?<br/>
Not thus the lion glories in his might,<br/>
Nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,<br/>
Nor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)<br/>
Man only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.<br/>
But far the vainest of the boastful kind,<br/>
These sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.<br/>
Yet 'twas but late, beneath my conquering steel<br/>
This boaster's brother, Hyperenor, fell;<br/>
Against our arm which rashly he defied,<br/>
Vain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.<br/>
These eyes beheld him on the dust expire,<br/>
No more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.<br/>
Presumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,<br/>
Go, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;<br/>
Or, while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;<br/>
Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Unmoved, Euphorbus thus: "That action known,<br/>
Come, for my brother's blood repay thy own.<br/>
His weeping father claims thy destined head,<br/>
And spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.<br/>
On these thy conquer'd spoils I shall bestow,<br/>
To soothe a consort's and a parent's woe.<br/>
No longer then defer the glorious strife,<br/>
Let heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift as the word the missile lance he flings;<br/>
The well-aim'd weapon on the buckler rings,<br/>
But blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.<br/>
On Jove the father great Atrides calls,<br/>
Nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,<br/>
It pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;<br/>
Wide through the neck appears the grisly wound,<br/>
Prone sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.<br/>
The shining circlets of his golden hair,<br/>
Which even the Graces might be proud to wear,<br/>
Instarr'd with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,<br/>
With dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with gore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As the young olive, in some sylvan scene,<br/>
Crown'd by fresh fountains with eternal green,<br/>
Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,<br/>
And plays and dances to the gentle air;<br/>
When lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades<br/>
The tender plant, and withers all its shades;<br/>
It lies uprooted from its genial bed,<br/>
A lovely ruin now defaced and dead:<br/>
Thus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,<br/>
While the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.<br/>
Proud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,<br/>
Affrighted Troy the towering victor flies:<br/>
Flies, as before some mountain lion's ire<br/>
The village curs and trembling swains retire,<br/>
When o'er the slaughter'd bull they hear him roar,<br/>
And see his jaws distil with smoking gore:<br/>
All pale with fear, at distance scatter'd round,<br/>
They shout incessant, and the vales resound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Apollo view'd with envious eyes,<br/>
And urged great Hector to dispute the prize;<br/>
(In Mentes' shape, beneath whose martial care<br/>
The rough Ciconians learn'd the trade of war;)<br/>
"Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase<br/>
Achilles' coursers, of ethereal race;<br/>
They stoop not, these, to mortal man's command,<br/>
Or stoop to none but great Achilles' hand.<br/>
Too long amused with a pursuit so vain,<br/>
Turn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;<br/>
By Sparta slain! for ever now suppress'd<br/>
The fire which burn'd in that undaunted breast!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus having spoke, Apollo wing'd his flight,<br/>
And mix'd with mortals in the toils of fight:<br/>
His words infix'd unutterable care<br/>
Deep in great Hector's soul: through all the war<br/>
He darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view'd<br/>
The breathless hero in his blood imbued,<br/>
(Forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay)<br/>
And in the victor's hands the shining prey.<br/>
Sheath'd in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,<br/>
And sends his voice in thunder to the skies:<br/>
Fierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent,<br/>
It flew, and fired the nations as it went.<br/>
Atrides from the voice the storm divined,<br/>
And thus explored his own unconquer'd mind:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain,<br/>
Slain in my cause, and for my honour slain!<br/>
Desert the arms, the relics, of my friend?<br/>
Or singly, Hector and his troops attend?<br/>
Sure where such partial favour heaven bestow'd,<br/>
To brave the hero were to brave the god:<br/>
Forgive me, Greece, if once I quit the field;<br/>
'Tis not to Hector, but to heaven I yield.<br/>
Yet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,<br/>
Did but the voice of Ajax reach my ear:<br/>
Still would we turn, still battle on the plains,<br/>
And give Achilles all that yet remains<br/>
Of his and our Patroclus—" This, no more<br/>
The time allow'd: Troy thicken'd on the shore.<br/>
A sable scene! The terrors Hector led.<br/>
Slow he recedes, and sighing quits the dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So from the fold the unwilling lion parts,<br/>
Forced by loud clamours, and a storm of darts;<br/>
He flies indeed, but threatens as he flies,<br/>
With heart indignant and retorted eyes.<br/>
Now enter'd in the Spartan ranks, he turn'd<br/>
His manly breast, and with new fury burn'd;<br/>
O'er all the black battalions sent his view,<br/>
And through the cloud the godlike Ajax knew;<br/>
Where labouring on the left the warrior stood,<br/>
All grim in arms, and cover'd o'er with blood;<br/>
There breathing courage, where the god of day<br/>
Had sunk each heart with terror and dismay.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To him the king: "Oh Ajax, oh my friend!<br/>
Haste, and Patroclus' loved remains defend:<br/>
The body to Achilles to restore<br/>
Demands our care; alas, we can no more!<br/>
For naked now, despoiled of arms, he lies;<br/>
And Hector glories in the dazzling prize."<br/>
He said, and touch'd his heart. The raging pair<br/>
Pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.<br/>
Already had stern Hector seized his head,<br/>
And doom'd to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;<br/>
But soon as Ajax rear'd his tower-like shield,<br/>
Sprung to his car, and measured back the field,<br/>
His train to Troy the radiant armour bear,<br/>
To stand a trophy of his fame in war.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display'd)<br/>
Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;<br/>
And now before, and now behind he stood:<br/>
Thus in the centre of some gloomy wood,<br/>
With many a step, the lioness surrounds<br/>
Her tawny young, beset by men and hounds;<br/>
Elate her heart, and rousing all her powers,<br/>
Dark o'er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.<br/>
Fast by his side the generous Spartan glows<br/>
With great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,<br/>
On Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Where now in Hector shall we Hector find?<br/>
A manly form, without a manly mind.<br/>
Is this, O chief! a hero's boasted fame?<br/>
How vain, without the merit, is the name!<br/>
Since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ<br/>
What other methods may preserve thy Troy:<br/>
'Tis time to try if Ilion's state can stand<br/>
By thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:<br/>
Mean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake<br/>
Their lives for you? those Lycians you forsake?<br/>
What from thy thankless arms can we expect?<br/>
Thy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect;<br/>
Say, shall our slaughter'd bodies guard your walls,<br/>
While unreveng'd the great Sarpedon falls?<br/>
Even where he died for Troy, you left him there,<br/>
A feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.<br/>
On my command if any Lycian wait,<br/>
Hence let him march, and give up Troy to fate.<br/>
Did such a spirit as the gods impart<br/>
Impel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart,<br/>
(Such as should burn in every soul that draws<br/>
The sword for glory, and his country's cause)<br/>
Even yet our mutual arms we might employ,<br/>
And drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.<br/>
Oh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain<br/>
Sarpedon's arms and honour'd corse again!<br/>
Greece with Achilles' friend should be repaid,<br/>
And thus due honours purchased to his shade.<br/>
But words are vain—Let Ajax once appear,<br/>
And Hector trembles and recedes with fear;<br/>
Thou dar'st not meet the terrors of his eye;<br/>
And lo! already thou prepar'st to fly."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Trojan chief with fix'd resentment eyed<br/>
The Lycian leader, and sedate replied:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Say, is it just, my friend, that Hector's ear<br/>
From such a warrior such a speech should hear?<br/>
I deem'd thee once the wisest of thy kind,<br/>
But ill this insult suits a prudent mind.<br/>
I shun great Ajax? I desert my train?<br/>
'Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain;<br/>
I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,<br/>
And hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.<br/>
But Jove's high will is ever uncontroll'd,<br/>
The strong he withers, and confounds the bold;<br/>
Now crowns with fame the mighty man, and now<br/>
Strikes the fresh garland from the victor's brow!<br/>
Come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,<br/>
And thou be witness, if I fear to-day;<br/>
If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread,<br/>
Or yet their hero dare defend the dead."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then turning to the martial hosts, he cries:<br/>
"Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies!<br/>
Be men, my friends, in action as in name,<br/>
And yet be mindful of your ancient fame.<br/>
Hector in proud Achilles' arms shall shine,<br/>
Torn from his friend, by right of conquest mine."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He strode along the field, as thus he said:<br/>
(The sable plumage nodded o'er his head:)<br/>
Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look;<br/>
One instant saw, one instant overtook<br/>
The distant band, that on the sandy shore<br/>
The radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.<br/>
There his own mail unbraced the field bestrow'd;<br/>
His train to Troy convey'd the massy load.<br/>
Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands;<br/>
The work and present of celestial hands;<br/>
By aged Peleus to Achilles given,<br/>
As first to Peleus by the court of heaven:<br/>
His father's arms not long Achilles wears,<br/>
Forbid by fate to reach his father's years.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,<br/>
The god whose thunder rends the troubled air<br/>
Beheld with pity; as apart he sat,<br/>
And, conscious, look'd through all the scene of fate.<br/>
He shook the sacred honours of his head;<br/>
Olympus trembled, and the godhead said;<br/>
"Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!<br/>
A moment's glory; and what fates attend!<br/>
In heavenly panoply divinely bright<br/>
Thou stand'st, and armies tremble at thy sight,<br/>
As at Achilles' self! beneath thy dart<br/>
Lies slain the great Achilles' dearer part.<br/>
Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,<br/>
Which once the greatest of mankind had worn.<br/>
Yet live! I give thee one illustrious day,<br/>
A blaze of glory ere thou fad'st away.<br/>
For ah! no more Andromache shall come<br/>
With joyful tears to welcome Hector home;<br/>
No more officious, with endearing charms,<br/>
From thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides' arms!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then with his sable brow he gave the nod<br/>
That seals his word; the sanction of the god.<br/>
The stubborn arms (by Jove's command disposed)<br/>
Conform'd spontaneous, and around him closed:<br/>
Fill'd with the god, enlarged his members grew,<br/>
Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew,<br/>
The blood in brisker tides began to roll,<br/>
And Mars himself came rushing on his soul.<br/>
Exhorting loud through all the field he strode,<br/>
And look'd, and moved, Achilles, or a god.<br/>
Now Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires,<br/>
Now Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires;<br/>
The great Thersilochus like fury found,<br/>
Asteropaeus kindled at the sound,<br/>
And Ennomus, in augury renown'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber'd bands<br/>
Of neighbouring nations, or of distant lands!<br/>
'Twas not for state we summon'd you so far,<br/>
To boast our numbers, and the pomp of war:<br/>
Ye came to fight; a valiant foe to chase,<br/>
To save our present, and our future race.<br/>
For this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy,<br/>
And glean the relics of exhausted Troy.<br/>
Now then, to conquer or to die prepare;<br/>
To die or conquer are the terms of war.<br/>
Whatever hand shall win Patroclus slain,<br/>
Whoe'er shall drag him to the Trojan train,<br/>
With Hector's self shall equal honours claim;<br/>
With Hector part the spoil, and share the fame."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,<br/>
They join, they thicken, they protend their spears;<br/>
Full on the Greeks they drive in firm array,<br/>
And each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey:<br/>
Vain hope! what numbers shall the field o'erspread,<br/>
What victims perish round the mighty dead!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Great Ajax mark'd the growing storm from far,<br/>
And thus bespoke his brother of the war:<br/>
"Our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend;<br/>
And all our wars and glories at an end!<br/>
'Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,<br/>
Condemn'd to vultures on the Trojan plain;<br/>
We too must yield: the same sad fate must fall<br/>
On thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.<br/>
See what a tempest direful Hector spreads,<br/>
And lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads!<br/>
Call on our Greeks, if any hear the call,<br/>
The bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The warrior raised his voice, and wide around<br/>
The field re-echoed the distressful sound.<br/>
"O chiefs! O princes, to whose hand is given<br/>
The rule of men; whose glory is from heaven!<br/>
Whom with due honours both Atrides grace:<br/>
Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race!<br/>
All, whom this well-known voice shall reach from far,<br/>
All, whom I see not through this cloud of war;<br/>
Come all! let generous rage your arms employ,<br/>
And save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oilean Ajax first the voice obey'd,<br/>
Swift was his pace, and ready was his aid:<br/>
Next him Idomeneus, more slow with age,<br/>
And Merion, burning with a hero's rage.<br/>
The long-succeeding numbers who can name?<br/>
But all were Greeks, and eager all for fame.<br/>
Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng;<br/>
Whole Troy embodied rush'd with shouts along.<br/>
Thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves,<br/>
Where some swoln river disembogues his waves,<br/>
Full in the mouth is stopp'd the rushing tide,<br/>
The boiling ocean works from side to side,<br/>
The river trembles to his utmost shore,<br/>
And distant rocks re-bellow to the roar.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor less resolved, the firm Achaian band<br/>
With brazen shields in horrid circle stand.<br/>
Jove, pouring darkness o'er the mingled fight,<br/>
Conceals the warriors' shining helms in night:<br/>
To him, the chief for whom the hosts contend<br/>
Had lived not hateful, for he lived a friend:<br/>
Dead he protects him with superior care.<br/>
Nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The first attack the Grecians scarce sustain,<br/>
Repulsed, they yield; the Trojans seize the slain.<br/>
Then fierce they rally, to revenge led on<br/>
By the swift rage of Ajax Telamon.<br/>
(Ajax to Peleus' son the second name,<br/>
In graceful stature next, and next in fame.)<br/>
With headlong force the foremost ranks he tore;<br/>
So through the thicket bursts the mountain boar,<br/>
And rudely scatters, for a distance round,<br/>
The frighted hunter and the baying hound.<br/>
The son of Lethus, brave Pelasgus' heir,<br/>
Hippothous, dragg'd the carcase through the war;<br/>
The sinewy ankles bored, the feet he bound<br/>
With thongs inserted through the double wound:<br/>
Inevitable fate o'ertakes the deed;<br/>
Doom'd by great Ajax' vengeful lance to bleed:<br/>
It cleft the helmet's brazen cheeks in twain;<br/>
The shatter'd crest and horse-hair strow the plain:<br/>
With nerves relax'd he tumbles to the ground:<br/>
The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound:<br/>
He drops Patroclus' foot, and o'er him spread,<br/>
Now lies a sad companion of the dead:<br/>
Far from Larissa lies, his native air,<br/>
And ill requites his parents' tender care.<br/>
Lamented youth! in life's first bloom he fell,<br/>
Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once more at Ajax Hector's javelin flies;<br/>
The Grecian marking, as it cut the skies,<br/>
Shunn'd the descending death; which hissing on,<br/>
Stretch'd in the dust the great Iphytus' son,<br/>
Schedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind<br/>
The boldest warrior and the noblest mind:<br/>
In little Panope, for strength renown'd,<br/>
He held his seat, and ruled the realms around.<br/>
Plunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood,<br/>
And deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;<br/>
In clanging arms the hero fell and all<br/>
The fields resounded with his weighty fall.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Phorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends,<br/>
The Telamonian lance his belly rends;<br/>
The hollow armour burst before the stroke,<br/>
And through the wound the rushing entrails broke:<br/>
In strong convulsions panting on the sands<br/>
He lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Struck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:<br/>
The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.<br/>
And now had Troy, by Greece compell'd to yield,<br/>
Fled to her ramparts, and resign'd the field;<br/>
Greece, in her native fortitude elate,<br/>
With Jove averse, had turn'd the scale of fate:<br/>
But Phoebus urged Æneas to the fight;<br/>
He seem'd like aged Periphas to sight:<br/>
(A herald in Anchises' love grown old,<br/>
Revered for prudence, and with prudence bold.)<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus he—"What methods yet, O chief! remain,<br/>
To save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain?<br/>
There have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,<br/>
By valour, numbers, and by arts of war,<br/>
Have forced the powers to spare a sinking state,<br/>
And gain'd at length the glorious odds of fate:<br/>
But you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares<br/>
His partial favour, and assists your wars,<br/>
Your shameful efforts 'gainst yourselves employ,<br/>
And force the unwilling god to ruin Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Æneas through the form assumed descries<br/>
The power conceal'd, and thus to Hector cries:<br/>
"Oh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey,<br/>
We seek our ramparts, and desert the day.<br/>
A god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,<br/>
And tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:<br/>
The bold example all his hosts pursue.<br/>
Then, first, Leocritus beneath him bled,<br/>
In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede;<br/>
Who view'd his fall, and, grieving at the chance,<br/>
Swift to revenge it sent his angry lance;<br/>
The whirling lance, with vigorous force address'd,<br/>
Descends, and pants in Apisaon's breast;<br/>
From rich Paeonia's vales the warrior came,<br/>
Next thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame.<br/>
Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain,<br/>
And rush'd to combat, but he rush'd in vain:<br/>
Indissolubly firm, around the dead,<br/>
Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,<br/>
And hemm'd with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,<br/>
A brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.<br/>
Great Ajax eyes them with incessant care,<br/>
And in an orb contracts the crowded war,<br/>
Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall,<br/>
And stands the centre and the soul of all:<br/>
Fix'd on the spot they war, and wounded, wound;<br/>
A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:<br/>
On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,<br/>
And, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Greece, in close order, and collected might,<br/>
Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;<br/>
Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,<br/>
And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.<br/>
In one thick darkness all the fight was lost;<br/>
The sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host<br/>
Seem'd as extinct: day ravish'd from their eyes,<br/>
And all heaven's splendours blotted from the skies.<br/>
Such o'er Patroclus' body hung the night,<br/>
The rest in sunshine fought, and open light;<br/>
Unclouded there, the aerial azure spread,<br/>
No vapour rested on the mountain's head,<br/>
The golden sun pour'd forth a stronger ray,<br/>
And all the broad expansion flamed with day.<br/>
Dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,<br/>
And here and there their scatter'd arrows light:<br/>
But death and darkness o'er the carcase spread,<br/>
There burn'd the war, and there the mighty bled.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear,<br/>
(Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,<br/>
And skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command,<br/>
When from the ships he sent the Pylian band.<br/>
The youthful brothers thus for fame contend,<br/>
Nor knew the fortune of Achilles' friend;<br/>
In thought they view'd him still, with martial joy,<br/>
Glorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But round the corse the heroes pant for breath,<br/>
And thick and heavy grows the work of death:<br/>
O'erlabour'd now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,<br/>
Their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o'er;<br/>
Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,<br/>
And carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.<br/>
As when a slaughter'd bull's yet reeking hide,<br/>
Strain'd with full force, and tugg'd from side to side,<br/>
The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o'er<br/>
The extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:<br/>
So tugging round the corse both armies stood;<br/>
The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;<br/>
While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,<br/>
Now to the ships to force it, now to Troy.<br/>
Not Pallas' self, her breast when fury warms,<br/>
Nor he whose anger sets the world in arms,<br/>
Could blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign'd;<br/>
Such, Jove to honour the great dead ordain'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Achilles in his ships at distance lay,<br/>
Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day;<br/>
He, yet unconscious of Patroclus' fall,<br/>
In dust extended under Ilion's wall,<br/>
Expects him glorious from the conquered plain,<br/>
And for his wish'd return prepares in vain;<br/>
Though well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend<br/>
Was more than heaven had destined to his friend.<br/>
Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal'd;<br/>
The rest, in pity to her son, conceal'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Still raged the conflict round the hero dead,<br/>
And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.<br/>
"Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)<br/>
Who dares desert this well-disputed day!<br/>
First may the cleaving earth before our eyes<br/>
Gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice;<br/>
First perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast<br/>
We lost Patroclus, and our glory lost!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus they: while with one voice the Trojans said,<br/>
"Grant this day, Jove! or heap us on the dead!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then clash their sounding arms; the clangours rise,<br/>
And shake the brazen concave of the skies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meantime, at distance from the scene of blood,<br/>
The pensive steeds of great Achilles stood:<br/>
Their godlike master slain before their eyes,<br/>
They wept, and shared in human miseries.<br/>
In vain Automedon now shakes the rein,<br/>
Now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain;<br/>
Nor to the fight nor Hellespont they go,<br/>
Restive they stood, and obstinate in woe:<br/>
Still as a tombstone, never to be moved,<br/>
On some good man or woman unreproved<br/>
Lays its eternal weight; or fix'd, as stands<br/>
A marble courser by the sculptor's hands,<br/>
Placed on the hero's grave. Along their face<br/>
The big round drops coursed down with silent pace,<br/>
Conglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late<br/>
Circled their arched necks, and waved in state,<br/>
Trail'd on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,<br/>
And prone to earth was hung their languid head:<br/>
Nor Jove disdain'd to cast a pitying look,<br/>
While thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Unhappy coursers of immortal strain,<br/>
Exempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;<br/>
Did we your race on mortal man bestow,<br/>
Only, alas! to share in mortal woe?<br/>
For ah! what is there of inferior birth,<br/>
That breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth;<br/>
What wretched creature of what wretched kind,<br/>
Than man more weak, calamitous, and blind?<br/>
A miserable race! but cease to mourn:<br/>
For not by you shall Priam's son be borne<br/>
High on the splendid car: one glorious prize<br/>
He rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.<br/>
Ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart,<br/>
Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart.<br/>
Automedon your rapid flight shall bear<br/>
Safe to the navy through the storm of war.<br/>
For yet 'tis given to Troy to ravage o'er<br/>
The field, and spread her slaughters to the shore;<br/>
The sun shall see her conquer, till his fall<br/>
With sacred darkness shades the face of all."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; and breathing in the immortal horse<br/>
Excessive spirit, urged them to the course;<br/>
From their high manes they shake the dust, and bear<br/>
The kindling chariot through the parted war:<br/>
So flies a vulture through the clamorous train<br/>
Of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.<br/>
From danger now with swiftest speed they flew,<br/>
And now to conquest with like speed pursue;<br/>
Sole in the seat the charioteer remains,<br/>
Now plies the javelin, now directs the reins:<br/>
Him brave Alcimedon beheld distress'd,<br/>
Approach'd the chariot, and the chief address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,<br/>
Alone, unaided, in the thickest war?<br/>
Alas! thy friend is slain, and Hector wields<br/>
Achilles' arms triumphant in the fields."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"In happy time (the charioteer replies)<br/>
The bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes;<br/>
No Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,<br/>
Or holds their fury in suspended reins:<br/>
Patroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,<br/>
But now Patroclus is an empty name!<br/>
To thee I yield the seat, to thee resign<br/>
The ruling charge: the task of fight be mine."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said. Alcimedon, with active heat,<br/>
Snatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.<br/>
His friend descends. The chief of Troy descried,<br/>
And call'd Æneas fighting near his side.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,<br/>
Achilles' car, deserted of its lord!<br/>
The glorious steeds our ready arms invite,<br/>
Scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.<br/>
Can such opponents stand when we assail?<br/>
Unite thy force, my friend, and we prevail."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The son of Venus to the counsel yields;<br/>
Then o'er their backs they spread their solid shields:<br/>
With brass refulgent the broad surface shined,<br/>
And thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.<br/>
Them Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds;<br/>
Each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:<br/>
In vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,<br/>
In vain advance! not fated to return.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Unmov'd, Automedon attends the fight,<br/>
Implores the Eternal, and collects his might.<br/>
Then turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:<br/>
"Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!<br/>
Full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,<br/>
For hard the fight, determined is the foe;<br/>
'Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,<br/>
War knows no mean; he wins it or he dies."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then through the field he sends his voice aloud,<br/>
And calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,<br/>
With great Atrides. "Hither turn, (he said,)<br/>
Turn where distress demands immediate aid;<br/>
The dead, encircled by his friends, forego,<br/>
And save the living from a fiercer foe.<br/>
Unhelp'd we stand, unequal to engage<br/>
The force of Hector, and Æneas' rage:<br/>
Yet mighty as they are, my force to prove<br/>
Is only mine: the event belongs to Jove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,<br/>
Which pass'd the shield of Aretus the young:<br/>
It pierced his belt, emboss'd with curious art,<br/>
Then in the lower belly struck the dart.<br/>
As when a ponderous axe, descending full,<br/>
Cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:<br/>
Struck 'twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,<br/>
Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:<br/>
Thus fell the youth; the air his soul received,<br/>
And the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now at Automedon the Trojan foe<br/>
Discharged his lance; the meditated blow,<br/>
Stooping, he shunn'd; the javelin idly fled,<br/>
And hiss'd innoxious o'er the hero's head;<br/>
Deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear<br/>
In long vibrations spent its fury there.<br/>
With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,<br/>
But each brave Ajax heard, and interposed;<br/>
Nor longer Hector with his Trojans stood,<br/>
But left their slain companion in his blood:<br/>
His arms Automedon divests, and cries,<br/>
"Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice:<br/>
Thus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,<br/>
Poor as it is, some offering to thy shade."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So looks the lion o'er a mangled boar,<br/>
All grim with rage, and horrible with gore;<br/>
High on the chariot at one bound he sprung,<br/>
And o'er his seat the bloody trophies hung.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now Minerva from the realms of air<br/>
Descends impetuous, and renews the war;<br/>
For, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid,<br/>
The lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.<br/>
As when high Jove denouncing future woe,<br/>
O'er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,<br/>
(In sign of tempests from the troubled air,<br/>
Or from the rage of man, destructive war,)<br/>
The drooping cattle dread the impending skies,<br/>
And from his half-till'd field the labourer flies:<br/>
In such a form the goddess round her drew<br/>
A livid cloud, and to the battle flew.<br/>
Assuming Phoenix' shape on earth she falls,<br/>
And in his well-known voice to Sparta calls:<br/>
"And lies Achilles' friend, beloved by all,<br/>
A prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall?<br/>
What shame 'o Greece for future times to tell,<br/>
To thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!"<br/>
"O chief, O father! (Atreus' son replies)<br/>
O full of days! by long experience wise!<br/>
What more desires my soul, than here unmoved<br/>
To guard the body of the man I loved?<br/>
Ah, would Minerva send me strength to rear<br/>
This wearied arm, and ward the storm of war!<br/>
But Hector, like the rage of fire, we dread,<br/>
And Jove's own glories blaze around his head!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pleased to be first of all the powers address'd,<br/>
She breathes new vigour in her hero's breast,<br/>
And fills with keen revenge, with fell despite,<br/>
Desire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.<br/>
So burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o'er),<br/>
Repulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore;<br/>
(Bold son of air and heat) on angry wings<br/>
Untamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.<br/>
Fired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew,<br/>
And sent his soul with every lance he threw.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame,<br/>
Aetion's son, and Podes was his name:<br/>
With riches honour'd, and with courage bless'd,<br/>
By Hector loved, his comrade, and his guest;<br/>
Through his broad belt the spear a passage found,<br/>
And, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.<br/>
Sudden at Hector's side Apollo stood,<br/>
Like Phaenops, Asius' son, appear'd the god;<br/>
(Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign<br/>
In fair Abydos, by the rolling main.)<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Oh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame!<br/>
What Grecian now shall tremble at thy name?<br/>
Dost thou at length to Menelaus yield,<br/>
A chief once thought no terror of the field?<br/>
Yet singly, now, the long-disputed prize<br/>
He bears victorious, while our army flies:<br/>
By the same arm illustrious Podes bled;<br/>
The friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!"<br/>
This heard, o'er Hector spreads a cloud of woe,<br/>
Rage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But now the Eternal shook his sable shield,<br/>
That shaded Ide and all the subject field<br/>
Beneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud<br/>
Involved the mount; the thunder roar'd aloud;<br/>
The affrighted hills from their foundations nod,<br/>
And blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:<br/>
At one regard of his all-seeing eye<br/>
The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors fly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;<br/>
For as the brave Boeotian turn'd his head<br/>
To face the foe, Polydamas drew near,<br/>
And razed his shoulder with a shorten'd spear:<br/>
By Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain,<br/>
Pierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,<br/>
Grasps his once formidable lance in vain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As Hector follow'd, Idomen address'd<br/>
The flaming javelin to his manly breast;<br/>
The brittle point before his corslet yields;<br/>
Exulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:<br/>
High on his chariots the Cretan stood,<br/>
The son of Priam whirl'd the massive wood.<br/>
But erring from its aim, the impetuous spear<br/>
Struck to the dust the squire and charioteer<br/>
Of martial Merion: Coeranus his name,<br/>
Who left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.<br/>
On foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low,<br/>
Had graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe,<br/>
But the brave squire the ready coursers brought,<br/>
And with his life his master's safety bought.<br/>
Between his cheek and ear the weapon went,<br/>
The teeth it shatter'd, and the tongue it rent.<br/>
Prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain;<br/>
His dying hand forgets the falling rein:<br/>
This Merion reaches, bending from the car,<br/>
And urges to desert the hopeless war:<br/>
Idomeneus consents; the lash applies;<br/>
And the swift chariot to the navy flies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Not Ajax less the will of heaven descried,<br/>
And conquest shifting to the Trojan side,<br/>
Turn'd by the hand of Jove. Then thus begun,<br/>
To Atreus's seed, the godlike Telamon:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Alas! who sees not Jove's almighty hand<br/>
Transfers the glory to the Trojan band?<br/>
Whether the weak or strong discharge the dart,<br/>
He guides each arrow to a Grecian heart:<br/>
Not so our spears; incessant though they rain,<br/>
He suffers every lance to fall in vain.<br/>
Deserted of the god, yet let us try<br/>
What human strength and prudence can supply;<br/>
If yet this honour'd corse, in triumph borne,<br/>
May glad the fleets that hope not our return,<br/>
Who tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates,<br/>
And still hear Hector thundering at their gates.<br/>
Some hero too must be despatch'd to bear<br/>
The mournful message to Pelides' ear;<br/>
For sure he knows not, distant on the shore,<br/>
His friend, his loved Patroclus, is no more.<br/>
But such a chief I spy not through the host:<br/>
The men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost<br/>
In general darkness—Lord of earth and air!<br/>
Oh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer:<br/>
Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;<br/>
Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more:<br/>
If Greece must perish, we thy will obey,<br/>
But let us perish in the face of day!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
With tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer<br/>
The god relenting clear'd the clouded air;<br/>
Forth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray;<br/>
The blaze of armour flash'd against the day.<br/>
"Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight;<br/>
If yet Antilochus survives the fight,<br/>
Let him to great Achilles' ear convey<br/>
The fatal news"—Atrides hastes away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So turns the lion from the nightly fold,<br/>
Though high in courage, and with hunger bold,<br/>
Long gall'd by herdsmen, and long vex'd by hounds,<br/>
Stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;<br/>
The darts fly round him from a hundred hands,<br/>
And the red terrors of the blazing brands:<br/>
Till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day<br/>
Sour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,<br/>
So moved Atrides from his dangerous place<br/>
With weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;<br/>
The foe, he fear'd, might yet Patroclus gain,<br/>
And much admonish'd, much adjured his train:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O guard these relics to your charge consign'd,<br/>
And bear the merits of the dead in mind;<br/>
How skill'd he was in each obliging art;<br/>
The mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:<br/>
He was, alas! but fate decreed his end,<br/>
In death a hero, as in life a friend!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
So parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew,<br/>
And round on all sides sent his piercing view.<br/>
As the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye<br/>
Of all that wings the mid aërial sky,<br/>
The sacred eagle, from his walks above<br/>
Looks down, and sees the distant thicket move;<br/>
Then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,<br/>
Snatches his life amid the clouds of air.<br/>
Not with less quickness, his exerted sight<br/>
Pass'd this and that way, through the ranks of fight:<br/>
Till on the left the chief he sought, he found,<br/>
Cheering his men, and spreading deaths around:<br/>
</p>
<p>
To him the king: "Beloved of Jove! draw near,<br/>
For sadder tidings never touch'd thy ear;<br/>
Thy eyes have witness'd what a fatal turn!<br/>
How Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn.<br/>
This is not all: Patroclus, on the shore<br/>
Now pale and dead, shall succour Greece no more.<br/>
Fly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell<br/>
The sad Achilles, how his loved-one fell:<br/>
He too may haste the naked corse to gain:<br/>
The arms are Hector's, who despoil'd the slain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The youthful warrior heard with silent woe,<br/>
From his fair eyes the tears began to flow:<br/>
Big with the mighty grief, he strove to say<br/>
What sorrow dictates, but no word found way.<br/>
To brave Laodocus his arms he flung,<br/>
Who, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;<br/>
Then ran the mournful message to impart,<br/>
With tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands<br/>
(Though sore distress'd) to aid the Pylian bands;<br/>
But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;<br/>
Himself returns to his Patroclus slain.<br/>
"Gone is Antilochus (the hero said);<br/>
But hope not, warriors, for Achilles' aid:<br/>
Though fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,<br/>
Unarm'd, he fights not with the Trojan foe.<br/>
'Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,<br/>
'Tis our own vigour must the dead regain,<br/>
And save ourselves, while with impetuous hate<br/>
Troy pours along, and this way rolls our fate."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"'Tis well (said Ajax), be it then thy care,<br/>
With Merion's aid, the weighty corse to rear;<br/>
Myself, and my bold brother will sustain<br/>
The shock of Hector and his charging train:<br/>
Nor fear we armies, fighting side by side;<br/>
What Troy can dare, we have already tried,<br/>
Have tried it, and have stood." The hero said.<br/>
High from the ground the warriors heave the dead.<br/>
A general clamour rises at the sight:<br/>
Loud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.<br/>
Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,<br/>
With rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,<br/>
Voracious hounds, that many a length before<br/>
Their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;<br/>
But if the savage turns his glaring eye,<br/>
They howl aloof, and round the forest fly.<br/>
Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,<br/>
Wave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:<br/>
But Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,<br/>
All pale they tremble and forsake the field.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While thus aloft the hero's corse they bear,<br/>
Behind them rages all the storm of war:<br/>
Confusion, tumult, horror, o'er the throng<br/>
Of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:<br/>
Less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire<br/>
To whelm some city under waves of fire;<br/>
Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,<br/>
Now crack the blazing temples of the gods;<br/>
The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,<br/>
And sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.<br/>
The heroes sweat beneath their honour'd load:<br/>
As when two mules, along the rugged road,<br/>
From the steep mountain with exerted strength<br/>
Drag some vast beam, or mast's unwieldy length;<br/>
Inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,<br/>
The enormous timber lumbering down the hill:<br/>
So these—Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands,<br/>
And breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.<br/>
Thus when a river swell'd with sudden rains<br/>
Spreads his broad waters o'er the level plains,<br/>
Some interposing hill the stream divides,<br/>
And breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.<br/>
Still close they follow, close the rear engage;<br/>
Æneas storms, and Hector foams with rage:<br/>
While Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,<br/>
Wedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,<br/>
That shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung<br/>
High on poised pinions, threats their callow young.<br/>
So from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly,<br/>
Such the wild terror, and the mingled cry:<br/>
Within, without the trench, and all the way,<br/>
Strow'd in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;<br/>
Such horror Jove impress'd! yet still proceeds<br/>
The work of death, and still the battle bleeds.<br/>

<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XXIV</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Cyllenius now to Pluto's dreary reign<br/>
Conveys the dead, a lamentable train!<br/>
The golden wand, that causes sleep to fly,<br/>
Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye,<br/>
That drives the ghosts to realms of night or day,<br/>
Points out the long uncomfortable way.<br/>
Trembling the spectres glide, and plaintive vent<br/>
Thin, hollow screams, along the deep descent.<br/>
As in the cavern of some rifted den,<br/>
Where flock nocturnal bats, and birds obscene;<br/>
Cluster'd they hang, till at some sudden shock<br/>
They move, and murmurs run through all the rock!<br/>
So cowering fled the sable heaps of ghosts,<br/>
And such a scream fill'd all the dismal coasts.<br/>
And now they reach'd the earth's remotest ends,<br/>
And now the gates where evening Sol descends,<br/>
And Leucas' rock, and Ocean's utmost streams,<br/>
And now pervade the dusky land of dreams,<br/>
And rest at last, where souls unbodied dwell<br/>
In ever-flowing meads of asphodel.<br/>
The empty forms of men inhabit there,<br/>
Impassive semblance, images of air!<br/>
Naught else are all that shined on earth before:<br/>
Ajax and great Achilles are no more!<br/>
Yet still a master ghost, the rest he awed,<br/>
The rest adored him, towering as he trod;<br/>
Still at his side is Nestor's son survey'd,<br/>
And loved Patroclus still attends his shade.
</p>
<p>
New as they were to that infernal shore,<br/>
The suitors stopp'd, and gazed the hero o'er.<br/>
When, moving slow, the regal form they view'd<br/>
Of great Atrides: him in pomp pursued<br/>
And solemn sadness through the gloom of hell,<br/>
The train of those who by AEgysthus fell:
</p>
<p>
"O mighty chief! (Pelides thus began)<br/>
Honour'd by Jove above the lot of man!<br/>
King of a hundred kings! to whom resign'd<br/>
The strongest, bravest, greatest of mankind<br/>
Comest thou the first, to view this dreary state?<br/>
And was the noblest, the first mark of Fate,<br/>
Condemn'd to pay the great arrear so soon,<br/>
The lot, which all lament, and none can shun!<br/>
Oh! better hadst thou sunk in Trojan ground,<br/>
With all thy full-blown honours cover'd round;<br/>
Then grateful Greece with streaming eyes might raise<br/>
Historic marbles to record thy praise:<br/>
Thy praise eternal on the faithful stone<br/>
Had with transmissive glories graced thy son.<br/>
But heavier fates were destined to attend:<br/>
What man is happy, till he knows his end?"
</p>
<p>
"O son of Peleus! greater than mankind!<br/>
(Thus Agamemnon's kingly shade rejoin'd)<br/>
Thrice happy thou, to press the martial plain<br/>
'Midst heaps of heroes in thy quarrel slain:<br/>
In clouds of smoke raised by the noble fray,<br/>
Great and terrific e'en in death you lay,<br/>
And deluges of blood flow'd round you every way.<br/>
Nor ceased the strife till Jove himself opposed,<br/>
And all in Tempests the dire evening closed.<br/>
Then to the fleet we bore thy honour'd load,<br/>
And decent on the funeral bed bestow'd;<br/>
Then unguents sweet and tepid streams we shed;<br/>
Tears flow'd from every eye, and o'er the dead<br/>
Each clipp'd the curling honours of his head.<br/>
Struck at the news, thy azure mother came,<br/>
The sea-green sisters waited on the dame:<br/>
A voice of loud lament through all the main<br/>
Was heard; and terror seized the Grecian train:<br/>
Back to their ships the frighted host had fled;<br/>
But Nestor spoke, they listen'd and obey'd<br/>
(From old experience Nestor's counsel springs,<br/>
And long vicissitudes of human things):<br/>
'Forbear your flight: fair Thetis from the main<br/>
To mourn Achilles leads her azure train.'<br/>
Around thee stand the daughters of the deep,<br/>
Robe thee in heavenly vests, and round thee weep:<br/>
Round thee, the Muses, with alternate strain,<br/>
In ever-consecrating verse, complain.<br/>
Each warlike Greek the moving music hears,<br/>
And iron-hearted heroes melt in tears.<br/>
Till seventeen nights and seventeen days return'd<br/>
All that was mortal or immortal mourn'd,<br/>
To flames we gave thee, the succeeding day,<br/>
And fatted sheep and sable oxen slay;<br/>
With oils and honey blazed the augmented fires,<br/>
And, like a god adorn'd, thy earthly part expires.<br/>
Unnumber'd warriors round the burning pile<br/>
Urge the fleet coursers or the racer's toil;<br/>
Thick clouds of dust o'er all the circle rise,<br/>
And the mix'd clamour thunders in the skies.<br/>
Soon as absorb'd in all-embracing flame<br/>
Sunk what was mortal of thy mighty name,<br/>
We then collect thy snowy bones, and place<br/>
With wines and unguents in a golden vase<br/>
(The vase to Thetis Bacchus gave of old,<br/>
And Vulcan's art enrich'd the sculptured gold).<br/>
There, we thy relics, great Achilles! blend<br/>
With dear Patroclus, thy departed friend:<br/>
In the same urn a separate space contains<br/>
Thy next beloved, Antilochus' remains.<br/>
Now all the sons of warlike Greece surround<br/>
Thy destined tomb and cast a mighty mound;<br/>
High on the shore the growing hill we raise,<br/>
That wide the extended Hellespont surveys;<br/>
Where all, from age to age, who pass the coast,<br/>
May point Achilles' tomb, and hail the mighty ghost.<br/>
Thetis herself to all our peers proclaims<br/>
Heroic prizes and exequial games;<br/>
The gods assented; and around thee lay<br/>
Rich spoils and gifts that blazed against the day.<br/>
Oft have I seen with solemn funeral games<br/>
Heroes and kings committed to the flames;<br/>
But strength of youth, or valour of the brave,<br/>
With nobler contest ne'er renown'd a grave.<br/>
Such were the games by azure Thetis given,<br/>
And such thy honours, O beloved of Heaven!<br/>
Dear to mankind thy fame survives, nor fades<br/>
Its bloom eternal in the Stygian shades.<br/>
But what to me avail my honours gone,<br/>
Successful toils, and battles bravely won?<br/>
Doom'd by stern Jove at home to end my life,<br/>
By cursed Ã†gysthus, and a faithless wife!"<br/>
Thus they: while Hermes o'er the dreary plain<br/>
Led the sad numbers by Ulysses slain.<br/>
On each majestic form they cast a view,<br/>
And timorous pass'd, and awfully withdrew.<br/>
But Agamemnon, through the gloomy shade,<br/>
His ancient host Amphimedon survey'd:<br/>
"Son of Melanthius! (he began) O say!<br/>
What cause compell'd so many, and so gay,<br/>
To tread the downward, melancholy way?<br/>
Say, could one city yield a troop so fair?<br/>
Were all these partners of one native air?<br/>
Or did the rage of stormy Neptune sweep<br/>
Your lives at once, and whelm beneath the deep?<br/>
Did nightly thieves, or pirates' cruel bands,<br/>
Drench with your blood your pillaged country's sands?<br/>
Or well-defending some beleaguer'd wall,<br/>
Say,&mdash;for the public did ye greatly fall?<br/>
Inform thy guest: for such I was of yore<br/>
When our triumphant navies touch'd your shore;<br/>
Forced a long month the wintry seas to bear,<br/>
To move the great Ulysses to the war."
</p>
<p>
"O king of men! I faithful shall relate<br/>
(Replied Amphimedon) our hapless fate.<br/>
Ulysses absent, our ambitious aim<br/>
With rival loves pursued his royal dame;<br/>
Her coy reserve, and prudence mix'd with pride,<br/>
Our common suit nor granted, nor denied;<br/>
But close with inward hate our deaths design'd;<br/>
Versed in all arts of wily womankind.<br/>
Her hand, laborious, in delusion spread<br/>
A spacious loom, and mix'd the various thread.<br/>
'Ye peers (she cried) who press to gain my heart,<br/>
Where dead Ulysses claims no more a part,<br/>
Yet a short space your rival suit suspend,<br/>
Till this funereal web my labours end:<br/>
Cease, till to good Laertes I bequeath<br/>
A task of grief, his ornaments of death:<br/>
Lest when the Fates his royal ashes claim,<br/>
The Grecian matrons taint my spotless fame;<br/>
Should he, long honour'd with supreme command,<br/>
Want the last duties of a daughter's hand.'
</p>
<p>
"The fiction pleased, our generous train complies,<br/>
Nor fraud mistrusts in virtue's fair disguise.<br/>
The work she plied, but studious of delay,<br/>
Each following night reversed the toils of day.<br/>
Unheard, unseen, three years her arts prevail;<br/>
The fourth, her maid reveal'd the amazing tale,<br/>
And show'd as unperceived we took our stand,<br/>
The backward labours of her faithless hand.<br/>
Forced she completes it; and before us lay<br/>
The mingled web, whose gold and silver ray<br/>
Display'd the radiance of the night and day.
</p>
<p>
"Just as she finished her illustrious toil,<br/>
Ill fortune led Ulysses to our isle.<br/>
Far in a lonely nook, beside the sea,<br/>
At an old swineherd's rural lodge he lay:<br/>
Thither his son from sandy Pyle repairs,<br/>
And speedy lands, and secretly confers.<br/>
They plan our future ruin, and resort<br/>
Confederate to the city and the court.<br/>
First came the son; the father next succeeds,<br/>
Clad like a beggar, whom Eumaeus leads;<br/>
Propp'd on a staff, deform'd with age and care,<br/>
And hung with rags that flutter'd in the air.<br/>
Who could Ulysses in that form behold?<br/>
Scorn'd by the young, forgotten by the old,<br/>
Ill-used by all! to every wrong resigned,<br/>
Patient he suffered with a constant mind.<br/>
But when, arising in his wrath to obey<br/>
The will of Jove, he gave the vengeance way:<br/>
The scattered arms that hung around the dome<br/>
Careful he treasured in a private room;<br/>
Then to her suitors bade his queen propose<br/>
The archer's strife, the source of future woes,<br/>
And omen of our death! In vain we drew<br/>
The twanging string, and tried the stubborn yew:<br/>
To none it yields but great Ulysses' hands;<br/>
In vain we threat; Telemachus commands:<br/>
The bow he snatch'd, and in an instant bent;<br/>
Through every ring the victor arrow went.<br/>
Fierce on the threshold then in arms he stood;<br/>
Poured forth the darts that thirsted for our blood,<br/>
And frown'd before us, dreadful as a god!<br/>
First bleeds Antinous: thick the shafts resound,<br/>
And heaps on heaps the wretches strew the ground;<br/>
This way, and that, we turn, we fly, we fall;<br/>
Some god assisted, and unmann'd us all;<br/>
Ignoble cries precede the dying groans;<br/>
And battered brains and blood besmear the stones.
</p>
<p>
"Thus, great Atrides, thus Ulysses drove<br/>
The shades thou seest from yon fair realms above;<br/>
Our mangled bodies now deformed with gore,<br/>
Cold and neglected, spread the marble floor.<br/>
No friend to bathe our wounds, or tears to shed<br/>
O'er the pale corse! the honours of the dead."
</p>
<p>
"Oh bless'd Ulysses! (thus the king express'd<br/>
His sudden rapture) in thy consort bless'd!<br/>
Not more thy wisdom than her virtue shined;<br/>
Not more thy patience than her constant mind.<br/>
Icarius' daughter, glory of the past,<br/>
And model to the future age, shall last:<br/>
The gods, to honour her fair fame, shall rise<br/>
(Their great reward) a poet in her praise.<br/>
Not such, O Tyndarus! thy daughter's deed,<br/>
By whose dire hand her king and husband bled;<br/>
Her shall the Muse to infamy prolong,<br/>
Example dread, and theme of tragic song!<br/>
The general sex shall suffer in her shame,<br/>
And e'en the best that bears a woman's name."
</p>
<p>
Thus in the regions of eternal shade<br/>
Conferr'd the mournful phantoms of the dead;<br/>
While from the town, Ulysses and his band<br/>
Pass'd to Laertes' cultivated land.<br/>
The ground himself had purchased with his pain,<br/>
And labour made the rugged soil a plain,<br/>
There stood his mansion of the rural sort,<br/>
With useful buildings round the lowly court;<br/>
Where the few servants that divide his care<br/>
Took their laborious rest, and homely fare;<br/>
And one Sicilian matron, old and sage,<br/>
With constant duty tends his drooping age.
</p>
<p>
Here now arriving, to his rustic band<br/>
And martial son, Ulysses gave command:<br/>
"Enter the house, and of the bristly swine<br/>
Select the largest to the powers divine.<br/>
Alone, and unattended, let me try<br/>
If yet I share the old man's memory:<br/>
If those dim eyes can yet Ulysses know<br/>
(Their light and dearest object long ago),<br/>
Now changed with time, with absence and with woe."<br/>
Then to his train he gives his spear and shield;<br/>
The house they enter; and he seeks the field,<br/>
Through rows of shade, with various fruitage crown'd,<br/>
And labour'd scenes of richest verdure round.<br/>
Nor aged Dolius; nor his sons, were there,<br/>
Nor servants, absent on another care;<br/>
To search the woods for sets of flowery thorn,<br/>
Their orchard bounds to strengthen and adorn.
</p>
<p>
But all alone the hoary king he found;<br/>
His habit course, but warmly wrapp'd around;<br/>
His head, that bow'd with many a pensive care,<br/>
Fenced with a double cap of goatskin hair:<br/>
His buskins old, in former service torn,<br/>
But swell repair'd; and gloves against the thorn.<br/>
In this array the kingly gardener stood,<br/>
And clear'd a plant, encumber'd with its wood.
</p>
<p>
Beneath a neighbouring tree, the chief divine<br/>
Gazed o'er his sire, retracing every line,<br/>
The ruins of himself, now worn away<br/>
With age, yet still majestic in decay!<br/>
Sudden his eyes released their watery store;<br/>
The much-enduring man could bear no more.<br/>
Doubtful he stood, if instant to embrace<br/>
His aged limbs, to kiss his reverend face,<br/>
With eager transport to disclose the whole,<br/>
And pour at once the torrent of his soul.&mdash;<br/>
Not so: his judgment takes the winding way<br/>
Of question distant, and of soft essay;<br/>
More gentle methods on weak age employs:<br/>
And moves the sorrows to enhance the joys.<br/>
Then, to his sire with beating heart he moves,<br/>
And with a tender pleasantry reproves;<br/>
Who digging round the plant still hangs his bead,<br/>
Nor aught remits the work, while thus he said:
</p>
<p>
"Great is thy skill, O father! great thy toil,<br/>
Thy careful hand is stamp'd on all the soil,<br/>
Thy squadron'd vineyards well thy art declare,<br/>
The olive green, blue fig, and pendent pear;<br/>
And not one empty spot escapes thy care.<br/>
On every plant and tree thy cares are shown,<br/>
Nothing neglected, but thyself alone.<br/>
Forgive me, father, if this fault I blame;<br/>
Age so advanced, may some indulgence claim.<br/>
Not for thy sloth, I deem thy lord unkind:<br/>
Nor speaks thy form a mean or servile mind;<br/>
I read a monarch in that princely air,<br/>
The same thy aspect, if the same thy care;<br/>
Soft sleep, fair garments, and the joys of wine,<br/>
These are the rights of age, and should be thine.<br/>
Who then thy master, say? and whose the land<br/>
So dress'd and managed by thy skilful hand?<br/>
But chief, oh tell me! (what I question most)<br/>
Is this the far-famed Ithacensian coast?<br/>
For so reported the first man I view'd<br/>
(Some surly islander, of manners rude),<br/>
Nor farther conference vouchsafed to stay;<br/>
Heedless he whistled, and pursued his way.<br/>
But thou whom years have taught to understand,<br/>
Humanely hear, and answer my demand:<br/>
A friend I seek, a wise one and a brave:<br/>
Say, lives he yet, or moulders in the grave?<br/>
Time was (my fortunes then were at the best)<br/>
When at my house I lodged this foreign guest;<br/>
He said, from Ithaca's fair isle he came,<br/>
And old Laertes was his father's name.<br/>
To him, whatever to a guest is owed<br/>
I paid, and hospitable gifts bestow'd:<br/>
To him seven talents of pure ore I told,<br/>
Twelve cloaks, twelve vests, twelve tunics stiff with gold:<br/>
A bowl, that rich with polish'd silver flames,<br/>
And skill'd in female works, four lovely dames."
</p>
<p>
At this the father, with a father's fears<br/>
(His venerable eyes bedimm'd with tears):<br/>
"This is the land; but ah! thy gifts are lost,<br/>
For godless men, and rude possess the coast:<br/>
Sunk is the glory of this once-famed shore!<br/>
Thy ancient friend, O stranger, is no more!<br/>
Full recompense thy bounty else had borne:<br/>
For every good man yields a just return:<br/>
So civil rights demand; and who begins<br/>
The track of friendship, not pursuing, sins.<br/>
But tell me, stranger, be the truth confess'd,<br/>
What years have circled since thou saw'st that guest?<br/>
That hapless guest, alas! for ever gone!<br/>
Wretch that he was! and that I am! my son!<br/>
If ever man to misery was born,<br/>
'Twas his to suffer, and 'tis mine to mourn!<br/>
Far from his friends, and from his native reign,<br/>
He lies a prey to monsters of the main;<br/>
Or savage beasts his mangled relics tear,<br/>
Or screaming vultures scatter through the air:<br/>
Nor could his mother funeral unguents shed;<br/>
Nor wail'd his father o'er the untimely dead:<br/>
Nor his sad consort, on the mournful bier,<br/>
Seal'd his cold eyes, or dropp'd a tender tear!
</p>
<p>
"But, tell me who thou art? and what thy race?<br/>
Thy town, thy parents, and thy native place?<br/>
Or, if a merchant in pursuit of gain,<br/>
What port received thy vessel from the main?<br/>
Or comest thou single, or attend thy train?"
</p>
<p>
Then thus the son: "From Alybas I came,<br/>
My palace there; Eperitus my name<br/>
Not vulgar born: from Aphidas, the king<br/>
Of Polyphemon's royal line, I spring.<br/>
Some adverse demon from Sicania bore<br/>
Our wandering course, and drove us on your shore;<br/>
Far from the town, an unfrequented bay<br/>
Relieved our wearied vessel from the sea.<br/>
Five years have circled since these eyes pursued<br/>
Ulysses parting through the sable flood:<br/>
Prosperous he sail'd, with dexter auguries,<br/>
And all the wing'd good omens of the skies.<br/>
Well hoped we then to meet on this fair shore,<br/>
Whom Heaven, alas! decreed to meet no more."
</p>
<p>
Quick through the father's heart these accents ran;<br/>
Grief seized at once, and wrapp'd up all the man:<br/>
Deep from his soul he sigh'd, and sorrowing spread<br/>
A cloud of ashes on his hoary head.<br/>
Trembling with agonies of strong delight<br/>
Stood the great son, heart-wounded with the sight:<br/>
He ran, he seized him with a strict embrace,<br/>
With thousand kisses wander'd o'er his face:<br/>
"I, I am he; O father, rise! behold<br/>
Thy son, with twenty winters now grown old;<br/>
Thy son, so long desired, so long detain'd,<br/>
Restored, and breathing in his native land:<br/>
These floods of sorrow, O my sire, restrain!<br/>
The vengeance is complete; the suitor train,<br/>
Stretch'd in our palace, by these hands lie slain."
</p>
<p>
Amazed, Laertes: "Give some certain sign<br/>
(If such thou art) to manifest thee mine."
</p>
<p>
"Lo here the wound (he cries) received of yore,<br/>
The scar indented by the tusky boar,<br/>
When, by thyself, and by Anticlea sent,<br/>
To old Autolycus' realms I went.<br/>
Yet by another sign thy offspring know;<br/>
The several trees you gave me long ago,<br/>
While yet a child, these fields I loved to trace,<br/>
And trod thy footsteps with unequal pace;<br/>
To every plant in order as we came,<br/>
Well-pleased, you told its nature and its name,<br/>
Whate'er my childish fancy ask'd, bestow'd:<br/>
Twelve pear-trees, bowing with their pendent load,<br/>
And ten, that red with blushing apples glow'd;<br/>
Full fifty purple figs; and many a row<br/>
Of various vines that then began to blow,<br/>
A future vintage! when the Hours produce<br/>
Their latent buds, and Sol exalts the juice."
</p>
<p>
Smit with the signs which all his doubts explain,<br/>
His heart within him melts; his knees sustain<br/>
Their feeble weight no more: his arms alone<br/>
Support him, round the loved Ulysses thrown;<br/>
He faints, he sinks, with mighty joys oppress'd:<br/>
Ulysses clasps him to his eager breast.<br/>
Soon as returning life regains its seat,<br/>
And his breath lengthens, and his pulses beat:<br/>
"Yes, I believe (he cries) almighty Jove!<br/>
Heaven rules us yet, and gods there are above.<br/>
'Tis so&mdash;the suitors for their wrongs have paid&mdash;<br/>
But what shall guard us, if the town invade?<br/>
If, while the news through every city flies,<br/>
All Ithaca and Cephalenia rise?"<br/>
To this Ulysses: "As the gods shall please<br/>
Be all the rest: and set thy soul at ease.<br/>
Haste to the cottage by this orchard's side,<br/>
And take the banquet which our cares provide;<br/>
There wait thy faithful band of rural friends,<br/>
And there the young Telemachus attends."
</p>
<p>
Thus, having said, they traced the garden o'er<br/>
And stooping entered at the lowly door.<br/>
The swains and young Telemachus they found.<br/>
The victim portion'd and the goblet crown'd.<br/>
The hoary king, his old Sicilian maid<br/>
Perfum'd and wash'd, and gorgeously arrayed.<br/>
Pallas attending gives his frame to shine<br/>
With awful port, and majesty divine;<br/>
His gazing son admires the godlike grace,<br/>
And air celestial dawning o'er his face.<br/>
"What god (he cried) my father's form improves!<br/>
How high he treads and how enlarged he moves!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh! would to all the deathless powers on high,<br/>
Pallas and Jove, and him who gilds the sky!<br/>
(Replied the king elated with his praise)<br/>
My strength were still, as once in better days:<br/>
When the bold Cephalens the leaguer form'd.<br/>
And proud Nericus trembled as I storm'd.<br/>
Such were I now, not absent from your deed<br/>
When the last sun beheld the suitors bleed,<br/>
This arm had aided yours, this hand bestrown<br/>
Our shores with death, and push'd the slaughter on;<br/>
Nor had the sire been separate from the son."
</p>
<p>
They communed thus; while homeward bent their way<br/>
The swains, fatigued with labours of the day:<br/>
Dolius, the first, the venerable man;<br/>
And next his sons, a long succeeding train.<br/>
For due refection to the bower they came,<br/>
Call'd by the careful old Sicilian dame,<br/>
Who nursed the children, and now tends the sire,<br/>
They see their lord, they gaze, and they admire.<br/>
On chairs and beds in order seated round,<br/>
They share the gladsome board; the roofs resound,<br/>
While thus Ulysses to his ancient friend:<br/>
"Forbear your wonder, and the feast attend:<br/>
The rites have waited long." The chief commands<br/>
Their love in vain; old Dolius spreads his hands,<br/>
Springs to his master with a warm embrace,<br/>
And fastens kisses on his hands and face;<br/>
Then thus broke out: "O long, O daily mourn'd!<br/>
Beyond our hopes, and to our wish return'd!<br/>
Conducted sure by Heaven! for Heaven alone<br/>
Could work this wonder: welcome to thy own!<br/>
And joys and happiness attend thy throne!<br/>
Who knows thy bless'd, thy wish'd return? oh say,<br/>
To the chaste queen shall we the news convey?<br/>
Or hears she, and with blessings loads the day?"
</p>
<p>
"Dismiss that care, for to the royal bride<br/>
Already is it known" (the king replied,<br/>
And straight resumed his seat); while round him bows<br/>
Each faithful youth, and breathes out ardent vows:<br/>
Then all beneath their father take their place,<br/>
Rank'd by their ages, and the banquet grace.
</p>
<p>
Now flying Fame the swift report had spread<br/>
Through all the city, of the suitors dead,<br/>
In throngs they rise, and to the palace crowd;<br/>
Their sighs were many and the tumult loud.<br/>
Weeping they bear the mangled heaps of slain;<br/>
Inhume the natives in their native plain,<br/>
The rest in ships are wafted o'er the main.<br/>
Then sad in council all the seniors sate,<br/>
Frequent and full, assembled to debate:<br/>
Amid the circle first Eupithes rose,<br/>
Big was his eye with tears, his heart with woes:<br/>
The bold Antinous was his age's pride,<br/>
The first who by Ulysses' arrow died.<br/>
Down his wan cheek the trickling torrent ran,<br/>
As mixing words with sighs he thus began:
</p>
<p>
"Great deeds, O friends! this wondrous man has wrought,<br/>
And mighty blessings to his country brought!<br/>
With ships he parted, and a numerous train,<br/>
Those, and their ships, he buried in the main.<br/>
Now he returns, and first essays his hand<br/>
In the best blood of all his native land.<br/>
Haste, then, and ere to neighbouring Pyle he flies,<br/>
Or sacred Elis, to procure supplies;<br/>
Arise (or ye for ever fall), arise!<br/>
Shame to this age, and all that shall succeed!<br/>
If unrevenged your sons and brothers bleed.<br/>
Prove that we live, by vengeance on his head,<br/>
Or sink at once forgotten with the dead."<br/>
Here ceased he, but indignant tears let fall<br/>
Spoke when he ceased: dumb sorrow touch'd them all.<br/>
When from the palace to the wondering throng<br/>
Sage Medon came, and Phemius came along<br/>
(Restless and early sleep's soft bands they broke);<br/>
And Medon first the assembled chiefs bespoke;
</p>
<p>
"Hear me, ye peers and elders of the land,<br/>
Who deem this act the work of mortal hand;<br/>
As o'er the heaps of death Ulysses strode,<br/>
These eyes, these eyes beheld a present god,<br/>
Who now before him, now beside him stood,<br/>
Fought as he fought, and mark'd his way with blood:<br/>
In vain old Mentor's form the god belied;<br/>
'Twas Heaven that struck, and Heaven was on his side."
</p>
<p>
A sudden horror all the assembly shook,<br/>
When slowly rising, Halitherses spoke<br/>
(Reverend and wise, whose comprehensive view<br/>
At once the present and the future knew):<br/>
"Me too, ye fathers, hear! from you proceed<br/>
The ills ye mourn; your own the guilty deed.<br/>
Ye gave your sons, your lawless sons, the rein<br/>
(Oft warn'd by Mentor and myself in vain);<br/>
An absent hero's bed they sought to soil,<br/>
An absent hero's wealth they made their spoil;<br/>
Immoderate riot, and intemperate lust!<br/>
The offence was great, the punishment was just.<br/>
Weigh then my counsels in an equal scale,<br/>
Nor rush to ruin. Justice will prevail."
</p>
<p>
His moderate words some better minds persuade:<br/>
They part, and join him: but the number stay'd.<br/>
They storm, they shout, with hasty frenzy fired,<br/>
And second all Eupithes' rage inspired.<br/>
They case their limbs in brass; to arms they run;<br/>
The broad effulgence blazes in the sun.<br/>
Before the city, and in ample plain,<br/>
They meet: Eupithes heads the frantic train.<br/>
Fierce for his son, he breathes his threats in air;<br/>
Fate bears them not, and Death attends him there.
</p>
<p>
This pass'd on earth, while in the realms above<br/>
Minerva thus to cloud-compelling Jove!<br/>
"May I presume to search thy secret soul?<br/>
O Power Supreme, O Ruler of the whole!<br/>
Say, hast thou doom'd to this divided state<br/>
Or peaceful amity or stern debate?<br/>
Declare thy purpose, for thy will is fate."
</p>
<p>
"Is not thy thought my own? (the god replies<br/>
Who rolls the thunder o'er the vaulted skies;)<br/>
Hath not long since thy knowing soul decreed<br/>
The chief's return should make the guilty bleed.<br/>
'Tis done, and at thy will the Fates succeed.<br/>
Yet hear the issue: Since Ulysses' hand<br/>
Has slain the suitors, Heaven shall bless the land.<br/>
None now the kindred of the unjust shall own;<br/>
Forgot the slaughter'd brother and the son:<br/>
Each future day increase of wealth shall bring,<br/>
And o'er the past Oblivion stretch her wing.<br/>
Long shall Ulysses in his empire rest,<br/>
His people blessing, by his people bless'd.<br/>
Let all be peace."&mdash;He said, and gave the nod<br/>
That binds the Fates; the sanction of the god<br/>
And prompt to execute the eternal will,<br/>
Descended Pallas from the Olympian hill.
</p>
<p>
Now sat Ulysses at the rural feast<br/>
The rage of hunger and of thirst repress'd:<br/>
To watch the foe a trusty spy he sent:<br/>
A son of Dolius on the message went,<br/>
Stood in the way, and at a glance beheld<br/>
The foe approach, embattled on the field.<br/>
With backward step he hastens to the bower,<br/>
And tells the news. They arm with all their power.<br/>
Four friends alone Ulysses' cause embrace,<br/>
And six were all the sons of Dolius' race:<br/>
Old Dolius too his rusted arms put on;<br/>
And, still more old, in arms Laertes shone.<br/>
Trembling with warmth, the hoary heroes stand,<br/>
And brazen panoply invests the band.<br/>
The opening gates at once their war display:<br/>
Fierce they rush forth: Ulysses leads the way.<br/>
That moment joins them with celestial aid,<br/>
In Mentor's form, the Jove-descended maid:<br/>
The suffering hero felt his patient breast<br/>
Swell with new joy, and thus his son address'd:
</p>
<p>
"Behold, Telemachus! (nor fear the sight,)<br/>
The brave embattled, the grim front of fight!<br/>
The valiant with the valiant must contend.<br/>
Shame not the line whence glorious you descend.<br/>
Wide o'er the world their martial fame was spread;<br/>
Regard thyself, the living and the dead."
</p>
<p>
"Thy eyes, great father! on this battle cast,<br/>
Shall learn from me Penelope was chaste."
</p>
<p>
So spoke Telemachus: the gallant boy<br/>
Good old Laertes heard with panting joy.<br/>
"And bless'd! thrice bless'd this happy day! (he cries,)<br/>
The day that shows me, ere I close my eyes,<br/>
A son and grandson of the Arcesian name<br/>
Strive for fair virtue, and contest for fame!"
</p>
<p>
Then thus Minerva in Laertes' ear:<br/>
"Son of Arcesius, reverend warrior, hear!<br/>
Jove and Jove's daughter first implore in prayer,<br/>
Then, whirling high, discharge thy lance in air."<br/>
She said, infusing courage with the word.<br/>
Jove and Jove's daughter then the chief implored,<br/>
And, whirling high, dismiss'd the lance in air.<br/>
Full at Eupithes drove the deathful spear:<br/>
The brass-cheek'd helmet opens to the wound;<br/>
He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.<br/>
Before the father and the conquering son<br/>
Heaps rush on heaps, they fight, they drop, they run<br/>
Now by the sword, and now the javelin, fall<br/>
The rebel race, and death had swallow'd all;<br/>
But from on high the blue-eyed virgin cried;<br/>
Her awful voice detain'd the headlong tide:<br/>
"Forbear, ye nations, your mad hands forbear<br/>
From mutual slaughter; Peace descends to spare."<br/>
Fear shook the nations: at the voice divine<br/>
They drop their javelins, and their rage resign.<br/>
All scatter'd round their glittering weapons lie;<br/>
Some fall to earth, and some confusedly fly.<br/>
With dreadful shouts Ulysses pour'd along,<br/>
Swift as an eagle, as an eagle strong.<br/>
But Jove's red arm the burning thunder aims:<br/>
Before Minerva shot the livid flames;<br/>
Blazing they fell, and at her feet expired;<br/>
Then stopped the goddess, trembled and retired.
</p>
<p>
"Descended from the gods! Ulysses, cease;<br/>
Offend not Jove: obey, and give the peace."
</p>
<p>
So Pallas spoke: the mandate from above<br/>
The king obey'd. The virgin-seed of Jove,<br/>
In Mentor's form, confirm'd the full accord,<br/>
And willing nations knew their lawful lord.

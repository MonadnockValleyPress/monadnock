<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book VII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
The patient heavenly man thus suppliant pray'd;<br/>
While the slow mules draws on the imperial maid;<br/>
Through the proud street she moves, the public gaze;<br/>
The turning wheel before the palace stays.<br/>
With ready love her brothers, gathering round,<br/>
Received the vestures, and the mules unbound.<br/>
She seeks the bridal bower: a matron there<br/>
The rising fire supplies with busy care,<br/>
Whose charms in youth her father's heart inflamed,<br/>
Now worn with age, Eurymedusa named;<br/>
The captive dame Phæacian rovers bore,<br/>
Snatch'd from Epirus, her sweet native shore<br/>
(A grateful prize), and in her bloom bestow'd<br/>
On good Alcinous, honor'd as a god;<br/>
Nurse of Nausicaa from her infant years,<br/>
And tender second to a mother's cares.
</p>
<p>
Now from the sacred thicket where he lay,<br/>
To town Ulysses took the winding way.<br/>
Propitious Pallas, to secure her care,<br/>
Around him spread a veil of thicken'd air;<br/>
To shun the encounter of the vulgar crowd,<br/>
Insulting still, inquisitive and loud.<br/>
When near the famed Phæacian walls he drew,<br/>
The beauteous city opening to his view,<br/>
His step a virgin met, and stood before:<br/>
A polish'd urn the seeming virgin bore,<br/>
And youthful smiled; but in the low disguise<br/>
Lay hid the goddess with the azure eyes.
</p>
<p>
"Show me, fair daughter (thus the chief demands),<br/>
The house of him who rules these happy lands<br/>
Through many woes and wanderings, do I come<br/>
To good Alcinous' hospitable dome.<br/>
Far from my native coast, I rove alone,<br/>
A wretched stranger, and of all unknown!"
</p>
<p>
The goddess answer'd: "Father, I obey,<br/>
And point the wandering traveller his way:<br/>
Well known to me the palace you inquire,<br/>
For fast beside it dwells my honour'd sire:<br/>
But silent march, nor greet the common train<br/>
With question needless, or inquiry vain;<br/>
A race of ragged mariners are these,<br/>
Unpolish'd men, and boisterous as their seas<br/>
The native islanders alone their care,<br/>
And hateful he who breathes a foreign air.<br/>
These did the ruler of the deep ordain<br/>
To build proud navies, and command the main;<br/>
On canvas wings to cut the watery way;<br/>
No bird so light, no thought so swift as they."
</p>
<p>
Thus having spoke, the unknown celestial leads:<br/>
The footsteps of the deity he treads,<br/>
And secret moves along the crowded space,<br/>
Unseen of all the rude Phæacian race.<br/>
(So Pallas order'd, Pallas to their eyes<br/>
The mist objected, and condensed the skies.)<br/>
The chief with wonder sees the extended streets,<br/>
The spreading harbours, and the riding fleets;<br/>
He next their princes' lofty domes admires,<br/>
In separate islands, crown'd with rising spires;<br/>
And deep entrenchments, and high walls of stone.<br/>
That gird the city like a marble zone.<br/>
At length the kingly palace-gates he view'd;<br/>
There stopp'd the goddess, and her speech renew'd;
</p>
<p>
"My task is done: the mansion you inquire<br/>
Appears before you: enter, and admire.<br/>
High-throned, and feasting, there thou shalt behold<br/>
The sceptred rulers. Fear not, but be bold:<br/>
A decent boldness ever meets with friends,<br/>
Succeeds, and even a stranger recommends<br/>
First to the queen prefer a suppliant's claim,<br/>
Alcinous' queen, Arete is her name.<br/>
The same her parents, and her power the same.<br/>
For know, from ocean's god Nausithous sprung,<br/>
And Peribæa, beautiful and young<br/>
(Eurymedon's last hope, who ruled of old<br/>
The race of giants, impious, proud, and bold:<br/>
Perish'd the nation in unrighteous war,<br/>
Perish'd the prince, and left this only heir),<br/>
Who now, by Neptune's amorous power compress'd,<br/>
Produced a monarch that his people bless'd,<br/>
Father and prince of the Phæacian name;<br/>
From him Rhexenor and Alcinous came.<br/>
The first by Phœbus' hurtling arrows fired,<br/>
New from his nuptials, hapless youth! expired.<br/>
No son survived; Arete heir'd his state,<br/>
And her, Alcinous chose his royal mate.<br/>
With honours yet to womankind unknown.<br/>
This queen he graces, and divides the throne;<br/>
In equal tenderness her sons conspire,<br/>
And all the children emulate their sire.<br/>
When through the streets she gracious deigns to move<br/>
(The public wonder and the public love),<br/>
The tongues of all with transport sound her praise,<br/>
The eyes of all, as on a goddess, gaze.<br/>
She feels the triumph of a generous breast;<br/>
To heal divisions, to relieve the oppress'd;<br/>
In virtue rich; in blessing others, bless'd.<br/>
(to then secure, thy humble suit prefer<br/>
And owe thy country and thy friends to her."
</p>
<p>
With that the goddess deign'd no longer stay,<br/>
But o'er the world of waters wing'd her way;<br/>
Forsaking Scheria's ever-pleasing shore,<br/>
The winds to Marathon the virgin bore:<br/>
Thence, where proud Athens rears her towery head,<br/>
With opening streets and shining structures spread,<br/>
She pass'd, delighted with the well-known seats;<br/>
And to Erectheus' sacred dome retreats.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Ulysses at the palace waits,<br/>
There stops, and anxious with his soul debates,<br/>
Fix'd in amaze before the royal gates.<br/>
The front appear'd with radiant splendours gay,<br/>
Bright as the lamp of night, or orb of day,<br/>
The walls were massy brass: the cornice high<br/>
Blue metals crown'd in colours of the sky,<br/>
Rich plates of gold the folding doors incase;<br/>
The pillars silver, on a brazen base;<br/>
Silver the lintels deep-projecting o'er,<br/>
And gold the ringlets that command the door.<br/>
Two rows of stately dogs, on either hand,<br/>
In sculptured gold and labour'd silver stood<br/>
These Vulcan form'd with art divine, to wait<br/>
Immortal guardians at Alcinous' gate;<br/>
Alive each animated frame appears,<br/>
And still to live beyond the power of years,<br/>
Fair thrones within from space to space were raised,<br/>
Where various carpets with embroidery blessed,<br/>
The work of matrons: these the princes press'd,<br/>
Day following day, a long-continued feast.<br/>
Refulgent pedestals the walls surround,<br/>
Which boys of gold with flaming torches crown'd;<br/>
The polish'd ore, reflecting every ray,<br/>
Blazed on the banquets with a double day.<br/>
Full fifty handmaids form the household train;<br/>
Some turn the mill, or sift the golden grain;<br/>
Some ply the loom; their busy fingers move<br/>
Like poplar-leaves when Zephyr fans the grove.<br/>
Not more renown'd the men of Scheria's isle<br/>
For sailing arts and all the naval toil,<br/>
Than works of female skill their women's pride,<br/>
The flying shuttle through the threads to guide:<br/>
Pallas to these her double gifts imparts,<br/>
Incentive genius, and industrious arts.
</p>
<p>
Close to the gates a spacious garden lies,<br/>
From storms defended and inclement skies.<br/>
Four acres was the allotted space of ground,<br/>
Fenced with a green enclosure all around.<br/>
Tall thriving trees confess'd the fruitful mould:<br/>
The reddening apple ripens here to gold.<br/>
Here the blue fig with luscious juice o'erflows,<br/>
With deeper red the full pomegranate glows;<br/>
The branch here bends beneath the weighty pear,<br/>
And verdant olives flourish round the year,<br/>
The balmy spirit of the western gale<br/>
Eternal breathes on fruits, unthought to fail:<br/>
Each dropping pear a following pear supplies,<br/>
On apples apples, figs on figs arise:<br/>
The same mild season gives the blooms to blow,<br/>
The buds to harden, and the fruits to grow.
</p>
<p>
Here order'd vines in equal ranks appear,<br/>
With all the united labours of the year;<br/>
Some to unload the fertile branches run,<br/>
Some dry the blackening clusters in the sun,<br/>
Others to tread the liquid harvest join:<br/>
The groaning presses foam with floods of wine<br/>
Here are the vines in early flower descried,<br/>
Here grapes discolour'd on the sunnyside,<br/>
And there in autumn's richest purple dyed,
</p>
<p>
Beds of all various herbs, for ever green,<br/>
In beauteous order terminate the scene.
</p>
<p>
Two plenteous fountains the whole prospect crown'd<br/>
This through the gardens leads its streams around<br/>
Visits each plant, and waters all the ground;<br/>
While that in pipes beneath the palace flows,<br/>
And thence its current on the town bestows:<br/>
To various use their various streams they bring,<br/>
The people one, and one supplies the king.
</p>
<p>
Such were the glories which the gods ordain'd,<br/>
To grace Alcinous, and his happy land.<br/>
E'en from the chief whom men and nations knew,<br/>
The unwonted scene surprise and rapture drew;<br/>
In pleasing thought he ran the prospect o'er,<br/>
Then hasty enter'd at the lofty door.<br/>
Night now approaching, in the palace stand,<br/>
With goblets crown'd, the rulers of the land;<br/>
Prepared for rest, and offering to the god<br/>
Who bears the virtue of the sleepy rod,<br/>
Unseen he glided through the joyous crowd,<br/>
With darkness circled, and an ambient cloud.<br/>
Direct to great Alcinous' throne he came,<br/>
And prostrate fell before the imperial dame.<br/>
Then from around him dropp'd the veil of night;<br/>
Sudden he shines, and manifest to sight.<br/>
The nobles gaze, with awful fear oppress'd;<br/>
Silent they gaze, and eye the godlike guest.
</p>
<p>
"Daughter of great Rhexenor! (thus began,<br/>
Low at her knees, the much-enduring man)<br/>
To thee, thy consort, and this royal train,<br/>
To all that share the blessings of your reign,<br/>
A suppliant bends: oh pity human woe!<br/>
'Tis what the happy to the unhappy owe.<br/>
A wretched exile to his country send,<br/>
Long worn with griefs, and long without a friend<br/>
So may the gods your better days increase,<br/>
And all your joys descend on all your race;<br/>
So reign for ever on your country's breast,<br/>
Your people blessing, by your people bless'd!"
</p>
<p>
Then to the genial hearth he bow'd his face,<br/>
And humbled in the ashes took his place.<br/>
Silence ensued. The eldest first began,<br/>
Echeneus sage, a venerable man!<br/>
Whose well-taught mind the present age surpass'd,<br/>
And join'd to that the experience of the last.<br/>
Fit words attended on his weighty sense,<br/>
And mild persuasion flow'd in eloquence.
</p>
<p>
"Oh sight (he cried) dishonest and unjust!<br/>
A guest, a stranger, seated in the dust!<br/>
To raise the lowly suppliant from the ground<br/>
Befits a monarch. Lo! the peers around<br/>
But wait thy word, the gentle guest to grace,<br/>
And seat him fair in some distinguish'd place.<br/>
Let first the herald due libation pay<br/>
To Jove, who guides the wanderer on his way:<br/>
Then set the genial banquet in his view,<br/>
And give the stranger-guest a stranger's due."
</p>
<p>
His sage advice the listening king obeys,<br/>
He stretch'd his hand the prudent chief to raise,<br/>
And from his seat Laodamas removed<br/>
(The monarch's offspring, and his best-beloved);<br/>
There next his side the godlike hero sate;<br/>
With stars of silver shone the bed of state.<br/>
The golden ewer a beauteous handmaid brings,<br/>
Replenish'd from the cool translucent springs,<br/>
Whose polish'd vase with copious streams supplies<br/>
A silver layer of capacious size.<br/>
The table next in regal order spread,<br/>
The glittering canisters are heap'd with bread:<br/>
Viands of various kinds invite the taste,<br/>
Of choicest sort and savour, rich repast!<br/>
Thus feasting high, Alcinous gave the sign,<br/>
And bade the herald pour the rosy wine;<br/>
"Let all around the due libation pay<br/>
To Jove, who guides the wanderer on his way."
</p>
<p>
He said. Pontonous heard the king's command;<br/>
The circling goblet moves from hand to hand;<br/>
Each drinks the juice that glads the heart of man.<br/>
Alcinous then, with aspect mild, began:
</p>
<p>
"Princes and peers, attend; while we impart<br/>
To you the thoughts of no inhuman heart.<br/>
Now pleased and satiate from the social rite<br/>
Repair we to the blessings of the night;<br/>
But with the rising day, assembled here,<br/>
Let all the elders of the land appear,<br/>
Pious observe our hospitable laws,<br/>
And Heaven propitiate in the stranger's cause;<br/>
Then join'd in council, proper means explore<br/>
Safe to transport him to the wished-for shore<br/>
(How distant that, imports us not to know,<br/>
Nor weigh the labour, but relieve the woe).<br/>
Meantime, nor harm nor anguish let him bear<br/>
This interval, Heaven trusts him to our care<br/>
But to his native land our charge resign'd,<br/>
Heaven's is his life to come, and all the woes behind.<br/>
Then must he suffer what the Fates ordain;<br/>
For Fate has wove the thread of life with pain!<br/>
And twins, e'en from the birth, are Misery and Man!<br/>
But if, descended from the Olympian bower,<br/>
Gracious approach us some immortal power;<br/>
If in that form thou comest a guest divine:<br/>
Some high event the conscious gods design.<br/>
As yet, unbid they never graced our feast,<br/>
The solemn sacrifice call'd down the guest;<br/>
Then manifest of Heaven the vision stood,<br/>
And to our eyes familiar was the god.<br/>
Oft with some favour'd traveller they stray,<br/>
And shine before him all the desert way;<br/>
With social intercourse, and face to face,<br/>
The friends and guardians of our pious race.<br/>
So near approach we their celestial kind,<br/>
By justice, truth, and probity of mind;<br/>
As our dire neighbours of Cyclopæan birth<br/>
Match in fierce wrong the giant-sons of earth."
</p>
<p>
"Let no such thought (with modest grace rejoin'd<br/>
The prudent Greek) possess the royal mind.<br/>
Alas! a mortal, like thyself, am I;<br/>
No glorious native of yon azure sky:<br/>
In form, ah how unlike their heavenly kind!<br/>
How more inferior in the gifts of mind!<br/>
Alas, a mortal! most oppress'd of those<br/>
Whom Fate has loaded with a weight of woes;<br/>
By a sad train of Miseries alone<br/>
Distinguish'd long, and second now to none!<br/>
By Heaven's high will compell'd from shore to shore;<br/>
With Heaven's high will prepared to suffer more.<br/>
What histories of toil could I declare!<br/>
But still long-wearied nature wants repair;<br/>
Spent with fatigue, and shrunk with pining fast,<br/>
My craving bowels still require repast.<br/>
Howe'er the noble, suffering mind may grieve<br/>
Its load of anguish, and disdain to live,<br/>
Necessity demands our daily bread;<br/>
Hunger is insolent, and will be fed.<br/>
But finish, oh ye peers! what you propose,<br/>
And let the morrow's dawn conclude my woes.<br/>
Pleased will I suffer all the gods ordain,<br/>
To see my soil, my son, my friends again.<br/>
That view vouchsafed, let instant death surprise<br/>
With ever-during shade these happy eyes!"
</p>
<p>
The assembled peers with general praise approved<br/>
His pleaded reason, and the suit he moved.<br/>
Each drinks a full oblivion of his cares,<br/>
And to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs,<br/>
Ulysses in the regal walls alone<br/>
Remain'd: beside him, on a splendid throne,<br/>
Divine Arete and Alcinous shone.<br/>
The queen, on nearer view, the guest survey'd,<br/>
Rob'd in the garments her own hands had made,<br/>
Not without wonder seen. Then thus began,<br/>
Her words addressing to the godlike man:
</p>
<p>
"Camest thou hither, wondrous stranger! say,<br/>
From lands remote and o'er a length of sea?<br/>
Tell, then, whence art thou? whence, that princely air?<br/>
And robes like these, so recent and so fair?"
</p>
<p>
"Hard is the task, O princess! you impose<br/>
(Thus sighing spoke the man of many woes),<br/>
The long, the mournful series to relate<br/>
Of all my sorrows sent by Heaven and Fate!<br/>
Yet what you ask, attend. An island lies<br/>
Beyond these tracts, and under other skies,<br/>
Ogygia named, in Ocean's watery arms;<br/>
Where dwells Calypso, dreadful in her charms!<br/>
Remote from gods or men she holds her reign,<br/>
Amid the terrors of a rolling main.<br/>
Me, only me, the hand of fortune bore,<br/>
Unblest! to tread that interdicted shore:<br/>
When Jove tremendous in the sable deeps<br/>
Launch'd his red lightning at our scattered ships;<br/>
Then, all my fleet and all my followers lost.<br/>
Sole on a plank on boiling surges toss'd,<br/>
Heaven drove my wreck the Ogygian Isle to find,<br/>
Full nine days floating to the wave and wind.<br/>
Met by the goddess there with open arms,<br/>
She bribed my stay with more than human charms;<br/>
Nay, promised, vainly promised, to bestow<br/>
Immortal life, exempt from age and woe;<br/>
But all her blandishments successless prove,<br/>
To banish from my breast my country's love.<br/>
I stay reluctant seven continued years,<br/>
And water her ambrosial couch with tears,<br/>
The eighth she voluntary moves to part,<br/>
Or urged by Jove, or her own changeful heart.<br/>
A raft was formed to cross the surging sea;<br/>
Herself supplied the stores and rich array,<br/>
And gave the gales to waft me on my way,<br/>
In seventeen days appear'd your pleasing coast,<br/>
And woody mountains half in vapours lost.<br/>
Joy touched my soul; my soul was joy'd in vain,<br/>
For angry Neptune roused the raging main;<br/>
The wild winds whistle, and the billows roar;<br/>
The splitting raft the furious tempest tore;<br/>
And storms vindictive intercept the shore.<br/>
Soon as their rage subsides, the seas I brave<br/>
With naked force, and shoot along the wave,<br/>
To reach this isle; but there my hopes were lost,<br/>
The surge impell'd me on a craggy coast.<br/>
I chose the safer sea, and chanced to find<br/>
A river's mouth impervious to the wind,<br/>
And clear of rocks. I fainted by the flood;<br/>
Then took the shelter of the neighbouring wood.<br/>
'Twas night, and, covered in the foliage deep,<br/>
Jove plunged my senses in the death of sleep.<br/>
All night I slept, oblivious of my pain:<br/>
Aurora dawned and Phœbus shined in vain,<br/>
Nor, till oblique he sloped his evening ray,<br/>
Had Somnus dried the balmy dews away.<br/>
Then female voices from the shore I heard:<br/>
A maid amidst them, goddess-like appear'd;<br/>
To her I sued, she pitied my distress;<br/>
Like thee in beauty, nor in virtue less.<br/>
Who from such youth could hope considerate care?<br/>
In youth and beauty wisdom is but rare!<br/>
She gave me life, relieved with just supplies<br/>
My wants, and lent these robes that strike your eyes.<br/>
This is the truth: and oh, ye powers on high!<br/>
Forbid that want should sink me to a lie."
</p>
<p>
To this the king: "Our daughter but express'd<br/>
Her cares imperfect to our godlike guest.<br/>
Suppliant to her, since first he chose to pray,<br/>
Why not herself did she conduct the way,<br/>
And with her handmaids to our court convey?"
</p>
<p>
"Hero and king (Ulysses thus replied)<br/>
Nor blame her faultless nor suspect of pride:<br/>
She bade me follow in the attendant train;<br/>
But fear and reverence did my steps detain,<br/>
Lest rash suspicion might alarm thy mind:<br/>
Man's of a jealous and mistaken kind."
</p>
<p>
"Far from my soul (he cried) the gods efface<br/>
All wrath ill-grounded, and suspicion base!<br/>
Whate'er is honest, stranger, I approve,<br/>
And would to Phœbus, Pallas, and to Jove,<br/>
Such as thou art, thy thought and mine were one,<br/>
Nor thou unwilling to be called my son.<br/>
In such alliance couldst thou wish to join,<br/>
A palace stored with treasures should be thine.<br/>
But if reluctant, who shall force thy stay?<br/>
Jove bids to set the stranger on his way,<br/>
And ships shall wait thee with the morning ray.<br/>
Till then, let slumber cross thy careful eyes:<br/>
The wakeful mariners shall watch the skies,<br/>
And seize the moment when the breezes rise:<br/>
Then gently waft thee to the pleasing shore,<br/>
Where thy soul rests, and labour is no more.<br/>
Far as Euboea though thy country lay,<br/>
Our ships with ease transport thee in a day.<br/>
Thither of old, earth's giant son to view,<br/>
On wings of wind with Rhadamanth they flew;<br/>
This land, from whence their morning course begun,<br/>
Saw them returning with the setting sun.<br/>
Your eyes shall witness and confirm my tale,<br/>
Our youth how dexterous, and how fleet our sail,<br/>
When justly timed with equal sweep they row,<br/>
And ocean whitens in long tracks below."
</p>
<p>
Thus he. No word the experienced man replies,<br/>
But thus to heaven (and heavenward lifts his eyes):<br/>
"O Jove! O father! what the king accords<br/>
Do thou make perfect! sacred be his words!<br/>
Wide o'er the world Alcinous' glory shine!<br/>
Let fame be his, and ah! my country mine!"
</p>
<p>
Meantime Arete, for the hour of rest,<br/>
Ordains the fleecy couch, and covering vest;<br/>
Bids her fair train the purple quilts prepare,<br/>
And the thick carpets spread with busy care.<br/>
With torches blazing in their hands they pass'd,<br/>
And finish'd all their queen's command with haste:<br/>
Then gave the signal to the willing guest:<br/>
He rose with pleasure, and retired to rest.<br/>
There, soft extended, to the murmuring sound<br/>
Of the high porch, Ulysses sleeps profound!<br/>
Within, released from cares, Alcinous lies;<br/>
And fast beside were closed Arete's eyes.

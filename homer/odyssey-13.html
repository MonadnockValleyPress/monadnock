<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XIII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
He ceased; but left so pleasing on their ear<br/>
His voice, that listening still they seem'd to hear.<br/>
A pause of silence hush'd the shady rooms:<br/>
The grateful conference then the king resumes:
</p>
<p>
"Whatever toils the great Ulysses pass'd,<br/>
Beneath this happy roof they end at last;<br/>
No longer now from shore to shore to roam,<br/>
Smooth seas and gentle winds invite him home.<br/>
But hear me, princes! whom these walls inclose,<br/>
For whom my chanter sings: and goblet flows<br/>
With wine unmix'd (an honour due to age,<br/>
To cheer the grave, and warm the poet's rage);<br/>
Though labour'd gold and many a dazzling vest<br/>
Lie heap'd already for our godlike guest;<br/>
Without new treasures let him not remove,<br/>
Large, and expressive of the public love:<br/>
Each peer a tripod, each a vase bestow,<br/>
A general tribute, which the state shall owe."
</p>
<p>
This sentence pleased: then all their steps address'd<br/>
To separate mansions, and retired to rest.
</p>
<p>
Now did the rosy-finger'd morn arise,<br/>
And shed her sacred light along the skies.<br/>
Down to the haven and the ships in haste<br/>
They bore the treasures, and in safety placed.<br/>
The king himself the vases ranged with care;<br/>
Then bade his followers to the feast prepare.<br/>
A victim ox beneath the sacred hand<br/>
Of great Alcinous falls, and stains the sand.<br/>
To Jove the Eternal (power above all powers!<br/>
Who wings the winds, and darkens heaven with showers)<br/>
The flames ascend: till evening they prolong<br/>
The rites, more sacred made by heavenly song;<br/>
For in the midst, with public honours graced,<br/>
Thy lyre divine, Demodocus! was placed.<br/>
All, but Ulysses, heard with fix'd delight;<br/>
He sate, and eyed the sun, and wish'd the night;<br/>
Slow seem'd the sun to move, the hours to roll,<br/>
His native home deep-imaged in his soul.<br/>
As the tired ploughman, spent with stubborn toil,<br/>
Whose oxen long have torn the furrow'd soil,<br/>
Sees with delight the sun's declining ray,<br/>
When home with feeble knees he bends his way<br/>
To late repast (the day's hard labour done);<br/>
So to Ulysses welcome set the sun;<br/>
Then instant to Alcinous and the rest<br/>
(The Scherian states) he turn'd, and thus address'd:
</p>
<p>
"O thou, the first in merit and command!<br/>
And you the peers and princes of the land!<br/>
May every joy be yours! nor this the least,<br/>
When due libation shall have crown'd the feast,<br/>
Safe to my home to send your happy guest.<br/>
Complete are now the bounties you have given,<br/>
Be all those bounties but confirm'd by Heaven!<br/>
So may I find, when all my wanderings cease,<br/>
My consort blameless, and my friends in peace.<br/>
On you be every bliss; and every day,<br/>
In home-felt joys, delighted roll away;<br/>
Yourselves, your wives, your long-descending race,<br/>
May every god enrich with every grace!<br/>
Sure fix'd on virtue may your nation stand,<br/>
And public evil never touch the land!"
</p>
<p>
His words well weigh'd, the general voice approved<br/>
Benign, and instant his dismission moved,<br/>
The monarch to Pontonus gave the sign.<br/>
To fill the goblet high with rosy wine;<br/>
"Great Jove the Father first (he cried) implore;<br/>
Then send the stranger to his native shore."
</p>
<p>
The luscious wine the obedient herald brought;<br/>
Around the mansion flow'd the purple draught;<br/>
Each from his seat to each immortal pours,<br/>
Whom glory circles in the Olympian bowers<br/>
Ulysses sole with air majestic stands,<br/>
The bowl presenting to Arete's hands;<br/>
Then thus: "O queen, farewell! be still possess'd<br/>
Of dear remembrance, blessing still and bless'd!<br/>
Till age and death shall gently call thee hence,<br/>
(Sure fate of every mortal excellence!)<br/>
Farewell! and joys successive ever spring<br/>
To thee, to thine, the people, and the king!"
</p>
<p>
Thus he: then parting prints the sandy shore<br/>
To the fair port: a herald march'd before,<br/>
Sent by Alcinous; of Arete's train<br/>
Three chosen maids attend him to the main;<br/>
This does a tunic and white vest convey,<br/>
A various casket that, of rich inlay,<br/>
And bread and wine the third. The cheerful mates<br/>
Safe in the hollow poop dispose the cates;<br/>
Upon the deck soft painted robes they spread<br/>
With linen cover'd, for the hero's bed.<br/>
He climbed the lofty stern; then gently press'd<br/>
The swelling couch, and lay composed to rest.
</p>
<p>
Now placed in order, the Phæacian train<br/>
Their cables loose, and launch into the main;<br/>
At once they bend, and strike their equal oars,<br/>
And leave the sinking hills and lessening shores.<br/>
While on the deck the chief in silence lies,<br/>
And pleasing slumbers steal upon his eyes.<br/>
As fiery coursers in the rapid race<br/>
Urged by fierce drivers through the dusty space,<br/>
Toss their high heads, and scour along the plain,<br/>
So mounts the bounding vessel o'er the main.<br/>
Back to the stern the parted billows flow,<br/>
And the black ocean foams and roars below.
</p>
<p>
Thus with spread sails the winged galley flies;<br/>
Less swift an eagle cuts the liquid skies;<br/>
Divine Ulysses was her sacred load,<br/>
A man, in wisdom equal to a god!<br/>
Much danger, long and mighty toils he bore,<br/>
In storms by sea, and combats on the shore;<br/>
All which soft sleep now banish'd from his breast,<br/>
Wrapp'd in a pleasing, deep, and death-like rest.
</p>
<p>
But when the morning-star with early ray<br/>
Flamed in the front of heaven, and promised day;<br/>
Like distant clouds the mariner descries<br/>
Fair Ithaca's emerging hills arise.<br/>
Far from the town a spacious port appears,<br/>
Sacred to Phorcys' power, whose name it bears;<br/>
Two craggy rocks projecting to the main,<br/>
The roaring wind's tempestuous rage restrain;<br/>
Within the waves in softer murmurs glide,<br/>
And ships secure without their halsers ride.<br/>
High at the head a branching olive grows,<br/>
And crowns the pointed cliffs with shady boughs.<br/>
Beneath, a gloomy grotto's cool recess<br/>
Delights the Nereids of the neighbouring seas,<br/>
Where bowls and urns were form'd of living stone,<br/>
And massy beams in native marble shone,<br/>
On which the labours of the nymphs were roll'd,<br/>
Their webs divine of purple mix'd with gold.<br/>
Within the cave the clustering bees attend<br/>
Their waxen works, or from the roof depend.<br/>
Perpetual waters o'er the pavement glide;<br/>
Two marble doors unfold on either side;<br/>
Sacred the south, by which the gods descend;<br/>
But mortals enter at the northern end.
</p>
<p>
Thither they bent, and haul'd their ship to land<br/>
(The crooked keel divides the yellow sand).<br/>
Ulysses sleeping on his couch they bore,<br/>
And gently placed him on the rocky shore.<br/>
His treasures next, Alcinous' gifts, they laid<br/>
In the wild olive's unfrequented shade,<br/>
Secure from theft; then launch'd the bark again,<br/>
Resumed their oars, and measured back the main,<br/>
Nor yet forgot old Ocean's dread supreme,<br/>
The vengeance vow'd for eyeless Polypheme.<br/>
Before the throne of mighty Jove he stood,<br/>
And sought the secret counsels of the god.
</p>
<p>
"Shall then no more, O sire of gods! be mine<br/>
The rights and honours of a power divine?<br/>
Scorn'd e'en by man, and (oh severe disgrace!)<br/>
By soft Phæacians, my degenerate race!<br/>
Against yon destined head in vain I swore,<br/>
And menaced vengeance, ere he reach'd his shore;<br/>
To reach his natal shore was thy decree;<br/>
Mild I obey'd, for who shall war with thee?<br/>
Behold him landed, careless and asleep,<br/>
From all the eluded dangers of the deep;<br/>
Lo where he lies, amidst a shining store<br/>
Of brass, rich garments, and refulgent ore;<br/>
And bears triumphant to his native isle<br/>
A prize more worth than Ilion's noble spoil."
</p>
<p>
To whom the Father of the immortal powers,<br/>
Who swells the clouds, and gladdens earth with showers,<br/>
"Can mighty Neptune thus of man complain?<br/>
Neptune, tremendous o'er the boundless main!<br/>
Revered and awful e'en in heaven's abodes,<br/>
Ancient and great! a god above the gods!<br/>
If that low race offend thy power divine<br/>
(Weak, daring creatures!) is not vengeance thine?<br/>
Go, then, the guilty at thy will chastise."<br/>
He said. The shaker of the earth replies:
</p>
<p>
"This then, I doom: to fix the gallant ship,<br/>
A mark of vengeance on the sable deep;<br/>
To warn the thoughtless, self-confiding train,<br/>
No more unlicensed thus to brave the main.<br/>
Full in their port a Shady hill shall rise,<br/>
If such thy will."&mdash;"We will it (Jove replies).<br/>
E'en when with transport blackening all the strand,<br/>
The swarming people hail their ship to land,<br/>
Fix her for ever, a memorial stone:<br/>
Still let her seem to sail, and seem alone.<br/>
The trembling crowds shall see the sudden shade<br/>
Of whelming mountains overhang their head!"
</p>
<p>
With that the god whose earthquakes rock the ground<br/>
Fierce to Phæacia cross'd the vast profound.<br/>
Swift as a swallow sweeps the liquid way,<br/>
The winged pinnace shot along the sea.<br/>
The god arrests her with a sudden stroke,<br/>
And roots her down an everlasting rock.<br/>
Aghast the Scherians stand in deep surprise;<br/>
All press to speak, all question with their eyes.<br/>
What hands unseen the rapid bark restrain!<br/>
And yet it swims, or seems to swim, the main!<br/>
Thus they, unconscious of the deed divine;<br/>
Till great Alcinous, rising, own'd the sign.
</p>
<p>
"Behold the long predestined day! (he cries;)<br/>
O certain faith of ancient prophecies<br/>
These ears have heard my royal sire disclose<br/>
A dreadful story, big with future woes;<br/>
How, moved with wrath, that careless we convey<br/>
Promiscuous every guest to every bay,<br/>
Stern Neptune raged; and how by his command<br/>
Firm rooted in the surge a ship should stand<br/>
(A monument of wrath); and mound on mound<br/>
Should hide our walls, or whelm beneath the ground.
</p>
<p>
"The Fates have follow'd as declared the seer.<br/>
Be humbled, nations! and your monarch hear.<br/>
No more unlicensed brave the deeps, no more<br/>
With every stranger pass from shore to shore;<br/>
On angry Neptune now for mercy call;<br/>
To his high name let twelve black oxen fall.<br/>
So may the god reverse his purposed will,<br/>
Nor o'er our city hang the dreadful hill."
</p>
<p>
The monarch spoke: they trembled and obey'd,<br/>
Forth on the sands the victim oxen led;<br/>
The gathered tribes before the altars stand,<br/>
And chiefs and rulers, a majestic band.<br/>
The king of ocean all the tribes implore;<br/>
The blazing altars redden all the shore.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Ulysses in his country lay,<br/>
Released from sleep, and round him might survey<br/>
The solitary shore and rolling sea.<br/>
Yet had his mind through tedious absence lost<br/>
The dear resemblance of his native coast;<br/>
Besides, Minerva, to secure her care,<br/>
Diffused around a veil of thickened air;<br/>
For so the gods ordain'd to keep unseen<br/>
His royal person from his friends and queen;<br/>
Till the proud suitors for their crimes afford<br/>
An ample vengeance to their injured lord.
</p>
<p>
Now all the land another prospect bore,<br/>
Another port appear'd, another shore.<br/>
And long-continued ways, and winding floods,<br/>
And unknown mountains, crown'd with unknown woods<br/>
Pensive and slow, with sudden grief oppress'd,<br/>
The king arose, and beat his careful breast,<br/>
Cast a long look o'er all the coast and main,<br/>
And sought, around, his native realm in vain;<br/>
Then with erected eyes stood fix'd in woe,<br/>
And as he spoke, the tears began to flow.
</p>
<p>
"Ye gods (he cried), upon what barren coast,<br/>
In what new region, is Ulysses toss'd?<br/>
Possess'd by wild barbarians, fierce in arms?<br/>
Or men whose bosom tender pity warms?<br/>
Where shall this treasure now in safely lie?<br/>
And whither, whither its sad owner fly?<br/>
Ah, why did I Alcinous' grace implore?<br/>
Ah, why forsake Phæacia's happy shore?<br/>
Some juster prince perhaps had entertain'd,<br/>
And safe restored me to my native land.<br/>
Is this the promised, long-expected coast,<br/>
And this the faith Phæacia's rulers boast?<br/>
O righteous gods! of all the great, how few<br/>
Are just to Heaven, and to their promise true!<br/>
But he, the power to whose all-seeing eyes<br/>
The deeds of men appear without disguise,<br/>
'Tis his alone to avenge the wrongs I bear;<br/>
For still the oppress'd are his peculiar care.<br/>
To count these presents, and from thence to prove,<br/>
Their faith is mine; the rest belongs to Jove."
</p>
<p>
Then on the sands he ranged his wealthy store,<br/>
The gold, the vests, the tripods number'd o'er:<br/>
All these he found, but still in error lost,<br/>
Disconsolate he wanders on the coast,<br/>
Sighs for his country, and laments again<br/>
To the deaf rocks, and hoarse-resounding main.<br/>
When lo! the guardian goddess of the wise,<br/>
Celestial Pallas, stood before his eyes;<br/>
In show a youthful swain, of form divine,<br/>
Who seem'd descended from some princely line.<br/>
A graceful robe her slender body dress'd;<br/>
Around her shoulders flew the waving vest;<br/>
Her decent hand a shining javelin bore,<br/>
And painted sandals on her feet she wore.<br/>
To whom the king: "Whoe'er of human race<br/>
Thou art, that wanderest in this desert place,<br/>
With joy to thee, as to some god I bend,<br/>
To thee my treasures and myself commend.<br/>
O tell a wretch in exile doom'd to stray,<br/>
What air I breathe, what country I survey?<br/>
The fruitful continent's extremest bound,<br/>
Or some fair isle which Neptune's arms surround?
</p>
<p>
"From what far clime (said she) remote from fame<br/>
Arrivest thou here, a stranger to our name?<br/>
Thou seest an island, not to those unknown<br/>
Whose hills are brighten'd by the rising sun,<br/>
Nor those that placed beneath his utmost reign<br/>
Behold him sinking in the western main.<br/>
The rugged soil allows no level space<br/>
For flying chariots, or the rapid race;<br/>
Yet, not ungrateful to the peasant's pain,<br/>
Suffices fulness to the swelling grain;<br/>
The loaded trees their various fruits produce,<br/>
And clustering grapes afford a generous juice;<br/>
Woods crown our mountains, and in every grove<br/>
The bounding goats and frisking heifers rove;<br/>
Soft rains and kindly dews refresh the field,<br/>
And rising springs eternal verdure yield.<br/>
E'en to those shores is Ithaca renown'd,<br/>
Where Troy's majestic ruins strew the ground."
</p>
<p>
At this, the chief with transport was possess'd;<br/>
His panting heart exulted in his breast;<br/>
Yet, well dissembling his untimely joys,<br/>
And veiling truth in plausible disguise,<br/>
Thus, with an air sincere, in fiction bold,<br/>
His ready tale the inventive hero told:
</p>
<p>
"Oft have I heard in Crete this island's name;<br/>
For 'twas from Crete, my native soil, I came,<br/>
Self-banished thence. I sail'd before the wind,<br/>
And left my children and my friends behind.<br/>
From fierce Idomeneus' revenge I flew,<br/>
Whose son, the swift Orsilochus, I slew<br/>
(With brutal force he seized my Trojan prey,<br/>
Due to the toils of many a bloody day).<br/>
Unseen I 'scaped, and favour'd by the night,<br/>
In a Phoenician vessel took my flight,<br/>
For Pyle or Elis bound; but tempests toss'd<br/>
And raging billows drove us on your coast.<br/>
In dead of night an unknown port we gain'd;<br/>
Spent with fatigue, and slept secure on land.<br/>
But ere the rosy morn renew'd the day,<br/>
While in the embrace of pleasing sleep I lay,<br/>
Sudden, invited by auspicious gales,<br/>
They land my goods, and hoist their flying sails.<br/>
Abandon'd here, my fortune I deplore<br/>
A hapless exile on a foreign shore,"
</p>
<p>
Thus while he spoke, the blue-eyed maid began<br/>
With pleasing smiles to view the godlike man;<br/>
Then changed her form: and now, divinely bright,<br/>
Jove's heavenly daughter stood confess'd to sight;<br/>
Like a fair virgin in her beauty's bloom,<br/>
Skill'd in the illustrious labours of the loom.
</p>
<p>
"O still the same Ulysses! (she rejoin'd,)<br/>
In useful craft successfully refined!<br/>
Artful in speech, in action, and in mind!<br/>
Sufficed it not, that, thy long labours pass'd,<br/>
Secure thou seest thy native shore at last?<br/>
But this to me? who, like thyself, excel<br/>
In arts of counsel and dissembling well;<br/>
To me? whose wit exceeds the powers divine,<br/>
No less than mortals are surpass'd by thine.<br/>
Know'st thou not me; who made thy life my care,<br/>
Through ten years' wandering, and through ten years' war;<br/>
Who taught thee arts, Alcinous to persuade,<br/>
To raise his wonder, and engage his aid;<br/>
And now appear, thy treasures to protect,<br/>
Conceal thy person, thy designs direct,<br/>
And tell what more thou must from Fate expect;<br/>
Domestic woes far heavier to be borne!<br/>
The pride of fools, and slaves' insulting scorn?<br/>
But thou be silent, nor reveal thy state;<br/>
Yield to the force of unresisted Fate,<br/>
And bear unmoved the wrongs of base mankind,<br/>
The last, and hardest, conquest of the mind."
</p>
<p>
"Goddess of wisdom! (Ithacus replies,)<br/>
He who discerns thee must be truly wise,<br/>
So seldom view'd and ever in disguise!<br/>
When the bold Argives led their warring powers,<br/>
Against proud Ilion's well-defended towers,<br/>
Ulysses was thy care, celestial maid!<br/>
Graced with thy sight, and favoured with thy aid.<br/>
But when the Trojan piles in ashes lay,<br/>
And bound for Greece we plough'd the watery way;<br/>
Our fleet dispersed, and driven from coast to coast,<br/>
Thy sacred presence from that hour I lost;<br/>
Till I beheld thy radiant form once more,<br/>
And heard thy counsels on Phæacia's shore.<br/>
But, by the almighty author of thy race,<br/>
Tell me, oh tell, is this my native place?<br/>
For much I fear, long tracts of land and sea<br/>
Divide this coast from distant Ithaca;<br/>
The sweet delusion kindly you impose,<br/>
To soothe my hopes, and mitigate my woes."
</p>
<p>
Thus he. The blue-eyed goddess thus replies;<br/>
"How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise!<br/>
Who, versed in fortune, fear the flattering show,<br/>
And taste not half the bliss the gods bestow.<br/>
The more shall Pallas aid thy just desires,<br/>
And guard the wisdom which herself inspires.<br/>
Others long absent from their native place,<br/>
Straight seek their home, and fly with eager pace<br/>
To their wives' arms, and children's dear embrace.<br/>
Not thus Ulysses; he decrees to prove<br/>
His subjects' faith, and queen's suspected love;<br/>
Who mourn'd her lord twice ten revolving years,<br/>
And wastes the days in grief, the nights in tears.<br/>
But Pallas knew (thy friends and navy lost)<br/>
Once more 'twas given thee to behold thy coast;<br/>
Yet how could I with adverse Fate engage,<br/>
And mighty Neptune's unrelenting rage?<br/>
Now lift thy longing eyes, while I restore<br/>
The pleasing prospect of thy native shore.<br/>
Bebold the port of Phorcys! fenced around<br/>
With rocky mountains, and with olives crown'd,<br/>
Behold the gloomy grot! whose cool recess<br/>
Delights the Nereids of the neighbouring seas;<br/>
Whose now-neglected altars in thy reign<br/>
Blush'd with the blood of sheep and oxen slain,<br/>
Behold! where Neritus the clouds divides,<br/>
And shakes the waving forests on his sides."
</p>
<p>
So spake the goddess; and the prospect clear'd,<br/>
The mists dispersed, and all the coast appeared.<br/>
The king with joy confess'd his place of birth,<br/>
And on his knees salutes his mother earth;<br/>
Then, with his suppliant hands upheld in air,<br/>
Thus to the sea-green sisters sends his prayer;
</p>
<p>
"All hail! ye virgin daughters of the main!<br/>
Ye streams, beyond my hopes, beheld again!<br/>
To you once more your own Ulysses bows;<br/>
Attend his transports, and receive his vows!<br/>
If Jove prolong my days, and Pallas crown<br/>
The growing virtues of my youthful son,<br/>
To you shall rites divine be ever paid,<br/>
And grateful offerings on your altars laid."
</p>
<p>
Thus then Minerva: "From that anxious breast<br/>
Dismiss those cares, and leave to heaven the rest.<br/>
Our task be now thy treasured stores to save,<br/>
Deep in the close recesses of the cave;<br/>
Then future means consult." She spoke, and trod<br/>
The shady grot, that brighten'd with the god.<br/>
The closest caverns of the grot she sought;<br/>
The gold, the brass, the robes, Ulysses brought;<br/>
These in the secret gloom the chief disposed;<br/>
The entrance with a rock the goddess closed.
</p>
<p>
Now, seated in the olive's sacred shade,<br/>
Confer the hero and the martial maid.<br/>
The goddess of the azure eyes began:<br/>
"Son of Laertes! much-experienced man!<br/>
The suitor-train thy earliest care demand,<br/>
Of that luxurious race to rid the land;<br/>
Three years thy house their lawless rule has seen,<br/>
And proud addresses to the matchless queen.<br/>
But she thy absence mourns from day to day,<br/>
And inly bleeds, and silent wastes away;<br/>
Elusive of the bridal hour, she gives<br/>
Fond hopes to all, and all with hopes deceives."
</p>
<p>
To this Ulysses: "O celestial maid!<br/>
Praised be thy counsel, and thy timely aid;<br/>
Else had I seen my native walls in vain,<br/>
Like great Atrides, just restored and slain.<br/>
Vouchsafe the means of vengeance to debate,<br/>
And plan with all thy arts the scene of fate.<br/>
Then, then be present, and my soul inspire,<br/>
As when we wrapp'd Troy's heaven-built walls in fire.<br/>
Though leagued against me hundred heroes stand.<br/>
Hundreds shall fall, if Pallas aid my hand."
</p>
<p>
She answer'd: "In the dreadful day of fight<br/>
Know, I am with thee, strong in all my might.<br/>
If thou but equal to thyself be found,<br/>
What gasping numbers then shall press the ground!<br/>
What human victims stain the feastful floor!<br/>
How wide the pavements float with guilty gore!<br/>
It fits thee now to wear a dark disguise,<br/>
And secret walk unknown to mortal eyes.<br/>
For this, my hand shall wither every grace,<br/>
And every elegance of form and face;<br/>
O'er thy smooth skin a bark of wrinkles spread,<br/>
Turn hoar the auburn honours of thy head;<br/>
Disfigure every limb with coarse attire,<br/>
And in thy eyes extinguish all the fire;<br/>
Add all the wants and the decays of life;<br/>
Estrange thee from thy own; thy son, thy wife;<br/>
From the loathed object every sight shall turn,<br/>
And the blind suitors their destruction scorn.
</p>
<p>
"Go first the master of thy herds to find,<br/>
True to his charge, a loyal swain and kind;<br/>
For thee he sighs; and to the loyal heir<br/>
And chaste Penelope extends his care.<br/>
At the Coracian rock he now resides,<br/>
Where Arethusa's sable water glides;<br/>
The sable water and the copious mast<br/>
Swell the fat herd; luxuriant, large repast!<br/>
With him rest peaceful in the rural cell,<br/>
And all you ask his faithful tongue shall tell.<br/>
Me into other realms my cares convey,<br/>
To Sparta, still with female beauty gay;<br/>
For know, to Sparta thy loved offspring came,<br/>
To learn thy fortunes from the voice of Fame."
</p>
<p>
At this the father, with a father's care:<br/>
"Must he too suffer? he, O goddess! bear<br/>
Of wanderings and of woes a wretched share?<br/>
Through the wild ocean plough the dangerous way,<br/>
And leave his fortunes and his house a prey?<br/>
Why would'st not thou, O all-enlighten'd mind!<br/>
Inform him certain, and protect him, kind?"
</p>
<p>
To whom Minerva: "Be thy soul at rest;<br/>
And know, whatever heaven ordains is best.<br/>
To fame I sent him, to acquire renown;<br/>
To other regions is his virtue known;<br/>
Secure he sits, near great Atrides placed;<br/>
With friendships strengthen'd, and with honours graced,<br/>
But lo! an ambush waits his passage o'er;<br/>
Fierce foes insidious intercept the shore;<br/>
In vain; far sooner all the murderous brood<br/>
This injured land shall fatten with their blood."
</p>
<p>
She spake, then touch'd him with her powerful wand:<br/>
The skin shrunk up, and wither'd at her hand;<br/>
A swift old age o'er all his members spread;<br/>
A sudden frost was sprinkled on his head;<br/>
Nor longer in the heavy eye-ball shined<br/>
The glance divine, forth-beaming from the mind.<br/>
His robe, which spots indelible besmear,<br/>
In rags dishonest flutters with the air:<br/>
A stag's torn hide is lapp'd around his reins;<br/>
A rugged staff his trembling hand sustains;<br/>
And at his side a wretched scrip was hung,<br/>
Wide-patch'd, and knotted to a twisted thong.<br/>
So looked the chief, so moved: to mortal eyes<br/>
Object uncouth! a man of miseries!<br/>
While Pallas, cleaving the wild fields of air,<br/>
To Sparta flies, Telemachus her care.

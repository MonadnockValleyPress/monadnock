<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XIV</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
But he, deep-musing, o'er the mountains stray'd<br/>
Through mazy thickets of the woodland shade,<br/>
And cavern'd ways, the shaggy coast along<br/>
With cliffs and nodding forests overhung.<br/>
Eumaeus at his sylvan lodge he sought,<br/>
A faithful servant, and without a fault.<br/>
Ulysses found him busied as he sate<br/>
Before the threshold of his rustic gate;<br/>
Around the mansion in a circle shone<br/>
A rural portico of rugged stone<br/>
(In absence of his lord with honest toil<br/>
His own industrious hands had raised the pile).<br/>
The wall was stone from neighbouring quarries borne,<br/>
Encircled with a fence of native thorn,<br/>
And strong with pales, by many a weary stroke<br/>
Of stubborn labour hewn from heart of oak:<br/>
Frequent and thick. Within the space were rear'd<br/>
Twelve ample cells, the lodgments of his herd.<br/>
Full fifty pregnant females each contain'd;<br/>
The males without (a smaller race) remain'd;<br/>
Doom'd to supply the suitors' wasteful feast,<br/>
A stock by daily luxury decreased;<br/>
Now scarce four hundred left. These to defend,<br/>
Four savage dogs, a watchful guard, attend.<br/>
Here sat Eumaeus, and his cares applied<br/>
To form strong buskins of well-season'd hide.<br/>
Of four assistants who his labour share,<br/>
Three now were absent on the rural care;<br/>
The fourth drove victims to a suitor train:<br/>
But he, of ancient faith, a simple swain,<br/>
Sigh'd, while he furnish'd the luxurious board,<br/>
And wearied Heaven with wishes for his lord.
</p>
<p>
Soon as Ulysses near the inclosure drew,<br/>
With open mouths the furious mastiffs flew:<br/>
Down sat the sage, and cautious to withstand,<br/>
Let fall the offensive truncheon from his hand.<br/>
Sudden, the master runs; aloud he calls;<br/>
And from his hasty hand the leather falls:<br/>
With showers of stones he drives then far away:<br/>
The scattering dogs around at distance bay.
</p>
<p>
"Unhappy stranger! (thus the faithful swain<br/>
Began with accent gracious and humane),<br/>
What sorrow had been mine, if at my gate<br/>
Thy reverend age had met a shameful fate!<br/>
Enough of woes already have I known;<br/>
Enough my master's sorrows and my own.<br/>
While here (ungrateful task!) his herds I feed,<br/>
Ordain'd for lawless rioters to bleed!<br/>
Perhaps, supported at another's board!<br/>
Far from his country roams my hapless lord;<br/>
Or sigh'd in exile forth his latest breath,<br/>
Now cover'd with the eternal shade of death!
</p>
<p>
"But enter this my homely roof, and see<br/>
Our woods not void of hospitality.<br/>
Then tell me whence thou art, and what the share<br/>
Of woes and wanderings thou wert born to bear."
</p>
<p>
He said, and, seconding the kind request,<br/>
With friendly step precedes his unknown guest.<br/>
A shaggy goat's soft hide beneath him spread,<br/>
And with fresh rushes heap'd an ample bed;<br/>
Jove touch'd the hero's tender soul, to find<br/>
So just reception from a heart so kind:<br/>
And "Oh, ye gods! with all your blessings grace<br/>
(He thus broke forth) this friend of human race!"
</p>
<p>
The swain replied: "It never was our guise<br/>
To slight the poor, or aught humane despise:<br/>
For Jove unfolds our hospitable door,<br/>
'Tis Jove that sends the stranger and the poor,<br/>
Little, alas! is all the good I can<br/>
A man oppress'd, dependent, yet a man:<br/>
Accept such treatment as a swain affords,<br/>
Slave to the insolence of youthful lords!<br/>
Far hence is by unequal gods removed<br/>
That man of bounties, loving and beloved!<br/>
To whom whate'er his slave enjoys is owed,<br/>
And more, had Fate allow'd, had been bestow'd:<br/>
But Fate condemn'd him to a foreign shore;<br/>
Much have I sorrow'd, but my Master more.<br/>
Now cold he lies, to death's embrace resign'd:<br/>
Ah, perish Helen! perish all her kind!<br/>
For whose cursed cause, in Agamemnon's name,<br/>
He trod so fatally the paths of fame."
</p>
<p>
His vest succinct then girding round his waist,<br/>
Forth rush'd the swain with hospitable haste.<br/>
Straight to the lodgments of his herd he run,<br/>
Where the fat porkers slept beneath the sun;<br/>
Of two, his cutlass launch'd the spouting blood;<br/>
These quarter'd, singed, and fix'd on forks of wood,<br/>
All hasty on the hissing coals he threw;<br/>
And smoking, back the tasteful viands drew.<br/>
Broachers and all then an the board display'd<br/>
The ready meal, before Ulysses laid<br/>
With flour imbrown'd; next mingled wine yet new,<br/>
And luscious as the bees' nectareous dew:<br/>
Then sate, companion of the friendly feast,<br/>
With open look; and thus bespoke his guest:<br/>
"Take with free welcome what our hands prepare,<br/>
Such food as falls to simple servants' share;<br/>
The best our lords consume; those thoughtless peers,<br/>
Rich without bounty, guilty without fears;<br/>
Yet sure the gods their impious acts detest,<br/>
And honour justice and the righteous breast.<br/>
Pirates and conquerors of harden'd mind,<br/>
The foes of peace, and scourges of mankind,<br/>
To whom offending men are made a prey<br/>
When Jove in vengeance gives a land away;<br/>
E'en these, when of their ill-got spoils possess'd,<br/>
Find sure tormentors in the guilty breast:<br/>
Some voice of God close whispering from within,<br/>
'Wretch! this is villainy, and this is sin.'<br/>
But these, no doubt, some oracle explore,<br/>
That tells, the great Ulysses is no more.<br/>
Hence springs their confidence, and from our sighs<br/>
Their rapine strengthens, and their riots rise:<br/>
Constant as Jove the night and day bestows,<br/>
Bleeds a whole hecatomb, a vintage flows.<br/>
None match'd this hero's wealth, of all who reign<br/>
O'er the fair islands of the neighbouring main.<br/>
Nor all the monarchs whose far-dreaded sway<br/>
The wide-extended continents obey:<br/>
First, on the main land, of Ulysses' breed<br/>
Twelve herds, twelve flocks, on ocean's margin feed;<br/>
As many stalls for shaggy goats are rear'd;<br/>
As many lodgments for the tusky herd;<br/>
Two foreign keepers guard: and here are seen<br/>
Twelve herds of goats that graze our utmost green;<br/>
To native pastors is their charge assign'd,<br/>
And mine the care to feed the bristly kind;<br/>
Each day the fattest bleeds of either herd,<br/>
All to the suitors' wasteful board preferr'd."<br/>
Thus he, benevolent: his unknown guest<br/>
With hunger keen devours the savoury feast;<br/>
While schemes of vengeance ripen in his breast.<br/>
Silent and thoughtful while the board he eyed,<br/>
Eumaeus pours on high the purple tide;<br/>
The king with smiling looks his joy express'd,<br/>
And thus the kind inviting host address'd:
</p>
<p>
"Say now, what man is he, the man deplored,<br/>
So rich, so potent, whom you style your lord?<br/>
Late with such affluence and possessions bless'd,<br/>
And now in honour's glorious bed at rest.<br/>
Whoever was the warrior, he must be<br/>
To fame no stranger, nor perhaps to me:<br/>
Who (so the gods and so the Fates ordain'd)<br/>
Have wander'd many a sea, and many a land."
</p>
<p>
"Small is the faith the prince and queen ascribe<br/>
(Replied Eumaeus) to the wandering tribe.<br/>
For needy strangers still to flattery fly,<br/>
And want too oft betrays the tongue to lie.<br/>
Each vagrant traveller, that touches here,<br/>
Deludes with fallacies the royal ear,<br/>
To dear remembrance makes his image rise,<br/>
And calls the springing sorrows from her eyes.<br/>
Such thou mayst be. But he whose name you crave<br/>
Moulders in earth, or welters on the wave,<br/>
Or food for fish or dogs his relics lie,<br/>
Or torn by birds are scatter'd through the sky.<br/>
So perish'd he: and left (for ever lost)<br/>
Much woe to all, but sure to me the most.<br/>
So mild a master never shall I find;<br/>
Less dear the parents whom I left behind,<br/>
Less soft my mother, less my father kind.<br/>
Not with such transport would my eyes run o'er,<br/>
Again to hail them in their native shore,<br/>
As loved Ulysses once more to embrace,<br/>
Restored and breathing in his natal place.<br/>
That name for ever dread, yet ever dear,<br/>
E'en in his absence I pronounce with fear:<br/>
In my respect, he bears a prince's part;<br/>
But lives a very brother in my heart."
</p>
<p>
Thus spoke the faithful swain, and thus rejoin'd<br/>
The master of his grief, the man of patient mind:<br/>
"Ulysses, friend! shall view his old abodes<br/>
(Distrustful as thou art), nor doubt the gods.<br/>
Nor speak I rashly, but with faith averr'd,<br/>
And what I speak attesting Heaven has heard.<br/>
If so, a cloak and vesture be my meed:<br/>
Till his return no title shall I plead,<br/>
Though certain be my news, and great my need.<br/>
Whom want itself can force untruths to tell,<br/>
My soul detests him as the gates of hell.
</p>
<p>
"Thou first be witness, hospitable Jove!<br/>
And every god inspiring social love!<br/>
And witness every household power that waits,<br/>
Guard of these fires, and angel of these gates!<br/>
Ere the next moon increase or this decay,<br/>
His ancient realms Ulysses shall survey,<br/>
In blood and dust each proud oppressor mourn,<br/>
And the lost glories of his house return."
</p>
<p>
"Nor shall that meed be thine, nor ever more<br/>
Shall loved Ulysses hail this happy shore.<br/>
(Replied Eumaeus): to the present hour<br/>
Now turn thy thought, and joys within our power.<br/>
From sad reflection let my soul repose;<br/>
The name of him awakes a thousand woes.<br/>
But guard him, gods! and to these arms restore!<br/>
Not his true consort can desire him more;<br/>
Not old Laertes, broken with despair:<br/>
Not young Telemachus, his blooming heir.<br/>
Alas, Telemachus! my sorrows flow<br/>
Afresh for thee, my second cause of woe!<br/>
Like some fair plant set by a heavenly hand,<br/>
He grew, he flourish'd, and he bless'd the land;<br/>
In all the youth his father's image shined,<br/>
Bright in his person, brighter in his mind.<br/>
What man, or god, deceived his better sense,<br/>
Far on the swelling seas to wander hence?<br/>
To distant Pylos hapless is he gone,<br/>
To seek his father's fate and find his own!<br/>
For traitors wait his way, with dire design<br/>
To end at once the great Arcesian line.<br/>
But let us leave him to their wills above;<br/>
The fates of men are in the hand of Jove.<br/>
And now, my venerable guest! declare<br/>
Your name, your parents, and your native air:<br/>
Sincere from whence begun, your course relate,<br/>
And to what ship I owe the friendly freight?"
</p>
<p>
Thus he: and thus (with prompt invention bold)<br/>
The cautious chief his ready story told.
</p>
<p>
"On dark reserve what better can prevail,<br/>
Or from the fluent tongue produce the tale,<br/>
Than when two friends, alone, in peaceful place<br/>
Confer, and wines and cates the table grace;<br/>
But most, the kind inviter's cheerful face?<br/>
Thus might we sit, with social goblets crown'd,<br/>
Till the whole circle of the year goes round:<br/>
Not the whole circle of the year would close<br/>
My long narration of a life of woes.<br/>
But such was Heaven's high will! Know then, I came<br/>
From sacred Crete, and from a sire of fame:<br/>
Castor Hylacides (that name he bore),<br/>
Beloved and honour'd in his native shore;<br/>
Bless'd in his riches, in his children more.<br/>
Sprung of a handmaid, from a bought embrace,<br/>
I shared his kindness with his lawful race:<br/>
But when that fate, which all must undergo,<br/>
From earth removed him to the shades below,<br/>
The large domain his greedy sons divide,<br/>
And each was portion'd as the lots decide.<br/>
Little, alas! was left my wretched share,<br/>
Except a house, a covert from the air:<br/>
But what by niggard fortune was denied,<br/>
A willing widow's copious wealth supplied.<br/>
My valour was my plea, a gallant mind,<br/>
That, true to honour, never lagg'd behind<br/>
(The sex is ever to a soldier kind).<br/>
Now wasting years my former strength confound,<br/>
And added woes have bow'd me to the ground;<br/>
Yet by the stubble you may guess the grain,<br/>
And mark the ruins of no vulgar man.<br/>
Me, Pallas gave to lead the martial storm,<br/>
And the fair ranks of battle to deform;<br/>
Me, Mars inspired to turn the foe to flight,<br/>
And tempt the secret ambush of the night.<br/>
Let ghastly Death in all his forms appear,<br/>
I saw him not, it was not mine to fear.<br/>
Before the rest I raised my ready steel,<br/>
The first I met, he yielded, or he fell.<br/>
But works of peace my soul disdain'd to bear,<br/>
The rural labour, or domestic care.<br/>
To raise the mast, the missile dart to wing,<br/>
And send swift arrows from the bounding string,<br/>
Were arts the gods made grateful to my mind;<br/>
Those gods, who turn (to various ends design'd)<br/>
The various thoughts and talents of mankind.<br/>
Before the Grecians touch'd the Trojan plain,<br/>
Nine times commander or by land or main,<br/>
In foreign fields I spread my glory far,<br/>
Great in the praise, rich in the spoils of war;<br/>
Thence charged with riches, as increased in fame,<br/>
To Crete return'd, an honourable name.<br/>
But when great Jove that direful war decreed,<br/>
Which roused all Greece, and made the mighty bleed;<br/>
Our states myself and Idomen employ<br/>
To lead their fleets, and carry death to Troy.<br/>
Nine years we warr'd; the tenth saw Ilion fall;<br/>
Homeward we sail'd, but heaven dispersed us all.<br/>
One only month my wife enjoy'd my stay;<br/>
So will'd the god who gives and takes away.<br/>
Nine ships I mann'd, equipp'd with ready stores,<br/>
Intent to voyage to the Ægyptian shores;<br/>
In feast and sacrifice my chosen train<br/>
Six days consum'd; the seventh we plough'd the main.<br/>
Crete's ample fields diminish to our eye;<br/>
Before the Boreal blast the vessels fly;<br/>
Safe through the level seas we sweep our way;<br/>
The steersman governs, and the ships obey.<br/>
The fifth fair morn we stem the Ægyptian tide,<br/>
And tilting o'er the bay the vessels ride:<br/>
To anchor there my fellows I command,<br/>
And spies commission to explore the land.<br/>
But, sway'd by lust of gain, and headlong will,<br/>
The coasts they ravage, and the natives kill.<br/>
The spreading clamour to their city flies,<br/>
And horse and foot in mingled tumult rise.<br/>
The reddening dawn reveals the circling fields,<br/>
Horrid with bristly spears, and glancing shields.<br/>
Jove thunder'd on their side. Our guilty head<br/>
We turn'd to flight; the gathering vengeance spread<br/>
On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lie dead.<br/>
I then explored my thought, what course to prove<br/>
(And sure the thought was dictated by Jove):<br/>
Oh, had he left me to that happier doom,<br/>
And saved a life of miseries to come!<br/>
The radiant helmet from my brows unlaced,<br/>
And low on earth my shield and javelin cast,<br/>
I meet the monarch with a suppliant's face,<br/>
Approach his chariot, and his knees embrace,<br/>
He heard, he saved, he placed me at his side;<br/>
My state he pitied, and my tears he dried,<br/>
Restrain'd the rage the vengeful foe express'd,<br/>
And turn'd the deadly weapons from my breast.<br/>
Pious! to guard the hospitable rite,<br/>
And fearing Jove, whom mercy's works delight.
</p>
<p>
"In Ægypt thus with peace and plenty bless'd,<br/>
I lived (and happy still have lived) a guest.<br/>
On seven bright years successive blessings wait;<br/>
The next changed all the colour of my fate.<br/>
A false Phoenician, of insiduous mind,<br/>
Versed in vile arts, and foe to humankind,<br/>
With semblance fair invites me to his home;<br/>
I seized the proffer (ever fond to roam):<br/>
Domestic in his faithless roof I stay'd,<br/>
Till the swift sun his annual circle made.<br/>
To Libya then he mediates the way;<br/>
With guileful art a stranger to betray,<br/>
And sell to bondage in a foreign land:<br/>
Much doubting, yet compell'd I quit the strand,<br/>
Through the mid seas the nimble pinnace sails,<br/>
Aloof from Crete, before the northern gales:<br/>
But when remote her chalky cliffs we lost,<br/>
And far from ken of any other coast,<br/>
When all was wild expanse of sea and air,<br/>
Then doom'd high Jove due vengeance to prepare.<br/>
He hung a night of horrors o'er their head<br/>
(The shaded ocean blacken'd as it spread):<br/>
He launch'd the fiery bolt: from pole to pole<br/>
Broad burst the lightnings, deep the thunders roll;<br/>
In giddy rounds the whirling ship is toss'd,<br/>
And all in clouds of smothering sulphur lost.<br/>
As from a hanging rock's tremendous height,<br/>
The sable crows with intercepted flight<br/>
Drop endlong; scarr'd, and black with sulphurous hue,<br/>
So from the deck are hurl'd the ghastly crew.<br/>
Such end the wicked found! but Jove's intent<br/>
Was yet to save the oppress'd and innocent.<br/>
Placed on the mast (the last resource of life)<br/>
With winds and waves I held unequal strife:<br/>
For nine long days the billows tilting o'er,<br/>
The tenth soft wafts me to Thesprotia's shore.<br/>
The monarch's son a shipwreck'd wretch relieved,<br/>
The sire with hospitable rites received,<br/>
And in his palace like a brother placed,<br/>
With gifts of price and gorgeous garments graced<br/>
While here I sojourn'd, oft I heard the fame<br/>
How late Ulysses to the country came.<br/>
How loved, how honour'd in this court he stay'd,<br/>
And here his whole collected treasure laid;<br/>
I saw myself the vast unnumber'd store<br/>
Of steel elaborate, and refulgent ore,<br/>
And brass high heap'd amidst the regal dome;<br/>
Immense supplies for ages yet to come!<br/>
Meantime he voyaged to explore the will<br/>
Of Jove, on high Dodona's holy hill,<br/>
What means might best his safe return avail,<br/>
To come in pomp, or bear a secret sail?<br/>
Full oft has Phidon, whilst he pour'd the wine,<br/>
Attesting solemn all the powers divine,<br/>
That soon Ulysses would return, declared<br/>
The sailors waiting, and the ships prepared.<br/>
But first the king dismiss'd me from his shores,<br/>
For fair Dulichium crown'd with fruitful stores;<br/>
To good Acastus' friendly care consign'd:<br/>
But other counsels pleased the sailors' mind:<br/>
New frauds were plotted by the faithless train,<br/>
And misery demands me once again.<br/>
Soon as remote from shore they plough the wave,<br/>
With ready hands they rush to seize their slave;<br/>
Then with these tatter'd rags they wrapp'd me round<br/>
(Stripp'd of my own), and to the vessel bound.<br/>
At eve, at Ithaca's delightful land<br/>
The ship arriv'd: forth issuing on the sand,<br/>
They sought repast; while to the unhappy kind,<br/>
The pitying gods themselves my chains unbind.<br/>
Soft I descended, to the sea applied<br/>
My naked breast, and shot along the tide.<br/>
Soon pass'd beyond their sight, I left the flood,<br/>
And took the spreading shelter of the wood.<br/>
Their prize escaped the faithless pirates mourn'd;<br/>
But deem'd inquiry vain, and to their ships return'd.<br/>
Screen'd by protecting gods from hostile eyes,<br/>
They led me to a good man and a wise,<br/>
To live beneath thy hospitable care,<br/>
And wait the woes Heaven dooms me yet to bear."
</p>
<p>
"Unhappy guest! whose sorrows touch my mind!<br/>
(Thus good Eumaeus with a sigh rejoin'd,)<br/>
For real sufferings since I grieve sincere,<br/>
Check not with fallacies the springing tear:<br/>
Nor turn the passion into groundless joy<br/>
For him whom Heaven has destined to destroy.<br/>
Oh! had he perish'd on some well-fought day,<br/>
Or in his friend's embraces died away!<br/>
That grateful Greece with streaming eyes might raise<br/>
Historic marbles to record his praise;<br/>
His praise, eternal on the faithful stone,<br/>
Had with transmissive honours graced his son.<br/>
Now, snatch'd by harpies to the dreary coast,<br/>
Sunk is the hero, and his glory lost!<br/>
While pensive in this solitary den,<br/>
Far from gay cities and the ways of men,<br/>
I linger life; nor to the court repair,<br/>
But when my constant queen commands my care;<br/>
Or when, to taste her hospitable board,<br/>
Some guest arrives, with rumours of her lord;<br/>
And these indulge their want, and those their woe,<br/>
And here the tears and there the goblets flow.<br/>
By many such have I been warn'd; but chief<br/>
By one Aetolian robb'd of all belief,<br/>
Whose hap it was to this our roof to roam,<br/>
For murder banish'd from his native home.<br/>
He swore, Ulysses on the coast of Crete<br/>
Stay'd but a season to refit his fleet;<br/>
A few revolving months should waft him o'er,<br/>
Fraught with bold warriors, and a boundless store<br/>
O thou! whom age has taught to understand,<br/>
And Heaven has guided with a favouring hand!<br/>
On god or mortal to obtrude a lie<br/>
Forbear, and dread to flatter as to die.<br/>
Nor for such ends my house and heart are free,<br/>
But dear respect to Jove, and charity."
</p>
<p>
"And why, O swain of unbelieving mind!<br/>
(Thus quick replied the wisest of mankind)<br/>
Doubt you my oath? yet more my faith to try,<br/>
A solemn compact let us ratify,<br/>
And witness every power that rules the sky!<br/>
If here Ulysses from his labours rest,<br/>
Be then my prize a tunic and a vest;<br/>
And where my hopes invite me, straight transport<br/>
In safety to Dulichium's friendly court.<br/>
But if he greets not thy desiring eye,<br/>
Hurl me from yon dread precipice on high:<br/>
The due reward of fraud and perjury."
</p>
<p>
"Doubtless, O guest! great laud and praise were mine<br/>
(Replied the swain, for spotless faith divine),<br/>
If after social rites and gifts bestow'd,<br/>
I stain'd my hospitable hearth with blood.<br/>
How would the gods my righteous toils succeed,<br/>
And bless the hand that made a stranger bleed?<br/>
No more&mdash;the approaching hours of silent night<br/>
First claim refection, then to rest invite;<br/>
Beneath our humble cottage let us haste,<br/>
And here, unenvied, rural dainties taste."
</p>
<p>
Thus communed these; while to their lowly dome<br/>
The full-fed swine return'd with evening home;<br/>
Compell'd, reluctant, to their several sties,<br/>
With din obstreperous, and ungrateful cries.<br/>
Then to the slaves: "Now from the herd the best<br/>
Select in honour of our foreign guest:<br/>
With him let us the genial banquet share,<br/>
For great and many are the griefs we bear;<br/>
While those who from our labours heap their board<br/>
Blaspheme their feeder, and forget their lord."
</p>
<p>
Thus speaking, with despatchful hand he took<br/>
A weighty axe, and cleft the solid oak;<br/>
This on the earth he piled; a boar full fed,<br/>
Of five years' age, before the pile was led:<br/>
The swain, whom acts of piety delight,<br/>
Observant of the gods, begins the rite;<br/>
First shears the forehead of the bristly boar,<br/>
And suppliant stands, invoking every power<br/>
To speed Ulysses to his native shore.<br/>
A knotty stake then aiming at his head,<br/>
Down dropped he groaning, and the spirit fled.<br/>
The scorching flames climb round on every side;<br/>
Then the singed members they with skill divide;<br/>
On these, in rolls of fat involved with art,<br/>
The choicest morsels lay from every part.<br/>
Some in the flames bestrew'd with flour they threw;<br/>
Some cut in fragments from the forks they drew:<br/>
These while on several tables they dispose.<br/>
A priest himself the blameless rustic rose;<br/>
Expert the destined victim to dispart<br/>
In seven just portions, pure of hand and heart.<br/>
One sacred to the nymphs apart they lay:<br/>
Another to the winged son of May;<br/>
The rural tribe in common share the rest,<br/>
The king the chine, the honour of the feast,<br/>
Who sate delighted at his servant's board;<br/>
The faithful servant joy'd his unknown lord.<br/>
"Oh be thou dear (Ulysses cried) to Jove,<br/>
As well thou claim'st a grateful stranger's love!"
</p>
<p>
"Be then thy thanks (the bounteous swain replied)<br/>
Enjoyment of the good the gods provide.<br/>
From God's own hand descend our joys and woes;<br/>
These he decrees, and he but suffers those:<br/>
All power is his, and whatsoe'er he wills,<br/>
The will itself, omnipotent, fulfils."<br/>
This said, the first-fruits to the gods he gave;<br/>
Then pour'd of offer'd wine the sable wave:<br/>
In great Ulysses' hand he placed the bowl,<br/>
He sate, and sweet refection cheer'd his soul.<br/>
The bread from canisters Mesaulius gave<br/>
(Eumaeus' proper treasure bought this slave,<br/>
And led from Taphos, to attend his board,<br/>
A servant added to his absent lord);<br/>
His task it was the wheaten loaves to lay,<br/>
And from the banquet take the bowls away.<br/>
And now the rage of hunger was repress'd,<br/>
And each betakes him to his couch to rest.
</p>
<p>
Now came the night, and darkness cover'd o'er<br/>
The face of things; the winds began to roar;<br/>
The driving storm the watery west-wind pours,<br/>
And Jove descends in deluges of showers.<br/>
Studious of rest and warmth, Ulysses lies,<br/>
Foreseeing from the first the storm would rise<br/>
In mere necessity of coat and cloak,<br/>
With artful preface to his host he spoke:<br/>
"Hear me, my friends! who this good banquet grace;<br/>
'Tis sweet to play the fool in time and place,<br/>
And wine can of their wits the wise beguile,<br/>
Make the sage frolic, and the serious smile,<br/>
The grave in merry measures frisk about,<br/>
And many a long-repented word bring out.<br/>
Since to be talkative I now commence,<br/>
Let wit cast off the sullen yoke of sense.<br/>
Once I was strong (would Heaven restore those days!)<br/>
And with my betters claim'd a share of praise.<br/>
Ulysses, Menelaus, led forth a band,<br/>
And join'd me with them ('twas their own command);<br/>
A deathful ambush for the foe to lay,<br/>
Beneath Troy walls by night we took our way:<br/>
There, clad in arms, along the marshes spread,<br/>
We made the osier-fringed bank our bed.<br/>
Full soon the inclemency of heaven I feel,<br/>
Nor had these shoulders covering, but of steel.<br/>
Sharp blew the north; snow whitening all the fields<br/>
Froze with the blast, and gathering glazed our shields.<br/>
There all but I, well fenced with cloak and vest,<br/>
Lay cover'd by their ample shields at rest.<br/>
Fool that I was! I left behind my own,<br/>
The skill of weather and of winds unknown,<br/>
And trusted to my coat and shield alone!<br/>
When now was wasted more than half the night,<br/>
And the stars faded at approaching light,<br/>
Sudden I jogg'd Ulysses, who was laid<br/>
Fast by my side, and shivering thus I said:
</p>
<p>
"'Here longer in this field I cannot lie;<br/>
The winter pinches, and with cold I die,<br/>
And die ashamed (O wisest of mankind),<br/>
The only fool who left his cloak behind.'
</p>
<p>
"He thought and answer'd: hardly waking yet,<br/>
Sprung in his mind a momentary wit<br/>
(That wit, which or in council or in fight,<br/>
Still met the emergence, and determined right).<br/>
'Hush thee (he cried, soft whispering in my ear),<br/>
Speak not a word, lest any Greek may hear'&mdash;<br/>
And then (supporting on his arm his head),<br/>
'Hear me, companions! (thus aloud he said:)<br/>
Methinks too distant from the fleet we lie:<br/>
E'en now a vision stood before my eye,<br/>
And sure the warning vision was from high:<br/>
Let from among us some swift courier rise,<br/>
Haste to the general, and demand supplies.'
</p>
<p>
"Up started Thoas straight, Andraemon's son,<br/>
Nimbly he rose, and cast his garment down!<br/>
Instant, the racer vanish'd off the ground;<br/>
That instant in his cloak I wrapp'd me round:<br/>
And safe I slept, till brightly-dawning shone<br/>
The morn conspicuous on her golden throne.
</p>
<p>
"Oh were my strength as then, as then my age!<br/>
Some friend would fence me from the winter's rage.<br/>
Yet, tatter'd as I look, I challenged then<br/>
The honours and the offices of men:<br/>
Some master, or some servant would allow<br/>
A cloak and vest&mdash;but I am nothing now!"
</p>
<p>
"Well hast thou spoke (rejoin'd the attentive swain):<br/>
Thy lips let fall no idle word or vain!<br/>
Nor garment shalt thou want, nor aught beside,<br/>
Meet for the wandering suppliant to provide.<br/>
But in the morning take thy clothes again,<br/>
For here one vest suffices every swain:<br/>
No change of garments to our hinds is known;<br/>
But when return'd, the good Ulysses' son<br/>
With better hand shall grace with fit attires<br/>
His guest, and send thee where thy soul desires."
</p>
<p>
The honest herdsman rose, as this he said,<br/>
And drew before the hearth the stranger's bed;<br/>
The fleecy spoils of sheep, a goat's rough hide<br/>
He spreads; and adds a mantle thick and wide;<br/>
With store to heap above him, and below,<br/>
And guard each quarter as the tempests blow.<br/>
There lay the king, and all the rest supine;<br/>
All, but the careful master of the swine:<br/>
Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care;<br/>
Well arm'd, and fenced against nocturnal air:<br/>
His weighty falchion o'er his shoulder tied:<br/>
His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied:<br/>
With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men,<br/>
He seeks his lodging in the rocky den.<br/>
There to the tusky herd he bends his way,<br/>
Where, screen'd from Boreas, high o'erarch'd they lay.

<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XXII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,<br/>
The herded Ilians rush like driven deer:<br/>
There safe they wipe the briny drops away,<br/>
And drown in bowls the labours of the day.<br/>
Close to the walls, advancing o'er the fields<br/>
Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,<br/>
March, bending on, the Greeks' embodied powers,<br/>
Far stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.<br/>
Great Hector singly stay'd: chain'd down by fate<br/>
There fix'd he stood before the Scaean gate;<br/>
Still his bold arms determined to employ,<br/>
The guardian still of long-defended Troy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Apollo now to tired Achilles turns:<br/>
(The power confess'd in all his glory burns:)<br/>
"And what (he cries) has Peleus' son in view,<br/>
With mortal speed a godhead to pursue?<br/>
For not to thee to know the gods is given,<br/>
Unskill'd to trace the latent marks of heaven.<br/>
What boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?<br/>
Vain thy past labour, and thy present vain:<br/>
Safe in their walls are now her troops bestow'd,<br/>
While here thy frantic rage attacks a god."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The chief incensed&mdash;"Too partial god of day!<br/>
To check my conquests in the middle way:<br/>
How few in Ilion else had refuge found!<br/>
What gasping numbers now had bit the ground!<br/>
Thou robb'st me of a glory justly mine,<br/>
Powerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:<br/>
Mean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,<br/>
To cheat a mortal who repines in vain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then to the city, terrible and strong,<br/>
With high and haughty steps he tower'd along,<br/>
So the proud courser, victor of the prize,<br/>
To the near goal with double ardour flies.<br/>
Him, as he blazing shot across the field,<br/>
The careful eyes of Priam first beheld.<br/>
Not half so dreadful rises to the sight,<br/>
Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,<br/>
Orion's dog (the year when autumn weighs),<br/>
And o'er the feebler stars exerts his rays;<br/>
Terrific glory! for his burning breath<br/>
Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.<br/>
So flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:<br/>
He strikes his reverend head, now white with age;<br/>
He lifts his wither'd arms; obtests the skies;<br/>
He calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:<br/>
The son, resolved Achilles' force to dare,<br/>
Full at the Scaean gates expects the war;<br/>
While the sad father on the rampart stands,<br/>
And thus adjures him with extended hands:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;<br/>
Hector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!<br/>
Methinks already I behold thee slain,<br/>
And stretch'd beneath that fury of the plain.<br/>
Implacable Achilles! might'st thou be<br/>
To all the gods no dearer than to me!<br/>
Thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore.<br/>
And bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.<br/>
How many valiant sons I late enjoy'd,<br/>
Valiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy'd:<br/>
Or, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles<br/>
To shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.<br/>
Two, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,<br/>
Two from one mother sprung, my Polydore,<br/>
And loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!<br/>
Oh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,<br/>
What heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!<br/>
(Their grandsire's wealth, by right of birth their own,<br/>
Consign'd his daughter with Lelegia's throne:)<br/>
But if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,<br/>
All pale they wander on the Stygian coast;<br/>
What sorrows then must their sad mother know,<br/>
What anguish I? unutterable woe!<br/>
Yet less that anguish, less to her, to me,<br/>
Less to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.<br/>
Yet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;<br/>
And spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!<br/>
Save thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave<br/>
Neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.<br/>
Pity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;<br/>
While yet thy father feels the woes he bears,<br/>
Yet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage<br/>
(All trembling on the verge of helpless age)<br/>
Great Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!<br/>
The bitter dregs of fortune's cup to drain:<br/>
To fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,<br/>
And number all his days by miseries!<br/>
My heroes slain, my bridal bed o'erturn'd,<br/>
My daughters ravish'd, and my city burn'd,<br/>
My bleeding infants dash'd against the floor;<br/>
These I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!<br/>
Perhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,<br/>
The last sad relic of my ruin'd state,<br/>
(Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,<br/>
And stain the pavement of my regal hall;<br/>
Where famish'd dogs, late guardians of my door,<br/>
Shall lick their mangled master's spatter'd gore.<br/>
Yet for my sons I thank ye, gods! 'tis well;<br/>
Well have they perish'd, for in fight they fell.<br/>
Who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,<br/>
Struck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.<br/>
But when the fates, in fulness of their rage,<br/>
Spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,<br/>
In dust the reverend lineaments deform,<br/>
And pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:<br/>
This, this is misery! the last, the worse,<br/>
That man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and acting what no words could say,<br/>
Rent from his head the silver locks away.<br/>
With him the mournful mother bears a part;<br/>
Yet all her sorrows turn not Hector's heart.<br/>
The zone unbraced, her bosom she display'd;<br/>
And thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Have mercy on me, O my son! revere<br/>
The words of age; attend a parent's prayer!<br/>
If ever thee in these fond arms I press'd,<br/>
Or still'd thy infant clamours at this breast;<br/>
Ah do not thus our helpless years forego,<br/>
But, by our walls secured, repel the foe.<br/>
Against his rage if singly thou proceed,<br/>
Should'st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should'st thou bleed,<br/>
Nor must thy corse lie honour'd on the bier,<br/>
Nor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!<br/>
Far from our pious rites those dear remains<br/>
Must feast the vultures on the naked plains."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;<br/>
But fix'd remains the purpose of his soul;<br/>
Resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance<br/>
Expects the hero's terrible advance.<br/>
So, roll'd up in his den, the swelling snake<br/>
Beholds the traveller approach the brake;<br/>
When fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins<br/>
Have gather'd half the poisons of the plains;<br/>
He burns, he stiffens with collected ire,<br/>
And his red eyeballs glare with living fire.<br/>
Beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,<br/>
He stood, and question'd thus his mighty mind:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?<br/>
Honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:<br/>
Shall proud Polydamas before the gate<br/>
Proclaim, his counsels are obey'd too late,<br/>
Which timely follow'd but the former night,<br/>
What numbers had been saved by Hector's flight?<br/>
That wise advice rejected with disdain,<br/>
I feel my folly in my people slain.<br/>
Methinks my suffering country's voice I hear,<br/>
But most her worthless sons insult my ear,<br/>
On my rash courage charge the chance of war,<br/>
And blame those virtues which they cannot share.<br/>
No&mdash;if I e'er return, return I must<br/>
Glorious, my country's terror laid in dust:<br/>
Or if I perish, let her see me fall<br/>
In field at least, and fighting for her wall.<br/>
And yet suppose these measures I forego,<br/>
Approach unarm'd, and parley with the foe,<br/>
The warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down,<br/>
And treat on terms of peace to save the town:<br/>
The wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain'd<br/>
(Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)<br/>
With honourable justice to restore:<br/>
And add half Ilion's yet remaining store,<br/>
Which Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece<br/>
May share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.<br/>
But why this thought? Unarm'd if I should go,<br/>
What hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,<br/>
But woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?<br/>
We greet not here, as man conversing man,<br/>
Met at an oak, or journeying o'er a plain;<br/>
No season now for calm familiar talk,<br/>
Like youths and maidens in an evening walk:<br/>
War is our business, but to whom is given<br/>
To die, or triumph, that, determine Heaven!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;<br/>
His dreadful plumage nodded from on high;<br/>
The Pelian javelin, in his better hand,<br/>
Shot trembling rays that glitter'd o'er the land;<br/>
And on his breast the beamy splendour shone,<br/>
Like Jove's own lightning, or the rising sun.<br/>
As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,<br/>
Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.<br/>
He leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:<br/>
Achilles follows like the winged wind.<br/>
Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies<br/>
(The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),<br/>
Just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,<br/>
Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,<br/>
With open beak and shrilling cries he springs,<br/>
And aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:<br/>
No less fore-right the rapid chase they held,<br/>
One urged by fury, one by fear impell'd:<br/>
Now circling round the walls their course maintain,<br/>
Where the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;<br/>
Now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,<br/>
(A wider compass,) smoke along the road.<br/>
Next by Scamander's double source they bound,<br/>
Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground;<br/>
This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,<br/>
With exhalations steaming to the skies;<br/>
That the green banks in summer's heat o'erflows,<br/>
Like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:<br/>
Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,<br/>
Whose polish'd bed receives the falling rills;<br/>
Where Trojan dames (ere yet alarm'd by Greece)<br/>
Wash'd their fair garments in the days of peace.<br/>
By these they pass'd, one chasing, one in flight:<br/>
(The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:)<br/>
Swift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,<br/>
No vulgar victim must reward the day:<br/>
(Such as in races crown the speedy strife:)<br/>
The prize contended was great Hector's life.<br/>
As when some hero's funerals are decreed<br/>
In grateful honour of the mighty dead;<br/>
Where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame<br/>
(Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame)<br/>
The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,<br/>
And with them turns the raised spectator's soul:<br/>
Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly.<br/>
The gazing gods lean forward from the sky;<br/>
To whom, while eager on the chase they look,<br/>
The sire of mortals and immortals spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Unworthy sight! the man beloved of heaven,<br/>
Behold, inglorious round yon city driven!<br/>
My heart partakes the generous Hector's pain;<br/>
Hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,<br/>
Whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,<br/>
From Ida's summits, and the towers of Troy:<br/>
Now see him flying; to his fears resign'd,<br/>
And fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind.<br/>
Consult, ye powers! ('tis worthy your debate)<br/>
Whether to snatch him from impending fate,<br/>
Or let him bear, by stern Pelides slain,<br/>
(Good as he is) the lot imposed on man."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Pallas thus: "Shall he whose vengeance forms<br/>
The forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,<br/>
Shall he prolong one Trojan's forfeit breath?<br/>
A man, a mortal, pre-ordain'd to death!<br/>
And will no murmurs fill the courts above?<br/>
No gods indignant blame their partial Jove?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Go then (return'd the sire) without delay,<br/>
Exert thy will: I give the Fates their way."<br/>
Swift at the mandate pleased Tritonia flies,<br/>
And stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As through the forest, o'er the vale and lawn,<br/>
The well-breath'd beagle drives the flying fawn,<br/>
In vain he tries the covert of the brakes,<br/>
Or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes;<br/>
Sure of the vapour in the tainted dews,<br/>
The certain hound his various maze pursues.<br/>
Thus step by step, where'er the Trojan wheel'd,<br/>
There swift Achilles compass'd round the field.<br/>
Oft as to reach the Dardan gates he bends,<br/>
And hopes the assistance of his pitying friends,<br/>
(Whose showering arrows, as he coursed below,<br/>
From the high turrets might oppress the foe,)<br/>
So oft Achilles turns him to the plain:<br/>
He eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.<br/>
As men in slumbers seem with speedy pace,<br/>
One to pursue, and one to lead the chase,<br/>
Their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,<br/>
Nor this can fly, nor that can overtake:<br/>
No less the labouring heroes pant and strain:<br/>
While that but flies, and this pursues in vain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
What god, O muse, assisted Hector's force<br/>
With fate itself so long to hold the course?<br/>
Phoebus it was; who, in his latest hour,<br/>
Endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:<br/>
And great Achilles, lest some Greek's advance<br/>
Should snatch the glory from his lifted lance,<br/>
Sign'd to the troops to yield his foe the way,<br/>
And leave untouch'd the honours of the day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Jove lifts the golden balances, that show<br/>
The fates of mortal men, and things below:<br/>
Here each contending hero's lot he tries,<br/>
And weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.<br/>
Low sinks the scale surcharged with Hector's fate;<br/>
Heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Phoebus left him. Fierce Minerva flies<br/>
To stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries:<br/>
"O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease,<br/>
And conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.<br/>
Great Hector falls; that Hector famed so far,<br/>
Drunk with renown, insatiable of war,<br/>
Falls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,<br/>
Shall more avail him, nor his god of light.<br/>
See, where in vain he supplicates above,<br/>
Roll'd at the feet of unrelenting Jove;<br/>
Rest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,<br/>
And urge to meet the fate he cannot shun."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Her voice divine the chief with joyful mind<br/>
Obey'd; and rested, on his lance reclined<br/>
While like Deiphobus the martial dame<br/>
(Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),<br/>
In show an aid, by hapless Hector's side<br/>
Approach'd, and greets him thus with voice belied:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight<br/>
Of this distress, and sorrow'd in thy flight:<br/>
It fits us now a noble stand to make,<br/>
And here, as brothers, equal fates partake."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he: "O prince! allied in blood and fame,<br/>
Dearer than all that own a brother's name;<br/>
Of all that Hecuba to Priam bore,<br/>
Long tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!<br/>
Since you, of all our numerous race alone<br/>
Defend my life, regardless of your own."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again the goddess: "Much my father's prayer,<br/>
And much my mother's, press'd me to forbear:<br/>
My friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,<br/>
But stronger love impell'd, and I obey.<br/>
Come then, the glorious conflict let us try,<br/>
Let the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;<br/>
Or let us stretch Achilles on the field,<br/>
Or to his arm our bloody trophies yield."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fraudful she said; then swiftly march'd before:<br/>
The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.<br/>
Sternly they met. The silence Hector broke:<br/>
His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Enough, O son of Peleus! Troy has view'd<br/>
Her walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued.<br/>
But now some god within me bids me try<br/>
Thine, or my fate: I kill thee, or I die.<br/>
Yet on the verge of battle let us stay,<br/>
And for a moment's space suspend the day;<br/>
Let Heaven's high powers be call'd to arbitrate<br/>
The just conditions of this stern debate,<br/>
(Eternal witnesses of all below,<br/>
And faithful guardians of the treasured vow!)<br/>
To them I swear; if, victor in the strife,<br/>
Jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,<br/>
No vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;<br/>
Stripp'd of its arms alone (the conqueror's due)<br/>
The rest to Greece uninjured I'll restore:<br/>
Now plight thy mutual oath, I ask no more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,<br/>
While anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes),<br/>
Detested as thou art, and ought to be,<br/>
Nor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee:<br/>
Such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,<br/>
Such leagues as men and furious lions join,<br/>
To such I call the gods! one constant state<br/>
Of lasting rancour and eternal hate:<br/>
No thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,<br/>
Till death extinguish rage, and thought, and life.<br/>
Rouse then thy forces this important hour,<br/>
Collect thy soul, and call forth all thy power.<br/>
No further subterfuge, no further chance;<br/>
'Tis Pallas, Pallas gives thee to my lance.<br/>
Each Grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,<br/>
Now hovers round, and calls thee to thy death."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and launch'd his javelin at the foe;<br/>
But Hector shunn'd the meditated blow:<br/>
He stoop'd, while o'er his head the flying spear<br/>
Sang innocent, and spent its force in air.<br/>
Minerva watch'd it falling on the land,<br/>
Then drew, and gave to great Achilles' hand,<br/>
Unseen of Hector, who, elate with joy,<br/>
Now shakes his lance, and braves the dread of Troy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"The life you boasted to that javelin given,<br/>
Prince! you have miss'd. My fate depends on Heaven,<br/>
To thee, presumptuous as thou art, unknown,<br/>
Or what must prove my fortune, or thy own.<br/>
Boasting is but an art, our fears to blind,<br/>
And with false terrors sink another's mind.<br/>
But know, whatever fate I am to try,<br/>
By no dishonest wound shall Hector die.<br/>
I shall not fall a fugitive at least,<br/>
My soul shall bravely issue from my breast.<br/>
But first, try thou my arm; and may this dart<br/>
End all my country's woes, deep buried in thy heart."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The weapon flew, its course unerring held,<br/>
Unerring, but the heavenly shield repell'd<br/>
The mortal dart; resulting with a bound<br/>
From off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.<br/>
Hector beheld his javelin fall in vain,<br/>
Nor other lance, nor other hope remain;<br/>
He calls Deiphobus, demands a spear&mdash;<br/>
In vain, for no Deiphobus was there.<br/>
All comfortless he stands: then, with a sigh;<br/>
"'Tis so&mdash;Heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh!<br/>
I deem'd Deiphobus had heard my call,<br/>
But he secure lies guarded in the wall.<br/>
A god deceived me; Pallas, 'twas thy deed,<br/>
Death and black fate approach! 'tis I must bleed.<br/>
No refuge now, no succour from above,<br/>
Great Jove deserts me, and the son of Jove,<br/>
Propitious once, and kind! Then welcome fate!<br/>
'Tis true I perish, yet I perish great:<br/>
Yet in a mighty deed I shall expire,<br/>
Let future ages hear it, and admire!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,<br/>
And, all collected, on Achilles flew.<br/>
So Jove's bold bird, high balanced in the air,<br/>
Stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.<br/>
Nor less Achilles his fierce soul prepares:<br/>
Before his breast the flaming shield he bears,<br/>
Refulgent orb! above his fourfold cone<br/>
The gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun.<br/>
Nodding at every step: (Vulcanian frame!)<br/>
And as he moved, his figure seem'd on flame.<br/>
As radiant Hesper shines with keener light,<br/>
Far-beaming o'er the silver host of night,<br/>
When all the starry train emblaze the sphere:<br/>
So shone the point of great Achilles' spear.<br/>
In his right hand he waves the weapon round,<br/>
Eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound;<br/>
But the rich mail Patroclus lately wore<br/>
Securely cased the warrior's body o'er.<br/>
One space at length he spies, to let in fate,<br/>
Where 'twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate<br/>
Gave entrance: through that penetrable part<br/>
Furious he drove the well-directed dart:<br/>
Nor pierced the windpipe yet, nor took the power<br/>
Of speech, unhappy! from thy dying hour.<br/>
Prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies,<br/>
While, thus triumphing, stern Achilles cries:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"At last is Hector stretch'd upon the plain,<br/>
Who fear'd no vengeance for Patroclus slain:<br/>
Then, prince! you should have fear'd, what now you feel;<br/>
Achilles absent was Achilles still:<br/>
Yet a short space the great avenger stayed,<br/>
Then low in dust thy strength and glory laid.<br/>
Peaceful he sleeps, with all our rites adorn'd,<br/>
For ever honour'd, and for ever mourn'd:<br/>
While cast to all the rage of hostile power,<br/>
Thee birds shall mangle, and the gods devour."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Hector, fainting at the approach of death:<br/>
"By thy own soul! by those who gave thee breath!<br/>
By all the sacred prevalence of prayer;<br/>
Ah, leave me not for Grecian dogs to tear!<br/>
The common rites of sepulture bestow,<br/>
To soothe a father's and a mother's woe:<br/>
Let their large gifts procure an urn at least,<br/>
And Hector's ashes in his country rest."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"No, wretch accursed! relentless he replies;<br/>
(Flames, as he spoke, shot flashing from his eyes;)<br/>
Not those who gave me breath should bid me spare,<br/>
Nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.<br/>
Could I myself the bloody banquet join!<br/>
No&mdash;to the dogs that carcase I resign.<br/>
Should Troy, to bribe me, bring forth all her store,<br/>
And giving thousands, offer thousands more;<br/>
Should Dardan Priam, and his weeping dame,<br/>
Drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame:<br/>
Their Hector on the pile they should not see,<br/>
Nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus the chief his dying accents drew:<br/>
"Thy rage, implacable! too well I knew:<br/>
The Furies that relentless breast have steel'd,<br/>
And cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield.<br/>
Yet think, a day will come, when fate's decree<br/>
And angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee;<br/>
Phoebus and Paris shall avenge my fate,<br/>
And stretch thee here before the Scaean gate."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He ceased. The Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,<br/>
And his eyes stiffen'd at the hand of death;<br/>
To the dark realm the spirit wings its way,<br/>
(The manly body left a load of clay,)<br/>
And plaintive glides along the dreary coast,<br/>
A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Achilles, musing as he roll'd his eyes<br/>
O'er the dead hero, thus unheard, replies:<br/>
"Die thou the first! When Jove and heaven ordain,<br/>
I follow thee"&mdash;He said, and stripp'd the slain.<br/>
Then forcing backward from the gaping wound<br/>
The reeking javelin, cast it on the ground.<br/>
The thronging Greeks behold with wondering eyes<br/>
His manly beauty and superior size;<br/>
While some, ignobler, the great dead deface<br/>
With wounds ungenerous, or with taunts disgrace:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"How changed that Hector, who like Jove of late<br/>
Sent lightning on our fleets, and scatter'd fate!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
High o'er the slain the great Achilles stands,<br/>
Begirt with heroes and surrounding bands;<br/>
And thus aloud, while all the host attends:<br/>
"Princes and leaders! countrymen and friends!<br/>
Since now at length the powerful will of heaven<br/>
The dire destroyer to our arm has given,<br/>
Is not Troy fallen already? Haste, ye powers!<br/>
See, if already their deserted towers<br/>
Are left unmann'd; or if they yet retain<br/>
The souls of heroes, their great Hector slain.<br/>
But what is Troy, or glory what to me?<br/>
Or why reflects my mind on aught but thee,<br/>
Divine Patroclus! Death hath seal'd his eyes;<br/>
Unwept, unhonour'd, uninterr'd he lies!<br/>
Can his dear image from my soul depart,<br/>
Long as the vital spirit moves my heart?<br/>
If in the melancholy shades below,<br/>
The flames of friends and lovers cease to glow,<br/>
Yet mine shall sacred last; mine, undecay'd,<br/>
Burn on through death, and animate my shade.<br/>
Meanwhile, ye sons of Greece, in triumph bring<br/>
The corpse of Hector, and your paeans sing.<br/>
Be this the song, slow-moving toward the shore,<br/>
"Hector is dead, and Ilion is no more.""<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred;<br/>
(Unworthy of himself, and of the dead;)<br/>
The nervous ancles bored, his feet he bound<br/>
With thongs inserted through the double wound;<br/>
These fix'd up high behind the rolling wain,<br/>
His graceful head was trail'd along the plain.<br/>
Proud on his car the insulting victor stood,<br/>
And bore aloft his arms, distilling blood.<br/>
He smites the steeds; the rapid chariot flies;<br/>
The sudden clouds of circling dust arise.<br/>
Now lost is all that formidable air;<br/>
The face divine, and long-descending hair,<br/>
Purple the ground, and streak the sable sand;<br/>
Deform'd, dishonour'd, in his native land,<br/>
Given to the rage of an insulting throng,<br/>
And, in his parents' sight, now dragg'd along!<br/>

<p>
The mother first beheld with sad survey;<br/>
She rent her tresses, venerable grey,<br/>
And cast, far off, the regal veils away.<br/>
With piercing shrieks his bitter fate she moans,<br/>
While the sad father answers groans with groans,<br/>
Tears after tears his mournful cheeks o'erflow,<br/>
And the whole city wears one face of woe:<br/>
No less than if the rage of hostile fires,<br/>
From her foundations curling to her spires,<br/>
O'er the proud citadel at length should rise,<br/>
And the last blaze send Ilion to the skies.<br/>
The wretched monarch of the falling state,<br/>
Distracted, presses to the Dardan gate.<br/>
Scarce the whole people stop his desperate course,<br/>
While strong affliction gives the feeble force:<br/>
Grief tears his heart, and drives him to and fro,<br/>
In all the raging impotence of woe.<br/>
At length he roll'd in dust, and thus begun,<br/>
Imploring all, and naming one by one:<br/>
"Ah! let me, let me go where sorrow calls;<br/>
I, only I, will issue from your walls<br/>
(Guide or companion, friends! I ask ye none),<br/>
And bow before the murderer of my son.<br/>
My grief perhaps his pity may engage;<br/>
Perhaps at least he may respect my age.<br/>
He has a father too; a man like me;<br/>
One, not exempt from age and misery<br/>
(Vigorous no more, as when his young embrace<br/>
Begot this pest of me, and all my race).<br/>
How many valiant sons, in early bloom,<br/>
Has that cursed hand sent headlong to the tomb!<br/>
Thee, Hector! last: thy loss (divinely brave)<br/>
Sinks my sad soul with sorrow to the grave.<br/>
O had thy gentle spirit pass'd in peace,<br/>
The son expiring in the sire's embrace,<br/>
While both thy parents wept the fatal hour,<br/>
And, bending o'er thee, mix'd the tender shower!<br/>
Some comfort that had been, some sad relief,<br/>
To melt in full satiety of grief!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus wail'd the father, grovelling on the ground,<br/>
And all the eyes of Ilion stream'd around.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Amidst her matrons Hecuba appears:<br/>
(A mourning princess, and a train in tears;)<br/>
"Ah why has Heaven prolong'd this hated breath,<br/>
Patient of horrors, to behold thy death?<br/>
O Hector! late thy parents' pride and joy,<br/>
The boast of nations! the defence of Troy!<br/>
To whom her safety and her fame she owed;<br/>
Her chief, her hero, and almost her god!<br/>
O fatal change! become in one sad day<br/>
A senseless corse! inanimated clay!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
But not as yet the fatal news had spread<br/>
To fair Andromache, of Hector dead;<br/>
As yet no messenger had told his fate,<br/>
Not e'en his stay without the Scaean gate.<br/>
Far in the close recesses of the dome,<br/>
Pensive she plied the melancholy loom;<br/>
A growing work employ'd her secret hours,<br/>
Confusedly gay with intermingled flowers.<br/>
Her fair-haired handmaids heat the brazen urn,<br/>
The bath preparing for her lord's return<br/>
In vain; alas! her lord returns no more;<br/>
Unbathed he lies, and bleeds along the shore!<br/>
Now from the walls the clamours reach her ear,<br/>
And all her members shake with sudden fear:<br/>
Forth from her ivory hand the shuttle falls,<br/>
And thus, astonish'd, to her maids she calls:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ah follow me! (she cried) what plaintive noise<br/>
Invades my ear? 'Tis sure my mother's voice.<br/>
My faltering knees their trembling frame desert,<br/>
A pulse unusual flutters at my heart;<br/>
Some strange disaster, some reverse of fate<br/>
(Ye gods avert it!) threats the Trojan state.<br/>
Far be the omen which my thoughts suggest!<br/>
But much I fear my Hector's dauntless breast<br/>
Confronts Achilles; chased along the plain,<br/>
Shut from our walls! I fear, I fear him slain!<br/>
Safe in the crowd he ever scorn'd to wait,<br/>
And sought for glory in the jaws of fate:<br/>
Perhaps that noble heat has cost his breath,<br/>
Now quench'd for ever in the arms of death."<br/>
</p>
<p>
She spoke: and furious, with distracted pace,<br/>
Fears in her heart, and anguish in her face,<br/>
Flies through the dome (the maids her steps pursue),<br/>
And mounts the walls, and sends around her view.<br/>
Too soon her eyes the killing object found,<br/>
The godlike Hector dragg'd along the ground.<br/>
A sudden darkness shades her swimming eyes:<br/>
She faints, she falls; her breath, her colour flies.<br/>
Her hair's fair ornaments, the braids that bound,<br/>
The net that held them, and the wreath that crown'd,<br/>
The veil and diadem flew far away<br/>
(The gift of Venus on her bridal day).<br/>
Around a train of weeping sisters stands,<br/>
To raise her sinking with assistant hands.<br/>
Scarce from the verge of death recall'd, again<br/>
She faints, or but recovers to complain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O wretched husband of a wretched wife!<br/>
Born with one fate, to one unhappy life!<br/>
For sure one star its baneful beam display'd<br/>
On Priam's roof, and Hippoplacia's shade.<br/>
From different parents, different climes we came.<br/>
At different periods, yet our fate the same!<br/>
Why was my birth to great Aetion owed,<br/>
And why was all that tender care bestow'd?<br/>
Would I had never been!&mdash;O thou, the ghost<br/>
Of my dead husband! miserably lost!<br/>
Thou to the dismal realms for ever gone!<br/>
And I abandon'd, desolate, alone!<br/>
An only child, once comfort of my pains,<br/>
Sad product now of hapless love, remains!<br/>
No more to smile upon his sire; no friend<br/>
To help him now! no father to defend!<br/>
For should he 'scape the sword, the common doom,<br/>
What wrongs attend him, and what griefs to come!<br/>
Even from his own paternal roof expell'd,<br/>
Some stranger ploughs his patrimonial field.<br/>
The day, that to the shades the father sends,<br/>
Robs the sad orphan of his father's friends:<br/>
He, wretched outcast of mankind! appears<br/>
For ever sad, for ever bathed in tears;<br/>
Amongst the happy, unregarded, he<br/>
Hangs on the robe, or trembles at the knee,<br/>
While those his father's former bounty fed<br/>
Nor reach the goblet, nor divide the bread:<br/>
The kindest but his present wants allay,<br/>
To leave him wretched the succeeding day.<br/>
Frugal compassion! Heedless, they who boast<br/>
Both parents still, nor feel what he has lost,<br/>
Shall cry, 'Begone! thy father feasts not here:'<br/>
The wretch obeys, retiring with a tear.<br/>
Thus wretched, thus retiring all in tears,<br/>
To my sad soul Astyanax appears!<br/>
Forced by repeated insults to return,<br/>
And to his widow'd mother vainly mourn:<br/>
He, who, with tender delicacy bred,<br/>
With princes sported, and on dainties fed,<br/>
And when still evening gave him up to rest,<br/>
Sunk soft in down upon the nurse's breast,<br/>
Must&mdash;ah what must he not? Whom Ilion calls<br/>
Astyanax, from her well-guarded walls,<br/>
Is now that name no more, unhappy boy!<br/>
Since now no more thy father guards his Troy.<br/>
But thou, my Hector, liest exposed in air,<br/>
Far from thy parents' and thy consort's care;<br/>
Whose hand in vain, directed by her love,<br/>
The martial scarf and robe of triumph wove.<br/>
Now to devouring flames be these a prey,<br/>
Useless to thee, from this accursed day!<br/>
Yet let the sacrifice at least be paid,<br/>
An honour to the living, not the dead!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
So spake the mournful dame: her matrons hear,<br/>
Sigh back her sighs, and answer tear with tear.<br/>

<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XVIII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
While fix'd in thought the pensive hero sate,<br/>
A mendicant approach'd the royal gate;<br/>
A surly vagrant of the giant kind,<br/>
The stain of manhood, of a coward mind:<br/>
From feast to feast, insatiate to devour,<br/>
He flew, attendant on the genial hour.<br/>
Him on his mother's knees, when babe he lay,<br/>
She named Arnaeus on his natal day:<br/>
But Irus his associates call'd the boy,<br/>
Practised the common messenger to fly;<br/>
Irus, a name expressive of the employ.
</p>
<p>
From his own roof, with meditated blows,<br/>
He strove to drive the man of mighty woes:
</p>
<p>
"Hence, dotard! hence, and timely speed thy way,<br/>
Lest dragg'd in vengeance thou repent thy stay;<br/>
See how with nods assent yon princely train!<br/>
But honouring age, in mercy I refrain:<br/>
In peace away! lest, if persuasions fail,<br/>
This arm with blows more eloquent prevail."<br/>
To whom, with stern regard: "O insolence,<br/>
Indecently to rail without offence!<br/>
What bounty gives without a rival share;<br/>
I ask, what harms not thee, to breathe this air:<br/>
Alike on alms we both precarious live:<br/>
And canst thou envy when the great relieve?<br/>
Know, from the bounteous heavens all riches flow,<br/>
And what man gives, the gods by man bestow;<br/>
Proud as thou art, henceforth no more be proud,<br/>
Lest I imprint my vengeance in thy blood;<br/>
Old as I am, should once my fury burn,<br/>
How would'st thou fly, nor e'en in thought return!"
</p>
<p>
"Mere woman-glutton! (thus the churl replied;)<br/>
A tongue so flippant, with a throat so wide!<br/>
Why cease I, gods! to dash those teeth away,<br/>
Like some wild boar's, that, greedy of his prey,<br/>
Uproots the bearded corn? Rise, try the fight,<br/>
Gird well thy loins, approach, and feel my might:<br/>
Sure of defeat, before the peers engage:<br/>
Unequal fight, when youth contends with age!"
</p>
<p>
Thus in a wordy war their tongues display<br/>
More fierce intents, preluding to the fray;<br/>
Antinous hears, and in a jovial vein,<br/>
Thus with loud laughter to the suitor train:
</p>
<p>
"This happy day in mirth, my friends, employ,<br/>
And lo! the gods conspire to crown our joy;<br/>
See ready for the fight, and hand to hand,<br/>
Yon surly mendicants contentious stand:<br/>
Why urge we not to blows!" Well pleased they spring<br/>
Swift from their seats, and thickening form a ring.
</p>
<p>
To whom Antinous: "Lo! enrich'd with blood,<br/>
A kid's well-fatted entrails (tasteful food)<br/>
On glowing embers lie; on him bestow<br/>
The choicest portion who subdues his foe;<br/>
Grant him unrivall'd in these walls to stay,<br/>
The sole attendant on the genial day."
</p>
<p>
The lords applaud: Ulysses then with art,<br/>
And fears well-feign'd, disguised his dauntless heart.
</p>
<p>
"Worn as I am with age, decay'd with woe;<br/>
Say, is it baseness to decline the foe?<br/>
Hard conflict! when calamity and age<br/>
With vigorous youth, unknown to cares, engage!<br/>
Yet, fearful of disgrace, to try the day<br/>
Imperious hunger bids, and I obey;<br/>
But swear, impartial arbiters of right,<br/>
Swear to stand neutral, while we cope in fight."
</p>
<p>
The peers assent: when straight his sacred head<br/>
Telemachus upraised, and sternly said:<br/>
"Stranger, if prompted to chastise the wrong<br/>
Of this bold insolent, confide, be strong!<br/>
The injurious Greek that dares attempt a blow,<br/>
That instant makes Telemachus his foe;<br/>
And these my friends shall guard the sacred ties<br/>
Of hospitality, for they are wise."
</p>
<p>
Then, girding his strong loins, the king prepares<br/>
To close in combat, and his body bares;<br/>
Broad spread his shoulders, and his nervous thighs<br/>
By just degrees, like well-turn'd columns, rise<br/>
Ample his chest, his arms are round and long,<br/>
And each strong joint Minerva knits more strong<br/>
(Attendant on her chief): the suitor-crowd<br/>
With wonder gaze, and gazing speak aloud:<br/>
"Irus! alas! shall Irus be no more?<br/>
Black fate impends, and this the avenging hour!<br/>
Gods! how his nerves a matchless strength proclaim,<br/>
Swell o'er his well-strong limbs, and brace his frame!"
</p>
<p>
Then pale with fears, and sickening at the sight;<br/>
They dragg'd the unwilling Irus to the fight;<br/>
From his blank visage fled the coward blood,<br/>
And his flesh trembled as aghast he stood.
</p>
<p>
"O that such baseness should disgrace the light?<br/>
O hide it, death, in everlasting night!<br/>
(Exclaims Antinous;) can a vigorous foe<br/>
Meanly decline to combat age and woe?<br/>
But hear me wretch! if recreant in the fray<br/>
That huge bulk yield this ill-contested day,<br/>
Instant thou sail'st, to Eschetus resign'd;<br/>
A tyrant, fiercest of the tyrant kind,<br/>
Who casts thy mangled ears and nose a prey<br/>
To hungry dogs, and lops the man away."
</p>
<p>
While with indignant scorn he sternly spoke,<br/>
In every joint the trembling Irus shook.<br/>
Now front to front each frowning champion stands,<br/>
And poises high in air his adverse hands.<br/>
The chief yet doubts, or to the shades below<br/>
To fell the giant at one vengeful blow,<br/>
Or save his life, and soon his life to save<br/>
The king resolves, for mercy sways the brave<br/>
That instant Irus his huge arm extends,<br/>
Full on his shoulder the rude weight descends;<br/>
The sage Ulysses, fearful to disclose<br/>
The hero latent in the man of woes,<br/>
Check'd half his might; yet rising to the stroke,<br/>
His jawbone dash'd, the crashing jawbone broke:<br/>
Down dropp'd he stupid from the stunning wound;<br/>
His feet extended quivering, beat the ground;<br/>
His mouth and nostrils spout a purple flood;<br/>
His teeth, all shatter'd, rush inmix'd with blood.
</p>
<p>
The peers transported, as outstretch'd he lies,<br/>
With bursts of laughter rend the vaulted skies;<br/>
Then dragg'd along, all bleeding from the wound,<br/>
His length of carcase trailing prints the ground:<br/>
Raised on his feet, again he reels, he falls,<br/>
Till propp'd, reclining on the palace walls:<br/>
Then to his hand a staff the victor gave,<br/>
And thus with just reproach address'd the slave:<br/>
"There terrible, affright with dogs, and reign<br/>
A dreaded tyrant o'er the bestial train!<br/>
But mercy to the poor and stranger show,<br/>
Lest Heaven in vengeance send some mightier woe."
</p>
<p>
Scornful he spoke, and o'er his shoulder flung<br/>
The broad-patch'd scrip in tatters hung<br/>
Ill join'd, and knotted to a twisted thong.<br/>
Then, turning short, disdain'd a further stay;<br/>
But to the palace measured back the way.<br/>
There, as he rested gathering in a ring,<br/>
The peers with smiles address'd their unknown king:<br/>
"Stranger, may Jove and all the aÃ«rial powers<br/>
With every blessing crown thy happy hours!<br/>
Our freedom to thy prowess'd arm we owe<br/>
From bold intrusion of thy coward foe:<br/>
Instant the flying sail the slave shall wing<br/>
To Eschetus, the monster of a king."
</p>
<p>
While pleased he hears, Antinous bears the food,<br/>
A kid's well-fatted entrails, rich with blood;<br/>
The bread from canisters of shining mould<br/>
Amphinomus; and wines that laugh in gold:<br/>
"And oh! (he mildly cries) may Heaven display<br/>
A beam of glory o'er thy future day!<br/>
Alas, the brave too oft is doom'd to bear<br/>
The gripes of poverty and stings of care."
</p>
<p>
To whom with thought mature the king replies:<br/>
"The tongue speaks wisely, when the soul is wise:<br/>
Such was thy father! in imperial state,<br/>
Great without vice, that oft attends the great;<br/>
Nor from the sire art thou, the son, declin'd;<br/>
Then hear my words, and grace them in thy mind!<br/>
Of all that breathes, or grovelling creeps on earth,<br/>
Most vain is man! calamitous by birth:<br/>
To-day, with power elate, in strength he blooms;<br/>
The haughty creature on that power presumes:<br/>
Anon from Heaven a sad reverse he feels:<br/>
Untaught to bear, 'gainst Heaven the wretch rebels.<br/>
For man is changeful, as his bliss or woe!<br/>
Too high when prosperous, when distress'd too low.<br/>
There was a day, when with the scornful great<br/>
I swell'd in pomp and arrogance of state;<br/>
Proud of the power that to high birth belongs;<br/>
And used that power to justify my wrongs.<br/>
Then let not man be proud; but firm of mind,<br/>
Bear the best humbly; and the worst resign'd;<br/>
Be dumb when Heaven afflicts! unlike yon train<br/>
Of haughty spoilers, insolently vain;<br/>
Who make their queen and all her wealth a prey:<br/>
But vengeance and Ulysses wing their way.<br/>
O may'st thou, favour'd by some guardian power,<br/>
Far, far be distant in that deathful hour!<br/>
For sure I am, if stern Ulysses breathe,<br/>
These lawless riots end in blood and death."
</p>
<p>
Then to the gods the rosy juice he pours,<br/>
And the drain'd goblet to the chief restores.<br/>
Stung to the soul, o'ercast with holy dread,<br/>
He shook the graceful honours of his head;<br/>
His boding mind the future woe forestalls,<br/>
In vain! by great Telemachus he falls,<br/>
For Pallas seals his doom: all sad he turns<br/>
To join the peers; resumes his throne, and mourns.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Minerva with instinctive fires<br/>
Thy soul, Penelope, from Heaven inspires;<br/>
With flattering hopes the suitors to betray,<br/>
And seem to meet, yet fly, the bridal day:<br/>
Thy husband's wonder, and thy son's to raise;<br/>
And crown the mother and the wife with praise.<br/>
Then, while the streaming sorrow dims her eyes,<br/>
Thus, with a transient smile, the matron cries:
</p>
<p>
"Eurynome! to go where riot reigns<br/>
I feel an impulse, though my soul disdains;<br/>
To my loved son the snares of death to show,<br/>
And in the traitor friend, unmask the foe;<br/>
Who, smooth of tongue, in purpose insincere,<br/>
Hides fraud in smiles, while death is ambush'd there."
</p>
<p>
"Go, warn thy son, nor be the warning vain<br/>
(Replied the sagest of the royal train);<br/>
But bathed, anointed, and adorn'd, descend;<br/>
Powerful of charms, bid every grace attend;<br/>
The tide of flowing tears awhile suppress;<br/>
Tears but indulge the sorrow, not repress.<br/>
Some joy remains: to thee a son is given,<br/>
Such as, in fondness, parents ask of Heaven."
</p>
<p>
"Ah me! forbear!" returns the queen, "forbear,<br/>
Oh! talk not, talk not of vain beauty's care;<br/>
No more I bathe, since he no longer sees<br/>
Those charms, for whom alone I wish to please.<br/>
The day that bore Ulysses from this coast<br/>
Blasted the little bloom these cheeks could boast.<br/>
But instant bid Autonoe descend,<br/>
Instant Hippodame our steps attend;<br/>
Ill suits it female virtue, to be seen<br/>
Alone, indecent, in the walks of men."
</p>
<p>
Then while Eurynome the mandate bears,<br/>
From heaven Minerva shoots with guardian cares;<br/>
O'er all her senses, as the couch she press'd,<br/>
She pours, a pleasing, deep and death-like rest,<br/>
With every beauty every feature arms,<br/>
Bids her cheeks glow, and lights up all her charms;<br/>
In her love-darting eyes awakes the fires<br/>
(Immortal gifts! to kindle soft desires);<br/>
From limb to limb an air majestic sheds,<br/>
And the pure ivory o'er her bosom spreads.<br/>
Such Venus shines, when with a measured bound<br/>
She smoothly gliding swims the harmonious round,<br/>
When with the Graces in the dance she moves,<br/>
And fires the gazing gods with ardent loves.
</p>
<p>
Then to the skies her flight Minerva bends,<br/>
And to the queen the damsel train descends;<br/>
Waked at their steps, her flowing eyes unclose;<br/>
The tears she wipes, and thus renews her woes:<br/>
"Howe'er 'tis well that sleep awhile can free,<br/>
With soft forgetfulness a wretch like me;<br/>
Oh! were it given to yield this transient breath,<br/>
Send, O Diana! send the sleep of death!<br/>
Why must I waste a tedious life in tears,<br/>
Nor bury in the silent grave my cares?<br/>
O my Ulysses! ever honour'd name!<br/>
For thee I mourn till death dissolves my frame."
</p>
<p>
Thus wailing, slow and sadly she descends,<br/>
On either band a damsel train attends:<br/>
Full where the dome its shining valves expands,<br/>
Radiant before the gazing peers she stands;<br/>
A veil translucent o'er her brow display'd,<br/>
Her beauty seems, and only seems, to shade:<br/>
Sudden she lightens in their dazzled eyes,<br/>
And sudden flames in every bosom rise;<br/>
They send their eager souls with every look.<br/>
Till silence thus the imperial matron broke:
</p>
<p>
"O why! my son, why now no more appears<br/>
That warmth of soul that urged thy younger years?<br/>
Thy riper days no growing worth impart,<br/>
A man in stature, still a boy in heart!<br/>
Thy well-knit frame unprofitably strong,<br/>
Speaks thee a hero, from a hero sprung:<br/>
But the just gods in vain those gifts bestow,<br/>
O wise alone in form, and grave in show!<br/>
Heavens! could a stranger feel oppression's hand<br/>
Beneath thy roof, and couldst thou tamely stand!<br/>
If thou the stranger's righteous cause decline<br/>
His is the sufferance, but the shame is thine."
</p>
<p>
To whom, with filial awe, the prince returns:<br/>
"That generous soul with just resentment burns;<br/>
Yet, taught by time, my heart has learn'd to glow<br/>
For others' good, and melt at others' woe;<br/>
But, impotent those riots to repel,<br/>
I bear their outrage, though my soul rebel;<br/>
Helpless amid the snares of death I tread,<br/>
And numbers leagued in impious union dread;<br/>
But now no crime is theirs: this wrong proceeds<br/>
From Irus, and the guilty Irus bleeds.<br/>
Oh would to Jove! or her whose arms display<br/>
The shield of Jove, or him who rules the day!<br/>
That yon proud suitors, who licentious tread<br/>
These courts, within these courts like Irus bled:<br/>
Whose loose head tottering, as with wine oppress'd,<br/>
Obliquely drops, and nodding knocks his breast;<br/>
Powerless to move, his staggering feet deny<br/>
The coward wretch the privilege to fly."
</p>
<p>
Then to the queen Eurymachus replies:<br/>
"O justly loved, and not more fair than wise!<br/>
Should Greece through all her hundred states survey<br/>
Thy finish'd charms, all Greece would own thy sway<br/>
In rival crowds contest the glorious prize.<br/>
Dispeopling realms to gaze upon thy eyes:<br/>
O woman! loveliest of the lovely kind,<br/>
In body perfect, and complete in mind."
</p>
<p>
"Ah me! (returns the queen) when from this shore<br/>
Ulysses sail'd, then beauty was no more!<br/>
The gods decreed these eyes no more should keep<br/>
Their wonted grace, but only serve to weep.<br/>
Should he return, whate'er my beauties prove,<br/>
My virtues last; my brightest charm is love.<br/>
Now, grief, thou all art mine! the gods o'ercast<br/>
My soul with woes, that long, ah long must last!<br/>
Too faithfully my heart retains the day<br/>
That sadly tore my royal lord away:<br/>
He grasp'd my hand, and, 'O, my spouse! I leave<br/>
Thy arms (he cried), perhaps to find a grave:<br/>
Fame speaks the Trojans bold; they boast the skill<br/>
To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill,<br/>
To dart the spear, and guide the rushing car<br/>
With dreadful inroad through the walks of war.<br/>
My sentence is gone forth, and 'tis decreed<br/>
Perhaps by righteous Heaven that I must bleed!<br/>
My father, mother, all I trust to three;<br/>
To them, to them, transfer the love of me:<br/>
But, when my son grows man, the royal sway<br/>
Resign, and happy be thy bridal day!'<br/>
Such were his words; and Hymen now prepares<br/>
To light his torch, and give me up to cares;<br/>
The afflictive hand of wrathful Jove to bear:<br/>
A wretch the most complete that breathes the air!<br/>
Fall'n e'en below the rights to woman due!<br/>
Careless to please, with insolence ye woo!<br/>
The generous lovers, studious to succeed,<br/>
Bid their whole herds and flocks in banquets bleed;<br/>
By precious gifts the vow sincere display:<br/>
You, only you, make her ye love your prey."
</p>
<p>
Well-pleased Ulysses hears his queen deceive<br/>
The suitor-train, and raise a thirst to give:<br/>
False hopes she kindles, but those hopes betray,<br/>
And promise, yet elude, the bridal day.
</p>
<p>
While yet she speaks, the gay Antinous cries:<br/>
"Offspring of kings, and more than woman wise!<br/>
'Tis right; 'tis man's prerogative to give,<br/>
And custom bids thee without shame receive;<br/>
Yet never, never, from thy dome we move,<br/>
Till Hymen lights the torch of spousal love."
</p>
<p>
The peers despatch'd their heralds to convey<br/>
The gifts of love; with speed they take the way.<br/>
A robe Antinous gives of shining dyes,<br/>
The varying hues in gay confusion rise<br/>
Rich from the artist's hand! Twelve clasps of gold<br/>
Close to the lessening waist the vest infold!<br/>
Down from the swelling loins the vest unbound<br/>
Floats in bright waves redundant o'er the ground,<br/>
A bracelet rich with gold, with amber gay,<br/>
That shot effulgence like the solar ray,<br/>
Eurymachus presents: and ear-rings bright,<br/>
With triple stars, that cast a trembling light.<br/>
Pisander bears a necklace wrought with art:<br/>
And every peer, expressive of his heart,<br/>
A gift bestows: this done, the queen ascends,<br/>
And slow behind her damsel train attends.
</p>
<p>
Then to the dance they form the vocal strain,<br/>
Till Hesperus leads forth the starry train;<br/>
And now he raises, as the daylight fades,<br/>
His golden circlet in the deepening shades:<br/>
Three vases heap'd with copious fires display<br/>
O'er all the palace a fictitious day;<br/>
From space to space the torch wide-beaming burns,<br/>
And sprightly damsels trim the rays by turns.
</p>
<p>
To whom the king: "Ill suits your sex to stay<br/>
Alone with men! ye modest maids, away!<br/>
Go, with the queen; the spindle guide; or cull<br/>
(The partners of her cares) the silver wool;<br/>
Be it my task the torches to supply<br/>
E'en till the morning lamp adorns the sky;<br/>
E'en till the morning, with unwearied care,<br/>
Sleepless I watch; for I have learn'd to bear."
</p>
<p>
Scornful they heard: Melantho, fair and young,<br/>
(Melantho, from the loins of Dolius sprung,<br/>
Who with the queen her years an infant led,<br/>
With the soft fondness of a daughter bred,)<br/>
Chiefly derides: regardless of the cares<br/>
Her queen endures, polluted joys she shares<br/>
Nocturnal with Eurymachus: with eyes<br/>
That speak disdain, the wanton thus replies:<br/>
"Oh! whither wanders thy distemper'd brain,<br/>
Thou bold intruder on a princely train?<br/>
Hence, to the vagrants' rendezvous repair;<br/>
Or shun in some black forge the midnight air.<br/>
Proceeds this boldness from a turn of soul,<br/>
Or flows licentious from the copious bowl?<br/>
Is it that vanquish'd Irus swells thy mind?<br/>
A foe may meet thee of a braver kind,<br/>
Who, shortening with a storm of blows thy stay,<br/>
Shall send thee howling all in blood away!"
</p>
<p>
To whom with frowns: "O impudent in wrong!<br/>
Thy lord shall curb that insolence of tongue;<br/>
Know, to Telemachus I tell the offence;<br/>
The scourge, the scourge shall lash thee into sense."
</p>
<p>
With conscious shame they hear the stern rebuke,<br/>
Nor longer durst sustain the sovereign look.
</p>
<p>
Then to the servile task the monarch turns<br/>
His royal hands: each torch refulgent burns<br/>
With added day: meanwhile in museful mood,<br/>
Absorb'd in thought, on vengeance fix'd he stood.<br/>
And now the martial maid, by deeper wrongs<br/>
To rouse Ulysses, points the suitors' tongues:<br/>
Scornful of age, to taunt the virtuous man,<br/>
Thoughtless and gay, Eurymachus began:
</p>
<p>
"Hear me (he cries), confederates and friends!<br/>
Some god, no doubt, this stranger kindly sends;<br/>
The shining baldness of his head survey,<br/>
It aids our torchlight, and reflects the ray."
</p>
<p>
Then to the king that levell'd haughty Troy:<br/>
"Say, if large hire can tempt thee to employ<br/>
Those hands in work; to tend the rural trade,<br/>
To dress the walk, and form the embowering shade.<br/>
So food and raiment constant will I give:<br/>
But idly thus thy soul prefers to live,<br/>
And starve by strolling, not by work to thrive."
</p>
<p>
To whom incensed: "Should we, O prince, engage<br/>
In rival tasks beneath the burning rage<br/>
Of summer suns; were both constrain'd to wield<br/>
Foodless the scythe along the burden'd field;<br/>
Or should we labour while the ploughshare wounds,<br/>
With steers of equal strength, the allotted grounds,<br/>
Beneath my labours, how thy wondering eyes<br/>
Might see the sable field at once arise!<br/>
Should Jove dire war unloose, with spear and shield,<br/>
And nodding helm, I tread the ensanguined field,<br/>
Fierce in the van: then wouldst thou, wouldst thou,&mdash;say,&mdash;<br/>
Misname me glutton, in that glorious day?<br/>
No, thy ill-judging thoughts the brave disgrace<br/>
'Tis thou injurious art, not I am base.<br/>
Proud to seem brave among a coward train!<br/>
But now, thou art not valorous, but vain.<br/>
God! should the stern Ulysses rise in might,<br/>
These gates would seem too narrow for thy flight."
</p>
<p>
While yet he speaks, Eurymachus replies,<br/>
With indignation flashing from his eyes:
</p>
<p>
"Slave, I with justice might deserve the wrong,<br/>
Should I not punish that opprobrious tongue.<br/>
Irreverent to the great, and uncontroll'd,<br/>
Art thou from wine, or innate folly, bold?<br/>
Perhaps these outrages from Irus flow,<br/>
A worthless triumph o'er a worthless foe!"
</p>
<p>
He said, and with full force a footstool threw;<br/>
Whirl'd from his arm, with erring rage it flew:<br/>
Ulysses, cautious of the vengeful foe,<br/>
Stoops to the ground, and disappoints the blow.<br/>
Not so a youth, who deals the goblet round,<br/>
Full on his shoulder it inflicts a wound;<br/>
Dash'd from his hand the sounding goblet flies,<br/>
He shrieks, he reels, he falls, and breathless lies.<br/>
Then wild uproar and clamour mount the sky,<br/>
Till mutual thus the peers indignant cry:<br/>
"Oh had this stranger sunk to realms beneath,<br/>
To the black realms of darkness and of death,<br/>
Ere yet he trod these shores! to strife he draws<br/>
Peer against peer; and what the weighty cause?<br/>
A vagabond! for him the great destroy,<br/>
In vile ignoble jars, the feast of joy."
</p>
<p>
To whom the stern Telemachus uprose;<br/>
"Gods! what wild folly from the goblet flows!<br/>
Whence this unguarded openness of soul,<br/>
But from the license of the copious bowl?<br/>
Or Heaven delusion sends: but hence away!<br/>
Force I forbear, and without force obey."
</p>
<p>
Silent, abash'd, they hear the stern rebuke,<br/>
Till thus Amphinomus the silence broke:
</p>
<p>
"True are his words, and he whom truth offends,<br/>
Not with Telemachus, but truth contends;<br/>
Let not the hand of violence invade<br/>
The reverend stranger, or the spotless maid;<br/>
Retire we hence, but crown with rosy wine<br/>
The flowing goblet to the powers divine!<br/>
Guard he his guest beneath whose roof he stands:<br/>
This justice, this the social rite demands."
</p>
<p>
The peers assent: the goblet Mulius crown'd<br/>
With purple juice, and bore in order round:<br/>
Each peer successive his libation pours<br/>
To the blest gods who fill'd the ethereal bowers:<br/>
Then swill'd with wine, with noise the crowds obey,<br/>
And rushing forth, tumultuous reel away.

<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book VIII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Now fair Aurora lifts her golden ray,<br/>
And all the ruddy orient flames with day:<br/>
Alcinous, and the chief, with dawning light,<br/>
Rose instant from the slumbers of the night;<br/>
Then to the council-seat they bend their way,<br/>
And fill the shining thrones along the bay.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Minerva, in her guardian care,<br/>
Shoots from the starry vault through fields of air;<br/>
In form, a herald of the king, she flies<br/>
From peer to peer, and thus incessant cries;
</p>
<p>
"Nobles and chiefs who rule Phæacia's states,<br/>
The king in council your attendance waits;<br/>
A prince of grace divine your aid implores,<br/>
O'er unknown seas arrived from unknown shores."
</p>
<p>
She spoke, and sudden with tumultuous sounds<br/>
Of thronging multitudes the shore rebounds:<br/>
At once the seats they fill; and every eye<br/>
Glazed, as before some brother of the sky.<br/>
Pallas with grace divine his form improves,<br/>
More high he treads, and more enlarged he moves:<br/>
She sheds celestial bloom, regard to draw;<br/>
And gives a dignity of mien, to awe;<br/>
With strength, the future prize of fame to play,<br/>
And gather all the honours of the day.
</p>
<p>
Then from his glittering throne Alcinous rose;<br/>
"Attend (he cried) while we our will disclose.<br/>
Your present aid this godlike stranger craves,<br/>
Toss'd by rude tempest through a war of waves;<br/>
Perhaps from realms that view the rising day,<br/>
Or nations subject to the western ray.<br/>
Then grant, what here all sons of woe obtain<br/>
(For here affliction never pleads in vain);<br/>
Be chosen youth prepared, expert to try<br/>
The vast profound and bid the vessel fly;<br/>
Launch the tall back, and order every oar;<br/>
Then in our court indulge the genial hour.<br/>
Instant, you sailors to this task attend;<br/>
Swift to the palace, all ye peers ascend;<br/>
Let none to strangers honours due disclaim:<br/>
Be there Demodocus the bard of fame,<br/>
Taught by the gods to please, when high he sings<br/>
The vocal lay, responsive to the strings."
</p>
<p>
Thus spoke the prince; the attending peers obey;<br/>
In state they move; Alcinous heads the way<br/>
Swift to Demodocus the herald flies,<br/>
At once the sailors to their charge arise;<br/>
They launch the vessel, and unfurl the sails,<br/>
And stretch the swelling canvas to the gales;<br/>
Then to the palace move: a gathering throng,<br/>
Youth, and white age, tumultuous pour along.<br/>
Now all accesses to the dome are fill'd;<br/>
Eight boars, the choicest of the herd, are kill'd;<br/>
Two beeves, twelve fatlings, from the flock they bring<br/>
To crown the feast; so wills the bounteous king.<br/>
The herald now arrives, and guides along<br/>
The sacred master of celestial song;<br/>
Dear to the Muse! who gave his days to flow<br/>
With mighty blessings, mix'd with mighty woe;<br/>
With clouds of darkness quench'd his visual ray,<br/>
But gave him skill to raise the lofty lay.<br/>
High on a radiant throne sublime in state,<br/>
Encircled by huge multitudes, he sate;<br/>
With silver shone the throne; his lyre, well strung<br/>
To rapturous sounds, at hand Poutonous hung.<br/>
Before his seat a polish'd table shines,<br/>
And a full goblet foams with generous wines;<br/>
His food a herald bore; and now they fed;<br/>
And now the rage of craving hunger fled.
</p>
<p>
Then, fired by all the Muse, aloud he sings<br/>
The mighty deeds of demigods and kings;<br/>
From that fierce wrath the noble song arose,<br/>
That made Ulysses and Achilles foes;<br/>
How o'er the feast they doom the fall of Troy;<br/>
The stern debate Atrides hears with joy;<br/>
For Heaven foretold the contest, when he trod<br/>
The marble threshold of the Delphic god,<br/>
Curious to learn the counsels of the sky,<br/>
Ere yet he loosed the rage of war on Troy.
</p>
<p>
Touch'd at the song, Ulysses straight resign'd<br/>
To soft affliction all his manly mind.<br/>
Before his eyes the purple vest he drew,<br/>
Industrious to conceal the falling dew;<br/>
But when the music paused, he ceased to shed<br/>
The flowing tear, and raised his drooping head;<br/>
And, lifting to the gods a goblet crown'd,<br/>
He pour'd a pure libation to the ground.
</p>
<p>
Transported with the song, the listening train<br/>
Again with loud applause demand the strain;<br/>
Again Ulysses veil'd his pensive head.<br/>
Again unmann'd, a shower of sorrows shed;<br/>
Conceal'd he wept; the king observed alone<br/>
The silent tear, and heard the secret groan;<br/>
Then to the bard aloud&mdash;"O cease to sing,<br/>
Dumb be thy voice and mute the harmonious string;<br/>
Enough the feast has pleased, enough the power<br/>
Of heavenly song has crown'd the genial hour!<br/>
Incessant in the games your strength display,<br/>
Contest, ye brave the honours of the day!<br/>
That pleased the admiring stranger may proclaim<br/>
In distant regions the Phæacian fame:<br/>
None wield the gauntlet with so dire a sway,<br/>
Or swifter in the race devour the way;<br/>
None in the leap spring with so strong a bound,<br/>
Or firmer, in the wrestling, press the ground."
</p>
<p>
Thus spoke the king; the attending peers obey;<br/>
In state they move, Alcinous lends the way;<br/>
His golden lyre Demodocus unstrung,<br/>
High on a column in the palace hung;<br/>
And guided by a herald's guardian cares,<br/>
Majestic to the lists of Fame repairs.
</p>
<p>
Now swarms the populace: a countless throng,<br/>
Youth and hoar age; and man drives man along.<br/>
The games begin; ambitious of the prize,<br/>
Acroneus, Thoon, and Eretmeus rise;<br/>
The prize Ocyalus and Prymneus claim,<br/>
Anchialus and Ponteus, chiefs of fame.<br/>
There Proreus, Nautes, Eratreus, appear<br/>
And famed Amphialus, Polyneus' heir;<br/>
Euryalus, like Mars terrific, rose,<br/>
When clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes;<br/>
Naubolides with grace unequall'd shone,<br/>
Or equall'd by Laodamas alone.<br/>
With these came forth Ambasineus the strong:<br/>
And three brave sons, from great Alcinous sprung.
</p>
<p>
Ranged in a line the ready racers stand,<br/>
Start from the goal, and vanish o'er the strand:<br/>
Swift as on wings of winds, upborne they fly,<br/>
And drifts of rising dust involve the sky.<br/>
Before the rest, what space the hinds allow<br/>
Between the mule and ox, from plough to plough,<br/>
Clytonius sprung: he wing'd the rapid way,<br/>
And bore the unrivall'd honours of the day.<br/>
With fierce embrace the brawny wrestlers join;<br/>
The conquest, great Euryalus, is thine.<br/>
Amphialus sprung forward with a bound,<br/>
Superior in the leap, a length of ground.<br/>
From Elatreus' strong arm the discus flies,<br/>
And sings with unmatch'd force along the skies.<br/>
And Laodam whirls high, with dreadful sway,<br/>
The gloves of death, victorious in the fray.
</p>
<p>
While thus the peerage in the games contends,<br/>
In act to speak, Laodamas ascends.
</p>
<p>
"O friends (he cries), the stranger seems well skill'd<br/>
To try the illustrious labours of the field:<br/>
I deem him brave: then grant the brave man's claim,<br/>
Invite the hero to his share of fame.<br/>
What nervous arms he boasts! how firm his tread!<br/>
His limbs how turn'd! how broad his shoulders spread!<br/>
By age unbroke!&mdash;but all-consuming care<br/>
Destroys perhaps the strength that time would spare:<br/>
Dire is the ocean, dread in all its forms!<br/>
Man must decay when man contends with storms."
</p>
<p>
"Well hast thou spoke (Euryalus replies):<br/>
Thine is the guest, invite him thou to rise."<br/>
Swift as the word, advancing from the crowd,<br/>
He made obeisance, and thus spoke aloud:
</p>
<p>
"Vouchsafes the reverend stranger to display<br/>
His manly worth, and share the glorious day?<br/>
Father, arise! for thee thy port proclaims<br/>
Expert to conquer in the solemn games.<br/>
To fame arise! for what more fame can yield<br/>
Than the swift race, or conflict of the field?<br/>
Steal from corroding care one transient day,<br/>
To glory give the space thou hast to stay;<br/>
Short is the time, and lo! e'en now the gales<br/>
Call thee aboard, and stretch the swelling sails."
</p>
<p>
To whom with sighs Ulysses gave reply:<br/>
"Ah why the ill-suiting pastime must I try?<br/>
To gloomy care my thoughts alone are free;<br/>
Ill the gay sports with troubled hearts agree;<br/>
Sad from my natal hour my days have ran,<br/>
A much-afflicted, much-enduring man!<br/>
Who, suppliant to the king and peers, implores<br/>
A speedy voyage to his native shore."
</p>
<p>
"Wide wanders, Laodam, thy erring tongue<br/>
The sports of glory to the brave belong<br/>
(Retorts Euryalus): he bears no claim<br/>
Among the great, unlike the sons of Fame.<br/>
A wandering merchant he frequents the main<br/>
Some mean seafarer in pursuit of gain;<br/>
Studious of freight, in naval trade well skill'd,<br/>
But dreads the athletic labours of the field."
</p>
<p>
Incensed, Ulysses with a frown replies:<br/>
"O forward to proclaim thy soul unwise!<br/>
With partial hands the gods their gifts dispense;<br/>
Some greatly think, some speak with manly sense;<br/>
Here Heaven an elegance of form denies,<br/>
But wisdom the defect of form supplies;<br/>
This man with energy of thought controls,<br/>
And steals with modest violence our souls;<br/>
He speaks reservedly, but he speaks with force,<br/>
Nor can one word be changed but for a worse;<br/>
In public more than mortal he appears,<br/>
And as he moves, the praising crowd reveres;<br/>
While others, beauteous as the etherial kind,<br/>
The nobler portion went, a knowing mind,<br/>
In outward show Heaven gives thee to excel.<br/>
But Heaven denies the praise of thinking well<br/>
I'll bear the brave a rude ungovern'd tongue,<br/>
And, youth, my generous soul resents the wrong.<br/>
Skill'd in heroic exercise, I claim<br/>
A post of honour with the sons of Fame.<br/>
Such was my boast while vigour crown'd my days,<br/>
Now care surrounds me, and my force decays;<br/>
Inured a melancholy part to bear<br/>
In scenes of death, by tempest and by war<br/>
Yet thus by woes impair'd, no more I waive<br/>
To prove the hero&mdash;slander stings the brave."
</p>
<p>
Then gliding forward with a furious bound<br/>
He wrench'd a rocky fragment from the ground<br/>
By far more ponderous, and more huge by far<br/>
Than what Phæacia's sons discharged in air.<br/>
Fierce from his arm the enormous load he flings;<br/>
Sonorous through the shaded air it sings;<br/>
Couch'd to the earth, tempestuous as it flies,<br/>
The crowd gaze upward while it cleaves the skies.<br/>
Beyond all marks, with many a giddy round<br/>
Down-rushing, it up-turns a hill of ground.
</p>
<p>
That Instant Pallas, bursting from a cloud,<br/>
Fix'd a distinguish'd mark, and cried aloud:
</p>
<p>
"E'en he who, sightless, wants his visual ray<br/>
May by his touch alone award the day:<br/>
Thy signal throw transcends the utmost bound<br/>
Of every champion by a length of ground:<br/>
Securely bid the strongest of the train<br/>
Arise to throw; the strongest throws in vain."
</p>
<p>
She spoke: and momentary mounts the sky:<br/>
The friendly voice Ulysses hears with joy.<br/>
Then thus aloud (elate with decent pride)<br/>
"Rise, ye Phæacians, try your force (he cried):<br/>
If with this throw the strongest caster vie,<br/>
Still, further still, I bid the discus fly.<br/>
Stand forth, ye champions, who the gauntlet wield,<br/>
Or ye, the swiftest racers of the field!<br/>
Stand forth, ye wrestlers, who these pastimes grace!<br/>
I wield the gauntlet, and I run the race.<br/>
In such heroic games I yield to none,<br/>
Or yield to brave Laodamas alone:<br/>
Shall I with brave Laodamas contend?<br/>
A friend is sacred, and I style him friend.<br/>
Ungenerous were the man, and base of heart,<br/>
Who takes the kind, and pays the ungrateful part:<br/>
Chiefly the man, in foreign realms confined,<br/>
Base to his friend, to his own interest blind:<br/>
All, all your heroes I this day defy;<br/>
Give me a man that we our might may try.<br/>
Expert in every art, I boast the skill<br/>
To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill;<br/>
Should a whole host at once discharge the bow,<br/>
My well-aim'd shaft with death prevents the foe:<br/>
Alone superior in the field of Troy,<br/>
Great Philoctetes taught the shaft to fly.<br/>
From all the sons of earth unrivall'd praise<br/>
I justly claim; but yield to better days,<br/>
To those famed days when great Alcides rose,<br/>
And Eurytus, who bade the gods be foes<br/>
(Vain Eurytus, whose art became his crime,<br/>
Swept from the earth, he perish'd in his prime:<br/>
Sudden the irremeable way he trod,<br/>
Who boldly durst defy the bowyer god).<br/>
In fighting fields as far the spear I throw<br/>
As flies an arrow from the well-drawn bow.<br/>
Sole in the race the contest I decline,<br/>
Stiff are my weary joints, and I resign;<br/>
By storms and hunger worn; age well may fail,<br/>
When storms and hunger doth at once assail."
</p>
<p>
Abash'd, the numbers hear the godlike man,<br/>
Till great Alcinous mildly thus began:
</p>
<p>
"Well hast thou spoke, and well thy generous tongue<br/>
With decent pride refutes a public wrong:<br/>
Warm are thy words, but warm without offence;<br/>
Fear only fools, secure in men of sense;<br/>
Thy worth is known. Then hear our country's claim,<br/>
And bear to heroes our heroic fame:<br/>
In distant realms our glorious deeds display,<br/>
Repeat them frequent in the genial day;<br/>
When, blest with ease, thy woes and wanderings end,<br/>
Teach them thy consort, bid thy sons attend;<br/>
How, loved of Jove, he crown'd our sires with praise,<br/>
How we their offspring dignify our race.
</p>
<p>
"Let other realms the deathful gauntlet wield,<br/>
Or boast the glories of the athletic field:<br/>
We in the course unrivall'd speed display,<br/>
Or through cerulean billows plough the way;<br/>
To dress, to dance, to sing, our sole delight,<br/>
The feast or bath by day, and love by night:<br/>
Rise, then, ye skill'd in measures; let him bear<br/>
Your fame to men that breathe a distant air;<br/>
And faithful say, to you the powers belong<br/>
To race, to sail, to dance, to chant the song.
</p>
<p>
"But, herald, to the palace swift repair,<br/>
And the soft lyre to grace our pastimes bear."
</p>
<p>
Swift at the word, obedient to the king,<br/>
The herald flies the tuneful lyre to bring.<br/>
Up rose nine seniors, chosen to survey<br/>
The future games, the judges of the day<br/>
With instant care they mark a spacious round<br/>
And level for the dance the allotted ground:<br/>
The herald bears the lyre: intent to play,<br/>
The bard advancing meditates the lay.<br/>
Skill'd in the dance, tall youths, a blooming band,<br/>
Graceful before the heavenly minstrel stand:<br/>
Light bounding from the earth, at once they rise,<br/>
Their feet half-viewless quiver in the skies:<br/>
Ulysses gazed, astonish'd to survey<br/>
The glancing splendours as their sandals play.<br/>
Meantime the bard, alternate to the strings,<br/>
The loves of Mars and Cytherea sings:<br/>
How the stern god, enamour'd with her charms<br/>
Clasp'd the gay panting goddess in his arms,<br/>
By bribes seduced; and how the sun, whose eye<br/>
Views the broad heavens, disclosed the lawless joy.<br/>
Stung to the soul, indignant through the skies<br/>
To his black forge vindictive Vulcan flies:<br/>
Arrived, his sinewy arms incessant place<br/>
The eternal anvil on the massy base.<br/>
A wondrous net he labours, to betray<br/>
The wanton lovers, as entwined they lay,<br/>
Indissolubly strong; Then instant bears<br/>
To his immortal dome the finish'd snares:<br/>
Above, below, around, with art dispread,<br/>
The sure inclosure folds the genial bed:<br/>
Whose texture even the search of gods deceives,<br/>
Thin as the filmy threads the spider weaves,<br/>
Then, as withdrawing from the starry bowers,<br/>
He feigns a journey to the Lemnian shores,<br/>
His favourite isle: observant Mars descries<br/>
His wish'd recess, and to the goddess flies;<br/>
He glows, he burns, the fair-hair'd queen of love<br/>
Descends, smooth gliding from the courts of Jove,<br/>
Gay blooming in full charms: her hand he press'd<br/>
With eager joy, and with a sigh address'd:
</p>
<p>
"Come, my beloved! and taste the soft delights:<br/>
Come, to repose the genial bed invites:<br/>
Thy absent spouse, neglectful of thy charms,<br/>
Prefers his barbarous Sintians to thy arms!"
</p>
<p>
Then, nothing loth, the enamour'd fair he led,<br/>
And sunk transported on the conscious bed.<br/>
Down rush'd the toils, inwrapping as they lay<br/>
The careless lovers in their wanton play:<br/>
In vain they strive; the entangling snares deny<br/>
(Inextricably firm) the power to fly.<br/>
Warn'd by the god who sheds the golden day,<br/>
Stern Vulcan homeward treads the starry way:<br/>
Arrived, he sees, he grieves, with rage he burns:<br/>
Full horribly he roars, his voice all heaven returns.
</p>
<p>
"O Jove (he cried) O all ye powers above,<br/>
See the lewd dalliance of the queen of love!<br/>
Me, awkward me, she scorns; and yields her charms<br/>
To that fair lecher, the strong god of arms.<br/>
If I am lame, that stain my natal hour<br/>
By fate imposed; such me my parent bore.<br/>
Why was I born? See how the wanton lies!<br/>
Oh sight tormenting to a husband's eyes!<br/>
But yet, I trust, this once e'en Mars would fly<br/>
His fair-one's arms&mdash;he thinks her, once, too nigh.<br/>
But there remain, ye guilty, in my power,<br/>
Till Jove refunds his shameless daughter's dower.<br/>
Too dear I prized a fair enchanting face:<br/>
Beauty unchaste is beauty in disgrace."
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the gods the dome of Vulcan throng;<br/>
Apollo comes, and Neptune comes along;<br/>
With these gay Hermes trod the starry plain;<br/>
But modesty withheld the goddess train.<br/>
All heaven beholds, imprison'd as they lie,<br/>
And unextinguish'd laughter shakes the sky.<br/>
Then mutual, thus they spoke: "Behold on wrong<br/>
Swift vengeance waits; and art subdues the strong!<br/>
Dwells there a god on all the Olympian brow<br/>
More swift than Mars, and more than Vulcan slow?<br/>
Yet Vulcan conquers, and the god of arms<br/>
Must pay the penalty for lawless charms."
</p>
<p>
Thus serious they; but he who gilds the skies,<br/>
The gay Apollo, thus to Hermes cries:<br/>
"Wouldst thou enchain'd like Mars, O Hermes, lie<br/>
And bear the shame like Mars to share the joy?"
</p>
<p>
"O envied shame! (the smiling youth rejoin'd;)<br/>
And thrice the chains, and thrice more firmly bind;<br/>
Gaze all ye gods, and every goddess gaze,<br/>
Yet eager would I bless the sweet disgrace."
</p>
<p>
Loud laugh the rest, e'en Neptune laughs aloud,<br/>
Yet sues importunate to loose the god.<br/>
"And free, (he cries) O Vulcan! free from shame<br/>
Thy captives; I ensure the penal claim."
</p>
<p>
"Will Neptune (Vulcan then) the faithless trust?<br/>
He suffers who gives surety for the unjust:<br/>
But say, if that lewd scandal of the sky,<br/>
To liberty restored, perfidious fly:<br/>
Say, wilt thou bear the mulct?" He instant cries,<br/>
"The mulct I bear, if Mars perfidious flies."
</p>
<p>
To whom appeased: "No more I urge delay;<br/>
When Neptune sues, my part is to obey."<br/>
Then to the snares his force the god applies;<br/>
They burst; and Mars to Thrace indignant flies:<br/>
To the soft Cyprian shores the goddess moves,<br/>
To visit Paphos and her blooming groves,<br/>
Where to the Power an hundred altars rise,<br/>
And breathing odours scent the balmy skies;<br/>
Concealed she bathes in consecrated bowers,<br/>
The Graces unguents shed, ambrosial showers,<br/>
Unguents that charm the gods! she last assumes<br/>
Her wondrous robes; and full the goddess blooms.
</p>
<p>
Thus sung the bard: Ulysses hears with joy,<br/>
And loud applauses read the vaulted sky.
</p>
<p>
Then to the sports his sons the king commands,<br/>
Each blooming youth before the monarch stands,<br/>
In dance unmatch'd! A wondrous ball is brought<br/>
(The work of Polypus, divinely wrought);<br/>
This youth with strength enormous bids it fly,<br/>
And bending backward whirls it to the sky;<br/>
His brother, springing with an active bound,<br/>
At distance intercepts it from the ground.<br/>
The ball dismissed, in dance they skim the strand,<br/>
Turn and return, and scarce imprint the sand.<br/>
The assembly gazes with astonished eyes,<br/>
And sends in shouts applauses to the skies.
</p>
<p>
Then thus Ulysses: "Happy king, whose name<br/>
The brightest shines in all the rolls of fame!<br/>
In subjects happy with surprise I gaze;<br/>
Thy praise was just; their skill transcends thy praise."
</p>
<p>
Pleas'd with his people's fame, the monarch hears,<br/>
And thus benevolent accosts the peers:<br/>
"Since wisdom's sacred guidance he pursues,<br/>
Give to the stranger-guest a stranger's dues:<br/>
Twelve princes in our realm dominion share,<br/>
O'er whom supreme, imperial power I bear;<br/>
Bring gold, a pledge of love: a talent bring,<br/>
A vest, a robe, and imitate your king.<br/>
Be swift to give: that he this night may share<br/>
The social feast of joy, with joy sincere.<br/>
And thou, Euryalus, redeem thy wrong;<br/>
A generous heart repairs a slanderous tongue."
</p>
<p>
The assenting peers, obedient to the king,<br/>
In haste their heralds send the gifts to bring.<br/>
Then thus Euryalus: "O prince, whose sway<br/>
Rules this bless'd realm, repentant I obey;<br/>
Be his this sword, whose blade of brass displays<br/>
A ruddy gleam; whose hilt a silver blaze;<br/>
Whose ivory sheath, inwrought with curious pride,<br/>
Adds graceful terror to the wearer's side."
</p>
<p>
He said, and to his hand the sword consign'd:<br/>
"And if (he cried) my words affect thy mind,<br/>
Far from thy mind those words, ye whirlwinds, bear,<br/>
And scatter them, ye storms, in empty air!<br/>
Crown, O ye heavens, with joy his peaceful hours,<br/>
And grant him to his spouse, and native shores."
</p>
<p>
"And blest be thou, my friend, (Ulysses cries,)<br/>
Crown him with every joy, ye favouring skies<br/>
To thy calm hours continued peace afford,<br/>
And never, never mayst thou want this sword,"
</p>
<p>
He said, and o'er his shoulder flung the blade.<br/>
Now o'er the earth ascends the evening shade:<br/>
The precious gifts the illustrious heralds bear,<br/>
And to the court the embodied peers repair.<br/>
Before the queen Alcinous' sons unfold<br/>
The vests, the robes, and heaps of shining gold;<br/>
Then to the radiant thrones they move in state:<br/>
Aloft, the king in pomp imperial sate.
</p>
<p>
Thence to the queen: "O partner of our reign,<br/>
O sole beloved! command thy menial train<br/>
A polish'd chest and stately robes to bear,<br/>
And healing waters for the bath prepare;<br/>
That, bathed, our guest may bid his sorrows cease,<br/>
Hear the sweet song, and taste the feast in peace.<br/>
A bowl that flames with gold, of wondrous frame,<br/>
Ourself we give, memorial of our name;<br/>
To raise in offerings to almighty Jove,<br/>
And every god that treads the courts above."
</p>
<p>
Instant the queen, observant of the king,<br/>
Commands her train a spacious vase to bring,<br/>
The spacious vase with ample streams suffice,<br/>
Heap the high wood, and bid the flames arise.<br/>
The flames climb round it with a fierce embrace,<br/>
The fuming waters bubble o'er the blaze.<br/>
Herself the chest prepares; in order roll'd<br/>
The robes, the vests are ranged, and heaps of gold<br/>
And adding a rich dress inwrought with art,<br/>
A gift expressive of her bounteous heart.<br/>
Thus spoke to Ithacus: "To guard with bands<br/>
Insolvable these gifts, thy care demands;<br/>
Lest, in thy slumbers on the watery main,<br/>
The hand of rapine make our bounty vain."
</p>
<p>
Then bending with full force around he roll'd<br/>
A labyrinth of bands in fold on fold,<br/>
Closed with Circaean art. A train attends<br/>
Around the bath: the bath the king ascends<br/>
(Untasted joy, since that disastrous hour,<br/>
He sail'd ill-fated from Calypso's bower);<br/>
Where, happy as the gods that range the sky,<br/>
He feasted every sense with every joy.<br/>
He bathes; the damsels with officious toil,<br/>
Shed sweets, shed unguents, in a shower of oil;<br/>
Then o'er his limbs a gorgeous robe he spreads,<br/>
And to the feast magnificently treads.<br/>
Full where the dome its shining valves expands,<br/>
Nausicaa blooming as a goddess stands;<br/>
With wondering eyes the hero she survey'd,<br/>
And graceful thus began the royal maid:
</p>
<p>
"Hail, godlike stranger! and when heaven restores<br/>
To thy fond wish thy long-expected shores,<br/>
This ever grateful in remembrance bear:<br/>
To me thou owest, to me, the vital air."
</p>
<p>
"O royal maid! (Ulysses straight returns)<br/>
Whose worth the splendours of thy race adorns,<br/>
So may dread Jove (whose arm in vengeance forms<br/>
The writhen bolt, and blackens heaven with storms),<br/>
Restore me safe, through weary wanderings toss'd,<br/>
To my dear country's ever-pleasing coast,<br/>
As while the spirit in this bosom glows,<br/>
To thee, my goddess, I address my vows;<br/>
My life, thy gift I boast!" He said, and sate<br/>
Fast by Alcinous on a throne of state.
</p>
<p>
Now each partakes the feast, the wine prepares,<br/>
Portions the food, and each his portion shares.<br/>
The bard a herald guides; the gazing throng<br/>
Pay low obeisance as he moves along:<br/>
Beneath a sculptur'd arch he sits enthroned,<br/>
The peers encircling form an awful round.<br/>
Then, from the chine, Ulysses carves with art<br/>
Delicious food, an honorary part:<br/>
"This, let the master of the lyre receive,<br/>
A pledge of love! 'tis all a wretch can give.<br/>
Lives there a man beneath the spacious skies<br/>
Who sacred honours to the bard denies?<br/>
The Muse the bard inspires, exalts his mind;<br/>
The muse indulgent loves the harmonious kind."
</p>
<p>
The herald to his hand the charge conveys,<br/>
Not fond of flattery, nor unpleased with praise.
</p>
<p>
When now the rage of hunger was allay'd,<br/>
Thus to the lyrist wise Ulysses said:<br/>
"O more than man! thy soul the muse inspires,<br/>
Or Phœbus animates with all his fires;<br/>
For who, by Phœbus uninform'd, could know<br/>
The woe of Greece, and sing so well the woe?<br/>
Just to the tale, as present at the fray,<br/>
Or taught the labours of the dreadful day:<br/>
The song recalls past horrors to my eyes,<br/>
And bids proud Ilion from her ashes rise.<br/>
Once more harmonious strike the sounding string,<br/>
The Epaean fabric, framed by Pallas, sing:<br/>
How stern Ulysses, furious to destroy,<br/>
With latent heroes sack'd imperial Troy.<br/>
If faithful thou record the tale of Fame,<br/>
The god himself inspires thy breast with flame<br/>
And mine shall be the task henceforth to raise<br/>
In every land thy monument of praise."
</p>
<p>
Full of the god he raised his lofty strain:<br/>
How the Greeks rush'd tumultuous to the main;<br/>
How blazing tents illumined half the skies,<br/>
While from the shores the winged navy flies;<br/>
How e'en in Ilion's walls, in deathful bands,<br/>
Came the stern Greeks by Troy's assisting hands:<br/>
All Troy up-heaved the steed; of differing mind,<br/>
Various the Trojans counsell'd: part consign'd<br/>
The monster to the sword, part sentence gave<br/>
To plunge it headlong in the whelming wave;<br/>
The unwise award to lodge it in the towers,<br/>
An offering sacred to the immortal powers:<br/>
The unwise prevail, they lodge it in the walls,<br/>
And by the gods' decree proud Ilion falls:<br/>
Destruction enters in the treacherous wood,<br/>
And vengeful slaughter, fierce for human blood.
</p>
<p>
He sung the Greeks stern-issuing from the steed,<br/>
How Ilion burns, how all her fathers bleed;<br/>
How to thy dome, Deiphobus! ascends<br/>
The Spartan king; how Ithacus attends<br/>
(Horrid as Mars); and how with dire alarms<br/>
He fights&mdash;subdues, for Pallas strings his arms
</p>
<p>
Thus while he sung, Ulysses' griefs renew,<br/>
Tears bathe his cheeks, and tears the ground bedew<br/>
As some fond matron views in mortal fight<br/>
Her husband falling in his country's right;<br/>
Frantic through clashing swords she runs, she flies,<br/>
As ghastly pale he groans, and faints and dies;<br/>
Close to his breast she grovels on the ground,<br/>
And bathes with floods of tears the gaping wound;<br/>
She cries, she shrieks: the fierce insulting foe<br/>
Relentless mocks her violence of woe:<br/>
To chains condemn'd, as wildly she deplores;<br/>
A widow, and a slave on foreign shores.
</p>
<p>
So from the sluices of Ulysses' eyes<br/>
Fast fell the tears, and sighs succeeded sighs:<br/>
Conceal'd he grieved: the king observed alone<br/>
The silent tear, and heard the secret groan;<br/>
Then to the bard aloud: "O cease to sing,<br/>
Dumb be thy voice, and mute the tuneful string;<br/>
To every note his tears responsive flow,<br/>
And his great heart heaves with tumultuous woe;<br/>
Thy lay too deeply moves: then cease the lay,<br/>
And o'er the banquet every heart be gay:<br/>
This social right demands: for him the sails,<br/>
Floating in air, invite the impelling gales:<br/>
His are the gifts of love: the wise and good<br/>
Receive the stranger as a brother's blood.
</p>
<p>
"But, friend, discover faithful what I crave;<br/>
Artful concealment ill becomes the brave:<br/>
Say what thy birth, and what the name you bore,<br/>
Imposed by parents in the natal hour?<br/>
(For from the natal hour distinctive names,<br/>
One common right, the great and lowly claims:)<br/>
Say from what city, from what regions toss'd,<br/>
And what inhabitants those regions boast?<br/>
So shalt thou instant reach the realm assign'd,<br/>
In wondrous ships, self-moved, instinct with mind;<br/>
No helm secures their course, no pilot guides;<br/>
Like man intelligent, they plough the tides,<br/>
Conscious of every coast, and every bay,<br/>
That lies beneath the sun's all-seeing ray;<br/>
Though clouds and darkness veil the encumber'd sky,<br/>
Fearless through darkness and through clouds they fly;<br/>
Though tempests rage, though rolls the swelling main,<br/>
The seas may roll, the tempests rage in vain;<br/>
E'en the stern god that o'er the waves presides,<br/>
Safe as they pass, and safe repass the tides,<br/>
With fury burns; while careless they convey<br/>
Promiscuous every guest to every bay,<br/>
These ears have heard my royal sire disclose<br/>
A dreadful story, big with future woes;<br/>
How Neptune raged, and how, by his command,<br/>
Firm rooted in a surge a ship should stand<br/>
A monument of wrath; how mound on mound<br/>
Should bury these proud towers beneath the ground.<br/>
But this the gods may frustrate or fulfil,<br/>
As suits the purpose of the Eternal Will.<br/>
But say through what waste regions hast thou stray'd<br/>
What customs noted, and what coasts survey'd;<br/>
Possess'd by wild barbarians fierce in arms,<br/>
Or men whose bosom tender pity warms?<br/>
Say why the fate of Troy awaked thy cares,<br/>
Why heaved thy bosom, and why flowed thy tears?<br/>
Just are the ways of Heaven: from Heaven proceed<br/>
The woes of man; Heaven doom'd the Greeks to bleed,<br/>
A theme of future song! Say, then, if slain<br/>
Some dear-loved brother press'd the Phrygian plain?<br/>
Or bled some friend, who bore a brother's part,<br/>
And claim'd by merit, not by blood, the heart?"

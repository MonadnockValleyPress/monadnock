<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XI</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
The saffron morn, with early blushes spread,<br/>
Now rose refulgent from Tithonus' bed;<br/>
With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,<br/>
And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:<br/>
When baleful Eris, sent by Jove's command,<br/>
The torch of discord blazing in her hand,<br/>
Through the red skies her bloody sign extends,<br/>
And, wrapt in tempests, o'er the fleet descends.<br/>
High on Ulysses' bark her horrid stand<br/>
She took, and thunder'd through the seas and land.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Even Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,<br/>
Whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,<br/>
Thence the black fury through the Grecian throng<br/>
With horror sounds the loud Orthian song:<br/>
The navy shakes, and at the dire alarms<br/>
Each bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.<br/>
No more they sigh, inglorious to return,<br/>
But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The king of men his hardy host inspires<br/>
With loud command, with great example fires!<br/>
Himself first rose, himself before the rest<br/>
His mighty limbs in radiant armour dress'd,<br/>
And first he cased his manly legs around<br/>
In shining greaves with silver buckles bound;<br/>
The beaming cuirass next adorn'd his breast,<br/>
The same which once king Cinyras possess'd:<br/>
(The fame of Greece and her assembled host<br/>
Had reach'd that monarch on the Cyprian coast;<br/>
'Twas then, the friendship of the chief to gain,<br/>
This glorious gift he sent, nor sent in vain:)<br/>
Ten rows of azure steel the work infold,<br/>
Twice ten of tin, and twelve of ductile gold;<br/>
Three glittering dragons to the gorget rise,<br/>
Whose imitated scales against the skies<br/>
Reflected various light, and arching bow'd,<br/>
Like colour'd rainbows o'er a showery cloud<br/>
(Jove's wondrous bow, of three celestial dies,<br/>
Placed as a sign to man amidst the skies).<br/>
A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,<br/>
Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side:<br/>
Gold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased<br/>
The shining blade, and golden hangers graced.<br/>
His buckler's mighty orb was next display'd,<br/>
That round the warrior cast a dreadful shade;<br/>
Ten zones of brass its ample brim surround,<br/>
And twice ten bosses the bright convex crown'd:<br/>
Tremendous Gorgon frown'd upon its field,<br/>
And circling terrors fill'd the expressive shield:<br/>
Within its concave hung a silver thong,<br/>
On which a mimic serpent creeps along,<br/>
His azure length in easy waves extends,<br/>
Till in three heads the embroider'd monster ends.<br/>
Last o'er his brows his fourfold helm he placed,<br/>
With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;<br/>
And in his hands two steely javelins wields,<br/>
That blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That instant Juno, and the martial maid,<br/>
In happy thunders promised Greece their aid;<br/>
High o'er the chief they clash'd their arms in air,<br/>
And, leaning from the clouds, expect the war.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Close to the limits of the trench and mound,<br/>
The fiery coursers to their chariots bound<br/>
The squires restrain'd: the foot, with those who wield<br/>
The lighter arms, rush forward to the field.<br/>
To second these, in close array combined,<br/>
The squadrons spread their sable wings behind.<br/>
Now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun,<br/>
As with the light the warriors' toils begun.<br/>
Even Jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill'd<br/>
Red drops of blood o'er all the fatal field;<br/>
The woes of men unwilling to survey,<br/>
And all the slaughters that must stain the day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Near Ilus' tomb, in order ranged around,<br/>
The Trojan lines possess'd the rising ground:<br/>
There wise Polydamas and Hector stood;<br/>
Æneas, honour'd as a guardian god;<br/>
Bold Polybus, Agenor the divine;<br/>
The brother-warriors of Antenor's line:<br/>
With youthful Acamas, whose beauteous face<br/>
And fair proportion match'd the ethereal race.<br/>
Great Hector, cover'd with his spacious shield,<br/>
Plies all the troops, and orders all the field.<br/>
As the red star now shows his sanguine fires<br/>
Through the dark clouds, and now in night retires,<br/>
Thus through the ranks appear'd the godlike man,<br/>
Plunged in the rear, or blazing in the van;<br/>
While streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,<br/>
Flash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.<br/>
As sweating reapers in some wealthy field,<br/>
Ranged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield,<br/>
Bear down the furrows, till their labours meet;<br/>
Thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet:<br/>
So Greece and Troy the field of war divide,<br/>
And falling ranks are strow'd on every side.<br/>
None stoop'd a thought to base inglorious flight;<br/>
But horse to horse, and man to man they fight,<br/>
Not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey;<br/>
Each wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.<br/>
Discord with joy the scene of death descries,<br/>
And drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes:<br/>
Discord alone, of all the immortal train,<br/>
Swells the red horrors of this direful plain:<br/>
The gods in peace their golden mansions fill,<br/>
Ranged in bright order on the Olympian hill:<br/>
But general murmurs told their griefs above,<br/>
And each accused the partial will of Jove.<br/>
Meanwhile apart, superior, and alone,<br/>
The eternal Monarch, on his awful throne,<br/>
Wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate;<br/>
And fix'd, fulfill'd the just decrees of fate.<br/>
On earth he turn'd his all-considering eyes,<br/>
And mark'd the spot where Ilion's towers arise;<br/>
The sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,<br/>
The victor's rage, the dying, and the dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus while the morning-beams, increasing bright,<br/>
O'er heaven's pure azure spread the glowing light,<br/>
Commutual death the fate of war confounds,<br/>
Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.<br/>
But now (what time in some sequester'd vale<br/>
The weary woodman spreads his sparing meal,<br/>
When his tired arms refuse the axe to rear,<br/>
And claim a respite from the sylvan war;<br/>
But not till half the prostrate forests lay<br/>
Stretch'd in long ruin, and exposed to day)<br/>
Then, nor till then, the Greeks' impulsive might<br/>
Pierced the black phalanx, and let in the light.<br/>
Great Agamemnon then the slaughter led,<br/>
And slew Bienor at his people's head:<br/>
Whose squire Oileus, with a sudden spring,<br/>
Leap'd from the chariot to revenge his king;<br/>
But in his front he felt the fatal wound,<br/>
Which pierced his brain, and stretch'd him on the ground.<br/>
Atrides spoil'd, and left them on the plain:<br/>
Vain was their youth, their glittering armour vain:<br/>
Now soil'd with dust, and naked to the sky,<br/>
Their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Two sons of Priam next to battle move,<br/>
The product, one of marriage, one of love:<br/>
In the same car the brother-warriors ride;<br/>
This took the charge to combat, that to guide:<br/>
Far other task, than when they wont to keep,<br/>
On Ida's tops, their father's fleecy sheep.<br/>
These on the mountains once Achilles found,<br/>
And captive led, with pliant osiers bound;<br/>
Then to their sire for ample sums restored;<br/>
But now to perish by Atrides' sword:<br/>
Pierced in the breast the base-born Isus bleeds:<br/>
Cleft through the head his brother's fate succeeds,<br/>
Swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls,<br/>
And, stript, their features to his mind recalls.<br/>
The Trojans see the youths untimely die,<br/>
But helpless tremble for themselves, and fly.<br/>
So when a lion ranging o'er the lawns,<br/>
Finds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns,<br/>
Their bones he cracks, their reeking vitals draws,<br/>
And grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws;<br/>
The frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay,<br/>
But swift through rustling thickets bursts her way;<br/>
All drown'd in sweat, the panting mother flies,<br/>
And the big tears roll trickling from her eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Amidst the tumult of the routed train,<br/>
The sons of false Antimachus were slain;<br/>
He who for bribes his faithless counsels sold,<br/>
And voted Helen's stay for Paris' gold.<br/>
Atrides mark'd, as these their safety sought,<br/>
And slew the children for the father's fault;<br/>
Their headstrong horse unable to restrain,<br/>
They shook with fear, and dropp'd the silken rein;<br/>
Then in the chariot on their knees they fall,<br/>
And thus with lifted hands for mercy call:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O spare our youth, and for the life we owe,<br/>
Antimachus shall copious gifts bestow:<br/>
Soon as he hears, that, not in battle slain,<br/>
The Grecian ships his captive sons detain,<br/>
Large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told,<br/>
And steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold."<br/>
</p>
<p>
These words, attended with the flood of tears,<br/>
The youths address'd to unrelenting ears:<br/>
The vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:<br/>
"If from Antimachus ye spring, ye die;<br/>
The daring wretch who once in council stood<br/>
To shed Ulysses' and my brother's blood,<br/>
For proffer'd peace! and sues his seed for grace?<br/>
No, die, and pay the forfeit of your race."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, Pisander from the car he cast,<br/>
And pierced his breast: supine he breathed his last.<br/>
His brother leap'd to earth; but, as he lay,<br/>
The trenchant falchion lopp'd his hands away;<br/>
His sever'd head was toss'd among the throng,<br/>
And, rolling, drew a bloody train along.<br/>
Then, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;<br/>
The king's example all his Greeks pursue.<br/>
Now by the foot the flying foot were slain,<br/>
Horse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.<br/>
From the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,<br/>
Shade the black host, and intercept the skies.<br/>
The brass-hoof'd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,<br/>
And the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,<br/>
Still slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds;<br/>
The distanced army wonders at his deeds,<br/>
As when the winds with raging flames conspire,<br/>
And o'er the forests roll the flood of fire,<br/>
In blazing heaps the grove's old honours fall,<br/>
And one refulgent ruin levels all:<br/>
Before Atrides' rage so sinks the foe,<br/>
Whole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.<br/>
The steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,<br/>
And many a car, now lighted of its lord,<br/>
Wide o'er the field with guideless fury rolls,<br/>
Breaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls;<br/>
While his keen falchion drinks the warriors' lives;<br/>
More grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Perhaps great Hector then had found his fate,<br/>
But Jove and destiny prolong'd his date.<br/>
Safe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,<br/>
Amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay,<br/>
Through the mid field the routed urge their way:<br/>
Where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,<br/>
The path they take, and speed to reach the town.<br/>
As swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued,<br/>
Hot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.<br/>
Now near the beech-tree, and the Scaean gates,<br/>
The hero halts, and his associates waits.<br/>
Meanwhile on every side around the plain,<br/>
Dispersed, disorder'd, fly the Trojan train.<br/>
So flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay'd<br/>
The lion's roaring through the midnight shade;<br/>
On heaps they tumble with successless haste;<br/>
The savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.<br/>
Not with less fury stern Atrides flew,<br/>
Still press'd the rout, and still the hindmost slew;<br/>
Hurl'd from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill'd,<br/>
And rage, and death, and carnage load the field.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall;<br/>
Surveys the towers, and meditates their fall.<br/>
But Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,<br/>
And down their summits pour'd a hundred rills:<br/>
The unkindled lightning in his hand he took,<br/>
And thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Iris, with haste thy golden wings display,<br/>
To godlike Hector this our word convey—<br/>
While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,<br/>
Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,<br/>
Bid him give way; but issue forth commands,<br/>
And trust the war to less important hands:<br/>
But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,<br/>
That chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,<br/>
Then Jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,<br/>
Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press'd,<br/>
Till to the main the burning sun descend,<br/>
And sacred night her awful shade extend."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and Iris at his word obey'd;<br/>
On wings of winds descends the various maid.<br/>
The chief she found amidst the ranks of war,<br/>
Close to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.<br/>
The goddess then: "O son of Priam, hear!<br/>
From Jove I come, and his high mandate bear.<br/>
While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,<br/>
Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,<br/>
Abstain from fight; yet issue forth commands,<br/>
And trust the war to less important hands:<br/>
But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,<br/>
The chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,<br/>
Then Jove shall string thy arm, and fire thy breast,<br/>
Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press'd,<br/>
Till to the main the burning sun descend,<br/>
And sacred night her awful shade extend."<br/>
</p>
<p>
She said, and vanish'd. Hector, with a bound,<br/>
Springs from his chariot on the trembling ground,<br/>
In clanging arms: he grasps in either hand<br/>
A pointed lance, and speeds from band to band;<br/>
Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,<br/>
And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.<br/>
They stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dare,<br/>
Condense their powers, and wait the coming war.<br/>
New force, new spirit, to each breast returns;<br/>
The fight renew'd with fiercer fury burns:<br/>
The king leads on: all fix on him their eye,<br/>
And learn from him to conquer, or to die.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ye sacred nine! celestial Muses! tell,<br/>
Who faced him first, and by his prowess fell?<br/>
The great Iphidamas, the bold and young,<br/>
From sage Antenor and Theano sprung;<br/>
Whom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred,<br/>
And nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed.<br/>
Scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,<br/>
And early honour warm his generous breast,<br/>
When the kind sire consign'd his daughter's charms<br/>
(Theano's sister) to his youthful arms.<br/>
But call'd by glory to the wars of Troy,<br/>
He leaves untasted the first fruits of joy;<br/>
From his loved bride departs with melting eyes,<br/>
And swift to aid his dearer country flies.<br/>
With twelve black ships he reach'd Percope's strand,<br/>
Thence took the long laborious march by land.<br/>
Now fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,<br/>
Towering in arms, and braves the king of kings.<br/>
Atrides first discharged the missive spear;<br/>
The Trojan stoop'd, the javelin pass'd in air.<br/>
Then near the corslet, at the monarch's heart,<br/>
With all his strength, the youth directs his dart:<br/>
But the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,<br/>
The point rebated, and repell'd the wound.<br/>
Encumber'd with the dart, Atrides stands,<br/>
Till, grasp'd with force, he wrench'd it from his hands;<br/>
At once his weighty sword discharged a wound<br/>
Full on his neck, that fell'd him to the ground.<br/>
Stretch'd in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,<br/>
And sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.<br/>
Oh worthy better fate! oh early slain!<br/>
Thy country's friend; and virtuous, though in vain!<br/>
No more the youth shall join his consort's side,<br/>
At once a virgin, and at once a bride!<br/>
No more with presents her embraces meet,<br/>
Or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,<br/>
On whom his passion, lavish of his store,<br/>
Bestow'd so much, and vainly promised more!<br/>
Unwept, uncover'd, on the plain he lay,<br/>
While the proud victor bore his arms away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Coon, Antenor's eldest hope, was nigh:<br/>
Tears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,<br/>
While pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view'd,<br/>
And the pale features now deform'd with blood.<br/>
Then, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,<br/>
Aim'd at the king, and near his elbow strook.<br/>
The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,<br/>
And through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.<br/>
Surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear<br/>
On Coon rushes with his lifted spear:<br/>
His brother's corpse the pious Trojan draws,<br/>
And calls his country to assert his cause;<br/>
Defends him breathless on the sanguine field,<br/>
And o'er the body spreads his ample shield.<br/>
Atrides, marking an unguarded part,<br/>
Transfix'd the warrior with his brazen dart;<br/>
Prone on his brother's bleeding breast he lay,<br/>
The monarch's falchion lopp'd his head away:<br/>
The social shades the same dark journey go,<br/>
And join each other in the realms below.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The vengeful victor rages round the fields,<br/>
With every weapon art or fury yields:<br/>
By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,<br/>
Whole ranks are broken, and whole troops o'erthrown.<br/>
This, while yet warm distill'd the purple flood;<br/>
But when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,<br/>
Then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,<br/>
Less keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:<br/>
(The powers that cause the teeming matron's throes,<br/>
Sad mothers of unutterable woes!)<br/>
Stung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,<br/>
He mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;<br/>
Then with a voice which fury made more strong,<br/>
And pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O friends! O Greeks! assert your honours won;<br/>
Proceed, and finish what this arm begun:<br/>
Lo! angry Jove forbids your chief to stay,<br/>
And envies half the glories of the day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;<br/>
The horses fly; the chariot smokes along.<br/>
Clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow,<br/>
And from their sides the foam descends in snow;<br/>
Shot through the battle in a moment's space,<br/>
The wounded monarch at his tent they place.<br/>
</p>
<p>
No sooner Hector saw the king retired,<br/>
But thus his Trojans and his aids he fired:<br/>
"Hear, all ye Dardan, all ye Lycian race!<br/>
Famed in close fight, and dreadful face to face:<br/>
Now call to mind your ancient trophies won,<br/>
Your great forefathers' virtues, and your own.<br/>
Behold, the general flies! deserts his powers!<br/>
Lo, Jove himself declares the conquest ours!<br/>
Now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds;<br/>
And, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With words like these the fiery chief alarms<br/>
His fainting host, and every bosom warms.<br/>
As the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear<br/>
The brindled lion, or the tusky bear:<br/>
With voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,<br/>
And springs the foremost with his lifted dart:<br/>
So godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare;<br/>
Nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.<br/>
On the black body of the foe he pours;<br/>
As from the cloud's deep bosom, swell'd with showers,<br/>
A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,<br/>
Drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.<br/>
Say, Muse! when Jove the Trojan's glory crown'd,<br/>
Beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?<br/>
Assaeus, Dolops, and Autonous died,<br/>
Opites next was added to their side;<br/>
Then brave Hipponous, famed in many a fight,<br/>
Opheltius, Orus, sunk to endless night;<br/>
Æsymnus, Agelaus; all chiefs of name;<br/>
The rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.<br/>
As when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,<br/>
Dispels the gather'd clouds that Notus forms:<br/>
The gust continued, violent and strong,<br/>
Rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along;<br/>
Now to the skies the foaming billows rears,<br/>
Now breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:<br/>
Thus, raging Hector, with resistless hands,<br/>
O'erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.<br/>
Now the last ruin the whole host appals;<br/>
Now Greece had trembled in her wooden walls;<br/>
But wise Ulysses call'd Tydides forth,<br/>
His soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.<br/>
"And stand we deedless, O eternal shame!<br/>
Till Hector's arm involve the ships in flame?<br/>
Haste, let us join, and combat side by side."<br/>
The warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"No martial toil I shun, no danger fear;<br/>
Let Hector come; I wait his fury here.<br/>
But Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:<br/>
And, Jove our foe, all human force is vain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He sigh'd; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,<br/>
And from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell:<br/>
Molion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,<br/>
His death ennobled by Ulysses' sword.<br/>
There slain, they left them in eternal night,<br/>
Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.<br/>
So two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,<br/>
Then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.<br/>
Stern Hector's conquests in the middle plain<br/>
Stood check'd awhile, and Greece respired again.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The sons of Merops shone amidst the war;<br/>
Towering they rode in one refulgent car:<br/>
In deep prophetic arts their father skill'd,<br/>
Had warn'd his children from the Trojan field.<br/>
Fate urged them on: the father warn'd in vain;<br/>
They rush'd to fight, and perish'd on the plain;<br/>
Their breasts no more the vital spirit warms;<br/>
The stern Tydides strips their shining arms.<br/>
Hypirochus by great Ulysses dies,<br/>
And rich Hippodamus becomes his prize.<br/>
Great Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight,<br/>
And level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.<br/>
By Tydeus' lance Agastrophus was slain,<br/>
The far-famed hero of Paeonian strain;<br/>
Wing'd with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,<br/>
His steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh:<br/>
Through broken orders, swifter than the wind,<br/>
He fled, but flying left his life behind.<br/>
This Hector sees, as his experienced eyes<br/>
Traverse the files, and to the rescue flies;<br/>
Shouts, as he pass'd, the crystal regions rend,<br/>
And moving armies on his march attend.<br/>
Great Diomed himself was seized with fear,<br/>
And thus bespoke his brother of the war:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!<br/>
The storm rolls on, and Hector rules the field:<br/>
Here stand his utmost force."—The warrior said;<br/>
Swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled;<br/>
Nor miss'd its aim, but where the plumage danced<br/>
Razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.<br/>
Safe in his helm (the gift of Phoebus' hands)<br/>
Without a wound the Trojan hero stands;<br/>
But yet so stunn'd, that, staggering on the plain.<br/>
His arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain;<br/>
O'er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,<br/>
And a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.<br/>
Tydides followed to regain his lance;<br/>
While Hector rose, recover'd from the trance,<br/>
Remounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:<br/>
The Greek pursues him, and exults aloud:<br/>
"Once more thank Phoebus for thy forfeit breath,<br/>
Or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.<br/>
Well by Apollo are thy prayers repaid,<br/>
And oft that partial power has lent his aid.<br/>
Thou shall not long the death deserved withstand,<br/>
If any god assist Tydides' hand.<br/>
Fly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day,<br/>
Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay,"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Him, while he triumph'd, Paris eyed from far,<br/>
(The spouse of Helen, the fair cause of war;)<br/>
Around the fields his feather'd shafts he sent,<br/>
From ancient Ilus' ruin'd monument:<br/>
Behind the column placed, he bent his bow,<br/>
And wing'd an arrow at the unwary foe;<br/>
Just as he stoop'd, Agastrophus's crest<br/>
To seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,<br/>
The bowstring twang'd; nor flew the shaft in vain,<br/>
But pierced his foot, and nail'd it to the plain.<br/>
The laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring.<br/>
Leaps from his ambush, and insults the king.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"He bleeds! (he cries) some god has sped my dart!<br/>
Would the same god had fix'd it in his heart!<br/>
So Troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,<br/>
Should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:<br/>
Whose sons now tremble at his darted spear,<br/>
As scatter'd lambs the rushing lion fear."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He dauntless thus: "Thou conqueror of the fair,<br/>
Thou woman-warrior with the curling hair;<br/>
Vain archer! trusting to the distant dart,<br/>
Unskill'd in arms to act a manly part!<br/>
Thou hast but done what boys or women can;<br/>
Such hands may wound, but not incense a man.<br/>
Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,<br/>
A coward's weapon never hurts the brave.<br/>
Not so this dart, which thou may'st one day feel;<br/>
Fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel:<br/>
Where this but lights, some noble life expires;<br/>
Its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,<br/>
Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,<br/>
And leaves such objects as distract the fair."<br/>
Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,<br/>
Before him steps, and bending draws the dart:<br/>
Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;<br/>
Tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now on the field Ulysses stands alone,<br/>
The Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on;<br/>
But stands collected in himself, and whole,<br/>
And questions thus his own unconquer'd soul:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What further subterfuge, what hopes remain?<br/>
What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?<br/>
What danger, singly if I stand the ground,<br/>
My friends all scatter'd, all the foes around?<br/>
Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,<br/>
The brave meets danger, and the coward flies.<br/>
To die or conquer, proves a hero's heart;<br/>
And, knowing this, I know a soldier's part."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,<br/>
Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd;<br/>
These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;<br/>
And round him deep the steely circle grows.<br/>
So fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds<br/>
Of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;<br/>
He grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;<br/>
His sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;<br/>
By these, by those, on every part is plied;<br/>
And the red slaughter spreads on every side.<br/>
Pierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;<br/>
Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;<br/>
Chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,<br/>
Falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.<br/>
Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near;<br/>
Ulysses reach'd him with the fatal spear;<br/>
But to his aid his brother Socus flies,<br/>
Socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.<br/>
Near as he drew, the warrior thus began:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O great Ulysses! much-enduring man!<br/>
Not deeper skill'd in every martial sleight,<br/>
Than worn to toils, and active in the fight!<br/>
This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,<br/>
And end at once the great Hippasian race,<br/>
Or thou beneath this lance must press the field."<br/>
He said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:<br/>
Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,<br/>
Plough'd half his side, and bared it to the bone.<br/>
By Pallas' care, the spear, though deep infix'd,<br/>
Stopp'd short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,<br/>
Then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):<br/>
"Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,<br/>
Fate calls thee hence and finish'd is thy race.<br/>
Nor longer check my conquests on the foe;<br/>
But, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,<br/>
And add one spectre to the realms below!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,<br/>
Trembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight;<br/>
Between his shoulders pierced the following dart,<br/>
And held its passage through the panting heart:<br/>
Wide in his breast appear'd the grisly wound;<br/>
He falls; his armour rings against the ground.<br/>
Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:<br/>
"Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;<br/>
There ends thy narrow span assign'd by fate,<br/>
Heaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.<br/>
Ah, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;<br/>
Thy dying eyes no tender mother close;<br/>
But hungry birds shall tear those balls away,<br/>
And hovering vultures scream around their prey.<br/>
Me Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,<br/>
With solemn funerals and a lasting tomb."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then raging with intolerable smart,<br/>
He writhes his body, and extracts the dart.<br/>
The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,<br/>
And gladden'd Troy with sight of hostile blood.<br/>
Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,<br/>
Forced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.<br/>
Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;<br/>
The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:<br/>
Alarm'd, to Ajax Telamon he cried,<br/>
Who shares his labours, and defends his side:<br/>
"O friend! Ulysses' shouts invade my ear;<br/>
Distressed he seems, and no assistance near;<br/>
Strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,<br/>
Oppress'd by multitudes, the best may fall.<br/>
Greece robb'd of him must bid her host despair,<br/>
And feel a loss not ages can repair."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, where the cry directs, his course he bends;<br/>
Great Ajax, like the god of war, attends,<br/>
The prudent chief in sore distress they found,<br/>
With bands of furious Trojans compass'd round.<br/>
As when some huntsman, with a flying spear,<br/>
From the blind thicket wounds a stately deer;<br/>
Down his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,<br/>
He bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,<br/>
Till life's warm vapour issuing through the wound,<br/>
Wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:<br/>
Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,<br/>
The lion rushes through the woodland shade,<br/>
The wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;<br/>
The lordly savage vindicates his prey.<br/>
Ulysses thus, unconquer'd by his pains,<br/>
A single warrior half a host sustains:<br/>
But soon as Ajax leaves his tower-like shield,<br/>
The scattered crowds fly frighted o'er the field;<br/>
Atrides' arm the sinking hero stays,<br/>
And, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew;<br/>
And first Doryclus, Priam's son, he slew,<br/>
On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,<br/>
And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.<br/>
As when a torrent, swell'd with wintry rains,<br/>
Pours from the mountains o'er the deluged plains,<br/>
And pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,<br/>
A country's ruins! to the seas are borne:<br/>
Fierce Ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng;<br/>
Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,<br/>
Raged on the left, and ruled the tide of war:<br/>
Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,<br/>
And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.<br/>
There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose<br/>
The warrior's fury; there the battle glows;<br/>
There fierce on foot, or from the chariot's height,<br/>
His sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.<br/>
The spouse of Helen, dealing darts around,<br/>
Had pierced Machaon with a distant wound:<br/>
In his right shoulder the broad shaft appear'd,<br/>
And trembling Greece for her physician fear'd.<br/>
To Nestor then Idomeneus begun:<br/>
"Glory of Greece, old Neleus' valiant son!<br/>
Ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away,<br/>
And great Machaon to the ships convey;<br/>
A wise physician skill'd our wounds to heal,<br/>
Is more than armies to the public weal."<br/>
Old Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode<br/>
The wounded offspring of the healing god.<br/>
He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet<br/>
Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But now Cebriones, from Hector's car,<br/>
Survey'd the various fortune of the war:<br/>
"While here (he cried) the flying Greeks are slain,<br/>
Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.<br/>
Before great Ajax see the mingled throng<br/>
Of men and chariots driven in heaps along!<br/>
I know him well, distinguish'd o'er the field<br/>
By the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.<br/>
Thither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds,<br/>
There danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;<br/>
There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,<br/>
And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus having spoke, the driver's lash resounds;<br/>
Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;<br/>
Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,<br/>
O'er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.<br/>
The horses' hoofs are bathed in heroes' gore,<br/>
And, dashing, purple all the car before;<br/>
The groaning axle sable drops distils,<br/>
And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.<br/>
Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,<br/>
Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:<br/>
(By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,<br/>
The ranks he scatter'd and the troops o'erthrown:)<br/>
Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,<br/>
And fears that arm whose force he felt so late.<br/>
But partial Jove, espousing Hector's part,<br/>
Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart;<br/>
Confused, unnerved in Hector's presence grown,<br/>
Amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.<br/>
O'er his broad back his moony shield he threw,<br/>
And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.<br/>
Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,<br/>
Beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;<br/>
Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,<br/>
Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,<br/>
Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;<br/>
Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires:<br/>
So turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd,<br/>
While his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,<br/>
In some wide field by troops of boys pursued,<br/>
Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,<br/>
Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;<br/>
Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,<br/>
The patient animal maintains his ground,<br/>
Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,<br/>
And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:<br/>
On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,<br/>
The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;<br/>
Confiding now in bulky strength he stands,<br/>
Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;<br/>
Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,<br/>
And threats his followers with retorted eye.<br/>
Fix'd as the bar between two warring powers,<br/>
While hissing darts descend in iron showers:<br/>
In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,<br/>
Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;<br/>
And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,<br/>
Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.<br/>
But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,<br/>
And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;<br/>
Whose eager javelin launch'd against the foe,<br/>
Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow;<br/>
From his torn liver the red current flow'd,<br/>
And his slack knees desert their dying load.<br/>
The victor rushing to despoil the dead,<br/>
From Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled;<br/>
Fix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,<br/>
Fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.<br/>
Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired,<br/>
Yet thus retreating, his associates fired:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?<br/>
Oh, turn to arms; 'tis Ajax claims your aid.<br/>
This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,<br/>
And this the last brave battle he shall wage:<br/>
Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave<br/>
The warrior rescue, and your country save."<br/>
Thus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,<br/>
Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,<br/>
To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand<br/>
With pious care, great Ajax joins the band:<br/>
Each takes new courage at the hero's sight;<br/>
The hero rallies, and renews the fight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,<br/>
While Nestor's chariot far from fight retires:<br/>
His coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore,<br/>
The Greeks' preserver, great Machaon, bore.<br/>
That hour Achilles, from the topmost height<br/>
Of his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight;<br/>
His feasted eyes beheld around the plain<br/>
The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.<br/>
His friend Machaon singled from the rest,<br/>
A transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast.<br/>
Straight to Menoetius' much-loved son he sent:<br/>
Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;<br/>
In evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,<br/>
And fix'd the date of all his woes to come.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;<br/>
Whate'er thy will, Patroclus shall obey."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)<br/>
Still at my heart, and ever at my side!<br/>
The time is come, when yon despairing host<br/>
Shall learn the value of the man they lost:<br/>
Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,<br/>
And proud Atrides tremble on his throne.<br/>
Go now to Nestor, and from him be taught<br/>
What wounded warrior late his chariot brought:<br/>
For, seen at distance, and but seen behind,<br/>
His form recall'd Machaon to my mind;<br/>
Nor could I, through yon cloud, discern his face,<br/>
The coursers pass'd me with so swift a pace."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The hero said. His friend obey'd with haste,<br/>
Through intermingled ships and tents he pass'd;<br/>
The chiefs descending from their car he found:<br/>
The panting steeds Eurymedon unbound.<br/>
The warriors standing on the breezy shore,<br/>
To dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,<br/>
Here paused a moment, while the gentle gale<br/>
Convey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale;<br/>
Then to consult on farther methods went,<br/>
And took their seats beneath the shady tent.<br/>
The draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,<br/>
Arsinous' daughter, graced with golden hairs:<br/>
(Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,<br/>
Greece, as the prize of Nestor's wisdom gave:)<br/>
A table first with azure feet she placed;<br/>
Whose ample orb a brazen charger graced;<br/>
Honey new-press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,<br/>
And wholesome garlic, crown'd the savoury treat,<br/>
Next her white hand an antique goblet brings,<br/>
A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings<br/>
From eldest times: emboss'd with studs of gold,<br/>
Two feet support it, and four handles hold;<br/>
On each bright handle, bending o'er the brink,<br/>
In sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:<br/>
A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,<br/>
When the brisk nectar overlook'd the brim.<br/>
Temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine<br/>
Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;<br/>
With goat's-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,<br/>
And last with flour the smiling surface strows:<br/>
This for the wounded prince the dame prepares:<br/>
The cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares:<br/>
Salubrious draughts the warriors' thirst allay,<br/>
And pleasing conference beguiles the day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent,<br/>
Unheard approached, and stood before the tent.<br/>
Old Nestor, rising then, the hero led<br/>
To his high seat: the chief refused and said:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"'Tis now no season for these kind delays;<br/>
The great Achilles with impatience stays.<br/>
To great Achilles this respect I owe;<br/>
Who asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,<br/>
Was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?<br/>
With grief I see the great Machaon bleeds.<br/>
This to report, my hasty course I bend;<br/>
Thou know'st the fiery temper of my friend."<br/>
"Can then the sons of Greece (the sage rejoin'd)<br/>
Excite compassion in Achilles' mind?<br/>
Seeks he the sorrows of our host to know?<br/>
This is not half the story of our woe.<br/>
Tell him, not great Machaon bleeds alone,<br/>
Our bravest heroes in the navy groan,<br/>
Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed,<br/>
And stern Eurypylus, already bleed.<br/>
But, ah! what flattering hopes I entertain!<br/>
Achilles heeds not, but derides our pain:<br/>
Even till the flames consume our fleet he stays,<br/>
And waits the rising of the fatal blaze.<br/>
Chief after chief the raging foe destroys;<br/>
Calm he looks on, and every death enjoys.<br/>
Now the slow course of all-impairing time<br/>
Unstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;<br/>
Oh! had I still that strength my youth possess'd,<br/>
When this bold arm the Epeian powers oppress'd,<br/>
The bulls of Elis in glad triumph led,<br/>
And stretch'd the great Itymonaeus dead!<br/>
Then from my fury fled the trembling swains,<br/>
And ours was all the plunder of the plains:<br/>
Fifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,<br/>
As many goats, as many lowing kine:<br/>
And thrice the number of unrivall'd steeds,<br/>
All teeming females, and of generous breeds.<br/>
These, as my first essay of arms, I won;<br/>
Old Neleus gloried in his conquering son.<br/>
Thus Elis forced, her long arrears restored,<br/>
And shares were parted to each Pylian lord.<br/>
The state of Pyle was sunk to last despair,<br/>
When the proud Elians first commenced the war:<br/>
For Neleus' sons Alcides' rage had slain;<br/>
Of twelve bold brothers, I alone remain!<br/>
Oppress'd, we arm'd; and now this conquest gain'd,<br/>
My sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain'd.<br/>
(That large reprisal he might justly claim,<br/>
For prize defrauded, and insulted fame,<br/>
When Elis' monarch, at the public course,<br/>
Detain'd his chariot, and victorious horse.)<br/>
The rest the people shared; myself survey'd<br/>
The just partition, and due victims paid.<br/>
Three days were past, when Elis rose to war,<br/>
With many a courser, and with many a car;<br/>
The sons of Actor at their army's head<br/>
(Young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.<br/>
High on the rock fair Thryoessa stands,<br/>
Our utmost frontier on the Pylian lands:<br/>
Not far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow:<br/>
The stream they pass'd, and pitch'd their tents below.<br/>
Pallas, descending in the shades of night,<br/>
Alarms the Pylians and commands the fight.<br/>
Each burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,<br/>
Myself the foremost; but my sire denied;<br/>
Fear'd for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;<br/>
And stopp'd my chariot, and detain'd my arms.<br/>
My sire denied in vain: on foot I fled<br/>
Amidst our chariots; for the goddess led.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Along fair Arene's delightful plain<br/>
Soft Minyas rolls his waters to the main:<br/>
There, horse and foot, the Pylian troops unite,<br/>
And sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.<br/>
Thence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,<br/>
To great Alphaeus' sacred source we came.<br/>
There first to Jove our solemn rites were paid;<br/>
An untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid;<br/>
A bull, Alphaeus; and a bull was slain<br/>
To the blue monarch of the watery main.<br/>
In arms we slept, beside the winding flood,<br/>
While round the town the fierce Epeians stood.<br/>
Soon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,<br/>
Flamed in the front of Heaven, and gave the day.<br/>
Bright scenes of arms, and works of war appear;<br/>
The nations meet; there Pylos, Elis here.<br/>
The first who fell, beneath my javelin bled;<br/>
King Augias' son, and spouse of Agamede:<br/>
(She that all simples' healing virtues knew,<br/>
And every herb that drinks the morning dew:)<br/>
I seized his car, the van of battle led;<br/>
The Epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.<br/>
The foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill'd,<br/>
Fierce as the whirlwind now I swept the field:<br/>
Full fifty captive chariots graced my train;<br/>
Two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.<br/>
Then Actor's sons had died, but Neptune shrouds<br/>
The youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.<br/>
O'er heapy shields, and o'er the prostrate throng,<br/>
Collecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,<br/>
Through wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes,<br/>
Where o'er the vales the Olenian rocks arose;<br/>
Till Pallas stopp'd us where Alisium flows.<br/>
Even there the hindmost of the rear I slay,<br/>
And the same arm that led concludes the day;<br/>
Then back to Pyle triumphant take my way.<br/>
There to high Jove were public thanks assign'd,<br/>
As first of gods; to Nestor, of mankind.<br/>
Such then I was, impell'd by youthful blood;<br/>
So proved my valour for my country's good.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Achilles with unactive fury glows,<br/>
And gives to passion what to Greece he owes.<br/>
How shall he grieve, when to the eternal shade<br/>
Her hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!<br/>
O friend! my memory recalls the day,<br/>
When, gathering aids along the Grecian sea,<br/>
I, and Ulysses, touch'd at Phthia's port,<br/>
And entered Peleus' hospitable court.<br/>
A bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice,<br/>
And pour'd libations on the flaming thighs.<br/>
Thyself, Achilles, and thy reverend sire<br/>
Menoetius, turn'd the fragments on the fire.<br/>
Achilles sees us, to the feast invites;<br/>
Social we sit, and share the genial rites.<br/>
We then explained the cause on which we came,<br/>
Urged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.<br/>
Your ancient fathers generous precepts gave;<br/>
Peleus said only this:—‘My son! be brave.'<br/>
Menoetius thus: ‘Though great Achilles shine<br/>
In strength superior, and of race divine,<br/>
Yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;<br/>
Let thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.'<br/>
Thus spoke your father at Thessalia's court:<br/>
Words now forgot, though now of vast import.<br/>
Ah! try the utmost that a friend can say:<br/>
Such gentle force the fiercest minds obey;<br/>
Some favouring god Achilles' heart may move;<br/>
Though deaf to glory, he may yield to love.<br/>
If some dire oracle his breast alarm,<br/>
If aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm,<br/>
Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,<br/>
If thou but lead the Myrmidonian line;<br/>
Clad in Achilles' arms, if thou appear,<br/>
Proud Troy may tremble, and desist from war;<br/>
Press'd by fresh forces, her o'er-labour'd train<br/>
Shall seek their walls, and Greece respire again."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This touch'd his generous heart, and from the tent<br/>
Along the shore with hasty strides he went;<br/>
Soon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,<br/>
The public mart and courts of justice stand,<br/>
Where the tall fleet of great Ulysses lies,<br/>
And altars to the guardian gods arise;<br/>
There, sad, he met the brave Euaemon's son,<br/>
Large painful drops from all his members run;<br/>
An arrow's head yet rooted in his wound,<br/>
The sable blood in circles mark'd the ground.<br/>
As faintly reeling he confess'd the smart,<br/>
Weak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.<br/>
Divine compassion touch'd Patroclus' breast,<br/>
Who, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ah, hapless leaders of the Grecian host!<br/>
Thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?<br/>
Is this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,<br/>
Far from your friends, and from your native shore?<br/>
Say, great Eurypylus! shall Greece yet stand?<br/>
Resists she yet the raging Hector's hand?<br/>
Or are her heroes doom'd to die with shame,<br/>
And this the period of our wars and fame?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Eurypylus replies: "No more, my friend;<br/>
Greece is no more! this day her glories end;<br/>
Even to the ships victorious Troy pursues,<br/>
Her force increasing as her toil renews.<br/>
Those chiefs, that used her utmost rage to meet,<br/>
Lie pierced with wounds, and bleeding in the fleet.<br/>
But, thou, Patroclus! act a friendly part,<br/>
Lead to my ships, and draw this deadly dart;<br/>
With lukewarm water wash the gore away;<br/>
With healing balms the raging smart allay,<br/>
Such as sage Chiron, sire of pharmacy,<br/>
Once taught Achilles, and Achilles thee.<br/>
Of two famed surgeons, Podalirius stands<br/>
This hour surrounded by the Trojan bands;<br/>
And great Machaon, wounded in his tent,<br/>
Now wants that succour which so oft he lent."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To him the chief: "What then remains to do?<br/>
The event of things the gods alone can view.<br/>
Charged by Achilles' great command I fly,<br/>
And bear with haste the Pylian king's reply:<br/>
But thy distress this instant claims relief."<br/>
He said, and in his arms upheld the chief.<br/>
The slaves their master's slow approach survey'd,<br/>
And hides of oxen on the floor display'd:<br/>
There stretch'd at length the wounded hero lay;<br/>
Patroclus cut the forky steel away:<br/>
Then in his hands a bitter root he bruised;<br/>
The wound he wash'd, the styptic juice infused.<br/>
The closing flesh that instant ceased to glow,<br/>
The wound to torture, and the blood to flow.<br/>

<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XV</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Now had Minerva reach'd those ample plains,<br/>
Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns:<br/>
Anxious she flies to great Ulysses' heir,<br/>
His instant voyage challenged all her care.<br/>
Beneath the royal portico display'd,<br/>
With Nestor's son Telemachus was laid:<br/>
In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies;<br/>
Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal'd his eyes:<br/>
Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress'd,<br/>
And all thy fortunes roll'd within his breast.<br/>
When, "O Telemachus! (the goddess said)<br/>
Too long in vain, too widely hast thou stray'd,<br/>
Thus leaving careless thy paternal right<br/>
The robbers' prize, the prey to lawless might.<br/>
On fond pursuits neglectful while you roam,<br/>
E'en now the hand of rapine sacks the dome.<br/>
Hence to Atrides; and his leave implore<br/>
To launch thy vessel for thy natal shore;<br/>
Fly, whilst thy mother virtuous yet withstands<br/>
Her kindred's wishes, and her sire's commands;<br/>
Through both, Eurymachus pursues the dame,<br/>
And with the noblest gifts asserts his claim.<br/>
Hence, therefore, while thy stores thy own remain;<br/>
Thou know'st the practice of the female train,<br/>
Lost in the children of the present spouse,<br/>
They slight the pledges of their former vows;<br/>
Their love is always with the lover past;<br/>
Still the succeeding flame expels the last.<br/>
Let o'er thy house some chosen maid preside,<br/>
Till Heaven decrees to bless thee in a bride.<br/>
But now thy more attentive ears incline,<br/>
Observe the warnings of a power divine;<br/>
For thee their snares the suitor lords shall lay<br/>
In Samos' sands, or straits of Ithaca;<br/>
To seize thy life shall lurk the murderous band,<br/>
Ere yet thy footsteps press thy native land.<br/>
No!&mdash;sooner far their riot and their lust<br/>
All-covering earth shall bury deep in dust!<br/>
Then distant from the scatter'd islands steer,<br/>
Nor let the night retard thy full career;<br/>
Thy heavenly guardian shall instruct the gales<br/>
To smooth thy passage and supply thy sails:<br/>
And when at Ithaca thy labour ends,<br/>
Send to the town the vessel with thy friends;<br/>
But seek thou first the master of the swine<br/>
(For still to thee his loyal thoughts incline);<br/>
There pass the night: while he his course pursues<br/>
To bring Penelope the wish'd-for news,<br/>
That thou, safe sailing from the Pylian strand,<br/>
Art come to bless her in thy native land."<br/>
Thus spoke the goddess, and resumed her flight<br/>
To the pure regions of eternal light,<br/>
Meanwhile Pisistratus he gently shakes,<br/>
And with these words the slumbering youth awakes:
</p>
<p>
"Rise, son of Nestor; for the road prepare,<br/>
And join the harness'd coursers to the car."
</p>
<p>
"What cause (he cried) can justify our flight<br/>
To tempt the dangers of forbidding night?<br/>
Here wait we rather, till approaching day<br/>
Shall prompt our speed, and point the ready way.<br/>
Nor think of flight before the Spartan king<br/>
Shall bid farewell, and bounteous presents bring;<br/>
Gifts, which to distant ages safely stored,<br/>
The sacred act of friendship shall record."
</p>
<p>
Thus he. But when the dawn bestreak'd the east,<br/>
The king from Helen rose, and sought his guest.<br/>
As soon as his approach the hero knew,<br/>
The splendid mantle round him first he threw,<br/>
Then o'er his ample shoulders whirl'd the cloak,<br/>
Respectful met the monarch, and bespoke:
</p>
<p>
"Hail, great Atrides, favour'd of high Jove!<br/>
Let not thy friends in vain for licence move.<br/>
Swift let us measure back the watery way,<br/>
Nor check our speed, impatient of delay."
</p>
<p>
"If with desire so strong thy bosom glows,<br/>
Ill (said the king) should I thy wish oppose;<br/>
For oft in others freely I reprove<br/>
The ill-timed efforts of officious love;<br/>
Who love too much, hate in the like extreme,<br/>
And both the golden mean alike condemn.<br/>
Alike he thwarts the hospitable end,<br/>
Who drives the free, or stays the hasty friend:<br/>
True friendship's laws are by this rule express'd,<br/>
Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.<br/>
Yet, stay, my friends, and in your chariot take<br/>
The noblest presents that our love can make;<br/>
Meantime commit we to our women's care<br/>
Some choice domestic viands to prepare;<br/>
The traveller, rising from the banquet gay,<br/>
Eludes the labours of the tedious way,<br/>
Then if a wider course shall rather please,<br/>
Through spacious Argos and the realms of Greece,<br/>
Atrides in his chariot shall attend;<br/>
Himself thy convoy to each royal friend.<br/>
No prince will let Ulysses' heir remove<br/>
Without some pledge, some monument of love:<br/>
These will the caldron, these the tripod give;<br/>
From those the well-pair'd mules we shall receive,<br/>
Or bowl emboss'd whose golden figures live."
</p>
<p>
To whom the youth, for prudence famed, replied:<br/>
"O monarch, care of heaven! thy people's pride!<br/>
No friend in Ithaca my place supplies,<br/>
No powerful hands are there, no watchful eyes:<br/>
My stores exposed and fenceless house demand<br/>
The speediest succour from my guardian hand;<br/>
Lest, in a search too anxious and too vain,<br/>
Of one lost joy, I lose what yet remain."
</p>
<p>
His purpose when the generous warrior heard,<br/>
He charged the household cates to be prepared.<br/>
Now with the dawn, from his adjoining home,<br/>
Was Boethoedes Eteoneus come;<br/>
Swift at the word he forms the rising blaze,<br/>
And o'er the coals the smoking fragments lays.<br/>
Meantime the king, his son, and Helen went<br/>
Where the rich wardrobe breathed a costly scent;<br/>
The king selected from the glittering rows<br/>
A bowl; the prince a silver beaker chose.<br/>
The beauteous queen revolved with careful eyes<br/>
Her various textures of unnumber'd dyes,<br/>
And chose the largest; with no vulgar art<br/>
Her own fair hands embroider'd every part;<br/>
Beneath the rest it lay divinely bright,<br/>
Like radiant Hesper o'er the gems of night,<br/>
Then with each gift they hasten'd to their guest,<br/>
And thus the king Ulysses' heir address'd:<br/>
"Since fix'd are thy resolves, may thundering Jove<br/>
With happiest omens thy desires approve!<br/>
This silver bowl, whose costly margins shine<br/>
Enchased with gold, this valued gift be thine;<br/>
To me this present, of Vulcanian frame,<br/>
From Sidon's hospitable monarch came;<br/>
To thee we now consign the precious load,<br/>
The pride of kings, and labour of a god."
</p>
<p>
Then gave the cup, while Megapenthe brought<br/>
The silver vase with living sculpture wrought.<br/>
The beauteous queen, advancing next, display'd<br/>
The shining veil, and thus endearing said:
</p>
<p>
"Accept, dear youth, this monument of love,<br/>
Long since, in better days, by Helen wove:<br/>
Safe in thy mother's care the vesture lay,<br/>
To deck thy bride and grace thy nuptial day.<br/>
Meantime may'st thou with happiest speed regain<br/>
Thy stately palace, and thy wide domain."
</p>
<p>
She said, and gave the veil; with grateful look<br/>
The prince the variegated present took.<br/>
And now, when through the royal dome they pass'd,<br/>
High on a throne the king each stranger placed.<br/>
A golden ewer the attendant damsel brings,<br/>
Replete with water from the crystal springs;<br/>
With copious streams the shining vase supplies<br/>
A silver layer of capacious size.<br/>
They wash. The tables in fair order spread,<br/>
The glittering canisters are crown'd with bread;<br/>
Viands of various kinds allure the taste,<br/>
Of choicest sort and savour; rich repast!<br/>
Whilst Eteoneus portions out the shares<br/>
Atrides' son the purple draught prepares,<br/>
And now (each sated with the genial feast,<br/>
And the short rage of thirst and hunger ceased)<br/>
Ulysses' son, with his illustrious friend,<br/>
The horses join, the polish'd car ascend,<br/>
Along the court the fiery steeds rebound,<br/>
And the wide portal echoes to the sound.<br/>
The king precedes; a bowl with fragrant wine<br/>
(Libation destined to the powers divine)<br/>
His right hand held: before the steed he stands,<br/>
Then, mix'd with prayers, he utters these commands:
</p>
<p>
"Farewell, and prosper, youths! let Nestor know<br/>
What grateful thoughts still in this bosom glow,<br/>
For all the proofs of his paternal care,<br/>
Through the long dangers of the ten years' war."<br/>
"Ah! doubt not our report (the prince rejoin'd)<br/>
Of all the virtues of thy generous mind.<br/>
And oh! return'd might we Ulysses meet!<br/>
To him thy presents show, thy words repeat:<br/>
How will each speech his grateful wonder raise!<br/>
How will each gift indulge us in thy praise!"
</p>
<p>
Scarce ended thus the prince, when on the right<br/>
Advanced the bird of Jove: auspicious sight!<br/>
A milk-white fowl his clinching talons bore,<br/>
With care domestic pampered at the floor.<br/>
Peasants in vain with threatening cries pursue,<br/>
In solemn speed the bird majestic flew<br/>
Full dexter to the car; the prosperous sight<br/>
Fill'd every breast with wonder and delight.
</p>
<p>
But Nestor's son the cheerful silence broke,<br/>
And in these words the Spartan chief bespoke:<br/>
"Say if to us the gods these omens send,<br/>
Or fates peculiar to thyself portend?"
</p>
<p>
Whilst yet the monarch paused, with doubts oppress'd<br/>
The beauteous queen relieved his labouring breast:<br/>
"Hear me (she cried), to whom the gods have given<br/>
To read this sign, and mystic sense of heaven,<br/>
As thus the plumy sovereign of the air<br/>
Left on the mountain's brow his callow care,<br/>
And wander'd through the wide ethereal way<br/>
To pour his wrath on yon luxurious prey;<br/>
So shall thy godlike father, toss'd in vain<br/>
Through all the dangers of the boundless main,<br/>
Arrive (or if perchance already come)<br/>
From slaughter'd gluttons to release the dome."
</p>
<p>
"Oh! if this promised bliss by thundering Jove<br/>
(The prince replied) stand fix'd in fate above;<br/>
To thee, as to some god, I'll temples raise.<br/>
And crown thy altars with the costly blaze."
</p>
<p>
He said; and bending o'er his chariot, flung<br/>
Athwart the fiery steeds the smarting thong;<br/>
The bounding shafts upon the harness play,<br/>
Till night descending intercepts the way.<br/>
To Diocles at Pherae they repair,<br/>
Whose boasted sire was sacred Alpheus' heir;<br/>
With him all night the youthful stranger stay'd,<br/>
Nor found the hospitable rites unpaid,<br/>
But soon as morning from her orient bed<br/>
Had tinged the mountains with her earliest red,<br/>
They join'd the steeds, and on the chariot sprung,<br/>
The brazen portals in their passage rung.
</p>
<p>
To Pylos soon they came; when thus begun<br/>
To Nestor's heir Ulysses' godlike son:
</p>
<p>
"Let not Pisistratus in vain be press'd,<br/>
Nor unconsenting hear his friend's request;<br/>
His friend by long hereditary claim,<br/>
In toils his equal, and in years the same.<br/>
No farther from our vessel, I implore,<br/>
The coursers drive; but lash them to the shore.<br/>
Too long thy father would his friend detain;<br/>
I dread his proffer'd kindness urged in vain."
</p>
<p>
The hero paused, and ponder'd this request,<br/>
While love and duty warr'd within his breast.<br/>
At length resolved, he turn'd his ready hand,<br/>
And lash'd his panting coursers to the strand.<br/>
There, while within the poop with care he stored<br/>
The regal presents of the Spartan lord,<br/>
"With speed begone (said he); call every mate,<br/>
Ere yet to Nestor I the tale relate:<br/>
'Tis true, the fervour of his generous heart<br/>
Brooks no repulse, nor couldst thou soon depart:<br/>
Himself will seek thee here, nor wilt thou find,<br/>
In words alone, the Pylian monarch kind.<br/>
But when, arrived, he thy return shall know<br/>
How will his breast with honest fury glow!"<br/>
This said, the sounding strokes his horses fire,<br/>
And soon he reached the palace of his sire.
</p>
<p>
"Now (cried Telemachus) with speedy care<br/>
Hoist every sail, and every oar prepare."<br/>
Swift as the word his willing mates obey,<br/>
And seize their seats, impatient for the sea.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the prince with sacrifice adores<br/>
Minerva, and her guardian aid implores;<br/>
When lo! a wretch ran breathless to the shore,<br/>
New from his crime; and reeking yet with gore.<br/>
A seer he was, from great Melampus sprung,<br/>
Melampus, who in Pylos flourish'd long,<br/>
Till, urged by wrongs, a foreign realm he chose,<br/>
Far from the hateful cause of all his woes.<br/>
Neleus his treasures one long year detains,<br/>
As long he groan'd in Philacus's chains:<br/>
Meantime, what anguish and what rage combined<br/>
For lovely Pero rack'd his labouring mind!<br/>
Yet 'scaped he death; and vengeful of his wrong<br/>
To Pylos drove the lowing herds along:<br/>
Then (Neleus vanquish'd, and consign'd the fair<br/>
To Bias' arms) he so sought a foreign air;<br/>
Argos the rich for his retreat he chose,<br/>
There form'd his empire; there his palace rose.<br/>
From him Antiphates and Mantius came:<br/>
The first begot Oicleus great in fame,<br/>
And he Amphiaraus, immortal name!<br/>
The people's saviour, and divinely wise,<br/>
Beloved by Jove, and him who gilds the skies;<br/>
Yet short his date of life! by female pride he dies.<br/>
From Mantius Clitus, whom Aurora's love<br/>
Snatch'd for his beauty to the thrones above;<br/>
And Polyphides, on whom Phœbus shone<br/>
With fullest rays, Amphiaraus now gone;<br/>
In Hyperesia's groves he made abode,<br/>
And taught mankind the counsels of the god.<br/>
From him sprung Theoclymenus, who found<br/>
(The sacred wine yet foaming on the ground)<br/>
Telemachus: whom, as to Heaven he press'd<br/>
His ardent vows, the stranger thus address'd:
</p>
<p>
"O thou! that dost thy happy course prepare<br/>
With pure libations and with solemn prayer:<br/>
By that dread power to whom thy vows are paid;<br/>
By all the lives of these; thy own dear head,<br/>
Declare sincerely to no foe's demand<br/>
Thy name, thy lineage, and paternal land."
</p>
<p>
"Prepare, then (said Telemachus), to know<br/>
A tale from falsehood free, not free from woe.<br/>
From Ithaca, of royal birth I came,<br/>
And great Ulysses (ever honour'd name!)<br/>
Once was my sire, though now, for ever lost,<br/>
In Stygian gloom he glides a pensive ghost!<br/>
Whose fate inquiring through the world we rove;<br/>
The last, the wretched proof of filial love."
</p>
<p>
The stranger then: "Nor shall I aught conceal,<br/>
But the dire secret of my fate reveal.<br/>
Of my own tribe an Argive wretch I slew;<br/>
Whose powerful friends the luckless deed pursue<br/>
With unrelenting rage, and force from home<br/>
The blood-stain'd exile, ever doom'd to roam.<br/>
But bear, oh bear me o'er yon azure flood;<br/>
Receive the suppliant! spare my destined blood!"
</p>
<p>
"Stranger (replied the prince) securely rest<br/>
Affianced in our faith; henceforth our guest."<br/>
Thus affable, Ulysses' godlike heir<br/>
Takes from the stranger's hand the glittering spear:<br/>
He climbs the ship, ascends the stern with haste<br/>
And by his side the guest accepted placed.<br/>
The chief his order gives: the obedient band,<br/>
With due observance wait the chief's command:<br/>
With speed the mast they rear, with speed unbind<br/>
The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind.<br/>
Minerva calls; the ready gales obey<br/>
With rapid speed to whirl them o'er the sea.<br/>
Crunus they pass'd, next Chalcis roll'd away,<br/>
With thickening darkness closed the doubtful day;<br/>
The silver Phaea's glittering rills they lost,<br/>
And skimm'd along by Elis' sacred coast.<br/>
Then cautious through the rocky reaches wind,<br/>
And turning sudden, shun the death design'd.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, the king, Eumaeus, and the rest,<br/>
Sate in the cottage, at their rural feast:<br/>
The banquet pass'd, and satiate every man,<br/>
To try his host, Ulysses thus began:
</p>
<p>
"Yet one night more, my friends, indulge your guest;<br/>
The last I purpose in your walls to rest:<br/>
To-morrow for myself I must provide,<br/>
And only ask your counsel, and a guide;<br/>
Patient to roam the street, by hunger led,<br/>
And bless the friendly hand that gives me bread.<br/>
There in Ulysses' roof I may relate<br/>
Ulysses' wanderings to his royal mate;<br/>
Or, mingling with the suitors' haughty train,<br/>
Not undeserving some support obtain.<br/>
Hermes to me his various gifts imparts.<br/>
Patron of industry and manual arts:<br/>
Few can with me in dexterous works contend,<br/>
The pyre to build, the stubborn oak to rend;<br/>
To turn the tasteful viand o'er the flame;<br/>
Or foam the goblet with a purple stream.<br/>
Such are the tasks of men of mean estate,<br/>
Whom fortune dooms to serve the rich and great."
</p>
<p>
"Alas! (Eumaeus with a sigh rejoin'd).<br/>
How sprung a thought so monstrous in thy mind?<br/>
If on that godless race thou would'st attend,<br/>
Fate owes thee sure a miserable end!<br/>
Their wrongs and blasphemies ascend the sky,<br/>
And pull descending vengeance from on high.<br/>
Not such, my friend, the servants of their feast:<br/>
A blooming train in rich embroidery dress'd,<br/>
With earth's whole tribute the bright table bends,<br/>
And smiling round celestial youth attends.<br/>
Stay, then: no eye askance beholds thee here;<br/>
Sweet is thy converse to each social ear;<br/>
Well pleased, and pleasing, in our cottage rest,<br/>
Till good Telemachus accepts his guest<br/>
With genial gifts, and change of fair attires,<br/>
And safe conveys thee where thy soul desires."
</p>
<p>
To him the man of woes; "O gracious Jove!<br/>
Reward this stranger's hospitable love!<br/>
Who knows the son of sorrow to relieve,<br/>
Cheers the sad heart, nor lets affliction grieve.<br/>
Of all the ills unhappy mortals know,<br/>
A life of wanderings is the greatest woe;<br/>
On all their weary ways wait care and pain,<br/>
And pine and penury, a meagre train.<br/>
To such a man since harbour you afford,<br/>
Relate the farther fortunes of your lord;<br/>
What cares his mother's tender breast engage,<br/>
And sire forsaken on the verge of age;<br/>
Beneath the sun prolong they yet their breath,<br/>
Or range the house of darkness and of death?"
</p>
<p>
To whom the swain: "Attend what you enquire;<br/>
Laertes lives, the miserable sire,<br/>
Lives, but implores of every power to lay<br/>
The burden down, and wishes for the day.<br/>
Torn from his offspring in the eve of life,<br/>
Torn from the embraces of his tender wife,<br/>
Sole, and all comfortless, he wastes away<br/>
Old age, untimely posting ere his day.<br/>
She too, sad mother! for Ulysses lost<br/>
Pined out her bloom, and vanish'd to a ghost;<br/>
(So dire a fate, ye righteous gods! avert<br/>
From every friendly, every feeling heart!)<br/>
While yet she was, though clouded o'er with grief.<br/>
Her pleasing converse minister'd relief:<br/>
With Climene, her youngest daughter, bred,<br/>
One roof contain'd us, and one table fed.<br/>
But when the softly-stealing pace of time<br/>
Crept on from childhood into youthful prime,<br/>
To Samos' isle she sent the wedded fair;<br/>
Me to the fields; to tend the rural care;<br/>
Array'd in garments her own hands had wove,<br/>
Nor less the darling object of her love.<br/>
Her hapless death my brighter days o'ercast,<br/>
Yet Providence deserts me not at last;<br/>
My present labours food and drink procure,<br/>
And more, the pleasure to relieve the poor.<br/>
Small is the comfort from the queen to hear<br/>
Unwelcome news, or vex the royal ear;<br/>
Blank and discountenanced the servants stand,<br/>
Nor dare to question where the proud command;<br/>
No profit springs beneath usurping powers;<br/>
Want feeds not there where luxury devours,<br/>
Nor harbours charity where riot reigns:<br/>
Proud are the lords, and wretched are the swains."
</p>
<p>
The suffering chief at this began to melt;<br/>
And, "O Eumaeus! thou (he cries) hast felt<br/>
The spite of fortune too! her cruel hand<br/>
Snatch'd thee an infant from thy native land!<br/>
Snatch'd from thy parents' arms, thy parents' eyes,<br/>
To early wants! a man of miseries!<br/>
The whole sad story, from its first, declare:<br/>
Sunk the fair city by the rage of war,<br/>
Where once thy parents dwelt? or did they keep,<br/>
In humbler life, the lowing herds and sheep?<br/>
So left perhaps to tend the fleecy train,<br/>
Rude pirates seized, and shipp'd thee o'er the main?<br/>
Doom'd a fair prize to grace some prince's board,<br/>
The worthy purchase of a foreign lord."
</p>
<p>
"If then my fortunes can delight my friend,<br/>
A story fruitful of events attend:<br/>
Another's sorrow may thy ears enjoy,<br/>
And wine the lengthen'd intervals employ.<br/>
Long nights the now declining year bestows;<br/>
A part we consecrate to soft repose,<br/>
A part in pleasing talk we entertain;<br/>
For too much rest itself becomes a pain.<br/>
Let those, whom sleep invites, the call obey,<br/>
Their cares resuming with the dawning day:<br/>
Here let us feast, and to the feast be join'd<br/>
Discourse, the sweeter banquet of the mind;<br/>
Review the series of our lives, and taste<br/>
The melancholy joy of evils pass'd:<br/>
For he who much has suffer'd, much will know,<br/>
And pleased remembrance builds delight on woe.
</p>
<p>
"Above Ortygia lies an isle of fame,<br/>
Far hence remote, and Syria is the name<br/>
(There curious eyes inscribed with wonder trace<br/>
The sun's diurnal, and his annual race);<br/>
Not large, but fruitful; stored with grass to keep<br/>
The bellowing oxen and the bleating sheep;<br/>
Her sloping hills the mantling vines adorn,<br/>
And her rich valleys wave with golden corn.<br/>
No want, no famine, the glad natives know,<br/>
Nor sink by sickness to the shades below;<br/>
But when a length of years unnerves the strong,<br/>
Apollo comes, and Cynthia comes along.<br/>
They bend the silver bow with tender skill,<br/>
And, void of pain, the silent arrows kill.<br/>
Two equal tribes this fertile land divide,<br/>
Where two fair cities rise with equal pride.<br/>
But both in constant peace one prince obey,<br/>
And Ctesius there, my father, holds the sway.<br/>
Freighted, it seems, with toys of every sort,<br/>
A ship of Sidon anchor'd in our port;<br/>
What time it chanced the palace entertain'd,<br/>
Skill'd in rich works, a woman of their land:<br/>
This nymph, where anchor'd the Phoenician train,<br/>
To wash her robes descending to the main,<br/>
A smooth tongued sailor won her to his mind<br/>
(For love deceives the best of womankind).<br/>
A sudden trust from sudden liking grew;<br/>
She told her name, her race, and all she knew,<br/>
'I too (she cried) from glorious Sidon came,<br/>
My father Arybas, of wealthy fame:<br/>
But, snatch'd by pirates from my native place,<br/>
The Taphians sold me to this man's embrace.'
</p>
<p>
"'Haste then (the false designing youth replied),<br/>
Haste to thy country; love shall be thy guide;<br/>
Haste to thy father's house, thy father's breast,<br/>
For still he lives, and lives with riches blest.'
</p>
<p>
"'Swear first (she cried), ye sailors! to restore<br/>
A wretch in safety to her native shore.'<br/>
Swift as she ask'd, the ready sailors swore.<br/>
She then proceeds: 'Now let our compact made<br/>
Be nor by signal nor by word betray'd,<br/>
Nor near me any of your crew descried,<br/>
By road frequented, or by fountain side.<br/>
Be silence still our guard. The monarch's spies<br/>
(For watchful age is ready to surmise)<br/>
Are still at hand; and this, revealed, must be<br/>
Death to yourselves, eternal chains to me.<br/>
Your vessel loaded, and your traffic pass'd,<br/>
Despatch a wary messenger with haste;<br/>
Then gold and costly treasures will I bring,<br/>
And more, the infant offspring of the king.<br/>
Him, child-like wandering forth, I'll lead away<br/>
(A noble prize!) and to your ship convey.'
</p>
<p>
"Thus spoke the dame, and homeward took the road.<br/>
A year they traffic, and their vessel load.<br/>
Their stores complete, and ready now to weigh,<br/>
A spy was sent their summons to convey:<br/>
An artist to my father's palace came,<br/>
With gold and amber chains, elaborate frame:<br/>
Each female eye the glittering links employ;<br/>
They turn, review, and cheapen every toy.<br/>
He took the occasion, as they stood intent,<br/>
Gave her the sign, and to his vessel went.<br/>
She straight pursued, and seized my willing arm;<br/>
I follow'd, smiling, innocent of harm.<br/>
Three golden goblets in the porch she found<br/>
(The guests not enter'd, but the table crown'd);<br/>
Hid in her fraudful bosom these she bore:<br/>
Now set the sun, and darken'd all the shore.<br/>
Arriving then, where tilting on the tides<br/>
Prepared to launch the freighted vessel rides,<br/>
Aboard they heave us, mount their decks, and sweep<br/>
With level oar along the glassy deep.<br/>
Six calmy days and six smooth nights we sail,<br/>
And constant Jove supplied the gentle gale.<br/>
The seventh, the fraudful wretch (no cause descried),<br/>
Touch'd by Diana's vengeful arrow, died.<br/>
Down dropp'd the caitiff-corse, a worthless load,<br/>
Down to the deep; there roll'd, the future food<br/>
Of fierce sea-wolves, and monsters of the flood.<br/>
An helpless infant I remain'd behind;<br/>
Thence borne to Ithaca by wave and wind;<br/>
Sold to Laertes by divine command,<br/>
And now adopted to a foreign land."
</p>
<p>
To him the king: "Reciting thus thy cares,<br/>
My secret soul in all thy sorrow shares;<br/>
But one choice blessing (such is Jove's high will)<br/>
Has sweeten'd all thy bitter draught of ill:<br/>
Torn from thy country to no hapless end,<br/>
The gods have, in a master, given a friend.<br/>
Whatever frugal nature needs is thine<br/>
(For she needs little), daily bread and wine.<br/>
While I, so many wanderings past, and woes,<br/>
Live but on what thy poverty bestows."
</p>
<p>
So passed in pleasing dialogue away<br/>
The night; then down to short repose they lay;<br/>
Till radiant rose the messenger of day.<br/>
While in the port of Ithaca, the band<br/>
Of young Telemachus approach'd the land;<br/>
Their sails they loosed, they lash'd the mast aside,<br/>
And cast their anchors, and the cables tied:<br/>
Then on the breezy shore, descending, join<br/>
In grateful banquet o'er the rosy wine.<br/>
When thus the prince: "Now each his course pursue;<br/>
I to the fields, and to the city you.<br/>
Long absent hence, I dedicate this day<br/>
My swains to visit, and the works survey.<br/>
Expect me with the morn, to pay the skies<br/>
Our debt of safe return in feast and sacrifice."
</p>
<p>
Then Theoclymenus: "But who shall lend,<br/>
Meantime, protection to thy stranger friend?<br/>
Straight to the queen and palace shall I fly,<br/>
Or yet more distant, to some lord apply?"
</p>
<p>
The prince return'd: "Renown'd in days of yore<br/>
Has stood our father's hospitable door;<br/>
No other roof a stranger should receive,<br/>
No other hands than ours the welcome give.<br/>
But in my absence riot fills the place,<br/>
Nor bears the modest queen a stranger's face;<br/>
From noiseful revel far remote she flies,<br/>
But rarely seen, or seen with weeping eyes.<br/>
No&mdash;let Eurymachus receive my guest,<br/>
Of nature courteous, and by far the best;<br/>
He woos the queen with more respectful flame,<br/>
And emulates her former husband's fame,<br/>
With what success, 'tis Jove's alone to know,<br/>
And the hoped nuptials turn to joy or woe."
</p>
<p>
Thus speaking, on the right up-soar'd in air<br/>
The hawk, Apollo's swift-wing'd messenger:<br/>
His dreadful pounces tore a trembling dove;<br/>
The clotted feathers, scatter'd from above,<br/>
Between the hero and the vessel pour<br/>
Thick plumage mingled with a sanguine shower.
</p>
<p>
The observing augur took the prince aside,<br/>
Seized by the hand, and thus prophetic cried:<br/>
"Yon bird, that dexter cuts the aërial road,<br/>
Rose ominous, nor flies without a god:<br/>
No race but thine shall Ithaca obey,<br/>
To thine, for ages, Heaven decrees the sway."
</p>
<p>
"Succeed the omens, gods! (the youth rejoin'd:)<br/>
Soon shall my bounties speak a grateful mind,<br/>
And soon each envied happiness attend<br/>
The man who calls Telemachus his friend."<br/>
Then to Peiraeus: "Thou whom time has proved<br/>
A faithful servant, by thy prince beloved!<br/>
Till we returning shall our guest demand,<br/>
Accept this charge with honour, at our hand."
</p>
<p>
To this Peiraeus: "Joyful I obey,<br/>
Well pleased the hospitable rites to pay.<br/>
The presence of thy guest shall best reward<br/>
(If long thy stay) the absence of my lord."
</p>
<p>
With that, their anchors he commands to weigh,<br/>
Mount the tall bark, and launch into the sea.<br/>
All with obedient haste forsake the shores,<br/>
And, placed in order, spread their equal oars.<br/>
Then from the deck the prince his sandals takes;<br/>
Poised in his hand the pointed javelin shakes.<br/>
They part; while, lessening from the hero's view<br/>
Swift to the town the well-row'd galley flew:<br/>
The hero trod the margin of the main,<br/>
And reach'd the mansion of his faithful swain.

<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book IV</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
And now Olympus' shining gates unfold;<br/>
The gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold:<br/>
Immortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine,<br/>
The golden goblet crowns with purple wine:<br/>
While the full bowls flow round, the powers employ<br/>
Their careful eyes on long-contended Troy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When Jove, disposed to tempt Saturnia's spleen,<br/>
Thus waked the fury of his partial queen,<br/>
"Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid,<br/>
Imperial Juno, and the martial maid;<br/>
But high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far,<br/>
The tame spectators of his deeds of war.<br/>
Not thus fair Venus helps her favour'd knight,<br/>
The queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight,<br/>
Each danger wards, and constant in her care,<br/>
Saves in the moment of the last despair.<br/>
Her act has rescued Paris' forfeit life,<br/>
Though great Atrides gain'd the glorious strife.<br/>
Then say, ye powers! what signal issue waits<br/>
To crown this deed, and finish all the fates!<br/>
Shall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare,<br/>
Or rouse the furies, and awake the war?<br/>
Yet, would the gods for human good provide,<br/>
Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride,<br/>
Still Priam's walls in peaceful honours grow,<br/>
And through his gates the crowding nations flow."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged,<br/>
And queen of war, in close consult engaged:<br/>
Apart they sit, their deep designs employ,<br/>
And meditate the future woes of Troy.<br/>
Though secret anger swell'd Minerva's breast,<br/>
The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress'd;<br/>
But Juno, impotent of passion, broke<br/>
Her sullen silence, and with fury spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Shall then, O tyrant of the ethereal reign!<br/>
My schemes, my labours, and my hopes be vain?<br/>
Have I, for this, shook Ilion with alarms,<br/>
Assembled nations, set two worlds in arms?<br/>
To spread the war, I flew from shore to shore;<br/>
The immortal coursers scarce the labour bore.<br/>
At length ripe vengeance o'er their heads impends,<br/>
But Jove himself the faithless race defends.<br/>
Loth as thou art to punish lawless lust,<br/>
Not all the gods are partial and unjust."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies,<br/>
Sighs from his inmost soul, and thus replies:<br/>
"Oh lasting rancour! oh insatiate hate<br/>
To Phrygia's monarch, and the Phrygian state!<br/>
What high offence has fired the wife of Jove?<br/>
Can wretched mortals harm the powers above,<br/>
That Troy, and Troy's whole race thou wouldst confound,<br/>
And yon fair structures level with the ground!<br/>
Haste, leave the skies, fulfil thy stern desire,<br/>
Burst all her gates, and wrap her walls in fire!<br/>
Let Priam bleed! if yet you thirst for more,<br/>
Bleed all his sons, and Ilion float with gore:<br/>
To boundless vengeance the wide realm be given,<br/>
Till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven!<br/>
So let it be, and Jove his peace enjoy,<br/>
When heaven no longer hears the name of Troy.<br/>
But should this arm prepare to wreak our hate<br/>
On thy loved realms, whose guilt demands their fate;<br/>
Presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay,<br/>
Remember Troy, and give the vengeance way.<br/>
For know, of all the numerous towns that rise<br/>
Beneath the rolling sun and starry skies,<br/>
Which gods have raised, or earth-born men enjoy,<br/>
None stands so dear to Jove as sacred Troy.<br/>
No mortals merit more distinguish'd grace<br/>
Than godlike Priam, or than Priam's race.<br/>
Still to our name their hecatombs expire,<br/>
And altars blaze with unextinguish'd fire."<br/>
</p>
<p>
At this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes,<br/>
Then on the Thunderer fix'd them, and replies:<br/>
"Three towns are Juno's on the Grecian plains,<br/>
More dear than all the extended earth contains,<br/>
Mycenae, Argos, and the Spartan wall;<br/>
</p>
<p>
These thou mayst raze, nor I forbid their fall:<br/>
'Tis not in me the vengeance to remove;<br/>
The crime's sufficient that they share my love.<br/>
Of power superior why should I complain?<br/>
Resent I may, but must resent in vain.<br/>
Yet some distinction Juno might require,<br/>
Sprung with thyself from one celestial sire,<br/>
A goddess born, to share the realms above,<br/>
And styled the consort of the thundering Jove;<br/>
Nor thou a wife and sister's right deny;<br/>
Let both consent, and both by terms comply;<br/>
So shall the gods our joint decrees obey,<br/>
And heaven shall act as we direct the way.<br/>
See ready Pallas waits thy high commands<br/>
To raise in arms the Greek and Phrygian bands;<br/>
Their sudden friendship by her arts may cease,<br/>
And the proud Trojans first infringe the peace."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The sire of men and monarch of the sky<br/>
The advice approved, and bade Minerva fly,<br/>
Dissolve the league, and all her arts employ<br/>
To make the breach the faithless act of Troy.<br/>
Fired with the charge, she headlong urged her flight,<br/>
And shot like lightning from Olympus' height.<br/>
As the red comet, from Saturnius sent<br/>
To fright the nations with a dire portent,<br/>
(A fatal sign to armies on the plain,<br/>
Or trembling sailors on the wintry main,)<br/>
With sweeping glories glides along in air,<br/>
And shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair:<br/>
Between both armies thus, in open sight<br/>
Shot the bright goddess in a trail of light,<br/>
With eyes erect the gazing hosts admire<br/>
The power descending, and the heavens on fire!<br/>
"The gods (they cried), the gods this signal sent,<br/>
And fate now labours with some vast event:<br/>
Jove seals the league, or bloodier scenes prepares;<br/>
Jove, the great arbiter of peace and wars."<br/>
</p>
<p>
They said, while Pallas through the Trojan throng,<br/>
(In shape a mortal,) pass'd disguised along.<br/>
Like bold Laodocus, her course she bent,<br/>
Who from Antenor traced his high descent.<br/>
Amidst the ranks Lycaon's son she found,<br/>
The warlike Pandarus, for strength renown'd;<br/>
Whose squadrons, led from black Ã†sepus' flood,<br/>
With flaming shields in martial circle stood.<br/>
To him the goddess: "Phrygian! canst thou hear<br/>
A well-timed counsel with a willing ear?<br/>
What praise were thine, couldst thou direct thy dart,<br/>
Amidst his triumph, to the Spartan's heart?<br/>
What gifts from Troy, from Paris wouldst thou gain,<br/>
Thy country's foe, the Grecian glory slain?<br/>
Then seize the occasion, dare the mighty deed,<br/>
Aim at his breast, and may that aim succeed!<br/>
But first, to speed the shaft, address thy vow<br/>
To Lycian Phoebus with the silver bow,<br/>
And swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay,<br/>
On Zelia's altars, to the god of day."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He heard, and madly at the motion pleased,<br/>
His polish'd bow with hasty rashness seized.<br/>
'Twas form'd of horn, and smooth'd with artful toil:<br/>
A mountain goat resign'd the shining spoil.<br/>
Who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled;<br/>
The stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead,<br/>
And sixteen palms his brow's large honours spread:<br/>
The workmen join'd, and shaped the bended horns,<br/>
And beaten gold each taper point adorns.<br/>
This, by the Greeks unseen, the warrior bends,<br/>
Screen'd by the shields of his surrounding friends:<br/>
There meditates the mark; and couching low,<br/>
Fits the sharp arrow to the well-strung bow.<br/>
One from a hundred feather'd deaths he chose,<br/>
Fated to wound, and cause of future woes;<br/>
Then offers vows with hecatombs to crown<br/>
Apollo's altars in his native town.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now with full force the yielding horn he bends,<br/>
Drawn to an arch, and joins the doubling ends;<br/>
Close to his breast he strains the nerve below,<br/>
Till the barb'd points approach the circling bow;<br/>
The impatient weapon whizzes on the wing;<br/>
Sounds the tough horn, and twangs the quivering string.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But thee, Atrides! in that dangerous hour<br/>
The gods forget not, nor thy guardian power,<br/>
Pallas assists, and (weakened in its force)<br/>
Diverts the weapon from its destined course:<br/>
So from her babe, when slumber seals his eye,<br/>
The watchful mother wafts the envenom'd fly.<br/>
Just where his belt with golden buckles join'd,<br/>
Where linen folds the double corslet lined,<br/>
She turn'd the shaft, which, hissing from above,<br/>
Pass'd the broad belt, and through the corslet drove;<br/>
The folds it pierced, the plaited linen tore,<br/>
And razed the skin, and drew the purple gore.<br/>
As when some stately trappings are decreed<br/>
To grace a monarch on his bounding steed,<br/>
A nymph in Caria or Maeonia bred,<br/>
Stains the pure ivory with a lively red;<br/>
With equal lustre various colours vie,<br/>
The shining whiteness, and the Tyrian dye:<br/>
So great Atrides! show'd thy sacred blood,<br/>
As down thy snowy thigh distill'd the streaming flood.<br/>
With horror seized, the king of men descried<br/>
The shaft infix'd, and saw the gushing tide:<br/>
Nor less the Spartan fear'd, before he found<br/>
The shining barb appear above the wound,<br/>
Then, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast,<br/>
The royal brother thus his grief express'd,<br/>
And grasp'd his hand; while all the Greeks around<br/>
With answering sighs return'd the plaintive sound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Oh, dear as life! did I for this agree<br/>
The solemn truce, a fatal truce to thee!<br/>
Wert thou exposed to all the hostile train,<br/>
To fight for Greece, and conquer, to be slain!<br/>
The race of Trojans in thy ruin join,<br/>
And faith is scorn'd by all the perjured line.<br/>
Not thus our vows, confirm'd with wine and gore,<br/>
Those hands we plighted, and those oaths we swore,<br/>
Shall all be vain: when Heaven's revenge is slow,<br/>
Jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow.<br/>
The day shall come, that great avenging day,<br/>
When Troy's proud glories in the dust shall lay,<br/>
When Priam's powers and Priam's self shall fall,<br/>
And one prodigious ruin swallow all.<br/>
I see the god, already, from the pole<br/>
Bare his red arm, and bid the thunder roll;<br/>
I see the Eternal all his fury shed,<br/>
And shake his aegis o'er their guilty head.<br/>
Such mighty woes on perjured princes wait;<br/>
But thou, alas! deserv'st a happier fate.<br/>
Still must I mourn the period of thy days,<br/>
And only mourn, without my share of praise?<br/>
Deprived of thee, the heartless Greeks no more<br/>
Shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore;<br/>
Troy seized of Helen, and our glory lost,<br/>
Thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast;<br/>
While some proud Trojan thus insulting cries,<br/>
(And spurns the dust where Menelaus lies,)<br/>
'Such are the trophies Greece from Ilion brings,<br/>
And such the conquest of her king of kings!<br/>
Lo his proud vessels scatter'd o'er the main,<br/>
And unrevenged, his mighty brother slain.'<br/>
Oh! ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,<br/>
O'erwhelm me, earth! and hide a monarch's shame."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: a leader's and a brother's fears<br/>
Possess his soul, which thus the Spartan cheers:<br/>
"Let not thy words the warmth of Greece abate;<br/>
The feeble dart is guiltless of my fate:<br/>
Stiff with the rich embroider'd work around,<br/>
My varied belt repell'd the flying wound."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the king: "My brother and my friend,<br/>
Thus, always thus, may Heaven thy life defend!<br/>
Now seek some skilful hand, whose powerful art<br/>
May stanch the effusion, and extract the dart.<br/>
Herald, be swift, and bid Machaon bring<br/>
His speedy succour to the Spartan king;<br/>
Pierced with a winged shaft (the deed of Troy),<br/>
The Grecian's sorrow, and the Dardan's joy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With hasty zeal the swift Talthybius flies;<br/>
Through the thick files he darts his searching eyes,<br/>
And finds Machaon, where sublime he stands<br/>
In arms incircled with his native bands.<br/>
Then thus: "Machaon, to the king repair,<br/>
His wounded brother claims thy timely care;<br/>
Pierced by some Lycian or Dardanian bow,<br/>
A grief to us, a triumph to the foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The heavy tidings grieved the godlike man:<br/>
Swift to his succour through the ranks he ran.<br/>
The dauntless king yet standing firm he found,<br/>
And all the chiefs in deep concern around.<br/>
Where to the steely point the reed was join'd,<br/>
The shaft he drew, but left the head behind.<br/>
Straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced,<br/>
He loosed; the corslet from his breast unbraced;<br/>
Then suck'd the blood, and sovereign balm infused,<br/>
Which Chiron gave, and Ã†sculapius used.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While round the prince the Greeks employ their care,<br/>
The Trojans rush tumultuous to the war;<br/>
Once more they glitter in refulgent arms,<br/>
Once more the fields are fill'd with dire alarms.<br/>
Nor had you seen the king of men appear<br/>
Confused, unactive, or surprised with fear;<br/>
But fond of glory, with severe delight,<br/>
His beating bosom claim'd the rising fight.<br/>
No longer with his warlike steeds he stay'd,<br/>
Or press'd the car with polish'd brass inlaid<br/>
But left Eurymedon the reins to guide;<br/>
The fiery coursers snorted at his side.<br/>
On foot through all the martial ranks he moves<br/>
And these encourages, and those reproves.<br/>
"Brave men!" he cries, (to such who boldly dare<br/>
Urge their swift steeds to face the coming war),<br/>
"Your ancient valour on the foes approve;<br/>
Jove is with Greece, and let us trust in Jove.<br/>
'Tis not for us, but guilty Troy, to dread,<br/>
Whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head;<br/>
Her sons and matrons Greece shall lead in chains,<br/>
And her dead warriors strew the mournful plains."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus with new ardour he the brave inspires;<br/>
Or thus the fearful with reproaches fires:<br/>
"Shame to your country, scandal of your kind;<br/>
Born to the fate ye well deserve to find!<br/>
Why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain,<br/>
Prepared for flight, but doom'd to fly in vain?<br/>
Confused and panting thus, the hunted deer<br/>
Falls as he flies, a victim to his fear.<br/>
Still must ye wait the foes, and still retire,<br/>
Till yon tall vessels blaze with Trojan fire?<br/>
Or trust ye, Jove a valiant foe shall chase,<br/>
To save a trembling, heartless, dastard race?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, he stalk'd with ample strides along,<br/>
To Crete's brave monarch and his martial throng;<br/>
High at their head he saw the chief appear,<br/>
And bold Meriones excite the rear.<br/>
At this the king his generous joy express'd,<br/>
And clasp'd the warrior to his armed breast.<br/>
"Divine Idomeneus! what thanks we owe<br/>
To worth like thine! what praise shall we bestow?<br/>
To thee the foremost honours are decreed,<br/>
First in the fight and every graceful deed.<br/>
For this, in banquets, when the generous bowls<br/>
Restore our blood, and raise the warriors' souls,<br/>
Though all the rest with stated rules we bound,<br/>
Unmix'd, unmeasured, are thy goblets crown'd.<br/>
Be still thyself, in arms a mighty name;<br/>
Maintain thy honours, and enlarge thy fame."<br/>
To whom the Cretan thus his speech address'd:<br/>
"Secure of me, O king! exhort the rest.<br/>
Fix'd to thy side, in every toil I share,<br/>
Thy firm associate in the day of war.<br/>
But let the signal be this moment given;<br/>
To mix in fight is all I ask of Heaven.<br/>
The field shall prove how perjuries succeed,<br/>
And chains or death avenge the impious deed."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Charm'd with this heat, the king his course pursues,<br/>
And next the troops of either Ajax views:<br/>
In one firm orb the bands were ranged around,<br/>
A cloud of heroes blacken'd all the ground.<br/>
Thus from the lofty promontory's brow<br/>
A swain surveys the gathering storm below;<br/>
Slow from the main the heavy vapours rise,<br/>
Spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies,<br/>
Till black as night the swelling tempest shows,<br/>
The cloud condensing as the west-wind blows:<br/>
He dreads the impending storm, and drives his flock<br/>
To the close covert of an arching rock.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Such, and so thick, the embattled squadrons stood,<br/>
With spears erect, a moving iron wood:<br/>
A shady light was shot from glimmering shields,<br/>
And their brown arms obscured the dusky fields.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O heroes! worthy such a dauntless train,<br/>
Whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain,<br/>
(Exclaim'd the king), who raise your eager bands<br/>
With great examples, more than loud commands.<br/>
Ah! would the gods but breathe in all the rest<br/>
Such souls as burn in your exalted breast,<br/>
Soon should our arms with just success be crown'd,<br/>
And Troy's proud walls lie smoking on the ground."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then to the next the general bends his course;<br/>
(His heart exults, and glories in his force);<br/>
There reverend Nestor ranks his Pylian bands,<br/>
And with inspiring eloquence commands;<br/>
With strictest order sets his train in arms,<br/>
The chiefs advises, and the soldiers warms.<br/>
Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, round him wait,<br/>
Bias the good, and Pelagon the great.<br/>
The horse and chariots to the front assign'd,<br/>
The foot (the strength of war) he ranged behind;<br/>
The middle space suspected troops supply,<br/>
Inclosed by both, nor left the power to fly;<br/>
He gives command to "curb the fiery steed,<br/>
Nor cause confusion, nor the ranks exceed:<br/>
Before the rest let none too rashly ride;<br/>
No strength nor skill, but just in time, be tried:<br/>
The charge once made, no warrior turn the rein,<br/>
But fight, or fall; a firm embodied train.<br/>
He whom the fortune of the field shall cast<br/>
From forth his chariot, mount the next in haste;<br/>
Nor seek unpractised to direct the car,<br/>
Content with javelins to provoke the war.<br/>
Our great forefathers held this prudent course,<br/>
Thus ruled their ardour, thus preserved their force;<br/>
By laws like these immortal conquests made,<br/>
And earth's proud tyrants low in ashes laid."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So spoke the master of the martial art,<br/>
And touch'd with transport great Atrides' heart.<br/>
"Oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires,<br/>
And nerves to second what thy soul inspires!<br/>
But wasting years, that wither human race,<br/>
Exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace.<br/>
What once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be!<br/>
And age the lot of any chief but thee."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried;<br/>
He shook his hoary locks, and thus replied:<br/>
"Well might I wish, could mortal wish renew<br/>
That strength which once in boiling youth I knew;<br/>
Such as I was, when Ereuthalion, slain<br/>
Beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain.<br/>
But heaven its gifts not all at once bestows,<br/>
These years with wisdom crowns, with action those:<br/>
The field of combat fits the young and bold,<br/>
The solemn council best becomes the old:<br/>
To you the glorious conflict I resign,<br/>
Let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said. With joy the monarch march'd before,<br/>
And found Menestheus on the dusty shore,<br/>
With whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands;<br/>
And next Ulysses, with his subject bands.<br/>
Remote their forces lay, nor knew so far<br/>
The peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war;<br/>
The tumult late begun, they stood intent<br/>
To watch the motion, dubious of the event.<br/>
The king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved,<br/>
With hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Can Peleus' son forget a warrior's part.<br/>
And fears Ulysses, skill'd in every art?<br/>
Why stand you distant, and the rest expect<br/>
To mix in combat which yourselves neglect?<br/>
From you 'twas hoped among the first to dare<br/>
The shock of armies, and commence the war;<br/>
For this your names are call'd before the rest,<br/>
To share the pleasures of the genial feast:<br/>
And can you, chiefs! without a blush survey<br/>
Whole troops before you labouring in the fray?<br/>
Say, is it thus those honours you requite?<br/>
The first in banquets, but the last in fight."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ulysses heard: the hero's warmth o'erspread<br/>
His cheek with blushes: and severe, he said:<br/>
"Take back the unjust reproach! Behold we stand<br/>
Sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command.<br/>
If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,<br/>
Behold me plunging in the thickest fight.<br/>
Then give thy warrior-chief a warrior's due,<br/>
Who dares to act whate'er thou dar'st to view."<br/>
Struck with his generous wrath, the king replies:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O great in action, and in council wise!<br/>
With ours, thy care and ardour are the same,<br/>
Nor need I to commend, nor aught to blame.<br/>
Sage as thou art, and learn'd in human kind,<br/>
Forgive the transport of a martial mind.<br/>
Haste to the fight, secure of just amends;<br/>
The gods that make, shall keep the worthy, friends."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and pass'd where great Tydides lay,<br/>
His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array;<br/>
(The warlike Sthenelus attends his side;)<br/>
To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried:<br/>
"O son of Tydeus! (he, whose strength could tame<br/>
The bounding steed, in arms a mighty name)<br/>
Canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,<br/>
With hands unactive, and a careless eye?<br/>
Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear'd;<br/>
Still first in front the matchless prince appear'd:<br/>
What glorious toils, what wonders they recite,<br/>
Who view'd him labouring through the ranks of fight?<br/>
I saw him once, when gathering martial powers,<br/>
A peaceful guest, he sought Mycenae's towers;<br/>
Armies he ask'd, and armies had been given,<br/>
Not we denied, but Jove forbade from heaven;<br/>
While dreadful comets glaring from afar,<br/>
Forewarn'd the horrors of the Theban war.<br/>
Next, sent by Greece from where Asopus flows,<br/>
A fearless envoy, he approach'd the foes;<br/>
Thebes' hostile walls unguarded and alone,<br/>
Dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.<br/>
The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,<br/>
And dared to combat all those chiefs around:<br/>
Dared, and subdued before their haughty lord;<br/>
For Pallas strung his arm and edged his sword.<br/>
Stung with the shame, within the winding way,<br/>
To bar his passage fifty warriors lay;<br/>
Two heroes led the secret squadron on,<br/>
Mason the fierce, and hardy Lycophon;<br/>
Those fifty slaughter'd in the gloomy vale.<br/>
He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale,<br/>
Such Tydeus was, and such his martial fire;<br/>
Gods! how the son degenerates from the sire!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
No words the godlike Diomed return'd,<br/>
But heard respectful, and in secret burn'd:<br/>
Not so fierce Capaneus' undaunted son;<br/>
Stern as his sire, the boaster thus begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What needs, O monarch! this invidious praise,<br/>
Ourselves to lessen, while our sire you raise?<br/>
Dare to be just, Atrides! and confess<br/>
Our value equal, though our fury less.<br/>
With fewer troops we storm'd the Theban wall,<br/>
And happier saw the sevenfold city fall,<br/>
In impious acts the guilty father died;<br/>
The sons subdued, for Heaven was on their side.<br/>
Far more than heirs of all our parents' fame,<br/>
Our glories darken their diminish'd name."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To him Tydides thus: "My friend, forbear;<br/>
Suppress thy passion, and the king revere:<br/>
His high concern may well excuse this rage,<br/>
Whose cause we follow, and whose war we wage:<br/>
His the first praise, were Ilion's towers o'erthrown,<br/>
And, if we fail, the chief disgrace his own.<br/>
Let him the Greeks to hardy toils excite,<br/>
'Tis ours to labour in the glorious fight."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and ardent, on the trembling ground<br/>
Sprung from his car: his ringing arms resound.<br/>
Dire was the clang, and dreadful from afar,<br/>
Of arm'd Tydides rushing to the war.<br/>
As when the winds, ascending by degrees,<br/>
First move the whitening surface of the seas,<br/>
The billows float in order to the shore,<br/>
The wave behind rolls on the wave before;<br/>
Till, with the growing storm, the deeps arise,<br/>
Foam o'er the rocks, and thunder to the skies.<br/>
So to the fight the thick battalions throng,<br/>
Shields urged on shields, and men drove men along<br/>
Sedate and silent move the numerous bands;<br/>
No sound, no whisper, but the chief's commands,<br/>
Those only heard; with awe the rest obey,<br/>
As if some god had snatch'd their voice away.<br/>
Not so the Trojans; from their host ascends<br/>
A general shout that all the region rends.<br/>
As when the fleecy flocks unnumber'd stand<br/>
In wealthy folds, and wait the milker's hand,<br/>
The hollow vales incessant bleating fills,<br/>
The lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills:<br/>
Such clamours rose from various nations round,<br/>
Mix'd was the murmur, and confused the sound.<br/>
Each host now joins, and each a god inspires,<br/>
These Mars incites, and those Minerva fires,<br/>
Pale flight around, and dreadful terror reign;<br/>
And discord raging bathes the purple plain;<br/>
Discord! dire sister of the slaughtering power,<br/>
Small at her birth, but rising every hour,<br/>
While scarce the skies her horrid head can bound,<br/>
She stalks on earth, and shakes the world around;<br/>
The nations bleed, where'er her steps she turns,<br/>
The groan still deepens, and the combat burns.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now shield with shield, with helmet helmet closed,<br/>
To armour armour, lance to lance opposed,<br/>
Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew,<br/>
The sounding darts in iron tempests flew,<br/>
Victors and vanquish'd join'd promiscuous cries,<br/>
And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise;<br/>
With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,<br/>
And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As torrents roll, increased by numerous rills,<br/>
With rage impetuous, down their echoing hills<br/>
Rush to the vales, and pour'd along the plain,<br/>
Roar through a thousand channels to the main:<br/>
The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound;<br/>
So mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The bold Antilochus the slaughter led,<br/>
The first who struck a valiant Trojan dead:<br/>
At great Echepolus the lance arrives,<br/>
Razed his high crest, and through his helmet drives;<br/>
Warm'd in the brain the brazen weapon lies,<br/>
And shades eternal settle o'er his eyes.<br/>
So sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood<br/>
Of force and fire, its walls besmear'd with blood.<br/>
Him, the bold leader of the Abantian throng,<br/>
Seized to despoil, and dragg'd the corpse along:<br/>
But while he strove to tug the inserted dart,<br/>
Agenor's javelin reach'd the hero's heart.<br/>
His flank, unguarded by his ample shield,<br/>
Admits the lance: he falls, and spurns the field;<br/>
The nerves, unbraced, support his limbs no more;<br/>
The soul comes floating in a tide of gore.<br/>
Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain;<br/>
The war renews, the warriors bleed again:<br/>
As o'er their prey rapacious wolves engage,<br/>
Man dies on man, and all is blood and rage.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In blooming youth fair Simoisius fell,<br/>
Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell;<br/>
Fair Simoisius, whom his mother bore<br/>
Amid the flocks on silver Simois' shore:<br/>
The nymph descending from the hills of Ide,<br/>
To seek her parents on his flowery side,<br/>
Brought forth the babe, their common care and joy,<br/>
And thence from Simois named the lovely boy.<br/>
Short was his date! by dreadful Ajax slain,<br/>
He falls, and renders all their cares in vain!<br/>
So falls a poplar, that in watery ground<br/>
Raised high the head, with stately branches crown'd,<br/>
(Fell'd by some artist with his shining steel,<br/>
To shape the circle of the bending wheel,)<br/>
Cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread,<br/>
With all its beauteous honours on its head<br/>
There, left a subject to the wind and rain,<br/>
And scorch'd by suns, it withers on the plain<br/>
Thus pierced by Ajax, Simoisius lies<br/>
Stretch'd on the shore, and thus neglected dies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
At Ajax, Antiphus his javelin threw;<br/>
The pointed lance with erring fury flew,<br/>
And Leucus, loved by wise Ulysses, slew.<br/>
He drops the corpse of Simoisius slain,<br/>
And sinks a breathless carcase on the plain.<br/>
This saw Ulysses, and with grief enraged,<br/>
Strode where the foremost of the foes engaged;<br/>
Arm'd with his spear, he meditates the wound,<br/>
In act to throw; but cautious look'd around,<br/>
Struck at his sight the Trojans backward drew,<br/>
And trembling heard the javelin as it flew.<br/>
A chief stood nigh, who from Abydos came,<br/>
Old Priam's son, Democoon was his name.<br/>
The weapon entered close above his ear,<br/>
Cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear;<br/>
With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath,<br/>
His eye-balls darken with the shades of death;<br/>
Ponderous he falls; his clanging arms resound,<br/>
And his broad buckler rings against the ground.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Seized with affright the boldest foes appear;<br/>
E'en godlike Hector seems himself to fear;<br/>
Slow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled;<br/>
The Greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead:<br/>
But Phoebus now from Ilion's towering height<br/>
Shines forth reveal'd, and animates the fight.<br/>
"Trojans, be bold, and force with force oppose;<br/>
Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes!<br/>
Nor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb'd with steel;<br/>
Your weapons enter, and your strokes they feel.<br/>
Have ye forgot what seem'd your dread before?<br/>
The great, the fierce Achilles fights no more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Apollo thus from Ilion's lofty towers,<br/>
Array'd in terrors, roused the Trojan powers:<br/>
While war's fierce goddess fires the Grecian foe,<br/>
And shouts and thunders in the fields below.<br/>
Then great Diores fell, by doom divine,<br/>
In vain his valour and illustrious line.<br/>
A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw,<br/>
(Who from cold Ã†nus led the Thracian crew,)<br/>
Full on his ankle dropp'd the ponderous stone,<br/>
Burst the strong nerves, and crash'd the solid bone.<br/>
Supine he tumbles on the crimson sands,<br/>
Before his helpless friends, and native bands,<br/>
And spreads for aid his unavailing hands.<br/>
The foe rush'd furious as he pants for breath,<br/>
And through his navel drove the pointed death:<br/>
His gushing entrails smoked upon the ground,<br/>
And the warm life came issuing from the wound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sent,<br/>
Deep in his breast above the pap it went,<br/>
Amid the lungs was fix'd the winged wood,<br/>
And quivering in his heaving bosom stood:<br/>
Till from the dying chief, approaching near,<br/>
The Ã†tolian warrior tugg'd his weighty spear:<br/>
Then sudden waved his flaming falchion round,<br/>
And gash'd his belly with a ghastly wound;<br/>
The corpse now breathless on the bloody plain,<br/>
To spoil his arms the victor strove in vain;<br/>
The Thracian bands against the victor press'd,<br/>
A grove of lances glitter'd at his breast.<br/>
Stern Thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes,<br/>
In sullen fury slowly quits the prize.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus fell two heroes; one the pride of Thrace,<br/>
And one the leader of the Epeian race;<br/>
Death's sable shade at once o'ercast their eyes,<br/>
In dust the vanquish'd and the victor lies.<br/>
With copious slaughter all the fields are red,<br/>
And heap'd with growing mountains of the dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Had some brave chief this martial scene beheld,<br/>
By Pallas guarded through the dreadful field;<br/>
Might darts be bid to turn their points away,<br/>
And swords around him innocently play;<br/>
The war's whole art with wonder had he seen,<br/>
And counted heroes where he counted men.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,<br/>
And crowds on crowds triumphantly expired.<br/>

<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
While thus the hero's pious cares attend<br/>
The cure and safety of his wounded friend,<br/>
Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,<br/>
And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.<br/>
Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;<br/>
With gods averse the ill-fated works arose;<br/>
Their powers neglected, and no victim slain,<br/>
The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Without the gods, how short a period stands<br/>
The proudest monument of mortal hands!<br/>
This stood while Hector and Achilles raged,<br/>
While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged;<br/>
But when her sons were slain, her city burn'd,<br/>
And what survived of Greece to Greece return'd;<br/>
Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,<br/>
Then Ida's summits pour'd their watery store;<br/>
Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills,<br/>
Caresus roaring down the stony hills,<br/>
Æsepus, Granicus, with mingled force,<br/>
And Xanthus foaming from his fruitful source;<br/>
And gulfy Simois, rolling to the main<br/>
Helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain:<br/>
These, turn'd by Phoebus from their wonted ways,<br/>
Deluged the rampire nine continual days;<br/>
The weight of waters saps the yielding wall,<br/>
And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.<br/>
Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours,<br/>
And half the skies descend in sluicy showers.<br/>
The god of ocean, marching stern before,<br/>
With his huge trident wounds the trembling shore,<br/>
Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves,<br/>
And whelms the smoky ruin in the waves.<br/>
Now smooth'd with sand, and levell'd by the flood,<br/>
No fragment tells where once the wonder stood;<br/>
In their old bounds the rivers roll again,<br/>
Shine 'twixt the hills, or wander o'er the plain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But this the gods in later times perform;<br/>
As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;<br/>
The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;<br/>
War thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd the towers.<br/>
Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,<br/>
Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:<br/>
Hector's approach in every wind they hear,<br/>
And Hector's fury every moment fear.<br/>
He, like a whirlwind, toss'd the scattering throng,<br/>
Mingled the troops, and drove the field along.<br/>
So 'midst the dogs and hunters' daring bands,<br/>
Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;<br/>
Arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form,<br/>
And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:<br/>
His powers untamed, their bold assault defy,<br/>
And where he turns the rout disperse or die:<br/>
He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,<br/>
And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.<br/>
With equal rage encompass'd Hector glows;<br/>
Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.<br/>
The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,<br/>
And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;<br/>
Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,<br/>
And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.<br/>
Eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep,<br/>
Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;<br/>
The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)<br/>
And bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below.<br/>
The foot alone this strong defence could force,<br/>
And try the pass impervious to the horse.<br/>
This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,<br/>
Restrain'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!<br/>
And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!<br/>
What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,<br/>
The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?<br/>
No pass through those, without a thousand wounds,<br/>
No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.<br/>
Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,<br/>
On certain dangers we too rashly run:<br/>
If 'tis his will our haughty foes to tame,<br/>
Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!<br/>
Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,<br/>
And one great day destroy and bury all!<br/>
But should they turn, and here oppress our train,<br/>
What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?<br/>
Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,<br/>
In one promiscuous carnage crush'd and bruised,<br/>
All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,<br/>
Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.<br/>
Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;<br/>
Back from the trenches let your steeds be led;<br/>
Then all alighting, wedged in firm array,<br/>
Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.<br/>
So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,<br/>
And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This counsel pleased: the godlike Hector sprung<br/>
Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.<br/>
The chief's example follow'd by his train,<br/>
Each quits his car, and issues on the plain,<br/>
By orders strict the charioteers enjoin'd<br/>
Compel the coursers to their ranks behind.<br/>
The forces part in five distinguish'd bands,<br/>
And all obey their several chiefs' commands.<br/>
The best and bravest in the first conspire,<br/>
Pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire:<br/>
Great Hector glorious in the van of these,<br/>
Polydamas, and brave Cebriones.<br/>
Before the next the graceful Paris shines,<br/>
And bold Alcathous, and Agenor joins.<br/>
The sons of Priam with the third appear,<br/>
Deiphobus, and Helenas the seer;<br/>
In arms with these the mighty Asius stood,<br/>
Who drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood,<br/>
And whom Arisba's yellow coursers bore,<br/>
The coursers fed on Selle's winding shore.<br/>
Antenor's sons the fourth battalion guide,<br/>
And great Æneas, born on fountful Ide.<br/>
Divine Sarpedon the last band obey'd,<br/>
Whom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid.<br/>
Next him, the bravest, at their army's head,<br/>
But he more brave than all the hosts he led.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now with compacted shields in close array,<br/>
The moving legions speed their headlong way:<br/>
Already in their hopes they fire the fleet,<br/>
And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While every Trojan thus, and every aid,<br/>
The advice of wise Polydamas obey'd,<br/>
Asius alone, confiding in his car,<br/>
His vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.<br/>
Unhappy hero! and advised in vain;<br/>
Those wheels returning ne'er shall mark the plain;<br/>
No more those coursers with triumphant joy<br/>
Restore their master to the gates of Troy!<br/>
Black death attends behind the Grecian wall,<br/>
And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!<br/>
Fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain<br/>
The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;<br/>
Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass'd,<br/>
The gates half-open'd to receive the last.<br/>
Thither, exulting in his force, he flies:<br/>
His following host with clamours rend the skies:<br/>
To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,<br/>
Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!<br/>
</p>
<p>
To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,<br/>
Who from the Lapiths' warlike race descend;<br/>
This Polypoetes, great Perithous' heir,<br/>
And that Leonteus, like the god of war.<br/>
As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;<br/>
Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:<br/>
Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown'd,<br/>
Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;<br/>
High on the hills appears their stately form,<br/>
And their deep roots for ever brave the storm.<br/>
So graceful these, and so the shock they stand<br/>
Of raging Asius, and his furious band.<br/>
Orestes, Acamas, in front appear,<br/>
And OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear:<br/>
In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,<br/>
In vain around them beat their hollow shields;<br/>
The fearless brothers on the Grecians call,<br/>
To guard their navies, and defend the wall.<br/>
Even when they saw Troy's sable troops impend,<br/>
And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,<br/>
Forth from the portals rush'd the intrepid pair,<br/>
Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.<br/>
So two wild boars spring furious from their den,<br/>
Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;<br/>
On every side the crackling trees they tear,<br/>
And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;<br/>
They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,<br/>
Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.<br/>
Around their heads the whistling javelins sung,<br/>
With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;<br/>
Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers<br/>
Maintain'd the walls, and mann'd the lofty towers:<br/>
To save their fleet their last efforts they try,<br/>
And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings<br/>
The dreary winter on his frozen wings;<br/>
Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow<br/>
Descend, and whiten all the fields below:<br/>
So fast the darts on either army pour,<br/>
So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:<br/>
Heavy, and thick, resound the batter'd shields,<br/>
And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,<br/>
The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:<br/>
"In powers immortal who shall now believe?<br/>
Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?<br/>
What man could doubt but Troy's victorious power<br/>
Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?<br/>
But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,<br/>
To guard the entrance of their common hive,<br/>
Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings<br/>
They strike the assailants, and infix their stings;<br/>
A race determined, that to death contend:<br/>
So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.<br/>
Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates,<br/>
Repel an army, and defraud the fates?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
These empty accents mingled with the wind,<br/>
Nor moved great Jove's unalterable mind;<br/>
To godlike Hector and his matchless might<br/>
Was owed the glory of the destined fight.<br/>
Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,<br/>
And all the gates sustain'd an equal tide;<br/>
Through the long walls the stony showers were heard,<br/>
The blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear'd.<br/>
The spirit of a god my breast inspire,<br/>
To raise each act to life, and sing with fire!<br/>
While Greece unconquer'd kept alive the war,<br/>
Secure of death, confiding in despair;<br/>
And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,<br/>
With unassisting arms deplored the day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain<br/>
The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.<br/>
First Damasus, by Polypoetes' steel,<br/>
Pierced through his helmet's brazen visor, fell;<br/>
The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!<br/>
The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!<br/>
Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:<br/>
Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death;<br/>
First through the belt Hippomachus he gored,<br/>
Then sudden waved his unresisted sword:<br/>
Antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,<br/>
The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:<br/>
Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;<br/>
And round him rose a monument of dead.<br/>
Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,<br/>
Bold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;<br/>
Fierce with impatience on the works to fall,<br/>
And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.<br/>
These on the farther bank now stood and gazed,<br/>
By Heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amazed:<br/>
A signal omen stopp'd the passing host,<br/>
Their martial fury in their wonder lost.<br/>
Jove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;<br/>
A bleeding serpent of enormous size,<br/>
His talons truss'd; alive, and curling round,<br/>
He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:<br/>
Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,<br/>
In airy circles wings his painful way,<br/>
Floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:<br/>
Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.<br/>
They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll'd,<br/>
And Jove's portent with beating hearts behold.<br/>
Then first Polydamas the silence broke,<br/>
Long weigh'd the signal, and to Hector spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,<br/>
For words well meant, and sentiments sincere?<br/>
True to those counsels which I judge the best,<br/>
I tell the faithful dictates of my breast.<br/>
To speak his thoughts is every freeman's right,<br/>
In peace, in war, in council, and in fight;<br/>
And all I move, deferring to thy sway,<br/>
But tends to raise that power which I obey.<br/>
Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!<br/>
Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;<br/>
For sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,<br/>
And thus my mind explains its clear event:<br/>
The victor eagle, whose sinister flight<br/>
Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,<br/>
Dismiss'd his conquest in the middle skies,<br/>
Allow'd to seize, but not possess the prize;<br/>
Thus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet,<br/>
Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,<br/>
Toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;<br/>
More woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.<br/>
So bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;<br/>
For thus a skilful seer would read the skies."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To him then Hector with disdain return'd:<br/>
(Fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn'd:)<br/>
"Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?<br/>
Thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:<br/>
Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,<br/>
Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.<br/>
What coward counsels would thy madness move<br/>
Against the word, the will reveal'd of Jove?<br/>
The leading sign, the irrevocable nod,<br/>
And happy thunders of the favouring god,<br/>
These shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind<br/>
By wandering birds that flit with every wind?<br/>
Ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,<br/>
Or where the suns arise, or where descend;<br/>
To right, to left, unheeded take your way,<br/>
While I the dictates of high heaven obey.<br/>
Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,<br/>
And asks no omen but his country's cause.<br/>
But why should'st thou suspect the war's success?<br/>
None fears it more, as none promotes it less:<br/>
Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,<br/>
Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.<br/>
Troy and her sons may find a general grave,<br/>
But thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.<br/>
Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests<br/>
Spread their cold poison through our soldiers' breasts,<br/>
My javelin can revenge so base a part,<br/>
And free the soul that quivers in thy heart."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Furious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,<br/>
Calls on his host; his host obey the call;<br/>
With ardour follow where their leader flies:<br/>
Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.<br/>
Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide,<br/>
And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;<br/>
He fills the Greeks with terror and dismay,<br/>
And gives great Hector the predestined day.<br/>
Strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,<br/>
Close to the works their rigid siege they laid.<br/>
In vain the mounds and massy beams defend,<br/>
While these they undermine, and those they rend;<br/>
Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;<br/>
And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.<br/>
Greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;<br/>
The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,<br/>
Shield touching shield, a long refulgent row;<br/>
Whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.<br/>
The bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower,<br/>
And rouse, with flame divine, the Grecian power.<br/>
The generous impulse every Greek obeys;<br/>
Threats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame,<br/>
And you, whose ardour hopes an equal name!<br/>
Since not alike endued with force or art;<br/>
Behold a day when each may act his part!<br/>
A day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,<br/>
To gain new glories, or augment the old.<br/>
Urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite;<br/>
Drown Hector's vaunts in loud exhorts of fight;<br/>
Conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;<br/>
Seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall;<br/>
So Jove once more may drive their routed train,<br/>
And Troy lie trembling in her walls again."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;<br/>
And now the stones descend in heavier showers.<br/>
As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms,<br/>
And opes his cloudy magazine of storms;<br/>
In winter's bleak uncomfortable reign,<br/>
A snowy inundation hides the plain;<br/>
He stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;<br/>
Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;<br/>
And first the mountain-tops are cover'd o'er,<br/>
Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;<br/>
Bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,<br/>
And one bright waste hides all the works of men:<br/>
The circling seas, alone absorbing all,<br/>
Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:<br/>
So from each side increased the stony rain,<br/>
And the white ruin rises o'er the plain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus godlike Hector and his troops contend<br/>
To force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:<br/>
Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield,<br/>
Till great Sarpedon tower'd amid the field;<br/>
For mighty Jove inspired with martial flame<br/>
His matchless son, and urged him on to fame.<br/>
In arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,<br/>
And bears aloft his ample shield in air;<br/>
Within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll'd,<br/>
Ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold:<br/>
And while two pointed javelins arm his hands,<br/>
Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So press'd with hunger, from the mountain's brow<br/>
Descends a lion on the flocks below;<br/>
So stalks the lordly savage o'er the plain,<br/>
In sullen majesty, and stern disdain:<br/>
In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,<br/>
And shepherds gall him with an iron war;<br/>
Regardless, furious, he pursues his way;<br/>
He foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Resolved alike, divine Sarpedon glows<br/>
With generous rage that drives him on the foes.<br/>
He views the towers, and meditates their fall,<br/>
To sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;<br/>
Then casting on his friend an ardent look,<br/>
Fired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Why boast we, Glaucus! our extended reign,<br/>
Where Xanthus' streams enrich the Lycian plain,<br/>
Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,<br/>
And hills where vines their purple harvest yield,<br/>
Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown'd,<br/>
Our feasts enhanced with music's sprightly sound?<br/>
Why on those shores are we with joy survey'd,<br/>
Admired as heroes, and as gods obey'd,<br/>
Unless great acts superior merit prove,<br/>
And vindicate the bounteous powers above?<br/>
'Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;<br/>
The first in valour, as the first in place;<br/>
That when with wondering eyes our martial bands<br/>
Behold our deeds transcending our commands,<br/>
Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,<br/>
Whom those that envy dare not imitate!<br/>
Could all our care elude the gloomy grave,<br/>
Which claims no less the fearful and the brave,<br/>
For lust of fame I should not vainly dare<br/>
In fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.<br/>
But since, alas! ignoble age must come,<br/>
Disease, and death's inexorable doom,<br/>
The life, which others pay, let us bestow,<br/>
And give to fame what we to nature owe;<br/>
Brave though we fall, and honour'd if we live,<br/>
Or let us glory gain, or glory give!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said; his words the listening chief inspire<br/>
With equal warmth, and rouse the warrior's fire;<br/>
The troops pursue their leaders with delight,<br/>
Rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.<br/>
Menestheus from on high the storm beheld<br/>
Threatening the fort, and blackening in the field:<br/>
Around the walls he gazed, to view from far<br/>
What aid appear'd to avert the approaching war,<br/>
And saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,<br/>
Of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.<br/>
In vain he calls; the din of helms and shields<br/>
Rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,<br/>
The brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,<br/>
Heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground.<br/>
Then thus to Thoos: "Hence with speed (he said),<br/>
And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;<br/>
Their strength, united, best may help to bear<br/>
The bloody labours of the doubtful war:<br/>
Hither the Lycian princes bend their course,<br/>
The best and bravest of the hostile force.<br/>
But if too fiercely there the foes contend,<br/>
Let Telamon, at least, our towers defend,<br/>
And Teucer haste with his unerring bow<br/>
To share the danger, and repel the foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift, at the word, the herald speeds along<br/>
The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,<br/>
And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,<br/>
Opposed in combat on the dusty shore.<br/>
"Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!<br/>
Your aid (said Thoos) Peteus' son demands;<br/>
Your strength, united, best may help to bear<br/>
The bloody labours of the doubtful war:<br/>
Thither the Lycian princes bend their course,<br/>
The best and bravest of the hostile force.<br/>
But if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,<br/>
At least, let Telamon those towers defend,<br/>
And Teucer haste with his unerring bow<br/>
To share the danger, and repel the foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Straight to the fort great Ajax turn'd his care,<br/>
And thus bespoke his brothers of the war:<br/>
"Now, valiant Lycomede! exert your might,<br/>
And, brave Oileus, prove your force in fight;<br/>
To you I trust the fortune of the field,<br/>
Till by this arm the foe shall be repell'd:<br/>
That done, expect me to complete the day.<br/>
Then with his sevenfold shield he strode away.'<br/>
With equal steps bold Teucer press'd the shore,<br/>
Whose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
High on the walls appear'd the Lycian powers,<br/>
Like some black tempest gathering round the towers:<br/>
The Greeks, oppress'd, their utmost force unite,<br/>
Prepared to labour in the unequal fight:<br/>
The war renews, mix'd shouts and groans arise;<br/>
Tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.<br/>
Fierce Ajax first the advancing host invades,<br/>
And sends the brave Epicles to the shades,<br/>
Sarpedon's friend. Across the warrior's way,<br/>
Rent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;<br/>
In modern ages not the strongest swain<br/>
Could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:<br/>
He poised, and swung it round; then toss'd on high,<br/>
It flew with force, and labour'd up the sky;<br/>
Full on the Lycian's helmet thundering down,<br/>
The ponderous ruin crush'd his batter'd crown.<br/>
As skilful divers from some airy steep<br/>
Headlong descend, and shoot into the deep,<br/>
So falls Epicles; then in groans expires,<br/>
And murmuring to the shades the soul retires.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,<br/>
From Teucer's hand a winged arrow flew;<br/>
The bearded shaft the destined passage found,<br/>
And on his naked arm inflicts a wound.<br/>
The chief, who fear'd some foe's insulting boast<br/>
Might stop the progress of his warlike host,<br/>
Conceal'd the wound, and, leaping from his height<br/>
Retired reluctant from the unfinish'd fight.<br/>
Divine Sarpedon with regret beheld<br/>
Disabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;<br/>
His beating breast with generous ardour glows,<br/>
He springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.<br/>
Alcmaon first was doom'd his force to feel;<br/>
Deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;<br/>
Then from the yawning wound with fury tore<br/>
The spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:<br/>
Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,<br/>
His brazen armour rings against the ground.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift to the battlement the victor flies,<br/>
Tugs with full force, and every nerve applies:<br/>
It shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;<br/>
The rolling ruins smoke along the field.<br/>
A mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;<br/>
And, like a deluge, rushes in the war.<br/>
At once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,<br/>
And Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;<br/>
Fix'd in his belt the feather'd weapon stood,<br/>
And through his buckler drove the trembling wood;<br/>
But Jove was present in the dire debate,<br/>
To shield his offspring, and avert his fate.<br/>
The prince gave back, not meditating flight,<br/>
But urging vengeance, and severer fight;<br/>
Then raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms,<br/>
His fainting squadrons to new fury warms.<br/>
"O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?<br/>
Your former fame and ancient virtue lost!<br/>
The breach lies open, but your chief in vain<br/>
Attempts alone the guarded pass to gain:<br/>
Unite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:<br/>
The force of powerful union conquers all."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;<br/>
They join, they thicken, and the assault renew:<br/>
Unmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,<br/>
And fix'd support the weight of all the war;<br/>
Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,<br/>
Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.<br/>
As on the confines of adjoining grounds,<br/>
Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;<br/>
They tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,<br/>
One foot, one inch, of the contended field;<br/>
Thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;<br/>
Nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.<br/>
Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,<br/>
Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;<br/>
The copious slaughter covers all the shore,<br/>
And the high ramparts drip with human gore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,<br/>
From side to side the trembling balance nods,<br/>
(While some laborious matron, just and poor,<br/>
With nice exactness weighs her woolly store,)<br/>
Till poised aloft, the resting beam suspends<br/>
Each equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:<br/>
So stood the war, till Hector's matchless might,<br/>
With fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight.<br/>
Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,<br/>
And fires his host with loud repeated cries.<br/>
"Advance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands,<br/>
Haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!"<br/>
They hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,<br/>
Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:<br/>
Around the works a wood of glittering spears<br/>
Shoots up, and all the rising host appears.<br/>
A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw,<br/>
Pointed above, and rough and gross below:<br/>
Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,<br/>
Such men as live in these degenerate days:<br/>
Yet this, as easy as a swain could bear<br/>
The snowy fleece, he toss'd, and shook in air;<br/>
For Jove upheld, and lighten'd of its load<br/>
The unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.<br/>
Thus arm'd, before the folded gates he came,<br/>
Of massy substance, and stupendous frame;<br/>
With iron bars and brazen hinges strong,<br/>
On lofty beams of solid timber hung:<br/>
Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,<br/>
Drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,<br/>
The folds are shatter'd; from the crackling door<br/>
Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.<br/>
Now rushing in, the furious chief appears,<br/>
Gloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears:<br/>
A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,<br/>
And from his eye-balls flash'd the living flame.<br/>
He moves a god, resistless in his course,<br/>
And seems a match for more than mortal force.<br/>
Then pouring after, through the gaping space,<br/>
A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;<br/>
The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;<br/>
The shore is heap'd with death, and tumult rends the sky.<br/>

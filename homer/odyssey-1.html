<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book I</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
The man for wisdom's various arts renown'd,<br/>
Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound;<br/>
Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall<br/>
Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall,<br/>
Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray'd,<br/>
Their manners noted, and their states survey'd,<br/>
On stormy seas unnumber'd toils he bore,<br/>
Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore:<br/>
Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey<br/>
On herds devoted to the god of day;<br/>
The god vindictive doom'd them never more<br/>
(Ah, men unbless'd!) to touch that natal shore.<br/>
Oh, snatch some portion of these acts from fate,<br/>
Celestial Muse! and to our world relate.
</p>
<p>
Now at their native realms the Greeks arrived;<br/>
All who the wars of ten long years survived;<br/>
And 'scaped the perils of the gulfy main.<br/>
Ulysses, sole of all the victor train,<br/>
An exile from his dear paternal coast,<br/>
Deplored his absent queen and empire lost.<br/>
Calypso in her caves constrain'd his stay,<br/>
With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay;<br/>
In vain-for now the circling years disclose<br/>
The day predestined to reward his woes.<br/>
At length his Ithaca is given by fate,<br/>
Where yet new labours his arrival wait;<br/>
At length their rage the hostile powers restrain,<br/>
All but the ruthless monarch of the main.<br/>
But now the god, remote, a heavenly guest,<br/>
In Æthiopia graced the genial feast<br/>
(A race divided, whom with sloping rays<br/>
The rising and descending sun surveys);<br/>
There on the world's extremest verge revered<br/>
With hecatombs and prayer in pomp preferr'd,<br/>
Distant he lay: while in the bright abodes<br/>
Of high Olympus, Jove convened the gods:<br/>
The assembly thus the sire supreme address'd,<br/>
AEgysthus' fate revolving in his breast,<br/>
Whom young Orestes to the dreary coast<br/>
Of Pluto sent, a blood-polluted ghost.
</p>
<p>
"Perverse mankind! whose wills, created free,<br/>
Charge all their woes on absolute degree;<br/>
All to the dooming gods their guilt translate,<br/>
And follies are miscall'd the crimes of fate.<br/>
When to his lust AEgysthus gave the rein,<br/>
Did fate, or we, the adulterous act constrain?<br/>
Did fate, or we, when great Atrides died,<br/>
Urge the bold traitor to the regicide?<br/>
Hermes I sent, while yet his soul remain'd<br/>
Sincere from royal blood, and faith profaned;<br/>
To warn the wretch, that young Orestes, grown<br/>
To manly years, should re-assert the throne.<br/>
Yet, impotent of mind, and uncontroll'd,<br/>
He plunged into the gulf which Heaven foretold."
</p>
<p>
Here paused the god; and pensive thus replies<br/>
Minerva, graceful with her azure eyes:
</p>
<p>
"O thou! from whom the whole creation springs,<br/>
The source of power on earth derived to kings!<br/>
His death was equal to the direful deed;<br/>
So may the man of blood be doomed to bleed!<br/>
But grief and rage alternate wound my breast<br/>
For brave Ulysses, still by fate oppress'd.<br/>
Amidst an isle, around whose rocky shore<br/>
The forests murmur, and the surges roar,<br/>
The blameless hero from his wish'd-for home<br/>
A goddess guards in her enchanted dome;<br/>
(Atlas her sire, to whose far-piercing eye<br/>
The wonders of the deep expanded lie;<br/>
The eternal columns which on earth he rears<br/>
End in the starry vault, and prop the spheres).<br/>
By his fair daughter is the chief confined,<br/>
Who soothes to dear delight his anxious mind;<br/>
Successless all her soft caresses prove,<br/>
To banish from his breast his country's love;<br/>
To see the smoke from his loved palace rise,<br/>
While the dear isle in distant prospect lies,<br/>
With what contentment could he close his eyes!<br/>
And will Omnipotence neglect to save<br/>
The suffering virtue of the wise and brave?<br/>
Must he, whose altars on the Phrygian shore<br/>
With frequent rites, and pure, avow'd thy power,<br/>
Be doom'd the worst of human ills to prove,<br/>
Unbless'd, abandon'd to the wrath of Jove?"
</p>
<p>
"Daughter! what words have pass'd thy lips unweigh'd!<br/>
(Replied the Thunderer to the martial maid;)<br/>
Deem not unjustly by my doom oppress'd,<br/>
Of human race the wisest and the best.<br/>
Neptune, by prayer repentant rarely won,<br/>
Afflicts the chief, to avenge his giant son,<br/>
Whose visual orb Ulysses robb'd of light;<br/>
Great Polypheme, of more than mortal might?<br/>
Him young Thousa bore (the bright increase<br/>
Of Phorcys, dreaded in the sounds and seas);<br/>
Whom Neptune eyed with bloom of beauty bless'd,<br/>
And in his cave the yielding nymph compress'd<br/>
For this the god constrains the Greek to roam,<br/>
A hopeless exile from his native home,<br/>
From death alone exempt&mdash;but cease to mourn;<br/>
Let all combine to achieve his wish'd return;<br/>
Neptune atoned, his wrath shall now refrain,<br/>
Or thwart the synod of the gods in vain."
</p>
<p>
"Father and king adored!" Minerva cried,<br/>
"Since all who in the Olympian bower reside<br/>
Now make the wandering Greek their public care,<br/>
Let Hermes to the Atlantic isle repair;<br/>
Bid him, arrived in bright Calypso's court,<br/>
The sanction of the assembled powers report:<br/>
That wise Ulysses to his native land<br/>
Must speed, obedient to their high command.<br/>
Meantime Telemachus, the blooming heir<br/>
Of sea-girt Ithaca, demands my care;<br/>
'Tis mine to form his green, unpractised years<br/>
In sage debates; surrounded with his peers,<br/>
To save the state, and timely to restrain<br/>
The bold intrusion of the suitor-train;<br/>
Who crowd his palace, and with lawless power<br/>
His herds and flocks in feastful rites devour.<br/>
To distant Sparta, and the spacious waste<br/>
Of Sandy Pyle, the royal youth shall haste.<br/>
There, warm with filial love, the cause inquire<br/>
That from his realm retards his god-like sire;<br/>
Delivering early to the voice of fame<br/>
The promise of a green immortal name."
</p>
<p>
She said: the sandals of celestial mould,<br/>
Fledged with ambrosial plumes, and rich with gold,<br/>
Surround her feet: with these sublime she sails<br/>
The aërial space, and mounts the winged gales;<br/>
O'er earth and ocean wide prepared to soar,<br/>
Her dreaded arm a beamy javelin bore,<br/>
Ponderous and vast: which, when her fury burns,<br/>
Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.<br/>
From high Olympus prone her flight she bends,<br/>
And in the realms of Ithaca descends,<br/>
Her lineaments divine, the grave disguise<br/>
Of Mentes' form conceal'd from human eyes<br/>
(Mentes, the monarch of the Taphian land);<br/>
A glittering spear waved awful in her hand.<br/>
There in the portal placed, the heaven-born maid<br/>
Enormous riot and misrule survey'd.<br/>
On hides of beeves, before the palace gate<br/>
(Sad spoils of luxury), the suitors sate.<br/>
With rival art, and ardour in their mien,<br/>
At chess they vie, to captivate the queen;<br/>
Divining of their loves. Attending nigh,<br/>
A menial train the flowing bowl supply.<br/>
Others, apart, the spacious hall prepare,<br/>
And form the costly feast with busy care.<br/>
There young Telemachus, his bloomy face<br/>
Glowing celestial sweet, with godlike grace<br/>
Amid the circle shines: but hope and fear<br/>
(Painful vicissitude!) his bosom tear.<br/>
Now, imaged in his mind, he sees restored<br/>
In peace and joy the people's rightful lord;<br/>
The proud oppressors fly the vengeful sword.<br/>
While his fond soul these fancied triumphs swell'd,<br/>
The stranger guest the royal youth beheld;<br/>
Grieved that a visitant so long should wait<br/>
Unmark'd, unhonour'd, at a monarch's gate;<br/>
Instant he flew with hospitable haste,<br/>
And the new friend with courteous air embraced.<br/>
"Stranger, whoe'er thou art, securely rest,<br/>
Affianced in my faith, a ready guest;<br/>
Approach the dome, the social banquet share,<br/>
And then the purpose of thy soul declare."
</p>
<p>
Thus affable and mild, the prince precedes,<br/>
And to the dome the unknown celestial leads.<br/>
The spear receiving from the hand, he placed<br/>
Against a column, fair with sculpture graced;<br/>
Where seemly ranged in peaceful order stood<br/>
Ulysses' arms now long disused to blood.<br/>
He led the goddess to the sovereign seat,<br/>
Her feet supported with a stool of state<br/>
(A purple carpet spread the pavement wide);<br/>
Then drew his seat, familiar, to her side;<br/>
Far from the suitor-train, a brutal crowd,<br/>
With insolence, and wine, elate and loud:<br/>
Where the free guest, unnoted, might relate,<br/>
If haply conscious, of his father's fate.<br/>
The golden ewer a maid obsequious brings,<br/>
Replenish'd from the cool, translucent springs;<br/>
With copious water the bright vase supplies<br/>
A silver laver of capacious size;<br/>
They wash. The tables in fair order spread,<br/>
They heap the glittering canisters with bread:<br/>
Viands of various kinds allure the taste,<br/>
Of choicest sort and savour, rich repast!<br/>
Delicious wines the attending herald brought;<br/>
The gold gave lustre to the purple draught.<br/>
Lured with the vapour of the fragrant feast,<br/>
In rush'd the suitors with voracious haste;<br/>
Marshall'd in order due, to each a sewer<br/>
Presents, to bathe his hands, a radiant ewer.<br/>
Luxurious then they feast. Observant round<br/>
Gay stripling youths the brimming goblets crown'd.<br/>
The rage of hunger quell'd, they all advance<br/>
And form to measured airs the mazy dance;<br/>
To Phemius was consign'd the chorded lyre,<br/>
Whose hand reluctant touch'd the warbling wire;<br/>
Phemius, whose voice divine could sweetest sing<br/>
High strains responsive to the vocal string.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in whispers to his heavenly guest<br/>
His indignation thus the prince express'd:
</p>
<p>
"Indulge my rising grief, whilst these (my friend)<br/>
With song and dance the pompous revel end.<br/>
Light is the dance, and doubly sweet the lays,<br/>
When for the dear delight another pays.<br/>
His treasured stores those cormarants consume,<br/>
Whose bones, defrauded of a regal tomb<br/>
And common turf, lie naked on the plain,<br/>
Or doom'd to welter in the whelming main.<br/>
Should he return, that troop so blithe and bold,<br/>
With purple robes inwrought, and stiff with gold,<br/>
Precipitant in fear would wing their flight,<br/>
And curse their cumbrous pride's unwieldy weight.<br/>
But ah, I dream!-the appointed hour is fled.<br/>
And hope, too long with vain delusion fed,<br/>
Deaf to the rumour of fallacious fame,<br/>
Gives to the roll of death his glorious name!<br/>
With venial freedom let me now demand<br/>
Thy name, thy lineage, and paternal land;<br/>
Sincere from whence began thy course, recite,<br/>
And to what ship I owe the friendly freight?<br/>
Now first to me this visit dost thou deign,<br/>
Or number'd in my father's social train?<br/>
All who deserved his choice he made his own,<br/>
And, curious much to know, he far was known."
</p>
<p>
"My birth I boast (the blue-eyed virgin cries)<br/>
From great Anchialus, renown'd and wise;<br/>
Mentes my name; I rule the Taphian race,<br/>
Whose bounds the deep circumfluent waves embrace;<br/>
A duteous people, and industrious isle,<br/>
To naval arts inured, and stormy toil.<br/>
Freighted with iron from my native land,<br/>
I steer my voyage to the Brutian strand<br/>
To gain by commerce, for the labour'd mass,<br/>
A just proportion of refulgent brass.<br/>
Far from your capital my ship resides<br/>
At Reitorus, and secure at anchor rides;<br/>
Where waving groves on airy Neign grow,<br/>
Supremely tall and shade the deeps below.<br/>
Thence to revisit your imperial dome,<br/>
An old hereditary guest I come;<br/>
Your father's friend. Laertes can relate<br/>
Our faith unspotted, and its early date;<br/>
Who, press'd with heart-corroding grief and years,<br/>
To the gay court a rural shed prefers,<br/>
Where, sole of all his train, a matron sage<br/>
Supports with homely fond his drooping age,<br/>
With feeble steps from marshalling his vines<br/>
Returning sad, when toilsome day declines.
</p>
<p>
"With friendly speed, induced by erring fame,<br/>
To hail Ulysses' safe return I came;<br/>
But still the frown of some celestial power<br/>
With envious joy retards the blissful hour.<br/>
Let not your soul be sunk in sad despair;<br/>
He lives, he breathes this heavenly vital air,<br/>
Among a savage race, whose shelfy bounds<br/>
With ceaseless roar the foaming deep surrounds.<br/>
The thoughts which roll within my ravish'd breast,<br/>
To me, no seer, the inspiring gods suggest;<br/>
Nor skill'd nor studious, with prophetic eye<br/>
To judge the winged omens of the sky.<br/>
Yet hear this certain speech, nor deem it vain;<br/>
Though adamantine bonds the chief restrain,<br/>
The dire restraint his wisdom will defeat,<br/>
And soon restore him to his regal seat.<br/>
But generous youth! sincere and free declare,<br/>
Are you, of manly growth, his royal heir?<br/>
For sure Ulysses in your look appears,<br/>
The same his features, if the same his years.<br/>
Such was that face, on which I dwelt with joy<br/>
Ere Greece assembled stemm'd the tides to Troy;<br/>
But, parting then for that detested shore,<br/>
Our eyes, unhappy never greeted more."
</p>
<p>
"To prove a genuine birth (the prince replies)<br/>
On female truth assenting faith relies.<br/>
Thus manifest of right, I build my claim<br/>
Sure-founded on a fair maternal fame,<br/>
Ulysses' son: but happier he, whom fate<br/>
Hath placed beneath the storms which toss the great!<br/>
Happier the son, whose hoary sire is bless'd<br/>
With humble affluence, and domestic rest!<br/>
Happier than I, to future empire born,<br/>
But doom'd a father's wretch'd fate to mourn!"
</p>
<p>
To whom, with aspect mild, the guest divine:<br/>
"Oh true descendant of a sceptred line!<br/>
The gods a glorious fate from anguish free<br/>
To chaste Penelope's increase decree.<br/>
But say, yon jovial troops so gaily dress'd,<br/>
Is this a bridal or a friendly feast?<br/>
Or from their deed I rightlier may divine,<br/>
Unseemly flown with insolence and wine?<br/>
Unwelcome revellers, whose lawless joy<br/>
Pains the sage ear, and hurts the sober eye."
</p>
<p>
"Magnificence of old (the prince replied)<br/>
Beneath our roof with virtue could reside;<br/>
Unblamed abundance crowned the royal board,<br/>
What time this dome revered her prudent lord;<br/>
Who now (so Heaven decrees) is doom'd to mourn,<br/>
Bitter constraint, erroneous and forlorn.<br/>
Better the chief, on Ilion's hostile plain,<br/>
Had fall'n surrounded with his warlike train;<br/>
Or safe return'd, the race of glory pass'd,<br/>
New to his friends' embrace, and breathed his last!<br/>
Then grateful Greece with streaming eyes would raise,<br/>
Historic marbles to record his praise;<br/>
His praise, eternal on the faithful stone,<br/>
Had with transmissive honour graced his son.<br/>
Now snatch'd by harpies to the dreary coast.<br/>
Sunk is the hero, and his glory lost;<br/>
Vanish'd at once! unheard of, and unknown!<br/>
And I his heir in misery alone.<br/>
Nor for a dear lost father only flow<br/>
The filial tears, but woe succeeds to woe<br/>
To tempt the spouseless queen with amorous wiles<br/>
Resort the nobles from the neighbouring isles;<br/>
From Samos, circled with the Ionian main,<br/>
Dulichium, and Zacynthas' sylvan reign;<br/>
Ev'n with presumptuous hope her bed to ascend,<br/>
The lords of Ithaca their right pretend.<br/>
She seems attentive to their pleaded vows,<br/>
Her heart detesting what her ear allows.<br/>
They, vain expectants of the bridal hour,<br/>
My stores in riotous expense devour.<br/>
In feast and dance the mirthful months employ,<br/>
And meditate my doom to crown their joy."
</p>
<p>
With tender pity touch'd, the goddess cried:<br/>
"Soon may kind Heaven a sure relief provide,<br/>
Soon may your sire discharge the vengeance due,<br/>
And all your wrongs the proud oppressors rue!<br/>
Oh! in that portal should the chief appear,<br/>
Each hand tremendous with a brazen spear,<br/>
In radiant panoply his limbs incased<br/>
(For so of old my father's court he graced,<br/>
When social mirth unbent his serious soul,<br/>
O'er the full banquet, and the sprightly bowl);<br/>
He then from Ephyre, the fair domain<br/>
Of Ilus, sprung from Jason's royal strain,<br/>
Measured a length of seas, a toilsome length, in vain.<br/>
For, voyaging to learn the direful art<br/>
To taint with deadly drugs the barbed dart;<br/>
Observant of the gods, and sternly just,<br/>
Ilus refused to impart the baneful trust;<br/>
With friendlier zeal my father's soul was fired,<br/>
The drugs he knew, and gave the boon desired.<br/>
Appear'd he now with such heroic port,<br/>
As then conspicuous at the Taphian court;<br/>
Soon should yon boasters cease their haughty strife,<br/>
Or each atone his guilty love with life.<br/>
But of his wish'd return the care resign,<br/>
Be future vengeance to the powers divine.<br/>
My sentence hear: with stern distaste avow'd,<br/>
To their own districts drive the suitor-crowd;<br/>
When next the morning warms the purple east,<br/>
Convoke the peerage, and the gods attest;<br/>
The sorrows of your inmost soul relate;<br/>
And form sure plans to save the sinking state.<br/>
Should second love a pleasing flame inspire,<br/>
And the chaste queen connubial rights require;<br/>
Dismiss'd with honour, let her hence repair<br/>
To great Icarius, whose paternal care<br/>
Will guide her passion, and reward her choice<br/>
With wealthy dower, and bridal gifts of price.<br/>
Then let this dictate of my love prevail:<br/>
Instant, to foreign realms prepare to sail,<br/>
To learn your father's fortunes; Fame may prove,<br/>
Or omen'd voice (the messenger of Jove),<br/>
Propitious to the search. Direct your toil<br/>
Through the wide ocean first to sandy Pyle;<br/>
Of Nestor, hoary sage, his doom demand:<br/>
Thence speed your voyage to the Spartan strand;<br/>
For young Atrides to the Achaian coast<br/>
Arrived the last of all the victor host.<br/>
If yet Ulysses views the light, forbear,<br/>
Till the fleet hours restore the circling year.<br/>
But if his soul hath wing'd the destined flight,<br/>
Inhabitant of deep disastrous night;<br/>
Homeward with pious speed repass the main,<br/>
To the pale shade funereal rites ordain,<br/>
Plant the fair column o'er the vacant grave,<br/>
A hero's honours let the hero have.<br/>
With decent grief the royal dead deplored,<br/>
For the chaste queen select an equal lord.<br/>
Then let revenge your daring mind employ,<br/>
By fraud or force the suitor train destroy,<br/>
And starting into manhood, scorn the boy.<br/>
Hast thou not heard how young Orestes, fired<br/>
With great revenge, immortal praise acquired?<br/>
His virgin-sword AEgysthus' veins imbrued;<br/>
The murderer fell, and blood atoned for blood.<br/>
O greatly bless'd with every blooming grace!<br/>
With equal steps the paths of glory trace;<br/>
Join to that royal youth's your rival name,<br/>
And shine eternal in the sphere of fame.<br/>
But my associates now my stay deplore,<br/>
Impatient on the hoarse-resounding shore.<br/>
Thou, heedful of advice, secure proceed;<br/>
My praise the precept is, be thine the deed.
</p>
<p>
"The counsel of my friend (the youth rejoin'd)<br/>
Imprints conviction on my grateful mind.<br/>
So fathers speak (persuasive speech and mild)<br/>
Their sage experience to the favourite child.<br/>
But, since to part, for sweet refection due,<br/>
The genial viands let my train renew;<br/>
And the rich pledge of plighted faith receive,<br/>
Worthy the heir of Ithaca to give."
</p>
<p>
"Defer the promised boon (the goddess cries,<br/>
Celestial azure brightening in her eyes),<br/>
And let me now regain the Reithrian port;<br/>
From Temese return'd, your royal court<br/>
I shall revisit, and that pledge receive;<br/>
And gifts, memorial of our friendship, leave."
</p>
<p>
Abrupt, with eagle-speed she cut the sky;<br/>
Instant invisible to mortal eye.<br/>
Then first he recognized the ethereal guest;<br/>
Wonder and joy alternate fire his breast;<br/>
Heroic thoughts, infused, his heart dilate;<br/>
Revolving much his father's doubtful fate.<br/>
At length, composed, he join'd the suitor-throng;<br/>
Hush'd in attention to the warbled song.<br/>
His tender theme the charming lyrist chose.<br/>
Minerva's anger, and the dreadful woes<br/>
Which voyaging from Troy the victors bore,<br/>
While storms vindictive intercept the store.<br/>
The shrilling airs the vaulted roof rebounds,<br/>
Reflecting to the queen the silver sounds.<br/>
With grief renew'd the weeping fair descends;<br/>
Their sovereign's step a virgin train attends:<br/>
A veil, of richest texture wrought, she wears,<br/>
And silent to the joyous hall repairs.<br/>
There from the portal, with her mild command,<br/>
Thus gently checks the minstrel's tuneful hand:
</p>
<p>
"Phemius! let acts of gods, and heroes old,<br/>
What ancient bards in hall and bower have told,<br/>
Attemper'd to the lyre, your voice employ;<br/>
Such the pleased ear will drink with silent joy.<br/>
But, oh! forbear that dear disastrous name,<br/>
To sorrow sacred, and secure of fame;<br/>
My bleeding bosom sickens at the sound,<br/>
And every piercing note inflicts a wound."
</p>
<p>
"Why, dearest object of my duteous love,<br/>
(Replied the prince,) will you the bard reprove?<br/>
Oft, Jove's ethereal rays (resistless fire)<br/>
The chanter's soul and raptured song inspire<br/>
Instinct divine? nor blame severe his choice,<br/>
Warbling the Grecian woes with heart and voice;<br/>
For novel lays attract our ravish'd ears;<br/>
But old, the mind with inattention hears:<br/>
Patient permit the sadly pleasing strain;<br/>
Familiar now with grief, your tears refrain,<br/>
And in the public woe forget your own;<br/>
You weep not for a perish'd lord alone.<br/>
What Greeks new wandering in the Stygian gloom,<br/>
Wish your Ulysses shared an equal doom!<br/>
Your widow'd hours, apart, with female toil<br/>
And various labours of the loom beguile;<br/>
There rule, from palace-cares remote and free;<br/>
That care to man belongs, and most to me."
</p>
<p>
Mature beyond his years, the queen admires<br/>
His sage reply, and with her train retires.<br/>
Then swelling sorrows burst their former bounds,<br/>
With echoing grief afresh the dome resounds;<br/>
Till Pallas, piteous of her plaintive cries,<br/>
In slumber closed her silver-streaming eyes.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, rekindled at the royal charms,<br/>
Tumultuous love each beating bosom warms;<br/>
Intemperate rage a wordy war began;<br/>
But bold Telemachus assumed the man.<br/>
"Instant (he cried) your female discord end,<br/>
Ye deedless boasters! and the song attend;<br/>
Obey that sweet compulsion, nor profane<br/>
With dissonance the smooth melodious strain.<br/>
Pacific now prolong the jovial feast;<br/>
But when the dawn reveals the rosy east,<br/>
I, to the peers assembled, shall propose<br/>
The firm resolve, I here in few disclose;<br/>
No longer live the cankers of my court;<br/>
All to your several states with speed resort;<br/>
Waste in wild riot what your land allows,<br/>
There ply the early feast, and late carouse.<br/>
But if, to honour lost, 'tis still decreed<br/>
For you my bowl shall flow, my flock shall bleed;<br/>
Judge and revenge my right, impartial Jove!<br/>
By him and all the immortal thrones above<br/>
(A sacred oath), each proud oppressor slain,<br/>
Shall with inglorious gore this marble stain."
</p>
<p>
Awed by the prince, thus haughty, bold, and young,<br/>
Rage gnaw'd the lip, and wonder chain'd the tongue.<br/>
Silence at length the gay Antinous broke,<br/>
Constrain'd a smile, and thus ambiguous spoke:<br/>
"What god to your untutor'd youth affords<br/>
This headlong torrent of amazing words?<br/>
May Jove delay thy reign, and cumber late<br/>
So bright a genius with the toils of state!"
</p>
<p>
"Those toils (Telemachus serene replies)<br/>
Have charms, with all their weight, t'allure the wise.<br/>
Fast by the throne obsequious fame resides,<br/>
And wealth incessant rolls her golden tides.<br/>
Nor let Antinous rage, if strong desire<br/>
Of wealth and fame a youthful bosom fire:<br/>
Elect by Jove, his delegate of sway,<br/>
With joyous pride the summons I'd obey.<br/>
Whene'er Ulysses roams the realm of night,<br/>
Should factious power dispute my lineal right,<br/>
Some other Greeks a fairer claim may plead;<br/>
To your pretence their title would precede.<br/>
At least, the sceptre lost, I still should reign<br/>
Sole o'er my vassals, and domestic train."
</p>
<p>
To this Eurymachus: "To Heaven alone<br/>
Refer the choice to fill the vacant throne.<br/>
Your patrimonial stores in peace possess;<br/>
Undoubted, all your filial claim confess:<br/>
Your private right should impious power invade,<br/>
The peers of Ithaca would arm in aid.<br/>
But say, that stranger guest who late withdrew,<br/>
What and from whence? his name and lineage shew.<br/>
His grave demeanour and majestic grace<br/>
Speak him descended of no vulgar race:<br/>
Did he some loan of ancient right require,<br/>
Or came forerunner of your sceptr'd sire?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh son of Polybus!" the prince replies,<br/>
"No more my sire will glad these longing eyes;<br/>
The queen's fond hope inventive rumour cheers,<br/>
Or vain diviners' dreams divert her fears.<br/>
That stranger-guest the Taphian realm obeys,<br/>
A realm defended with encircling seas.<br/>
Mentes, an ever-honour'd name, of old<br/>
High in Ulysses' social list enroll'd."
</p>
<p>
Thus he, though conscious of the ethereal guest,<br/>
Answer'd evasive of the sly request.<br/>
Meantime the lyre rejoins the sprightly lay;<br/>
Love-dittied airs, and dance, conclude the day<br/>
But when the star of eve with golden light<br/>
Adorn'd the matron brow of sable night,<br/>
The mirthful train dispersing quit the court,<br/>
And to their several domes to rest resort.<br/>
A towering structure to the palace join'd;<br/>
To this his steps the thoughtful prince inclined:<br/>
In his pavilion there, to sleep repairs;<br/>
The lighted torch, the sage Euryclea bears<br/>
(Daughter of Ops, the just Pisenor's son,<br/>
For twenty beeves by great Laertes won;<br/>
In rosy prime with charms attractive graced,<br/>
Honour'd by him, a gentle lord and chaste,<br/>
With dear esteem: too wise, with jealous strife<br/>
To taint the joys of sweet connubial life.<br/>
Sole with Telemachus her service ends,<br/>
A child she nursed him, and a man attends).<br/>
Whilst to his couch himself the prince address'd,<br/>
The duteous dame received the purple vest;<br/>
The purple vest with decent care disposed,<br/>
The silver ring she pull'd, the door reclosed,<br/>
The bolt, obedient to the silken cord,<br/>
To the strong staple's inmost depth restored,<br/>
Secured the valves. There, wrapped in silent shade,<br/>
Pensive, the rules the goddess gave he weigh'd;<br/>
Stretch'd on the downy fleece, no rest he knows,<br/>
And in his raptured soul the vision glows.

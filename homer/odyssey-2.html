<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book II</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Now reddening from the dawn, the morning ray<br/>
Glow'd in the front of heaven, and gave the day<br/>
The youthful hero, with returning light,<br/>
Rose anxious from the inquietudes of night.<br/>
A royal robe he wore with graceful pride,<br/>
A two-edged falchion threaten'd by his side,<br/>
Embroider'd sandals glitter'd as he trod,<br/>
And forth he moved, majestic as a god.<br/>
Then by his heralds, restless of delay,<br/>
To council calls the peers: the peers obey.<br/>
Soon as in solemn form the assembly sate,<br/>
From his high dome himself descends in state.<br/>
Bright in his hand a ponderous javelin shined;<br/>
Two dogs, a faithful guard, attend behind;<br/>
Pallas with grace divine his form improves,<br/>
And gazing crowds admire him as he moves,
</p>
<p>
His father's throne he fill'd; while distant stood<br/>
The hoary peers, and aged wisdom bow'd.
</p>
<p>
'Twas silence all. At last AEgyptius spoke;<br/>
AEgyptius, by his age and sorrow broke;<br/>
A length of days his soul with prudence crown'd,<br/>
A length of days had bent him to the ground.<br/>
His eldest hope in arms to Ilion came,<br/>
By great Ulysses taught the path to fame;<br/>
But (hapless youth) the hideous Cyclops tore<br/>
His quivering limbs, and quaff'd his spouting gore.<br/>
Three sons remain'd; to climb with haughty fires<br/>
The royal bed, Eurynomus aspires;<br/>
The rest with duteous love his griefs assuage,<br/>
And ease the sire of half the cares of age.<br/>
Yet still his Antiphus he loves, he mourns,<br/>
And, as he stood, he spoke and wept by turns,
</p>
<p>
"Since great Ulysses sought the Phrygian plains,<br/>
Within these walls inglorious silence reigns.<br/>
Say then, ye peers! by whose commands we meet?<br/>
Why here once more in solemn council sit?<br/>
Ye young, ye old, the weighty cause disclose:<br/>
Arrives some message of invading foes?<br/>
Or say, does high necessity of state<br/>
Inspire some patriot, and demand debate?<br/>
The present synod speaks its author wise;<br/>
Assist him, Jove, thou regent of the skies!"
</p>
<p>
He spoke. Telemachus with transport glows,<br/>
Embraced the omen, and majestic rose<br/>
(His royal hand the imperial sceptre sway'd);<br/>
Then thus, addressing to AEgyptius, said:
</p>
<p>
"Reverend old man! lo here confess'd he stands<br/>
By whom ye meet; my grief your care demands.<br/>
No story I unfold of public woes,<br/>
Nor bear advices of impending foes:<br/>
Peace the blest land, and joys incessant crown:<br/>
Of all this happy realm, I grieve alone.<br/>
For my lost sire continual sorrows spring,<br/>
The great, the good; your father and your king.<br/>
Yet more; our house from its foundation bows,<br/>
Our foes are powerful, and your sons the foes;<br/>
Hither, unwelcome to the queen, they come;<br/>
Why seek they not the rich Icarian dome?<br/>
If she must wed, from other hands require<br/>
The dowry: is Telemachus her sire?<br/>
Yet through my court the noise of revel rings,<br/>
And waste the wise frugality of kings.<br/>
Scarce all my herds their luxury suffice;<br/>
Scarce all my wine their midnight hours supplies.<br/>
Safe in my youth, in riot still they grow,<br/>
Nor in the helpless orphan dread a foe.<br/>
But come it will, the time when manhood grants<br/>
More powerful advocates than vain complaints.<br/>
Approach that hour! insufferable wrong<br/>
Cries to the gods, and vengeance sleeps too long.<br/>
Rise then, ye peers! with virtuous anger rise;<br/>
Your fame revere, but most the avenging skies.<br/>
By all the deathless powers that reign above,<br/>
By righteous Themis and by thundering Jove<br/>
(Themis, who gives to councils, or denies<br/>
Success; and humbles, or confirms the wise),<br/>
Rise in my aid! suffice the tears that flow<br/>
For my lost sire, nor add new woe to woe.<br/>
If e'er he bore the sword to strengthen ill,<br/>
Or, having power to wrong, betray'd the will,<br/>
On me, on me your kindled wrath assuage,<br/>
And bid the voice of lawless riot rage.<br/>
If ruin to your royal race ye doom,<br/>
Be you the spoilers, and our wealth consume.<br/>
Then might we hope redress from juster laws,<br/>
And raise all Ithaca to aid our cause:<br/>
But while your sons commit the unpunish'd wrong,<br/>
You make the arm of violence too strong."
</p>
<p>
While thus he spoke, with rage and grief he frown'd,<br/>
And dash'd the imperial sceptre to the ground.<br/>
The big round tear hung trembling in his eye:<br/>
The synod grieved, and gave a pitying sigh,<br/>
Then silent sate&mdash;at length Antinous burns<br/>
With haughty rage, and sternly thus returns:
</p>
<p>
"O insolence of youth! whose tongue affords<br/>
Such railing eloquence, and war of words.<br/>
Studious thy country's worthies to defame,<br/>
Thy erring voice displays thy mother's shame.<br/>
Elusive of the bridal day, she gives<br/>
Fond hopes to all, and all with hopes deceives.<br/>
Did not the sun, through heaven's wide azure roll'd,<br/>
For three long years the royal fraud behold?<br/>
While she, laborious in delusion, spread<br/>
The spacious loom, and mix'd the various thread:<br/>
Where as to life the wondrous figures rise,<br/>
Thus spoke the inventive queen, with artful sighs:
</p>
<p>
"Though cold in death Ulysses breathes no more,<br/>
Cease yet awhile to urge the bridal hour:<br/>
Cease, till to great Laertes I bequeath<br/>
A task of grief, his ornaments of death.<br/>
Lest when the Fates his royal ashes claim,<br/>
The Grecian matrons taint my spotless fame;<br/>
When he, whom living mighty realms obey'd,<br/>
Shall want in death a shroud to grace his shade.'
</p>
<p>
"Thus she: at once the generous train complies,<br/>
Nor fraud mistrusts in virtue's fair disguise.<br/>
The work she plied; but, studious of delay,<br/>
By night reversed the labours of the day.<br/>
While thrice the sun his annual journey made,<br/>
The conscious lamp the midnight fraud survey'd;<br/>
Unheard, unseen, three years her arts prevail;<br/>
The fourth her maid unfolds the amazing tale.<br/>
We saw, as unperceived we took our stand,<br/>
The backward labours of her faithless hand.<br/>
Then urged, she perfects her illustrious toils;<br/>
A wondrous monument of female wiles!
</p>
<p>
"But you, O peers! and thou, O prince! give ear<br/>
(I speak aloud, that every Greek may hear):<br/>
Dismiss the queen; and if her sire approves<br/>
Let him espouse her to the peer she loves:<br/>
Bid instant to prepare the bridal train,<br/>
Nor let a race of princes wait in vain.<br/>
Though with a grace divine her soul is blest,<br/>
And all Minerva breathes within her breast,<br/>
In wondrous arts than woman more renown'd,<br/>
And more than woman with deep wisdom crown'd;<br/>
Though Tyro nor Mycene match her name,<br/>
Not great Alcmena (the proud boasts of fame);<br/>
Yet thus by heaven adorn'd, by heaven's decree<br/>
She shines with fatal excellence, to thee:<br/>
With thee, the bowl we drain, indulge the feast,<br/>
Till righteous heaven reclaim her stubborn breast.<br/>
What though from pole to pole resounds her name!<br/>
The son's destruction waits the mother's fame:<br/>
For, till she leaves thy court, it is decreed,<br/>
Thy bowl to empty and thy flock to bleed."
</p>
<p>
While yet he speaks, Telemachus replies:<br/>
"Ev'n nature starts, and what ye ask denies.<br/>
Thus, shall I thus repay a mother's cares,<br/>
Who gave me life, and nursed my infant years!<br/>
While sad on foreign shores Ulysses treads.<br/>
Or glides a ghost with unapparent shades;<br/>
How to Icarius in the bridal hour<br/>
Shall I, by waste undone, refund the dower?<br/>
How from my father should I vengeance dread!<br/>
How would my mother curse my hated head!<br/>
And while in wrath to vengeful fiends she cries,<br/>
How from their hell would vengeful fiends arise!<br/>
Abhorr'd by all, accursed my name would grow,<br/>
The earth's disgrace, and human-kind my foe.<br/>
If this displease, why urge ye here your stay?<br/>
Haste from the court, ye spoilers, haste away:<br/>
Waste in wild riot what your land allows,<br/>
There ply the early feast, and late carouse.<br/>
But if to honour lost, 'tis still decreed<br/>
For you my bowl shall flow, my flocks shall bleed;<br/>
Judge, and assert my right, impartial Jove!<br/>
By him, and all the immortal host above<br/>
(A sacred oath), if heaven the power supply,<br/>
Vengeance I vow, and for your wrongs ye die."
</p>
<p>
With that, two eagles from a mountain's height<br/>
By Jove's command direct their rapid flight;<br/>
Swift they descend, with wing to wing conjoin'd,<br/>
Stretch their broad plumes, and float upon the wind.<br/>
Above the assembled peers they wheel on high,<br/>
And clang their wings, and hovering beat the sky;<br/>
With ardent eyes the rival train they threat,<br/>
And shrieking loud denounce approaching fate.<br/>
They cuff, they tear; their cheeks and neck they rend,<br/>
And from their plumes huge drops of blood descend;<br/>
Then sailing o'er the domes and towers, they fly,<br/>
Full toward the east, and mount into the sky.
</p>
<p>
The wondering rivals gaze, with cares oppress'd,<br/>
And chilling horrors freeze in every breast,<br/>
Till big with knowledge of approaching woes,<br/>
The prince of augurs, Halitherses, rose:<br/>
Prescient he view'd the aërial tracks, and drew<br/>
A sure presage from every wing that flew.
</p>
<p>
"Ye sons (he cried) of Ithaca, give ear;<br/>
Hear all! but chiefly you, O rivals! hear.<br/>
Destruction sure o'er all your heads impends<br/>
Ulysses comes, and death his steps attends.<br/>
Nor to the great alone is death decreed;<br/>
We and our guilty Ithaca must bleed.<br/>
Why cease we then the wrath of heaven to stay?<br/>
Be humbled all, and lead, ye great! the way.<br/>
For lo my words no fancied woes relate;<br/>
I speak from science and the voice of fate.
</p>
<p>
"When great Ulysses sought the Phrygian shores<br/>
To shake with war proud Ilion's lofty towers,<br/>
Deeds then undone my faithful tongue foretold:<br/>
Heaven seal'd my words, and you those deeds behold.<br/>
I see (I cried) his woes, a countless train;<br/>
I see his friends o'erwhelm'd beneath the main;<br/>
How twice ten years from shore to shore he roams:<br/>
Now twice ten years are past, and now he comes!"
</p>
<p>
To whom Eurymachus&mdash;"Fly, dotard fly,<br/>
With thy wise dreams, and fables of the sky.<br/>
Go prophesy at home, thy sons advise:<br/>
Here thou art sage in vain&mdash;I better read the skies<br/>
Unnumber'd birds glide through the aërial way;<br/>
Vagrants of air, and unforeboding stray.<br/>
Cold in the tomb, or in the deeps below,<br/>
Ulysses lies; oh wert thou laid as low!<br/>
Then would that busy head no broils suggest,<br/>
For fire to rage Telemachus' breast,<br/>
From him some bribe thy venal tongue requires,<br/>
And interest, not the god, thy voice inspires.<br/>
His guideless youth, if thy experienced age<br/>
Mislead fallacious into idle rage,<br/>
Vengeance deserved thy malice shall repress.<br/>
And but augment the wrongs thou would'st redress,<br/>
Telemachus may bid the queen repair<br/>
To great Icarius, whose paternal care<br/>
Will guide her passion, and reward her choice<br/>
With wealthy dower, and bridal gifts of price.<br/>
Till she retires, determined we remain,<br/>
And both the prince and augur threat in vain:<br/>
His pride of words, and thy wild dream of fate,<br/>
Move not the brave, or only move their hate,<br/>
Threat on, O prince! elude the bridal day.<br/>
Threat on, till all thy stores in waste decay.<br/>
True, Greece affords a train of lovely dames,<br/>
In wealth and beauty worthy of our flames:<br/>
But never from this nobler suit we cease;<br/>
For wealth and beauty less than virtue please."
</p>
<p>
To whom the youth: "Since then in vain I tell<br/>
My numerous woes, in silence let them dwell.<br/>
But Heaven, and all the Greeks, have heard my wrongs;<br/>
To Heaven, and all the Greeks, redress belongs;<br/>
Yet this I ask (nor be it ask'd in vain),<br/>
A bark to waft me o'er the rolling main,<br/>
The realms of Pyle and Sparta to explore,<br/>
And seek my royal sire from shore to shore;<br/>
If, or to fame his doubtful fate be known,<br/>
Or to be learn'd from oracles alone,<br/>
If yet he lives, with patience I forbear,<br/>
Till the fleet hours restore the circling year;<br/>
But if already wandering in the train<br/>
Of empty shades, I measure back the main,<br/>
Plant the fair column o'er the mighty dead,<br/>
And yield his consort to the nuptial bed."
</p>
<p>
He ceased; and while abash'd the peers attend,<br/>
Mentor arose, Ulysses' faithful friend:<br/>
(When fierce in arms he sought the scenes of war,<br/>
"My friend (he cried), my palace be thy care;<br/>
Years roll'd on years my godlike sire decay,<br/>
Guard thou his age, and his behests obey.")<br/>
Stern as he rose, he cast his eyes around,<br/>
That flash'd with rage; and as spoke, he frown'd,
</p>
<p>
"O never, never more let king be just,<br/>
Be mild in power, or faithful to his trust!<br/>
Let tyrants govern with an iron rod,<br/>
Oppress, destroy, and be the scourge of God;<br/>
Since he who like a father held his reign,<br/>
So soon forgot, was just and mild in vain!<br/>
True, while my friend is grieved, his griefs I share;<br/>
Yet now the rivals are my smallest care:<br/>
They for the mighty mischiefs they devise,<br/>
Ere long shall pay&mdash;their forfeit lives the price.<br/>
But against you, ye Greeks! ye coward train!<br/>
Gods! how my soul is moved with just disdain!<br/>
Dumb ye all stand, and not one tongue affords<br/>
His injured prince the little aid of words."
</p>
<p>
While yet he spoke, Leocritus rejoined:<br/>
"O pride of words, and arrogance of mind!<br/>
Would'st thou to rise in arms the Greeks advise?<br/>
Join all your powers? in arms, ye Greeks, arise!<br/>
Yet would your powers in vain our strength oppose.<br/>
The valiant few o'ermatch a host of foes.<br/>
Should great Ulysses stern appear in arms,<br/>
While the bowl circles and the banquet warms;<br/>
Though to his breast his spouse with transport flies,<br/>
Torn from her breast, that hour, Ulysses dies.<br/>
But hence retreating to your domes repair.<br/>
To arm the vessel, Mentor! be thy care,<br/>
And Halitherses! thine: be each his friend;<br/>
Ye loved the father: go, the son attend.<br/>
But yet, I trust, the boaster means to stay<br/>
Safe in the court, nor tempt the watery way."
</p>
<p>
Then, with a rushing sound the assembly bend<br/>
Diverse their steps: the rival rout ascend<br/>
The royal dome; while sad the prince explores<br/>
The neighbouring main, and sorrowing treads the shores.<br/>
There, as the waters o'er his hands he shed,<br/>
The royal suppliant to Minerva pray'd:
</p>
<p>
"O goddess! who descending from the skies<br/>
Vouchsafed thy presence to my wondering eyes,<br/>
By whose commands the raging deeps I trace,<br/>
And seek my sire through storms and rolling seas!<br/>
Hear from thy heavens above, O warrior maid!<br/>
Descend once more, propitious to my aid.<br/>
Without thy presence, vain is thy command:<br/>
Greece, and the rival train, thy voice withstand."
</p>
<p>
Indulgent to his prayer, the goddess took<br/>
Sage Mentor's form, and thus like Mentor spoke:
</p>
<p>
"O prince, in early youth divinely wise,<br/>
Born, the Ulysses of thy age to rise<br/>
If to the son the father's worth descends,<br/>
O'er the wide wave success thy ways attends<br/>
To tread the walks of death he stood prepared;<br/>
And what he greatly thought, he nobly dared.<br/>
Were not wise sons descendant of the wise,<br/>
And did not heroes from brave heroes rise,<br/>
Vain were my hopes: few sons attain the praise<br/>
Of their great sires, and most their sires disgrace.<br/>
But since thy veins paternal virtue fires,<br/>
And all Penelope thy soul inspires,<br/>
Go, and succeed: the rivals' aims despise;<br/>
For never, never wicked man was wise.<br/>
Blind they rejoice, though now, ev'n now they fall;<br/>
Death hastes amain: one hour o'erwhelms them all!<br/>
And lo, with speed we plough the watery way;<br/>
My power shall guard thee, and my hand convey:<br/>
The winged vessel studious I prepare,<br/>
Through seas and realms companion of thy care.<br/>
Thou to the court ascend: and to the shores<br/>
(When night advances) bear the naval stores;<br/>
Bread, that decaying man with strength supplies,<br/>
And generous wine, which thoughtful sorrow flies.<br/>
Meanwhile the mariners, by my command,<br/>
Shall speed aboard, a valiant chosen band.<br/>
Wide o'er the bay, by vessel vessel rides;<br/>
The best I choose to waft then o'er the tides."
</p>
<p>
She spoke: to his high dome the prince returns,<br/>
And, as he moves, with royal anguish mourns.<br/>
'Twas riot all, among the lawless train;<br/>
Boar bled by boar, and goat by goat lay slain.<br/>
Arrived, his hand the gay Antinous press'd,<br/>
And thus deriding, with a smile address'd:
</p>
<p>
"Grieve not, O daring prince! that noble heart;<br/>
Ill suits gay youth the stern heroic part.<br/>
Indulge the genial hour, unbend thy soul,<br/>
Leave thought to age, and drain the flowing bowl.<br/>
Studious to ease thy grief, our care provides<br/>
The bark, to waft thee o'er the swelling tides."
</p>
<p>
"Is this (returns the prince) for mirth a time?<br/>
When lawless gluttons riot, mirth's a crime;<br/>
The luscious wines, dishonour'd, lose their taste;<br/>
The song is noise, and impious is the feast.<br/>
Suffice it to have spent with swift decay<br/>
The wealth of kings, and made my youth a prey.<br/>
But now the wise instructions of the sage,<br/>
And manly thoughts inspired by manly age,<br/>
Teach me to seek redress for all my woe,<br/>
Here, or in Pyle&mdash;in Pyle, or here, your foe.<br/>
Deny your vessels, ye deny in vain:<br/>
A private voyager I pass the main.<br/>
Free breathe the winds, and free the billows flow;<br/>
And where on earth I live, I live your foe."
</p>
<p>
He spoke and frown'd, nor longer deign'd to stay,<br/>
Sternly his hand withdrew, and strode away.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, o'er all the dome, they quaff, they feast,<br/>
Derisive taunts were spread from guest to guest,<br/>
And each in jovial mood his mate address'd:
</p>
<p>
"Tremble ye not, O friends, and coward fly,<br/>
Doom'd by the stern Telemachus to die?<br/>
To Pyle or Sparta to demand supplies,<br/>
Big with revenge, the mighty warrior flies;<br/>
Or comes from Ephyre with poisons fraught,<br/>
And kills us all in one tremendous draught!"
</p>
<p>
"Or who can say (his gamesome mate replies)<br/>
But, while the danger of the deeps he tries<br/>
He, like his sire, may sink deprived of breath,<br/>
And punish us unkindly by his death?<br/>
What mighty labours would he then create,<br/>
To seize his treasures, and divide his state,<br/>
The royal palace to the queen convey,<br/>
Or him she blesses in the bridal day!"
</p>
<p>
Meantime the lofty rooms the prince surveys,<br/>
Where lay the treasures of the Ithacian race:<br/>
Here ruddy brass and gold refulgent blazed;<br/>
There polished chests embroider'd vestures graced;<br/>
Here jars of oil breathed forth a rich perfume;<br/>
There casks of wine in rows adorn'd the dome<br/>
(Pure flavorous wine, by gods in bounty given<br/>
And worthy to exalt the feasts of heaven).<br/>
Untouch'd they stood, till, his long labours o'er,<br/>
The great Ulysses reach'd his native shore.<br/>
A double strength of bars secured the gates;<br/>
Fast by the door the wise Euryclea waits;<br/>
Euryclea, who great Ops! thy lineage shared,<br/>
And watch'd all night, all day, a faithful guard.
</p>
<p>
To whom the prince: "O thou whose guardian care<br/>
Nursed the most wretched king that breathes the air;<br/>
Untouch'd and sacred may these vessels stand,<br/>
Till great Ulysses views his native land.<br/>
But by thy care twelve urns of wine be fill'd;<br/>
Next these in worth, and firm these urns be seal'd;<br/>
And twice ten measures of the choicest flour<br/>
Prepared, ere yet descends the evening hour.<br/>
For when the favouring shades of night arise,<br/>
And peaceful slumbers close my mother's eyes,<br/>
Me from our coast shall spreading sails convey,<br/>
To seek Ulysses through the watery way."
</p>
<p>
While yet he spoke, she fill'd the walls with cries,<br/>
And tears ran trickling from her aged eyes.<br/>
"O whither, whither flies my son (she cried)<br/>
To realms; that rocks and roaring seas divide?<br/>
In foreign lands thy father's days decay'd.<br/>
And foreign lands contain the mighty dead.<br/>
The watery way ill-fated if thou try,<br/>
All, all must perish, and by fraud you die!<br/>
Then stay, my, child! storms beat, and rolls the main,<br/>
Oh, beat those storms, and roll the seas in vain!"
</p>
<p>
"Far hence (replied the prince) thy fears be driven:<br/>
Heaven calls me forth; these counsels are of Heaven.<br/>
But, by the powers that hate the perjured, swear,<br/>
To keep my voyage from the royal ear,<br/>
Nor uncompell'd the dangerous truth betray,<br/>
Till twice six times descends the lamp of day,<br/>
Lest the sad tale a mother's life impair,<br/>
And grief destroy what time awhile would spare."
</p>
<p>
Thus he. The matron with uplifted eyes<br/>
Attests the all-seeing sovereign of the skies.<br/>
Then studious she prepares the choicest flour,<br/>
The strength of wheat and wines an ample store.<br/>
While to the rival train the prince returns,<br/>
The martial goddess with impatience burns;<br/>
Like thee, Telemachus, in voice and size,<br/>
With speed divine from street to street she flies,<br/>
She bids the mariners prepared to stand,<br/>
When night descends, embodied on the strand.<br/>
Then to Noëmon swift she runs, she flies,<br/>
And asks a bark: the chief a bark supplies.
</p>
<p>
And now, declining with his sloping wheels,<br/>
Down sunk the sun behind the western hills<br/>
The goddess shoved the vessel from the shores,<br/>
And stow'd within its womb the naval stores,<br/>
Full in the openings of the spacious main<br/>
It rides; and now descends the sailor-train,
</p>
<p>
Next, to the court, impatient of delay.<br/>
With rapid step the goddess urged her way;<br/>
There every eye with slumberous chains she bound,<br/>
And dash'd the flowing goblet to the ground.<br/>
Drowsy they rose, with heavy fumes oppress'd,<br/>
Reel'd from the palace, and retired to rest.<br/>
Then thus, in Mentor's reverend form array'd,<br/>
Spoke to Telemachus the martial maid.<br/>
"Lo! on the seas, prepared the vessel stands,<br/>
The impatient mariner thy speed demands."<br/>
Swift as she spoke, with rapid pace she leads;<br/>
The footsteps of the deity he treads.<br/>
Swift to the shore they move along the strand;<br/>
The ready vessel rides, the sailors ready stand.
</p>
<p>
He bids them bring their stores; the attending train<br/>
Load the tall bark, and launch into the main,<br/>
The prince and goddess to the stern ascend;<br/>
To the strong stroke at once the rowers bend.<br/>
Full from the west she bids fresh breezes blow;<br/>
The sable billows foam and roar below.<br/>
The chief his orders gives; the obedient band<br/>
With due observance wait the chief's command;<br/>
With speed the mast they rear, with speed unbind<br/>
The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind.<br/>
High o'er the roaring waves the spreading sails<br/>
Bow the tall mast, and swell before the gales;<br/>
The crooked keel the parting surge divides,<br/>
And to the stern retreating roll the tides.<br/>
And now they ship their oars, and crown with wine<br/>
The holy goblet to the powers divine:<br/>
Imploring all the gods that reign above,<br/>
But chief the blue-eyed progeny of Jove.
</p>
<p>
Thus all the night they stem the liquid way,<br/>
And end their voyage with the morning ray.

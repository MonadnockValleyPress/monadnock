<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book VII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state,<br/>
Then rush'd impetuous through the Scaean gate.<br/>
Him Paris follow'd to the dire alarms;<br/>
Both breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms.<br/>
As when to sailors labouring through the main,<br/>
That long have heaved the weary oar in vain,<br/>
Jove bids at length the expected gales arise;<br/>
The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.<br/>
So welcome these to Troy's desiring train,<br/>
The bands are cheer'd, the war awakes again.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Bold Paris first the work of death begun<br/>
On great Menestheus, Areithous' son,<br/>
Sprung from the fair Philomeda's embrace,<br/>
The pleasing Arne was his native place.<br/>
Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below,<br/>
Beneath his steely casque he felt the blow<br/>
Full on his neck, from Hector's weighty hand;<br/>
And roll'd, with limbs relax'd, along the land.<br/>
By Glaucus' spear the bold Iphinous bleeds,<br/>
Fix'd in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;<br/>
Headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound,<br/>
Drop the cold useless members on the ground.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When now Minerva saw her Argives slain,<br/>
From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain<br/>
Fierce she descends: Apollo marked her flight,<br/>
Nor shot less swift from Ilion's towery height.<br/>
Radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade;<br/>
When thus Apollo to the blue-eyed maid:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What cause, O daughter of Almighty Jove!<br/>
Thus wings thy progress from the realms above?<br/>
Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,<br/>
To give to Greece the long divided day?<br/>
Too much has Troy already felt thy hate,<br/>
Now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate;<br/>
This day, the business of the field suspend;<br/>
War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend;<br/>
Since vengeful goddesses confederate join<br/>
To raze her walls, though built by hands divine."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the progeny of Jove replies:<br/>
"I left, for this, the council of the skies:<br/>
But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,<br/>
What art shall calm the furious sons of war?"<br/>
To her the god: "Great Hector's soul incite<br/>
To dare the boldest Greek to single fight,<br/>
Till Greece, provoked, from all her numbers show<br/>
A warrior worthy to be Hector's foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
At this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;<br/>
Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew;<br/>
Hector, inspired, he sought: to him address'd,<br/>
Thus told the dictates of his sacred breast:<br/>
"O son of Priam! let thy faithful ear<br/>
Receive my words: thy friend and brother hear!<br/>
Go forth persuasive, and a while engage<br/>
The warring nations to suspend their rage;<br/>
Then dare the boldest of the hostile train<br/>
To mortal combat on the listed plain.<br/>
For not this day shall end thy glorious date;<br/>
The gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said: the warrior heard the word with joy;<br/>
Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,<br/>
Held by the midst athwart. On either hand<br/>
The squadrons part; the expecting Trojans stand;<br/>
Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear:<br/>
They breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.<br/>
The Athenian maid, and glorious god of day,<br/>
With silent joy the settling hosts survey:<br/>
In form of vultures, on the beech's height<br/>
They sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,<br/>
Horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.<br/>
As when a general darkness veils the main,<br/>
(Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat'ry plain,)<br/>
The waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,<br/>
And a still horror saddens all the deeps;<br/>
Thus in thick orders settling wide around,<br/>
At length composed they sit, and shade the ground.<br/>
Great Hector first amidst both armies broke<br/>
The solemn silence, and their powers bespoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,<br/>
What my soul prompts, and what some god commands.<br/>
Great Jove, averse our warfare to compose,<br/>
O'erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;<br/>
War with a fiercer tide once more returns,<br/>
Till Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.<br/>
You then, O princes of the Greeks! appear;<br/>
'Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:<br/>
From all your troops select the boldest knight,<br/>
And him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight.<br/>
Here if I fall, by chance of battle slain,<br/>
Be his my spoil, and his these arms remain;<br/>
But let my body, to my friends return'd,<br/>
By Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burn'd.<br/>
And if Apollo, in whose aid I trust,<br/>
Shall stretch your daring champion in the dust;<br/>
If mine the glory to despoil the foe;<br/>
On Phoebus' temple I'll his arms bestow:<br/>
The breathless carcase to your navy sent,<br/>
Greece on the shore shall raise a monument;<br/>
Which when some future mariner surveys,<br/>
Wash'd by broad Hellespont's resounding seas,<br/>
Thus shall he say, ‘A valiant Greek lies there,<br/>
By Hector slain, the mighty man of war,'<br/>
The stone shall tell your vanquish'd hero's name<br/>
And distant ages learn the victor's fame."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This fierce defiance Greece astonish'd heard,<br/>
Blush'd to refuse, and to accept it fear'd.<br/>
Stern Menelaus first the silence broke,<br/>
And, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Women of Greece! O scandal of your race,<br/>
Whose coward souls your manly form disgrace,<br/>
How great the shame, when every age shall know<br/>
That not a Grecian met this noble foe!<br/>
Go then! resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,<br/>
A heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!<br/>
Be what ye seem, unanimated clay,<br/>
Myself will dare the danger of the day;<br/>
'Tis man's bold task the generous strife to try,<br/>
But in the hands of God is victory."<br/>
</p>
<p>
These words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press'd,<br/>
His manly limbs in azure arms he dress'd.<br/>
That day, Atrides! a superior hand<br/>
Had stretch'd thee breathless on the hostile strand;<br/>
But all at once, thy fury to compose,<br/>
The kings of Greece, an awful band, arose;<br/>
Even he their chief, great Agamemnon, press'd<br/>
Thy daring hand, and this advice address'd:<br/>
"Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,<br/>
And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?<br/>
Grieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;<br/>
Great Hector's arm is mightier far than thine:<br/>
Even fierce Achilles learn'd its force to fear,<br/>
And trembling met this dreadful son of war.<br/>
Sit thou secure, amidst thy social band;<br/>
Greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.<br/>
The mightiest warrior of the Achaian name,<br/>
Though bold and burning with desire of fame,<br/>
Content the doubtful honour might forego,<br/>
So great the danger, and so brave the foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and turn'd his brother's vengeful mind;<br/>
He stoop'd to reason, and his rage resign'd,<br/>
No longer bent to rush on certain harms;<br/>
His joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He from whose lips divine persuasion flows,<br/>
Grave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;<br/>
Thus to the kings he spoke: "What grief, what shame<br/>
Attend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!<br/>
How shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn<br/>
Their sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!<br/>
What tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll'd,<br/>
O Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!<br/>
Once with what joy the generous prince would hear<br/>
Of every chief who fought this glorious war,<br/>
Participate their fame, and pleased inquire<br/>
Each name, each action, and each hero's sire!<br/>
Gods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,<br/>
And trembling all before one hostile hand;<br/>
How would he lift his aged arms on high,<br/>
Lament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!<br/>
Oh! would to all the immortal powers above,<br/>
Minerva, Phoebus, and almighty Jove!<br/>
Years might again roll back, my youth renew,<br/>
And give this arm the spring which once it knew<br/>
When fierce in war, where Jardan's waters fall,<br/>
I led my troops to Phea's trembling wall,<br/>
And with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,<br/>
Where Celadon rolls down his rapid tide.<br/>
There Ereuthalion braved us in the field,<br/>
Proud Areithous' dreadful arms to wield;<br/>
Great Areithous, known from shore to shore<br/>
By the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;<br/>
No lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,<br/>
But broke, with this, the battle of the foe.<br/>
Him not by manly force Lycurgus slew,<br/>
Whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,<br/>
Deep in a winding way his breast assailed,<br/>
Nor aught the warrior's thundering mace avail'd.<br/>
Supine he fell: those arms which Mars before<br/>
Had given the vanquish'd, now the victor bore:<br/>
But when old age had dimm'd Lycurgus' eyes,<br/>
To Ereuthalion he consign'd the prize.<br/>
Furious with this he crush'd our levell'd bands,<br/>
And dared the trial of the strongest hands;<br/>
Nor could the strongest hands his fury stay:<br/>
All saw, and fear'd, his huge tempestuous sway<br/>
Till I, the youngest of the host, appear'd,<br/>
And, youngest, met whom all our army fear'd.<br/>
I fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown'd:<br/>
Prone fell the giant o'er a length of ground.<br/>
What then I was, O were your Nestor now!<br/>
Not Hector's self should want an equal foe.<br/>
But, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,<br/>
The flower of Greece, the examples of our host,<br/>
Sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,<br/>
Can you stand trembling, and desert the day?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
His warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;<br/>
And nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,<br/>
Up-started fierce: but far before the rest<br/>
The king of men advanced his dauntless breast:<br/>
Then bold Tydides, great in arms, appear'd;<br/>
And next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear'd;<br/>
Oileus follow'd; Idomen was there,<br/>
And Merion, dreadful as the god of war:<br/>
With these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,<br/>
And wise Ulysses closed the daring band.<br/>
All these, alike inspired with noble rage,<br/>
Demand the fight. To whom the Pylian sage:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,<br/>
What chief shall combat, let the gods decide.<br/>
Whom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise<br/>
His country's fame, his own immortal praise."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The lots produced, each hero signs his own:<br/>
Then in the general's helm the fates are thrown,<br/>
The people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,<br/>
And vows like these ascend from all the bands:<br/>
"Grant, thou Almighty! in whose hand is fate,<br/>
A worthy champion for the Grecian state:<br/>
This task let Ajax or Tydides prove,<br/>
Or he, the king of kings, beloved by Jove."<br/>
Old Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspired,<br/>
Leap'd forth the lot, of every Greek desired.<br/>
This from the right to left the herald bears,<br/>
Held out in order to the Grecian peers;<br/>
Each to his rival yields the mark unknown,<br/>
Till godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;<br/>
Surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,<br/>
Then casts before him, and with transport cries:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Warriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;<br/>
Be mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.<br/>
Now while my brightest arms my limbs invest,<br/>
To Saturn's son be all your vows address'd:<br/>
But pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,<br/>
And deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.<br/>
Said I in secret? No, your vows declare<br/>
In such a voice as fills the earth and air,<br/>
Lives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?<br/>
Ajax, in all the toils of battle bred!<br/>
From warlike Salamis I drew my birth,<br/>
And, born to combats, fear no force on earth."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said. The troops with elevated eyes,<br/>
Implore the god whose thunder rends the skies:<br/>
"O father of mankind, superior lord!<br/>
On lofty Ida's holy hill adored:<br/>
Who in the highest heaven hast fix'd thy throne,<br/>
Supreme of gods! unbounded and alone:<br/>
Grant thou, that Telamon may bear away<br/>
The praise and conquest of this doubtful day;<br/>
Or, if illustrious Hector be thy care,<br/>
That both may claim it, and that both may share."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;<br/>
Sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:<br/>
He moves to combat with majestic pace;<br/>
So stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,<br/>
When Jove to punish faithless men prepares,<br/>
And gives whole nations to the waste of wars,<br/>
Thus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god;<br/>
Grimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:<br/>
His massy javelin quivering in his hand,<br/>
He stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.<br/>
Through every Argive heart new transport ran;<br/>
All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:<br/>
Even Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress'd,<br/>
Felt his great heart suspended in his breast:<br/>
'Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;<br/>
Himself had challenged, and the foe drew near.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Stern Telamon behind his ample shield,<br/>
As from a brazen tower, o'erlook'd the field.<br/>
Huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o'ercast,<br/>
Of tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,<br/>
(The work of Tychius, who in Hyle dwell'd<br/>
And in all arts of armoury excell'd,)<br/>
This Ajax bore before his manly breast,<br/>
And, threatening, thus his adverse chief address'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hector! approach my arm, and singly know<br/>
What strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.<br/>
Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,<br/>
Not void of soul, and not unskill'd in war:<br/>
Let him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,<br/>
Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;<br/>
Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,<br/>
And sends thee one, a sample of her host,<br/>
Such as I am, I come to prove thy might;<br/>
No more—be sudden, and begin the fight."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O son of Telamon, thy country's pride!<br/>
(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)<br/>
Me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,<br/>
New to the field, and trembling at the fight?<br/>
Thou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms,<br/>
To combat born, and bred amidst alarms:<br/>
I know to shift my ground, remount the car,<br/>
Turn, charge, and answer every call of war;<br/>
To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,<br/>
And bear thick battle on my sounding shield.<br/>
But open be our fight, and bold each blow;<br/>
I steal no conquest from a noble foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and rising, high above the field<br/>
Whirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.<br/>
Full on the brass descending from above<br/>
Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,<br/>
Till in the seventh it fix'd. Then Ajax threw;<br/>
Through Hector's shield the forceful javelin flew,<br/>
His corslet enters, and his garment rends,<br/>
And glancing downwards, near his flank descends.<br/>
The wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low<br/>
Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.<br/>
From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,<br/>
Then close impetuous, and the charge renew;<br/>
Fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,<br/>
Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.<br/>
At Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;<br/>
The blunted point against the buckler bends;<br/>
But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,<br/>
Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;<br/>
It reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd!<br/>
Spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.<br/>
Yet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,<br/>
In his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,<br/>
Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;<br/>
Full on the brazen boss the stone descends;<br/>
The hollow brass resounded with the shock:<br/>
Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,<br/>
Applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,<br/>
With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;<br/>
The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:<br/>
His slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke;<br/>
Great Hector falls extended on the field,<br/>
His bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield:<br/>
Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo's might<br/>
Confirm'd his sinews, and restored to fight.<br/>
And now both heroes their broad falchions drew<br/>
In flaming circles round their heads they flew;<br/>
But then by heralds' voice the word was given.<br/>
The sacred ministers of earth and heaven:<br/>
Divine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ,<br/>
And sage Idaeus on the part of Troy,<br/>
Between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear'd;<br/>
And first Idaeus' awful voice was heard:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Forbear, my sons! your further force to prove,<br/>
Both dear to men, and both beloved of Jove.<br/>
To either host your matchless worth is known,<br/>
Each sounds your praise, and war is all your own.<br/>
But now the Night extends her awful shade;<br/>
The goddess parts you; be the night obey'd."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom great Ajax his high soul express'd:<br/>
"O sage! to Hector be these words address'd.<br/>
Let him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,<br/>
Let him demand the sanction of the night;<br/>
If first he ask'd it, I content obey,<br/>
And cease the strife when Hector shows the way."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O first of Greeks! (his noble foe rejoin'd)<br/>
Whom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,<br/>
With strength of body, and with worth of mind!<br/>
Now martial law commands us to forbear;<br/>
Hereafter we shall meet in glorious war,<br/>
Some future day shall lengthen out the strife,<br/>
And let the gods decide of death or life!<br/>
Since, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,<br/>
And heaven enjoins it, be the night obey'd.<br/>
Return, brave Ajax, to thy Grecian friends,<br/>
And joy the nations whom thy arm defends;<br/>
As I shall glad each chief, and Trojan wife,<br/>
Who wearies heaven with vows for Hector's life.<br/>
But let us, on this memorable day,<br/>
Exchange some gift: that Greece and Troy may say,<br/>
‘Not hate, but glory, made these chiefs contend;<br/>
And each brave foe was in his soul a friend.'"<br/>
</p>
<p>
With that, a sword with stars of silver graced,<br/>
The baldric studded, and the sheath enchased,<br/>
He gave the Greek. The generous Greek bestow'd<br/>
A radiant belt that rich with purple glow'd.<br/>
Then with majestic grace they quit the plain;<br/>
This seeks the Grecian, that the Phrygian train.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Trojan bands returning Hector wait,<br/>
And hail with joy the Champion of their state;<br/>
Escaped great Ajax, they survey him round,<br/>
Alive, unarm'd, and vigorous from his wound;<br/>
To Troy's high gates the godlike man they bear<br/>
Their present triumph, as their late despair.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But Ajax, glorying in his hardy deed,<br/>
The well-arm'd Greeks to Agamemnon lead.<br/>
A steer for sacrifice the king design'd,<br/>
Of full five years, and of the nobler kind.<br/>
The victim falls; they strip the smoking hide,<br/>
The beast they quarter, and the joints divide;<br/>
Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,<br/>
Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.<br/>
The king himself (an honorary sign)<br/>
Before great Ajax placed the mighty chine.<br/>
When now the rage of hunger was removed,<br/>
Nestor, in each persuasive art approved,<br/>
The sage whose counsels long had sway'd the rest,<br/>
In words like these his prudent thought express'd:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"How dear, O kings! this fatal day has cost,<br/>
What Greeks are perish'd! what a people lost!<br/>
What tides of blood have drench'd Scamander's shore!<br/>
What crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more!<br/>
Then hear me, chief! nor let the morrow's light<br/>
Awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:<br/>
Some space at least permit the war to breathe,<br/>
While we to flames our slaughter'd friends bequeath,<br/>
From the red field their scatter'd bodies bear,<br/>
And nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear;<br/>
So decent urns their snowy bones may keep,<br/>
And pious children o'er their ashes weep.<br/>
Here, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,<br/>
High o'er them all a general tomb be raised;<br/>
Next, to secure our camp and naval powers,<br/>
Raise an embattled wall, with lofty towers;<br/>
From space to space be ample gates around,<br/>
For passing chariots; and a trench profound.<br/>
So Greece to combat shall in safety go,<br/>
Nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe."<br/>
'Twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved;<br/>
The sceptred kings of Greece his words approved.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, convened at Priam's palace-gate,<br/>
The Trojan peers in nightly council sate;<br/>
A senate void of order, as of choice:<br/>
Their hearts were fearful, and confused their voice.<br/>
Antenor, rising, thus demands their ear:<br/>
"Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliars, hear!<br/>
'Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires,<br/>
And I but move what every god requires:<br/>
Let Sparta's treasures be this hour restored,<br/>
And Argive Helen own her ancient lord.<br/>
The ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke,<br/>
Our impious battles the just gods provoke.<br/>
As this advice ye practise, or reject,<br/>
So hope success, or dread the dire effect."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The senior spoke and sate. To whom replied<br/>
The graceful husband of the Spartan bride:<br/>
"Cold counsels, Trojan, may become thy years<br/>
But sound ungrateful in a warrior's ears:<br/>
Old man, if void of fallacy or art,<br/>
Thy words express the purpose of thy heart,<br/>
Thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;<br/>
But wisdom has its date, assign'd by heaven.<br/>
Then hear me, princes of the Trojan name!<br/>
Their treasures I'll restore, but not the dame;<br/>
My treasures too, for peace, I will resign;<br/>
But be this bright possession ever mine."<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Twas then, the growing discord to compose,<br/>
Slow from his seat the reverend Priam rose:<br/>
His godlike aspect deep attention drew:<br/>
He paused, and these pacific words ensue:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliar bands!<br/>
Now take refreshment as the hour demands;<br/>
Guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night.<br/>
Till the new sun restores the cheerful light.<br/>
Then shall our herald, to the Atrides sent,<br/>
Before their ships proclaim my son's intent.<br/>
Next let a truce be ask'd, that Troy may burn<br/>
Her slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn;<br/>
That done, once more the fate of war be tried,<br/>
And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The monarch spoke: the warriors snatch'd with haste<br/>
(Each at his post in arms) a short repast.<br/>
Soon as the rosy morn had waked the day,<br/>
To the black ships Idaeus bent his way;<br/>
There, to the sons of Mars, in council found,<br/>
He raised his voice: the host stood listening round.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Greeks, give ear!<br/>
The words of Troy, and Troy's great monarch, hear.<br/>
Pleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed my prayers)<br/>
What Paris, author of the war, declares.<br/>
The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore<br/>
(Oh had he perish'd ere they touch'd our shore!)<br/>
He proffers injured Greece: with large increase<br/>
Of added Trojan wealth to buy the peace.<br/>
But to restore the beauteous bride again,<br/>
This Greece demands, and Troy requests in vain.<br/>
Next, O ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burn<br/>
Our slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn.<br/>
That done, once more the fate of war be tried,<br/>
And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke;<br/>
At length Tydides rose, and rising spoke:<br/>
"Oh, take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,<br/>
Their proffer'd wealth, nor even the Spartan dame.<br/>
Let conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wall,<br/>
And Troy already totters to her fall."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name,<br/>
With general shouts return'd him loud acclaim.<br/>
Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:<br/>
"Herald! in him thou hear'st the voice of Greece<br/>
For what remains; let funeral flames be fed<br/>
With heroes' corps: I war not with the dead:<br/>
Go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,<br/>
And gratify the manes of the slain.<br/>
Be witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!"<br/>
He said, and rear'd his sceptre to the sky.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To sacred Troy, where all her princes lay<br/>
To wait the event, the herald bent his way.<br/>
He came, and standing in the midst, explain'd<br/>
The peace rejected, but the truce obtain'd.<br/>
Straight to their several cares the Trojans move,<br/>
Some search the plains, some fell the sounding grove:<br/>
Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore,<br/>
Hew'd the green forests, and the bodies bore.<br/>
And now from forth the chambers of the main,<br/>
To shed his sacred light on earth again,<br/>
Arose the golden chariot of the day,<br/>
And tipp'd the mountains with a purple ray.<br/>
In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train<br/>
Through heaps of carnage search'd the mournful plain.<br/>
Scarce could the friend his slaughter'd friend explore,<br/>
With dust dishonour'd, and deformed with gore.<br/>
The wounds they wash'd, their pious tears they shed,<br/>
And, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.<br/>
Sage Priam check'd their grief: with silent haste<br/>
The bodies decent on the piles were placed:<br/>
With melting hearts the cold remains they burn'd,<br/>
And, sadly slow, to sacred Troy return'd.<br/>
Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed,<br/>
And decent on the pile dispose the dead;<br/>
The cold remains consume with equal care;<br/>
And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.<br/>
Now, ere the morn had streak'd with reddening light<br/>
The doubtful confines of the day and night,<br/>
About the dying flames the Greeks appear'd,<br/>
And round the pile a general tomb they rear'd.<br/>
Then, to secure the camp and naval powers,<br/>
They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:<br/>
From space to space were ample gates around,<br/>
For passing chariots, and a trench profound<br/>
Of large extent; and deep in earth below,<br/>
Strong piles infix'd stood adverse to the foe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So toil'd the Greeks: meanwhile the gods above,<br/>
In shining circle round their father Jove,<br/>
Amazed beheld the wondrous works of man:<br/>
Then he, whose trident shakes the earth, began:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What mortals henceforth shall our power adore,<br/>
Our fanes frequent, our oracles implore,<br/>
If the proud Grecians thus successful boast<br/>
Their rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast?<br/>
See the long walls extending to the main,<br/>
No god consulted, and no victim slain!<br/>
Their fame shall fill the world's remotest ends,<br/>
Wide as the morn her golden beam extends;<br/>
While old Laomedon's divine abodes,<br/>
Those radiant structures raised by labouring gods,<br/>
Shall, razed and lost, in long oblivion sleep."<br/>
Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The almighty Thunderer with a frown replies,<br/>
That clouds the world, and blackens half the skies:<br/>
"Strong god of ocean! thou, whose rage can make<br/>
The solid earth's eternal basis shake!<br/>
What cause of fear from mortal works could move<br/>
The meanest subject of our realms above?<br/>
Where'er the sun's refulgent rays are cast,<br/>
Thy power is honour'd, and thy fame shall last.<br/>
But yon proud work no future age shall view,<br/>
No trace remain where once the glory grew.<br/>
The sapp'd foundations by thy force shall fall,<br/>
And, whelm'd beneath the waves, drop the huge wall:<br/>
Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore:<br/>
The ruin vanish'd, and the name no more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus they in heaven: while, o'er the Grecian train,<br/>
The rolling sun descending to the main<br/>
Beheld the finish'd work. Their bulls they slew;<br/>
Back from the tents the savoury vapour flew.<br/>
And now the fleet, arrived from Lemnos' strands,<br/>
With Bacchus' blessings cheered the generous bands.<br/>
Of fragrant wines the rich Eunaeus sent<br/>
A thousant measures to the royal tent.<br/>
(Eunaeus, whom Hypsipyle of yore<br/>
To Jason, shepherd of his people, bore,)<br/>
The rest they purchased at their proper cost,<br/>
And well the plenteous freight supplied the host:<br/>
Each, in exchange, proportion'd treasures gave;<br/>
Some, brass or iron; some, an ox, or slave.<br/>
All night they feast, the Greek and Trojan powers:<br/>
Those on the fields, and these within their towers.<br/>
But Jove averse the signs of wrath display'd,<br/>
And shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade:<br/>
Humbled they stood; pale horror seized on all,<br/>
While the deep thunder shook the aerial hall.<br/>
Each pour'd to Jove before the bowl was crown'd;<br/>
And large libations drench'd the thirsty ground:<br/>
Then late, refresh'd with sleep from toils of fight,<br/>
Enjoy'd the balmy blessings of the night.<br/>

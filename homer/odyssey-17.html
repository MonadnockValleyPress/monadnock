<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XVII</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br/>
Sprinkled with roseate light the dewy lawn,<br/>
In haste the prince arose, prepared to part;<br/>
His hand impatient grasps the pointed dart;<br/>
Fair on his feet the polish'd sandals shine,<br/>
And thus he greets the master of the swine:
</p>
<p>
"My friend, adieu! let this short stay suffice;<br/>
I haste to meet my mother's longing eyes,<br/>
And end her tears, her sorrows and her sighs.<br/>
But thou, attentive, what we order heed:<br/>
This hapless stranger to the city lead:<br/>
By public bounty let him there be fed,<br/>
And bless the hand that stretches forth the bread.<br/>
To wipe the tears from all afflicted eyes,<br/>
My will may covet, but my power denies.<br/>
If this raise anger in the stranger's thought,<br/>
The pain of anger punishes the fault:<br/>
The very truth I undisguised declare;<br/>
For what so easy as to be sincere?"
</p>
<p>
To this Ulysses: "What the prince requires<br/>
Of swift removal, seconds my desires.<br/>
To want like mine the peopled town can yield<br/>
More hopes of comfort than the lonely field:<br/>
Nor fits my age to till the labour'd lands,<br/>
Or stoop to tasks a rural lord demands.<br/>
Adieu! but since this ragged garb can bear<br/>
So ill the inclemencies of morning air,<br/>
A few hours' space permit me here to stay:<br/>
My steps Eumaeus shall to town convey,<br/>
With riper beams when Phœbus warms the day."
</p>
<p>
Thus he: nor aught Telemachus replied,<br/>
But left the mansion with a lofty stride:<br/>
Schemes of revenge his pondering breast elate,<br/>
Revolving deep the suitors' sudden fate,<br/>
Arriving now before the imperial hall,<br/>
He props his spear against the pillar'd wall;<br/>
Then like a lion o'er the threshold bounds;<br/>
The marble pavement with his steps resounds:<br/>
His eye first glanced where Euryclea spreads<br/>
With furry spoils of beasts the splendid beds:<br/>
She saw, she wept, she ran with eager pace,<br/>
And reach'd her master with a long embrace.<br/>
All crowded round, the family appears<br/>
With wild entrancement, and ecstatic tears.<br/>
Swift from above descends the royal fair<br/>
(Her beauteous cheeks the blush of Venus wear,<br/>
Chasten'd with coy Diana's pensive air);<br/>
Hangs o'er her son, in his embraces dies;<br/>
Rains kisses on his neck, his face, his eyes:<br/>
Few words she spoke, though much she had to say;<br/>
And scarce those few, for tears, could force their way.
</p>
<p>
"Light of my eyes: he comes! unhoped-for joy!<br/>
Has Heaven from Pylos brought my lovely boy?<br/>
So snatch'd from all our cares!&mdash;Tell, hast thou known<br/>
Thy father's fate, and tell me all thy own."
</p>
<p>
"Oh dearest! most revered of womankind!<br/>
Cease with those tears to melt a manly mind<br/>
(Replied the prince); nor be our fates deplored,<br/>
From death and treason to thy arms restored.<br/>
Go bathe, and robed in white ascend the towers;<br/>
With all thy handmaids thank the immortal powers;<br/>
To every god vow hecatombs to bleed.<br/>
And call Jove's vengeance on their guilty deed.<br/>
While to the assembled council I repair:<br/>
A stranger sent by Heaven attends me there;<br/>
My new accepted guest I haste to find,<br/>
Now to Peiraeus' honour'd charge consign'd."
</p>
<p>
The matron heard, nor was his word in vain.<br/>
She bathed; and, robed in white, with all her train,<br/>
To every god vow'd hecatombs to bleed,<br/>
And call'd Jove's vengeance on the guilty deed,<br/>
Arm'd with his lance, the prince then pass'd the gate,<br/>
Two dogs behind, a faithful guard, await;<br/>
Pallas his form with grace divine improves:<br/>
The gazing crowd admires him as he moves.<br/>
Him, gathering round, the haughty suitors greet<br/>
With semblance fair, but inward deep deceit,<br/>
Their false addresses, generous, he denied.<br/>
Pass'd on, and sate by faithful Mentor's side;<br/>
With Antiphus, and Halitherses sage<br/>
(His father's counsellors, revered for age).<br/>
Of his own fortunes, and Ulysses' fame,<br/>
Much ask'd the seniors; till Peiraeus came.<br/>
The stranger-guest pursued him close behind;<br/>
Whom when Telemachus beheld, he join'd.<br/>
He (when Peiraeus ask'd for slaves to bring<br/>
The gifts and treasures of the Spartan king)<br/>
Thus thoughtful answer'd: "Those we shall not move,<br/>
Dark and unconscious of the will of Jove;<br/>
We know not yet the full event of all:<br/>
Stabb'd in his palace if your prince must fall,<br/>
Us, and our house, if treason must o'erthrow,<br/>
Better a friend possess them than a foe;<br/>
If death to these, and vengeance Heaven decree,<br/>
Riches are welcome then, not else, to me.<br/>
Till then retain the gifts."&mdash;The hero said,<br/>
And in his hand the willing stranger led.<br/>
Then disarray'd, the shining bath they sought<br/>
(With unguents smooth) of polish'd marble wrought:<br/>
Obedient handmaids with assistant toil<br/>
Supply the limpid wave, and fragrant oil:<br/>
Then o'er their limbs refulgent robes they threw,<br/>
And fresh from bathing to their seats withdrew.<br/>
The golden ewer a nymph attendant brings,<br/>
Replenish'd from the pure translucent springs;<br/>
With copious streams that golden ewer supplies<br/>
A silver layer of capacious size.<br/>
They wash: the table, in fair order spread,<br/>
Is piled with viands and the strength of bread.<br/>
Full opposite, before the folding gate,<br/>
The pensive mother sits in humble state;<br/>
Lowly she sate, and with dejected view<br/>
The fleecy threads her ivory fingers drew.<br/>
The prince and stranger shared the genial feast,<br/>
Till now the rage of thirst and hunger ceased.
</p>
<p>
When thus the queen: "My son! my only friend!<br/>
Say, to my mournful couch shall I ascend?<br/>
(The couch deserted now a length of years;<br/>
The couch for ever water'd with my tears;)<br/>
Say, wilt thou not (ere yet the suitor crew<br/>
Return, and riot shakes our walls anew),<br/>
Say, wilt thou not the least account afford?<br/>
The least glad tidings of my absent lord?"
</p>
<p>
To her the youth. "We reach'd the Pylian plains,<br/>
Where Nestor, shepherd of his people, reigns.<br/>
All arts of tenderness to him are known,<br/>
Kind to Ulysses' race as to his own;<br/>
No father with a fonder grasp of joy<br/>
Strains to his bosom his long-absent boy.<br/>
But all unknown, if yet Ulysses breathe,<br/>
Or glide a spectre in the realms beneath;<br/>
For farther search, his rapid steeds transport<br/>
My lengthen'd journey to the Spartan court.<br/>
There Argive Helen I beheld, whose charms<br/>
(So Heaven decreed) engaged the great in arms.<br/>
My cause of coming told, he thus rejoin'd;<br/>
And still his words live perfect in my mind:
</p>
<p>
"'Heavens! would a soft, inglorious, dastard train<br/>
An absent hero's nuptial joys profane<br/>
So with her young, amid the woodland shades,<br/>
A timorous hind the lion's court invades,<br/>
Leaves in that fatal lair her tender fawns,<br/>
And climbs the cliffs, or feeds along the lawns;<br/>
Meantime returning, with remorseless sway<br/>
The monarch savage rends the panting prey:<br/>
With equal fury, and with equal fame,<br/>
Shall great Ulysses reassert his claim.<br/>
O Jove! supreme! whom men and gods revere;<br/>
And thou whose lustre gilds the rolling sphere!<br/>
With power congenial join'd, propitious aid<br/>
The chief adopted by the martial maid!<br/>
Such to our wish the warrior soon restore,<br/>
As when, contending on the Lesbian shore,<br/>
His prowess Philomelides confess'd,<br/>
And loud acclaiming Greeks the victor bless'd:<br/>
Then soon the invaders of his bed, and throne,<br/>
Their love presumptuous shall by death atone.<br/>
Now what you question of my ancient friend,<br/>
With truth I answer; thou the truth attend.<br/>
Learn what I heard the sea-born seer relate,<br/>
Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate<br/>
Sole in an isle, imprison'd by the main,<br/>
The sad survivor of his numerous train,<br/>
Ulysses lies; detain'd by magic charms,<br/>
And press'd unwilling in Calypso's arms.<br/>
No sailors there, no vessels to convey,<br/>
No oars to cut the immeasurable way.'<br/>
This told Atrides, and he told no more.<br/>
Then safe I voyaged to my native shore."
</p>
<p>
He ceased; nor made the pensive queen reply,<br/>
But droop'd her head, and drew a secret sigh.<br/>
When Theoclymenus the seer began:<br/>
"O suffering consort of the suffering man!<br/>
What human knowledge could, those kings might tell,<br/>
But I the secrets of high heaven reveal.<br/>
Before the first of gods be this declared,<br/>
Before the board whose blessings we have shared;<br/>
Witness the genial rites, and witness all<br/>
This house holds sacred in her ample wall!<br/>
E'en now, this instant, great Ulysses, laid<br/>
At rest, or wandering in his country's shade,<br/>
Their guilty deeds, in hearing, and in view,<br/>
Secret revolves; and plans the vengeance due.<br/>
Of this sure auguries the gods bestow'd,<br/>
When first our vessel anchor'd in your road."<br/>
"Succeed those omens, Heaven! (the queen rejoin'd)<br/>
So shall our bounties speak a grateful mind;<br/>
And every envied happiness attend<br/>
The man who calls Penelope his friend."<br/>
Thus communed they: while in the marble court<br/>
(Scene of their insolence) the lords resort:<br/>
Athwart the spacious square each tries his art,<br/>
To whirl the disk, or aim the missile dart.<br/>
Now did the hour of sweet repast arrive,<br/>
And from the field the victim flocks they drive:<br/>
Medon the herald (one who pleased them best,<br/>
And honour'd with a portion of their feast),<br/>
To bid the banquet, interrupts their play:<br/>
Swift to the hall they haste; aside they lay<br/>
Their garments, and succinct the victims slay.<br/>
Then sheep, and goats, and bristly porkers bled,<br/>
And the proud steer was o'er the marble spread.<br/>
While thus the copious banquet they provide,<br/>
Along the road, conversing side by side,<br/>
Proceed Ulysses and the faithful swain;<br/>
When thus Eumaeus, generous and humane:<br/>
"To town, observant of our lord's behest,<br/>
Now let us speed; my friend no more my guest!<br/>
Yet like myself I wish thee here preferr'd,<br/>
Guard of the flock, or keeper of the herd,<br/>
But much to raise my master's wrath I fear;<br/>
The wrath of princes ever is severe.<br/>
Then heed his will, and be our journey made<br/>
While the broad beams of Phœbus are display'd,<br/>
Or ere brown evening spreads her chilly shade."<br/>
"Just thy advice (the prudent chief rejoin'd),<br/>
And such as suits the dictate of my mind.<br/>
Lead on: but help me to some staff to stay<br/>
My feeble step, since rugged is the way."<br/>
Across his shoulders then the scrip he flung,<br/>
Wide-patch'd, and fasten'd by a twisted thong.<br/>
A staff Eumaeus gave. Along the way<br/>
Cheerly they fare: behind, the keepers stay:<br/>
These with their watchful dogs (a constant guard)<br/>
Supply his absence, and attend the herd.<br/>
And now his city strikes the monarch's eyes,<br/>
Alas! how changed! a man of miseries;<br/>
Propp'd on a staff, a beggar old and bare<br/>
In rags dishonest fluttering with the air!<br/>
Now pass'd the rugged road, they journey down<br/>
The cavern'd way descending to the town,<br/>
Where, from the rock, with liquid drops distils<br/>
A limpid fount; that spread in parting rills<br/>
Its current thence to serve the city brings;<br/>
An useful work, adorn'd by ancient kings.<br/>
Neritus, Ithacus, Polyctor, there,<br/>
In sculptured stone immortalized their care,<br/>
In marble urns received it from above,<br/>
And shaded with a green surrounding grove;<br/>
Where silver alders, in high arches twined,<br/>
Drink the cool stream, and tremble to the wind.<br/>
Beneath, sequester'd to the nymphs, is seen<br/>
A mossy altar, deep embower'd in green;<br/>
Where constant vows by travellers are paid,<br/>
And holy horrors solemnize the shade.
</p>
<p>
Here with his goats (not vow'd to sacred fame,<br/>
But pamper'd luxury) Melanthius came:<br/>
Two grooms attend him. With an envious look<br/>
He eyed the stranger, and imperious spoke:
</p>
<p>
"The good old proverb how this pair fulfil!<br/>
One rogue is usher to another still.<br/>
Heaven with a secret principle endued<br/>
Mankind, to seek their own similitude.<br/>
Where goes the swineherd with that ill-look'd guest?<br/>
That giant-glutton, dreadful at a feast!<br/>
Full many a post have those broad shoulders worn,<br/>
From every great man's gate repulsed with scorn:<br/>
To no brave prize aspired the worthless swain,<br/>
'Twas but for scraps he ask'd, and ask'd in vain.<br/>
To beg, than work, he better understands,<br/>
Or we perhaps might take him off thy hands.<br/>
For any office could the slave be good,<br/>
To cleanse the fold, or help the kids to food.<br/>
If any labour those big joints could learn,<br/>
Some whey, to wash his bowels, he might earn.<br/>
To cringe, to whine, his idle hands to spread,<br/>
Is all, by which that graceless maw is fed.<br/>
Yet hear me! if thy impudence but dare<br/>
Approach yon wall, I prophesy thy fare:<br/>
Dearly, full dearly, shalt thou buy thy bread<br/>
With many a footstool thundering at thy head."
</p>
<p>
He thus: nor insolent of word alone,<br/>
Spurn'd with his rustic heel his king unknown;<br/>
Spurn'd, but not moved: he like a pillar stood,<br/>
Nor stirr'd an inch, contemptuous, from the road:<br/>
Doubtful, or with his staff to strike him dead,<br/>
Or greet the pavement with his worthless head.<br/>
Short was that doubt; to quell his rage inured,<br/>
The hero stood self-conquer'd, and endured.<br/>
But hateful of the wretch, Eumaeus heaved<br/>
His hands obtesting, and this prayer conceived:<br/>
"Daughters of Jove! who from the ethereal bowers<br/>
Descend to swell the springs, and feed the flowers!<br/>
Nymphs of this fountain! to whose sacred names<br/>
Our rural victims mount in blazing flames!<br/>
To whom Ulysses' piety preferr'd<br/>
The yearly firstlings of his flock and herd;<br/>
Succeed my wish, your votary restore:<br/>
Oh, be some god his convoy to our shore!<br/>
Due pains shall punish then this slave's offence,<br/>
And humble all his airs of insolence,<br/>
Who, proudly stalking, leaves the herds at large,<br/>
Commences courtier, and neglects his charge."
</p>
<p>
"What mutters he? (Melanthius sharp rejoins;)<br/>
This crafty miscreant, big with dark designs?<br/>
The day shall come&mdash;nay, 'tis already near&mdash;<br/>
When, slave! to sell thee at a price too dear<br/>
Must be my care; and hence transport thee o'er,<br/>
A load and scandal to this happy shore.<br/>
Oh! that as surely great Apollo's dart,<br/>
Or some brave suitor's sword, might pierce the heart<br/>
Of the proud son; as that we stand this hour<br/>
In lasting safety from the father's power!"
</p>
<p>
So spoke the wretch, but, shunning farther fray,<br/>
Turn'd his proud step, and left them on their way.<br/>
Straight to the feastful palace he repair'd,<br/>
Familiar enter'd, and the banquet shared;<br/>
Beneath Eurymachus, his patron lord,<br/>
He took his place, and plenty heap'd the board.
</p>
<p>
Meantime they heard, soft circling in the sky<br/>
Sweet airs ascend, and heavenly minstrelsy<br/>
(For Phemius to the lyre attuned the strain):<br/>
Ulysses hearken'd, then address'd the swain:
</p>
<p>
"Well may this palace admiration claim,<br/>
Great and respondent to the master's fame!<br/>
Stage above stage the imperial structure stands,<br/>
Holds the chief honours, and the town commands:<br/>
High walls and battlements the courts inclose,<br/>
And the strong gates defy a host of foes.<br/>
Far other cares its dwellers now employ;<br/>
The throng'd assembly and the feast of joy:<br/>
I see the smokes of sacrifice aspire,<br/>
And hear (what graces every feast) the lyre."
</p>
<p>
Then thus Eumaeus: "Judge we which were best;<br/>
Amidst yon revellers a sudden guest<br/>
Choose you to mingle, while behind I stay?<br/>
Or I first entering introduce the way?<br/>
Wait for a space without, but wait not long;<br/>
This is the house of violence and wrong:<br/>
Some rude insult thy reverend age may bear;<br/>
For like their lawless lords the servants are."
</p>
<p>
"Just is, O friend! thy caution, and address'd<br/>
(Replied the chief, to no unheedful breast:)<br/>
The wrongs and injuries of base mankind<br/>
Fresh to my sense, and always in my mind.<br/>
The bravely-patient to no fortune yields:<br/>
On rolling oceans, and in fighting fields,<br/>
Storms have I pass'd, and many a stern debate;<br/>
And now in humbler scene submit to fate.<br/>
What cannot want? The best she will expose,<br/>
And I am learn'd in all her train of woes;<br/>
She fills with navies, hosts, and loud alarms,<br/>
The sea, the land, and shakes the world with arms!"
</p>
<p>
Thus, near the gates conferring as they drew,<br/>
Argus, the dog, his ancient master knew:<br/>
He not unconscious of the voice and tread,<br/>
Lifts to the sound his ear, and rears his head;<br/>
Bred by Ulysses, nourish'd at his board,<br/>
But, ah! not fated long to please his lord;<br/>
To him, his swiftness and his strength were vain;<br/>
The voice of glory call'd him o'er the main.<br/>
Till then in every sylvan chase renown'd,<br/>
With Argus, Argus, rung the woods around;<br/>
With him the youth pursued the goat or fawn,<br/>
Or traced the mazy leveret o'er the lawn.<br/>
Now left to man's ingratitude he lay,<br/>
Unhoused, neglected in the public way;<br/>
And where on heaps the rich manure was spread,<br/>
Obscene with reptiles, took his sordid bed.
</p>
<p>
He knew his lord; he knew, and strove to meet;<br/>
In vain he strove to crawl and kiss his feet;<br/>
Yet (all he could) his tail, his tears, his eyes,<br/>
Salute his master, and confess his joys.<br/>
Soft pity touch'd the mighty master's soul;<br/>
Adown his cheek a tear unbidden stole,<br/>
Stole unperceived: he turn'd his head and dried<br/>
The drop humane: then thus impassion'd cried:
</p>
<p>
"What noble beast in this abandon'd state<br/>
Lies here all helpless at Ulysses' gate?<br/>
His bulk and beauty speak no vulgar praise:<br/>
If, as he seems, he was in better days,<br/>
Some care his age deserves; or was he prized<br/>
For worthless beauty? therefore now despised;<br/>
Such dogs and men there are, mere things of state;<br/>
And always cherish'd by their friends, the great."
</p>
<p>
"Not Argus so, (Eumaeus thus rejoin'd,)<br/>
But served a master of a nobler kind,<br/>
Who, never, never shall behold him more!<br/>
Long, long since perish'd on a distant shore!<br/>
Oh had you seen him, vigorous, bold, and young,<br/>
Swift as a stag, and as a lion strong:<br/>
Him no fell savage on the plain withstood,<br/>
None 'scaped him bosom'd in the gloomy wood;<br/>
His eye how piercing, and his scent how true,<br/>
To wind the vapour on the tainted dew!<br/>
Such, when Ulysses left his natal coast:<br/>
Now years unnerve him, and his lord is lost!<br/>
The women keep the generous creature bare,<br/>
A sleek and idle race is all their care:<br/>
The master gone, the servants what restrains?<br/>
Or dwells humanity where riot reigns?<br/>
Jove fix'd it certain, that whatever day<br/>
Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away."
</p>
<p>
This said, the honest herdsman strode before;<br/>
The musing monarch pauses at the door:<br/>
The dog, whom Fate had granted to behold<br/>
His lord, when twenty tedious years had roll'd,<br/>
Takes a last look, and having seen him, dies;<br/>
So closed for ever faithful Argus' eyes!
</p>
<p>
And now Telemachus, the first of all,<br/>
Observed Eumaeus entering in the hall;<br/>
Distant he saw, across the shady dome;<br/>
Then gave a sign, and beckon'd him to come:<br/>
There stood an empty seat, where late was placed,<br/>
In order due, the steward of the feast,<br/>
(Who now was busied carving round the board,)<br/>
Eumaeus took, and placed it near his lord.<br/>
Before him instant was the banquet spread,<br/>
And the bright basket piled with loaves of bread.
</p>
<p>
Next came Ulysses lowly at the door,<br/>
A figure despicable, old, and poor.<br/>
In squalid vests, with many a gaping rent,<br/>
Propp'd on a staff, and trembling as he went.<br/>
Then, resting on the threshold of the gate,<br/>
Against a cypress pillar lean'd his weight<br/>
Smooth'd by the workman to a polish'd plane);<br/>
The thoughtful son beheld, and call'd his swain
</p>
<p>
"These viands, and this bread, Eumaeus! bear,<br/>
And let yon mendicant our plenty share:<br/>
And let him circle round the suitors' board,<br/>
And try the bounty of each gracious lord.<br/>
Bold let him ask, encouraged thus by me:<br/>
How ill, alas! do want and shame agree!"
</p>
<p>
His lord's command the faithful servant bears:<br/>
The seeming beggar answers with his prayers:<br/>
"Bless'd be Telemachus! in every deed<br/>
Inspire him. Jove! in every wish succeed!"<br/>
This said, the portion from his son convey'd<br/>
With smiles receiving on his scrip he laid.<br/>
Long has the minstrel swept the sounding wire,<br/>
He fed, and ceased when silence held the lyre.<br/>
Soon as the suitors from the banquet rose,<br/>
Minerva prompts the man of mighty woes<br/>
To tempt their bounties with a suppliant's art,<br/>
And learn the generous from the ignoble heart<br/>
(Not but his soul, resentful as humane,<br/>
Dooms to full vengeance all the offending train);<br/>
With speaking eyes, and voice of plaintive sound,<br/>
Humble he moves, imploring all around.<br/>
The proud feel pity, and relief bestow,<br/>
With such an image touch'd of human woe;<br/>
Inquiring all, their wonder they confess,<br/>
And eye the man, majestic in distress.
</p>
<p>
While thus they gaze and question with their eyes,<br/>
The bold Melanthius to their thought replies:<br/>
"My lords! this stranger of gigantic port<br/>
The good Eumaeus usher'd to your court.<br/>
Full well I mark'd the features of his face,<br/>
Though all unknown his clime, or noble race."
</p>
<p>
"And is this present, swineherd! of thy band?<br/>
Bring'st thou these vagrants to infest the land?<br/>
(Returns Antinous with retorted eye)<br/>
Objects uncouth, to check the genial joy.<br/>
Enough of these our court already grace;<br/>
Of giant stomach, and of famish'd face.<br/>
Such guests Eumaeus to his country brings,<br/>
To share our feast, and lead the life of kings."
</p>
<p>
To whom the hospitable swain rejoins:<br/>
"Thy passion, prince, belies thy knowing mind.<br/>
Who calls, from distant nations to his own,<br/>
The poor, distinguish'd by their wants alone?<br/>
Round the wide world are sought those men divine<br/>
Who public structures raise, or who design;<br/>
Those to whose eyes the gods their ways reveal,<br/>
Or bless with salutary arts to heal;<br/>
But chief to poets such respect belongs,<br/>
By rival nations courted for their songs;<br/>
These states invite, and mighty kings admire,<br/>
Wide as the sun displays his vital fire.<br/>
It is not so with want! how few that feed<br/>
A wretch unhappy, merely for his need!<br/>
Unjust to me, and all that serve the state,<br/>
To love Ulysses is to raise thy hate.<br/>
For me, suffice the approbation won<br/>
Of my great mistress, and her godlike son."
</p>
<p>
To him Telemachus: "No more incense<br/>
The man by nature prone to insolence:<br/>
Injurious minds just answers but provoke"&mdash;<br/>
Then turning to Antinous, thus he spoke:<br/>
"Thanks to thy care! whose absolute command<br/>
Thus drives the stranger from our court and land.<br/>
Heaven bless its owner with a better mind!<br/>
From envy free, to charity inclined.<br/>
This both Penelope and I afford:<br/>
Then, prince! be bounteous of Ulysses' board.<br/>
To give another's is thy hand so slow?<br/>
So much more sweet to spoil than to bestow?"
</p>
<p>
"Whence, great Telemachus! this lofty strain?<br/>
(Antinous cries with insolent disdain):<br/>
Portions like mine if every suitor gave,<br/>
Our walls this twelvemonth should not see the slave."
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and lifting high above the board<br/>
His ponderous footstool, shook it at his lord.<br/>
The rest with equal hand conferr'd the bread:<br/>
He fill'd his scrip, and to the threshold sped;<br/>
But first before Antinous stopp'd, and said:<br/>
"Bestow, my friend! thou dost not seem the worst<br/>
Of all the Greeks, but prince-like and the first;<br/>
Then, as in dignity, be first in worth,<br/>
And I shall praise thee through the boundless earth.<br/>
Once I enjoy'd in luxury of state<br/>
Whate'er gives man the envied name of great;<br/>
Wealth, servants, friends, were mine in better days<br/>
And hospitality was then my praise;<br/>
In every sorrowing soul I pour'd delight,<br/>
And poverty stood smiling in my sight.<br/>
But Jove, all-governing, whose only will<br/>
Determines fate, and mingles good with ill,<br/>
Sent me (to punish my pursuit of gain)<br/>
With roving pirates o'er the Egyptian main<br/>
By Egypt's silver flood our ships we moor;<br/>
Our spies commission'd straight the coast explore;<br/>
But impotent of mind, the lawless will<br/>
The country ravage, and the natives kill.<br/>
The spreading clamour to their city flies,<br/>
And horse and foot in mingled tumults rise:<br/>
The reddening dawn reveals the hostile fields,<br/>
Horrid with bristly spears, and gleaming shields:<br/>
Jove thunder'd on their side: our guilty head<br/>
We turn'd to flight; the gathering vengeance spread<br/>
On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lay dead.<br/>
Some few the foe in servitude detain;<br/>
Death ill exchanged for bondage and for pain!<br/>
Unhappy me a Cyprian took aboard,<br/>
And gave to Dmetor, Cyprus' haughty lord:<br/>
Hither, to 'scape his chains, my course I steer,<br/>
Still cursed by Fortune, and insulted here!"
</p>
<p>
To whom Antinous thus his rage express'd:<br/>
"What god has plagued us with this gourmand guest?<br/>
Unless at distance, wretch! thou keep behind,<br/>
Another isle, than Cyprus more unkind,<br/>
Another Egypt shalt thou quickly find.<br/>
From all thou begg'st, a bold audacious slave;<br/>
Nor all can give so much as thou canst crave.<br/>
Nor wonder I, at such profusion shown;<br/>
Shameless they give, who give what's not their own."
</p>
<p>
The chief, retiring: "Souls, like that in thee,<br/>
Ill suits such forms of grace and dignity.<br/>
Nor will that hand to utmost need afford<br/>
The smallest portion of a wasteful board,<br/>
Whose luxury whole patrimonies sweeps,<br/>
Yet starving want, amidst the riot, weeps."
</p>
<p>
The haughty suitor with resentment burns,<br/>
And, sourly smiling, this reply returns:<br/>
"Take that, ere yet thou quit this princely throng;<br/>
And dumb for ever be thy slanderous tongue!"<br/>
He said, and high the whirling tripod flung.<br/>
His shoulder-blade received the ungentle shock;<br/>
He stood, and moved not, like a marble rock;<br/>
But shook his thoughtful head, nor more complain'd,<br/>
Sedate of soul, his character sustain'd,<br/>
And inly form'd revenge; then back withdrew:<br/>
Before his feet the well fill'd scrip he threw,<br/>
And thus with semblance mild address'd the crew:
</p>
<p>
"May what I speak your princely minds approve,<br/>
Ye peers and rivals in this noble love!<br/>
Not for the hurt I grieve, but for the cause.<br/>
If, when the sword our country's quarrel draws,<br/>
Or if, defending what is justly dear,<br/>
From Mars impartial some broad wound we bear,<br/>
The generous motive dignifies the scar.<br/>
But for mere want, how hard to suffer wrong!<br/>
Want brings enough of other ills along!<br/>
Yet, if injustice never be secure,<br/>
If fiends revenge, and gods assert the poor,<br/>
Death shall lay low the proud aggressor's head,<br/>
And make the dust Antinous' bridal bed."
</p>
<p>
"Peace, wretch! and eat thy bread without offence<br/>
(The suitor cried), or force shall drag thee hence,<br/>
Scourge through the public street, and cast thee there,<br/>
A mangled carcase for the hounds to tear."
</p>
<p>
His furious deed the general anger moved,<br/>
All, even the worst, condemn'd; and some reproved.<br/>
"Was ever chief for wars like these renown'd?<br/>
Ill fits the stranger and the poor to wound.<br/>
Unbless'd thy hand! if in this low disguise<br/>
Wander, perhaps, some inmate of the skies;<br/>
They (curious oft of mortal actions) deign<br/>
In forms like these to round the earth and main,<br/>
Just and unjust recording in their mind,<br/>
And with sure eyes inspecting all mankind."
</p>
<p>
Telemachus, absorb'd in thought severe,<br/>
Nourish'd deep anguish, though he shed no tear;<br/>
But the dark brow of silent sorrow shook:<br/>
While thus his mother to her virgins spoke:
</p>
<p>
"On him and his may the bright god of day<br/>
That base, inhospitable blow repay!"<br/>
The nurse replies: "If Jove receives my prayer,<br/>
Not one survives to breathe to-morrow's air."
</p>
<p>
"All, all are foes, and mischief is their end;<br/>
Antinous most to gloomy death a friend<br/>
(Replies the queen): the stranger begg'd their grace,<br/>
And melting pity soften'd every face;<br/>
From every other hand redress he found,<br/>
But fell Antinous answer'd with a wound."<br/>
Amidst her maids thus spoke the prudent queen,<br/>
Then bade Eumaeus call the pilgrim in.<br/>
"Much of the experienced man I long to hear,<br/>
If or his certain eye, or listening ear,<br/>
Have learn'd the fortunes of my wandering lord?"<br/>
Thus she, and good Eumaeus took the word:
</p>
<p>
"A private audience if thy grace impart,<br/>
The stranger's words may ease the royal heart.<br/>
His sacred eloquence in balm distils,<br/>
And the soothed heart with secret pleasure fills.<br/>
Three days have spent their beams, three nights have run<br/>
Their silent journey, since his tale begun,<br/>
Unfinish'd yet; and yet I thirst to hear!<br/>
As when some heaven-taught poet charms the ear<br/>
(Suspending sorrow with celestial strain<br/>
Breathed from the gods to soften human pain)<br/>
Time steals away with unregarded wing,<br/>
And the soul hears him, though he cease to sing
</p>
<p>
"Ulysses late he saw, on Cretan ground<br/>
(His fathers guest), for Minos' birth renown'd.<br/>
He now but waits the wind to waft him o'er,<br/>
With boundless treasure, from Thesprotia's shore."
</p>
<p>
To this the queen: "The wanderer let me hear,<br/>
While yon luxurious race indulge their cheer,<br/>
Devour the grazing ox, and browsing goat,<br/>
And turn my generous vintage down their throat.<br/>
For where's an arm, like thine, Ulysses! strong,<br/>
To curb wild riot, and to punish wrong?"
</p>
<p>
She spoke. Telemachus then sneezed aloud;<br/>
Constrain'd, his nostril echoed through the crowd.<br/>
The smiling queen the happy omen bless'd:
</p>
<p>
"So may these impious fall, by Fate oppress'd!"<br/>
Then to Eumaeus: "Bring the stranger, fly!<br/>
And if my questions meet a true reply,<br/>
Graced with a decent robe he shall retire,<br/>
A gift in season which his wants require."
</p>
<p>
Thus spoke Penelope. Eumaeus flies<br/>
In duteous haste, and to Ulysses cries:<br/>
"The queen invites thee, venerable guest!<br/>
A secret instinct moves her troubled breast,<br/>
Of her long absent lord from thee to gain<br/>
Some light, and soothe her soul's eternal pain.<br/>
If true, if faithful thou, her grateful mind<br/>
Of decent robes a present has design'd:<br/>
So finding favour in the royal eye,<br/>
Thy other wants her subjects shall supply."
</p>
<p>
"Fair truth alone (the patient man replied)<br/>
My words shall dictate, and my lips shall guide.<br/>
To him, to me, one common lot was given,<br/>
In equal woes, alas! involved by Heaven.<br/>
Much of his fates I know; but check'd by fear<br/>
I stand; the hand of violence is here:<br/>
Here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade,<br/>
And injured suppliants seek in vain for aid.<br/>
Let for a space the pensive queen attend,<br/>
Nor claim my story till the sun descend;<br/>
Then in such robes as suppliants may require,<br/>
Composed and cheerful by the genial fire,<br/>
When loud uproar and lawless riot cease,<br/>
Shall her pleased ear receive my words in peace."
</p>
<p>
Swift to the queen returns the gentle swain:<br/>
"And say (she cries), does fear or shame detain<br/>
The cautious stranger? With the begging kind<br/>
Shame suits but ill." Eumaeus thus rejoin'd:
</p>
<p>
"He only asks a more propitious hour,<br/>
And shuns (who would not?) wicked men in power;<br/>
At evening mild (meet season to confer)<br/>
By turns to question, and by turns to hear."
</p>
<p>
"Whoe'er this guest (the prudent queen replies)<br/>
His every step and every thought is wise.<br/>
For men like these on earth he shall not find<br/>
In all the miscreant race of human kind."<br/>
Thus she. Eumaeus all her words attends,<br/>
And, parting, to the suitor powers descends;<br/>
There seeks Telemachus, and thus apart<br/>
In whispers breathes the fondness of his heart:
</p>
<p>
"The time, my lord, invites me to repair<br/>
Hence to the lodge; my charge demands my care.<br/>
These sons of murder thirst thy life to take;<br/>
O guard it, guard it, for thy servant's sake!"
</p>
<p>
"Thanks to my friend (he cries): but now the hour<br/>
Of night draws on, go seek the rural bower:<br/>
But first refresh: and at the dawn of day<br/>
Hither a victim to the gods convey.<br/>
Our life to Heaven's immortal powers we trust,<br/>
Safe in their care, for Heaven protects the just."
</p>
<p>
Observant of his voice, Eumaeus sate<br/>
And fed recumbent on a chair of state.<br/>
Then instant rose, and as he moved along,<br/>
'Twas riot all amid the suitor throng,<br/>
They feast, they dance, and raise the mirthful song<br/>
Till now, declining towards the close of day,<br/>
The sun obliquely shot his dewy ray.

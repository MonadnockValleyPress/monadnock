<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book XXI</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
And Pallas now, to raise the rivals' fires,<br/>
With her own art Penelope inspires<br/>
Who now can bend Ulysses' bow, and wing<br/>
The well-aim'd arrow through the distant ring,<br/>
Shall end the strife, and win the imperial dame:<br/>
But discord and black death await the game!
</p>
<p>
The prudent queen the lofty stair ascends:<br/>
At distance due a virgin-train attends;<br/>
A brazen key she held, the handle turn'd,<br/>
With steel and polish'd elephant adorn'd:<br/>
Swift to the inmost room she bent her way,<br/>
Where, safe reposed, the royal treasures lay:<br/>
There shone high heap'd the labour'd brass and ore,<br/>
And there the bow which great Ulysses bore;<br/>
And there the quiver, where now guiltless slept<br/>
Those winged deaths that many a matron wept.
</p>
<p>
This gift, long since when Sparta's shore he trod,<br/>
On young Ulysses Iphitus bestowed:<br/>
Beneath Orsilochus' roof they met;<br/>
One loss was private, one a public debt;<br/>
Messena's state from Ithaca detains<br/>
Three hundred sheep, and all the shepherd swains;<br/>
And to the youthful prince to urge the laws,<br/>
The king and elders trust their common cause.<br/>
But Iphitus, employed on other cares,<br/>
Search'd the wide country for his wandering mares,<br/>
And mules, the strongest of the labouring kind;<br/>
Hapless to search; more hapless still to find!<br/>
For journeying on to Hercules, at length<br/>
That lawless wretch, that man of brutal strength,<br/>
Deaf to Heaven's voice, the social rites transgress'd;<br/>
And for the beauteous mares destroy'd his guest.<br/>
He gave the bow; and on Ulysses' part<br/>
Received a pointed sword, and missile dart:<br/>
Of luckless friendship on a foreign shore<br/>
Their first, last pledges! for they met no more.<br/>
The bow, bequeath'd by this unhappy hand,<br/>
Ulysses bore not from his native land;<br/>
Nor in the front of battle taught to bend,<br/>
But kept in dear memorial of his friend.
</p>
<p>
Now gently winding up the fair ascent,<br/>
By many an easy step the matron went;<br/>
Then o'er the pavement glides with grace divine<br/>
(With polish'd oak the level pavements shine);<br/>
The folding gates a dazzling light display'd,<br/>
With pomp of various architrave o'erlaid.<br/>
The bolt, obedient to the silken string,<br/>
Forsakes the staple as she pulls the ring;<br/>
The wards respondent to the key turn round;<br/>
The bars fall back; the flying valves resound;<br/>
Loud as a bull makes hill and valley ring,<br/>
So roar'd the lock when it released the spring.<br/>
She moves majestic through the wealthy room,<br/>
Where treasured garments cast a rich perfume;<br/>
There from the column where aloft it hung,<br/>
Reach'd in its splendid case, the bow unstrung;<br/>
Across her knees she laid the well-known bow,<br/>
And pensive sate, and tears began to flow.<br/>
To full satiety of grief she mourns,<br/>
Then silent to the joyous hall returns,<br/>
To the proud suitors bears in pensive state<br/>
The unbended bow, and arrows winged with fate.
</p>
<p>
Behind, her train the polish'd coffer brings,<br/>
Which held the alternate brass and silver rings.<br/>
Full in the portal the chaste queen appears,<br/>
And with her veil conceals the coming tears:<br/>
On either side awaits a virgin fair;<br/>
While thus the matron, with majestic air:
</p>
<p>
"Say you, when these forbidden walls inclose,<br/>
For whom my victims bleed, my vintage flows:<br/>
If these neglected, faded charms can move?<br/>
Or is it but a vain pretence, you love?<br/>
If I the prize, if me you seek to wife,<br/>
Hear the conditions, and commence the strife.<br/>
Who first Ulysses' wondrous bow shall bend,<br/>
And through twelve ringlets the fleet arrow send;<br/>
Him will I follow, and forsake my home,<br/>
For him forsake this loved, this wealthy dome,<br/>
Long, long the scene of all my past delight,<br/>
And still to last, the vision of my night!"
</p>
<p>
Graceful she said, and bade Eumaeus show<br/>
The rival peers the ringlets and the bow.<br/>
From his full eyes the tears unbidden spring,<br/>
Touch'd at the dear memorials of his king.<br/>
Philaetius too relents, but secret shed<br/>
The tender drops. Antinous saw, and said:
</p>
<p>
"Hence to your fields, ye rustics! hence away,<br/>
Nor stain with grief the pleasures of the day;<br/>
Nor to the royal heart recall in vain<br/>
The sad remembrance of a perish'd man.<br/>
Enough her precious tears already flow&mdash;<br/>
Or share the feast with due respect; or go<br/>
To weep abroad, and leave to us the bow,<br/>
No vulgar task! Ill suits this courtly crew<br/>
That stubborn horn which brave Ulysses drew.<br/>
I well remember (for I gazed him o'er<br/>
While yet a child), what majesty he bore!<br/>
And still (all infant as I was) retain<br/>
The port, the strength, the grandeur of the man."
</p>
<p>
He said, but in his soul fond joys arise,<br/>
And his proud hopes already win the prize.<br/>
To speed the flying shaft through every ring,<br/>
Wretch! is not thine: the arrows of the king<br/>
Shall end those hopes, and fate is on the wing!
</p>
<p>
Then thus Telemachus: "Some god I find<br/>
With pleasing frenzy has possess'd my mind;<br/>
When a loved mother threatens to depart,<br/>
Why with this ill-timed gladness leaps my heart?<br/>
Come then, ye suitors! and dispute a prize<br/>
Richer than all the Achaian state supplies,<br/>
Than all proud Argos, or Mycaena knows,<br/>
Than all our isles or continents inclose;<br/>
A woman matchless, and almost divine,<br/>
Fit for the praise of every tongue but mine.<br/>
No more excuses then, no more delay;<br/>
Haste to the trial&mdash;Lo! I lead the way.
</p>
<p>
"I too may try, and if this arm can wing<br/>
The feather'd arrow through the destined ring,<br/>
Then if no happier night the conquest boast,<br/>
I shall not sorrow for a mother lost;<br/>
But, bless'd in her, possess those arms alone,<br/>
Heir of my father's strength, as well as throne."
</p>
<p>
He spoke; then rising, his broad sword unbound,<br/>
And cast his purple garment on the ground.<br/>
A trench he open'd: in a line he placed.<br/>
The level axes, and the points made fast<br/>
(His perfect skill the wondering gazers eyed,<br/>
The game as yet unseen, as yet untried).<br/>
Then, with a manly pace, he took his stand:<br/>
And grasp'd the bow, and twang'd it in his hand.<br/>
Three times, with beating heart, he made essay:<br/>
Three times, unequal to the task, gave way;<br/>
A modest boldness on his cheek appear'd:<br/>
And thrice he hoped, and thrice again he fear'd.<br/>
The fourth had drawn it. The great sire with joy<br/>
Beheld, but with a sign forbade the boy.<br/>
His ardour straight the obedient prince suppress'd,<br/>
And, artful, thus the suitor-train address'd:
</p>
<p>
"O lay the cause on youth yet immature!<br/>
(For heaven forbid such weakness should endure!)<br/>
How shall this arm, unequal to the bow,<br/>
Retort an insult, or repel a foe?<br/>
But you! whom Heaven with better nerves has bless'd,<br/>
Accept the trial, and the prize contest."
</p>
<p>
He cast the bow before him, and apart<br/>
Against the polish'd quiver propp'd the dart.<br/>
Resuming then his seat, Eupithes' son,<br/>
The bold Antinous, to the rest begun:<br/>
"From where the goblet first begins to flow,<br/>
From right to left in order take the bow;<br/>
And prove your several strengths." The princes heard<br/>
And first Leiodes, blameless priest, appear'd:<br/>
The eldest born of Å’nops' noble race,<br/>
Who next the goblet held his holy place:<br/>
He, only he, of all the suitor throng,<br/>
Their deeds detested, and abjured the wrong.<br/>
With tender hands the stubborn horn he strains,<br/>
The stubborn horn resisted all his pains!<br/>
Already in despair he gives it o'er:<br/>
"Take it who will (he cries), I strive no more,<br/>
What numerous deaths attend this fatal bow!<br/>
What souls and spirits shall it send below!<br/>
Better, indeed, to die, and fairly give<br/>
Nature her debt, than disappointed live,<br/>
With each new sun to some new hope a prey,<br/>
Yet still to-morrow falser than to-day.<br/>
How long in vain Penelope we sought!<br/>
This bow shall ease us of that idle thought,<br/>
And send us with some humbler wife to live,<br/>
Whom gold shall gain, or destiny shall give."
</p>
<p>
Thus speaking, on the floor the bow he placed<br/>
(With rich inlay the various floor was graced):<br/>
At distance far the feather'd shaft he throws,<br/>
And to the seat returns from whence he rose.
</p>
<p>
To him Antinous thus with fury said:<br/>
"What words ill-omen'd from thy lips have fled?<br/>
Thy coward-function ever is in fear!<br/>
Those arms are dreadful which thou canst not bear,<br/>
Why should this bow be fatal to the brave?<br/>
Because the priest is born a peaceful slave.<br/>
Mark then what others can." He ended there,<br/>
And bade Melanthius a vast pile prepare;<br/>
He gives it instant flame, then fast beside<br/>
Spreads o'er an ample board a bullock's hide.<br/>
With melted lard they soak the weapon o'er,<br/>
Chafe every knot, and supple every pore.<br/>
Vain all their art, and all their strength as vain;<br/>
The bow inflexible resists their pain.<br/>
The force of great Eurymachus alone<br/>
And bold Antinous, yet untired, unknown:<br/>
Those only now remain'd; but those confess'd<br/>
Of all the train the mightiest and the best.
</p>
<p>
Then from the hall, and from the noisy crew,<br/>
The masters of the herd and flock withdrew.<br/>
The king observes them, he the hall forsakes,<br/>
And, past the limits of the court, o'ertakes.<br/>
Then thus with accent mild Ulysses spoke:<br/>
"Ye faithful guardians of the herd and flock!<br/>
Shall I the secret of my breast conceal,<br/>
Or (as my soul now dictates) shall I tell?<br/>
Say, should some favouring god restore again<br/>
The lost Ulysses to his native reign,<br/>
How beat your hearts? what aid would you afford<br/>
To the proud suitors, or your ancient lord?"
</p>
<p>
Philaetius thus: "O were thy word not vain!<br/>
Would mighty Jove restore that man again!<br/>
These aged sinews, with new vigour strung,<br/>
In his blest cause should emulate the young."<br/>
With equal vows Eumaeus too implored<br/>
Each power above, with wishes for his lord.
</p>
<p>
He saw their secret souls, and thus began:<br/>
"Those vows the gods accord; behold the man!<br/>
Your own Ulysses! twice ten years detain'd<br/>
By woes and wanderings from this hapless land:<br/>
At length he comes; but comes despised, unknown,<br/>
And finding faithful you, and you alone.<br/>
All else have cast him from their very thought,<br/>
E'en in their wishes and their prayers forgot!<br/>
Hear then, my friends: If Jove this arm succeed,<br/>
And give yon impious revellers to bleed,<br/>
My care shall be to bless your future lives<br/>
With large possessions and with faithful wives;<br/>
Fast by my palace shall your domes ascend,<br/>
And each on young Telemachus attend,<br/>
And each be call'd his brother and my friend.<br/>
To give you firmer faith, now trust your eye;<br/>
Lo! the broad scar indented on my thigh,<br/>
When with Autolycus' sons, of yore,<br/>
On Parnass' top I chased the tusky boar."<br/>
His ragged vest then drawn aside disclosed<br/>
The sign conspicuous, and the scar exposed:<br/>
Eager they view'd, with joy they stood amazed<br/>
With tearful eyes o'er all their master gazed:<br/>
Around his neck their longing arms they cast,<br/>
His head, his shoulders, and his knees embraced;<br/>
Tears followed tears; no word was in their power;<br/>
In solemn silence fell the kindly shower.<br/>
The king too weeps, the king too grasps their hands;<br/>
And moveless, as a marble fountain, stands.
</p>
<p>
Thus had their joy wept down the setting sun,<br/>
But first the wise man ceased, and thus begun:<br/>
"Enough&mdash;on other cares your thought employ,<br/>
For danger waits on all untimely joy.<br/>
Full many foes and fierce, observe us near;<br/>
Some may betray, and yonder walls may hear.<br/>
Re-enter then, not all at once, but stay<br/>
Some moments you, and let me lead the way.<br/>
To me, neglected as I am I know<br/>
The haughty suitors will deny the bow;<br/>
But thou, Eumaeus, as 'tis borne away,<br/>
Thy master's weapon to his hand convey.<br/>
At every portal let some matron wait,<br/>
And each lock fast the well-compacted gate:<br/>
Close let them keep, whate'er invades their ear;<br/>
Though arms, or shouts, or dying groans they hear.<br/>
To thy strict charge, Philaetius, we consign<br/>
The court's main gate: to guard that pass be thine."
</p>
<p>
This said, he first return'd; the faithful swains<br/>
At distance follow, as their king ordains.<br/>
Before the flame Eurymachus now stands,<br/>
And turns the bow, and chafes it with his hands<br/>
Still the tough bow unmoved. The lofty man<br/>
Sigh'd from his mighty soul, and thus began:
</p>
<p>
"I mourn the common cause: for, oh, my friends,<br/>
On me, on all, what grief, what shame attends!<br/>
Not the lost nuptials can affect me more<br/>
(For Greece has beauteous dames on every shore),<br/>
But baffled thus! confess'd so far below<br/>
Ulysses' strength, as not to bend his bow!<br/>
How shall all ages our attempt deride!<br/>
Our weakness scorn!" Antinous thus replied:
</p>
<p>
"Not so, Eurymachus: that no man draws<br/>
The wondrous bow, attend another cause.<br/>
Sacred to PhÅ“bus is the solemn day,<br/>
Which thoughtless we in games would waste away:<br/>
Till the next dawn this ill-timed strife forego,<br/>
And here leave fixed the ringlets in a row.<br/>
Now bid the sewer approach, and let us join<br/>
In due libations, and in rites divine,<br/>
So end our night: before the day shall spring,<br/>
The choicest offerings let Melanthius bring:<br/>
Let then to PhÅ“bus' name the fatted thighs<br/>
Feed the rich smokes high curling to the skies.<br/>
So shall the patron of these arts bestow<br/>
(For his the gift) the skill to bend the bow."
</p>
<p>
They heard well pleased: the ready heralds bring<br/>
The cleansing waters from the limpid spring:<br/>
The goblet high with rosy wine they crown'd,<br/>
In order circling to the peers around.<br/>
That rite complete, uprose the thoughtful man,<br/>
And thus his meditated scheme began:
</p>
<p>
"If what I ask your noble minds approve,<br/>
Ye peers and rivals in the royal love!<br/>
Chief, if it hurt not great Antinous' ear<br/>
(Whose sage decision I with wonder hear),<br/>
And if Eurymachus the motion please:<br/>
Give Heaven this day and rest the bow in peace.<br/>
To-morrow let your arms dispute the prize,<br/>
And take it he, the favour'd of the skies!<br/>
But, since till then this trial you delay,<br/>
Trust it one moment to my hands to-day:<br/>
Fain would I prove, before your judging eyes,<br/>
What once I was, whom wretched you despise:<br/>
If yet this arm its ancient force retain;<br/>
Or if my woes (a long-continued train)<br/>
And wants and insults, make me less than man."
</p>
<p>
Rage flash'd in lightning from the suitors' eyes,<br/>
Yet mixed with terror at the bold emprise.<br/>
Antinous then: "O miserable guest!<br/>
Is common sense quite banish'd from thy breast?<br/>
Sufficed it not, within the palace placed,<br/>
To sit distinguish'd, with our presence graced,<br/>
Admitted here with princes to confer,<br/>
A man unknown, a needy wanderer?<br/>
To copious wine this insolence we owe,<br/>
And much thy betters wine can overthrow:<br/>
The great Eurytion, when this frenzy stung,<br/>
Pirithous' roofs with frantic riot rung;<br/>
Boundless the Centaur raged; till one and all<br/>
The heroes rose, and dragg'd him from the hall;<br/>
His nose they shorten'd, and his ears they slit,<br/>
And sent him sober'd home, with better wit.<br/>
Hence with long war the double race was cursed,<br/>
Fatal to all, but to the aggressor first.<br/>
Such fate I prophesy our guest attends,<br/>
If here this interdicted bow he bends:<br/>
Nor shall these walls such insolence contain:<br/>
The first fair wind transports him o'er the main,<br/>
Where Echetus to death the guilty brings<br/>
(The worst of mortals, e'en the worst of kings).<br/>
Better than that, if thou approve our cheer;<br/>
Cease the mad strife and share our bounty here."
</p>
<p>
To this the queen her just dislike express'd:
</p>
<p>
"'Tis impious, prince, to harm the stranger-guest,<br/>
Base to insult who bears a suppliant's name,<br/>
And some respect Telemachus may claim.<br/>
What if the immortals on the man bestow<br/>
Sufficient strength to draw the mighty bow?<br/>
Shall I, a queen, by rival chiefs adored,<br/>
Accept a wandering stranger for my lord?<br/>
A hope so idle never touch'd his brain:<br/>
Then ease your bosoms of a fear so vain.<br/>
Far be he banish'd from this stately scene<br/>
Who wrongs his princess with a thought so mean."
</p>
<p>
"O fair! and wisest of so fair a kind!<br/>
(Respectful thus Eurymachus rejoin'd,)<br/>
Moved by no weak surmise, but sense of shame,<br/>
We dread the all-arraigning voice of Fame:<br/>
We dread the censure of the meanest slave,<br/>
The weakest woman: all can wrong the brave.<br/>
'Behold what wretches to the bed pretend<br/>
Of that brave chief whose bow they could not bend!<br/>
In came a beggar of the strolling crew,<br/>
And did what all those princes could not do.'<br/>
Thus will the common voice our deed defame,<br/>
And thus posterity upbraid our name."
</p>
<p>
To whom the queen: "If fame engage your views,<br/>
Forbear those acts which infamy pursues;<br/>
Wrong and oppression no renown can raise;<br/>
Know, friend! that virtue is the path to praise.<br/>
The stature of our guest, his port, his face,<br/>
Speak him descended from no vulgar race.<br/>
To him the bow, as he desires, convey;<br/>
And to his hand if PhÅ“bus give the day,<br/>
Hence, to reward his merit, be shall bear<br/>
A two-edged falchion and a shining spear,<br/>
Embroider'd sandals, a rich cloak and vest,<br/>
A safe conveyance to his port of rest."
</p>
<p>
"O royal mother! ever-honour'd name!<br/>
Permit me (cries Telemachus) to claim<br/>
A son's just right. No Grecian prince but I<br/>
Has power this bow to grant or to deny.<br/>
Of all that Ithaca's rough hills contain,<br/>
And all wide Elis' courser-breeding plain,<br/>
To me alone my father's arms descend;<br/>
And mine alone they are, to give or lend.<br/>
Retire, O queen! thy household task resume,<br/>
Tend, with thy maids, the labours of thy loom;<br/>
The bow, the darts, and arms of chivalry,<br/>
These cares to man belong, and most to me."
</p>
<p>
Mature beyond his years, the queen admired<br/>
His sage reply, and with her train retired;<br/>
There in her chamber as she sate apart,<br/>
Revolved his words, and placed them in her heart.<br/>
On her Ulysses then she fix'd her soul;<br/>
Down her fair cheek the tears abundant roll,<br/>
Till gentle Pallas, piteous of her cries,<br/>
In slumber closed her silver-streaming eyes.
</p>
<p>
Now through the press the bow Eumaeus bore,<br/>
And all was riot, noise, and wild uproar.<br/>
"Hold! lawless rustic! whither wilt thou go?<br/>
To whom, insensate, dost thou bear the bow?<br/>
Exiled for this to some sequester'd den,<br/>
Far from the sweet society of men,<br/>
To thy own dogs a prey thou shalt be made;<br/>
If Heaven and PhÅ“bus lend the suitors aid."<br/>
Thus they. Aghast he laid the weapon down,<br/>
But bold Telemachus thus urged him on:<br/>
"Proceed, false slave, and slight their empty words:<br/>
What! hopes the fool to please so many lords?<br/>
Young as I am, thy prince's vengeful hand<br/>
Stretch'd forth in wrath shall drive thee from the land.<br/>
Oh! could the vigour of this arm as well<br/>
The oppressive suitors from my walls expel!<br/>
Then what a shoal of lawless men should go<br/>
To fill with tumult the dark courts below!"
</p>
<p>
The suitors with a scornful smile survey<br/>
The youth, indulging in the genial day.<br/>
Eumaeus, thus encouraged, hastes to bring<br/>
The strifeful bow and gives it to the king.<br/>
Old Euryclea calling then aside,<br/>
"Hear what Telemachus enjoins (he cried):<br/>
At every portal let some matron wait,<br/>
And each lock fast the well-compacted gate;<br/>
And if unusual sounds invade their ear,<br/>
If arms, or shouts, or dying groans they hear,<br/>
Let none to call or issue forth presume,<br/>
But close attend the labours of the loom."
</p>
<p>
Her prompt obedience on his order waits;<br/>
Closed in an instant were the palace gates.<br/>
In the same moment forth Philaetius flies,<br/>
Secures the court, and with a cable ties<br/>
The utmost gate (the cable strongly wrought<br/>
Of Byblos' reed, a ship from Egypt brought);<br/>
Then unperceived and silent at the board<br/>
His seat he takes, his eyes upon his lord.
</p>
<p>
And now his well-known bow the master bore,<br/>
Turn'd on all sides, and view'd it o'er and o'er;<br/>
Lest time or worms had done the weapon wrong,<br/>
Its owner absent, and untried so long.<br/>
While some deriding&mdash;"How he turns the bow!<br/>
Some other like it sure the man must know,<br/>
Or else would copy; or in bows he deals;<br/>
Perhaps he makes them, or perhaps he steals."<br/>
"Heaven to this wretch (another cried) be kind!<br/>
And bless, in all to which he stands inclined.<br/>
With such good fortune as he now shall find."
</p>
<p>
Heedless he heard them: but disdain'd reply;<br/>
The bow perusing with exactest eye.<br/>
Then, as some heavenly minstrel, taught to sing<br/>
High notes responsive to the trembling string,<br/>
To some new strain when he adapts the lyre,<br/>
Or the dumb lute refits with vocal wire,<br/>
Relaxes, strains, and draws them to and fro;<br/>
So the great master drew the mighty bow,<br/>
And drew with ease. One hand aloft display'd<br/>
The bending horns, and one the string essay'd.<br/>
From his essaying hand the string, let fly,<br/>
Twang'd short and sharp like the shrill swallow's cry.<br/>
A general horror ran through all the race,<br/>
Sunk was each heart, and pale was every face,<br/>
Signs from above ensued: the unfolding sky<br/>
In lightning burst; Jove thunder'd from on high.<br/>
Fired at the call of heaven's almighty Lord,<br/>
He snatch'd the shaft that glitter'd on the board<br/>
(Fast by, the rest lay sleeping in the sheath,<br/>
But soon to fly the messengers of death).
</p>
<p>
Now sitting as he was, the cord he drew,<br/>
Through every ringlet levelling his view:<br/>
Then notch'd the shaft, released, and gave it wing;<br/>
The whizzing arrow vanished from the string,<br/>
Sung on direct, and threaded every ring.<br/>
The solid gate its fury scarcely bounds;<br/>
Pierced through and through the solid gate resounds,<br/>
Then to the prince: "Nor have I wrought thee shame;<br/>
Nor err'd this hand unfaithful to its aim;<br/>
Nor prov'd the toil too hard; nor have I lost<br/>
That ancient vigour, once my pride and boast.<br/>
Ill I deserved these haughty peers' disdain;<br/>
Now let them comfort their dejected train,<br/>
In sweet repast their present hour employ,<br/>
Nor wait till evening for the genial joy:<br/>
Then to the lute's soft voice prolong the night;<br/>
Music, the banquet's most refined delight."
</p>
<p>
He said, then gave a nod; and at the word<br/>
Telemachus girds on his shining sword.<br/>
Fast by his father's side he takes his stand:<br/>
The beamy javelin lightens in his hand.

<h1>The Iliad</h1>
<h3>Book XXIV</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Now from the finish'd games the Grecian band<br/>
Seek their black ships, and clear the crowded strand,<br/>
All stretch'd at ease the genial banquet share,<br/>
And pleasing slumbers quiet all their care.<br/>
Not so Achilles: he, to grief resign'd,<br/>
His friend's dear image present to his mind,<br/>
Takes his sad couch, more unobserved to weep;<br/>
Nor tastes the gifts of all-composing sleep.<br/>
Restless he roll'd around his weary bed,<br/>
And all his soul on his Patroclus fed:<br/>
The form so pleasing, and the heart so kind,<br/>
That youthful vigour, and that manly mind,<br/>
What toils they shared, what martial works they wrought,<br/>
What seas they measured, and what fields they fought;<br/>
All pass'd before him in remembrance dear,<br/>
Thought follows thought, and tear succeeds to tear.<br/>
And now supine, now prone, the hero lay,<br/>
Now shifts his side, impatient for the day:<br/>
Then starting up, disconsolate he goes<br/>
Wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes.<br/>
There as the solitary mourner raves,<br/>
The ruddy morning rises o'er the waves:<br/>
Soon as it rose, his furious steeds he join'd!<br/>
The chariot flies, and Hector trails behind.<br/>
And thrice, Patroclus! round thy monument<br/>
Was Hector dragg'd, then hurried to the tent.<br/>
There sleep at last o'ercomes the hero's eyes;<br/>
While foul in dust the unhonour'd carcase lies,<br/>
But not deserted by the pitying skies:<br/>
For Phoebus watch'd it with superior care,<br/>
Preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air;<br/>
And, ignominious as it swept the field,<br/>
Spread o'er the sacred corse his golden shield.<br/>
All heaven was moved, and Hermes will'd to go<br/>
By stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe:<br/>
But Neptune this, and Pallas this denies,<br/>
And th' unrelenting empress of the skies,<br/>
E'er since that day implacable to Troy,<br/>
What time young Paris, simple shepherd boy,<br/>
Won by destructive lust (reward obscene),<br/>
Their charms rejected for the Cyprian queen.<br/>
But when the tenth celestial morning broke,<br/>
To heaven assembled, thus Apollo spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Unpitying powers! how oft each holy fane<br/>
Has Hector tinged with blood of victims slain?<br/>
And can ye still his cold remains pursue?<br/>
Still grudge his body to the Trojans' view?<br/>
Deny to consort, mother, son, and sire,<br/>
The last sad honours of a funeral fire?<br/>
Is then the dire Achilles all your care?<br/>
That iron heart, inflexibly severe;<br/>
A lion, not a man, who slaughters wide,<br/>
In strength of rage, and impotence of pride;<br/>
Who hastes to murder with a savage joy,<br/>
Invades around, and breathes but to destroy!<br/>
Shame is not of his soul; nor understood,<br/>
The greatest evil and the greatest good.<br/>
Still for one loss he rages unresign'd,<br/>
Repugnant to the lot of all mankind;<br/>
To lose a friend, a brother, or a son,<br/>
Heaven dooms each mortal, and its will is done:<br/>
Awhile they sorrow, then dismiss their care;<br/>
Fate gives the wound, and man is born to bear.<br/>
But this insatiate, the commission given<br/>
By fate exceeds, and tempts the wrath of heaven:<br/>
Lo, how his rage dishonest drags along<br/>
Hector's dead earth, insensible of wrong!<br/>
Brave though he be, yet by no reason awed,<br/>
He violates the laws of man and god."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"If equal honours by the partial skies<br/>
Are doom'd both heroes, (Juno thus replies,)<br/>
If Thetis' son must no distinction know,<br/>
Then hear, ye gods! the patron of the bow.<br/>
But Hector only boasts a mortal claim,<br/>
His birth deriving from a mortal dame:<br/>
Achilles, of your own ethereal race,<br/>
Springs from a goddess by a man's embrace<br/>
(A goddess by ourself to Peleus given,<br/>
A man divine, and chosen friend of heaven)<br/>
To grace those nuptials, from the bright abode<br/>
Yourselves were present; where this minstrel-god,<br/>
Well pleased to share the feast, amid the quire<br/>
Stood proud to hymn, and tune his youthful lyre."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then thus the Thunderer checks the imperial dame:<br/>
"Let not thy wrath the court of heaven inflame;<br/>
Their merits, nor their honours, are the same.<br/>
But mine, and every god's peculiar grace<br/>
Hector deserves, of all the Trojan race:<br/>
Still on our shrines his grateful offerings lay,<br/>
(The only honours men to gods can pay,)<br/>
Nor ever from our smoking altar ceased<br/>
The pure libation, and the holy feast:<br/>
Howe'er by stealth to snatch the corse away,<br/>
We will not: Thetis guards it night and day.<br/>
But haste, and summon to our courts above<br/>
The azure queen; let her persuasion move<br/>
Her furious son from Priam to receive<br/>
The proffer'd ransom, and the corse to leave."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He added not: and Iris from the skies,<br/>
Swift as a whirlwind, on the message flies,<br/>
Meteorous the face of ocean sweeps,<br/>
Refulgent gliding o'er the sable deeps.<br/>
Between where Samos wide his forests spreads,<br/>
And rocky Imbrus lifts its pointed heads,<br/>
Down plunged the maid; (the parted waves resound;)<br/>
She plunged and instant shot the dark profound.<br/>
As bearing death in the fallacious bait,<br/>
From the bent angle sinks the leaden weight;<br/>
So pass'd the goddess through the closing wave,<br/>
Where Thetis sorrow'd in her secret cave:<br/>
There placed amidst her melancholy train<br/>
(The blue-hair'd sisters of the sacred main)<br/>
Pensive she sat, revolving fates to come,<br/>
And wept her godlike son's approaching doom.<br/>
Then thus the goddess of the painted bow:<br/>
"Arise, O Thetis! from thy seats below,<br/>
'Tis Jove that calls."&mdash;"And why (the dame replies)<br/>
Calls Jove his Thetis to the hated skies?<br/>
Sad object as I am for heavenly sight!<br/>
Ah may my sorrows ever shun the light!<br/>
Howe'er, be heaven's almighty sire obey'd&mdash;"<br/>
She spake, and veil'd her head in sable shade,<br/>
Which, flowing long, her graceful person clad;<br/>
And forth she paced, majestically sad.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then through the world of waters they repair<br/>
(The way fair Iris led) to upper air.<br/>
The deeps dividing, o'er the coast they rise,<br/>
And touch with momentary flight the skies.<br/>
There in the lightning's blaze the sire they found,<br/>
And all the gods in shining synod round.<br/>
Thetis approach'd with anguish in her face,<br/>
(Minerva rising, gave the mourner place,)<br/>
Even Juno sought her sorrows to console,<br/>
And offer'd from her hand the nectar-bowl:<br/>
She tasted, and resign'd it: then began<br/>
The sacred sire of gods and mortal man:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thou comest, fair Thetis, but with grief o'ercast;<br/>
Maternal sorrows; long, ah, long to last!<br/>
Suffice, we know and we partake thy cares;<br/>
But yield to fate, and hear what Jove declares.<br/>
Nine days are past since all the court above<br/>
In Hector's cause have moved the ear of Jove;<br/>
'Twas voted, Hermes from his godlike foe<br/>
By stealth should bear him, but we will'd not so:<br/>
We will, thy son himself the corse restore,<br/>
And to his conquest add this glory more.<br/>
Then hie thee to him, and our mandate bear:<br/>
Tell him he tempts the wrath of heaven too far;<br/>
Nor let him more (our anger if he dread)<br/>
Vent his mad vengeance on the sacred dead;<br/>
But yield to ransom and the father's prayer;<br/>
The mournful father, Iris shall prepare<br/>
With gifts to sue; and offer to his hands<br/>
Whate'er his honour asks, or heart demands."<br/>
</p>
<p>
His word the silver-footed queen attends,<br/>
And from Olympus' snowy tops descends.<br/>
Arrived, she heard the voice of loud lament,<br/>
And echoing groans that shook the lofty tent:<br/>
His friends prepare the victim, and dispose<br/>
Repast unheeded, while he vents his woes;<br/>
The goddess seats her by her pensive son,<br/>
She press'd his hand, and tender thus begun:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"How long, unhappy! shall thy sorrows flow,<br/>
And thy heart waste with life-consuming woe:<br/>
Mindless of food, or love, whose pleasing reign<br/>
Soothes weary life, and softens human pain?<br/>
O snatch the moments yet within thy power;<br/>
Not long to live, indulge the amorous hour!<br/>
Lo! Jove himself (for Jove's command I bear)<br/>
Forbids to tempt the wrath of heaven too far.<br/>
No longer then (his fury if thou dread)<br/>
Detain the relics of great Hector dead;<br/>
Nor vent on senseless earth thy vengeance vain,<br/>
But yield to ransom, and restore the slain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom Achilles: "Be the ransom given,<br/>
And we submit, since such the will of heaven."<br/>
</p>
<p>
While thus they communed, from the Olympian bowers<br/>
Jove orders Iris to the Trojan towers:<br/>
"Haste, winged goddess! to the sacred town,<br/>
And urge her monarch to redeem his son.<br/>
Alone the Ilian ramparts let him leave,<br/>
And bear what stern Achilles may receive:<br/>
Alone, for so we will; no Trojan near<br/>
Except, to place the dead with decent care,<br/>
Some aged herald, who with gentle hand<br/>
May the slow mules and funeral car command.<br/>
Nor let him death, nor let him danger dread,<br/>
Safe through the foe by our protection led:<br/>
Him Hermes to Achilles shall convey,<br/>
Guard of his life, and partner of his way.<br/>
Fierce as he is, Achilles' self shall spare<br/>
His age, nor touch one venerable hair:<br/>
Some thought there must be in a soul so brave,<br/>
Some sense of duty, some desire to save."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then down her bow the winged Iris drives,<br/>
And swift at Priam's mournful court arrives:<br/>
Where the sad sons beside their father's throne<br/>
Sat bathed in tears, and answer'd groan with groan.<br/>
And all amidst them lay the hoary sire,<br/>
(Sad scene of woe!) his face his wrapp'd attire<br/>
Conceal'd from sight; with frantic hands he spread<br/>
A shower of ashes o'er his neck and head.<br/>
From room to room his pensive daughters roam;<br/>
Whose shrieks and clamours fill the vaulted dome;<br/>
Mindful of those, who late their pride and joy,<br/>
Lie pale and breathless round the fields of Troy!<br/>
Before the king Jove's messenger appears,<br/>
And thus in whispers greets his trembling ears:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Fear not, O father! no ill news I bear;<br/>
From Jove I come, Jove makes thee still his care;<br/>
For Hector's sake these walls he bids thee leave,<br/>
And bear what stern Achilles may receive;<br/>
Alone, for so he wills; no Trojan near,<br/>
Except, to place the dead with decent care,<br/>
Some aged herald, who with gentle hand<br/>
May the slow mules and funeral car command.<br/>
Nor shalt thou death, nor shalt thou danger dread:<br/>
Safe through the foe by his protection led:<br/>
Thee Hermes to Pelides shall convey,<br/>
Guard of thy life, and partner of thy way.<br/>
Fierce as he is, Achilles' self shall spare<br/>
Thy age, nor touch one venerable hair;<br/>
Some thought there must be in a soul so brave,<br/>
Some sense of duty, some desire to save."<br/>
</p>
<p>
She spoke, and vanish'd. Priam bids prepare<br/>
His gentle mules and harness to the car;<br/>
There, for the gifts, a polish'd casket lay:<br/>
His pious sons the king's command obey.<br/>
Then pass'd the monarch to his bridal-room,<br/>
Where cedar-beams the lofty roofs perfume,<br/>
And where the treasures of his empire lay;<br/>
Then call'd his queen, and thus began to say:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Unhappy consort of a king distress'd!<br/>
Partake the troubles of thy husband's breast:<br/>
I saw descend the messenger of Jove,<br/>
Who bids me try Achilles' mind to move;<br/>
Forsake these ramparts, and with gifts obtain<br/>
The corse of Hector, at yon navy slain.<br/>
Tell me thy thought: my heart impels to go<br/>
Through hostile camps, and bears me to the foe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The hoary monarch thus. Her piercing cries<br/>
Sad Hecuba renews, and then replies:<br/>
"Ah! whither wanders thy distemper'd mind?<br/>
And where the prudence now that awed mankind?<br/>
Through Phrygia once and foreign regions known;<br/>
Now all confused, distracted, overthrown!<br/>
Singly to pass through hosts of foes! to face<br/>
(O heart of steel!) the murderer of thy race!<br/>
To view that deathful eye, and wander o'er<br/>
Those hands yet red with Hector's noble gore!<br/>
Alas! my lord! he knows not how to spare,<br/>
And what his mercy, thy slain sons declare;<br/>
So brave! so many fallen! To claim his rage<br/>
Vain were thy dignity, and vain thy age.<br/>
No&mdash;pent in this sad palace, let us give<br/>
To grief the wretched days we have to live.<br/>
Still, still for Hector let our sorrows flow,<br/>
Born to his own, and to his parents' woe!<br/>
Doom'd from the hour his luckless life begun,<br/>
To dogs, to vultures, and to Peleus' son!<br/>
Oh! in his dearest blood might I allay<br/>
My rage, and these barbarities repay!<br/>
For ah! could Hector merit thus, whose breath<br/>
Expired not meanly, in unactive death?<br/>
He poured his latest blood in manly fight,<br/>
And fell a hero in his country's right."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Seek not to stay me, nor my soul affright<br/>
With words of omen, like a bird of night,<br/>
(Replied unmoved the venerable man;)<br/>
'Tis heaven commands me, and you urge in vain.<br/>
Had any mortal voice the injunction laid,<br/>
Nor augur, priest, nor seer, had been obey'd.<br/>
A present goddess brought the high command,<br/>
I saw, I heard her, and the word shall stand.<br/>
I go, ye gods! obedient to your call:<br/>
If in yon camp your powers have doom'd my fall,<br/>
Content&mdash;By the same hand let me expire!<br/>
Add to the slaughter'd son the wretched sire!<br/>
One cold embrace at least may be allow'd,<br/>
And my last tears flow mingled with his blood!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
From forth his open'd stores, this said, he drew<br/>
Twelve costly carpets of refulgent hue,<br/>
As many vests, as many mantles told,<br/>
And twelve fair veils, and garments stiff with gold,<br/>
Two tripods next, and twice two chargers shine,<br/>
With ten pure talents from the richest mine;<br/>
And last a large well-labour'd bowl had place,<br/>
(The pledge of treaties once with friendly Thrace:)<br/>
Seem'd all too mean the stores he could employ,<br/>
For one last look to buy him back to Troy!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Lo! the sad father, frantic with his pain,<br/>
Around him furious drives his menial train:<br/>
In vain each slave with duteous care attends,<br/>
Each office hurts him, and each face offends.<br/>
"What make ye here, officious crowds! (he cries):<br/>
Hence! nor obtrude your anguish on my eyes.<br/>
Have ye no griefs at home, to fix ye there:<br/>
Am I the only object of despair?<br/>
Am I become my people's common show,<br/>
Set up by Jove your spectacle of woe?<br/>
No, you must feel him too; yourselves must fall;<br/>
The same stern god to ruin gives you all:<br/>
Nor is great Hector lost by me alone;<br/>
Your sole defence, your guardian power is gone!<br/>
I see your blood the fields of Phrygia drown,<br/>
I see the ruins of your smoking town!<br/>
O send me, gods! ere that sad day shall come,<br/>
A willing ghost to Pluto's dreary dome!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and feebly drives his friends away:<br/>
The sorrowing friends his frantic rage obey.<br/>
Next on his sons his erring fury falls,<br/>
Polites, Paris, Agathon, he calls;<br/>
His threats Deiphobus and Dius hear,<br/>
Hippothous, Pammon, Helenes the seer,<br/>
And generous Antiphon: for yet these nine<br/>
Survived, sad relics of his numerous line.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Inglorious sons of an unhappy sire!<br/>
Why did not all in Hector's cause expire?<br/>
Wretch that I am! my bravest offspring slain.<br/>
You, the disgrace of Priam's house, remain!<br/>
Mestor the brave, renown'd in ranks of war,<br/>
With Troilus, dreadful on his rushing car,<br/>
And last great Hector, more than man divine,<br/>
For sure he seem'd not of terrestrial line!<br/>
All those relentless Mars untimely slew,<br/>
And left me these, a soft and servile crew,<br/>
Whose days the feast and wanton dance employ,<br/>
Gluttons and flatterers, the contempt of Troy!<br/>
Why teach ye not my rapid wheels to run,<br/>
And speed my journey to redeem my son?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The sons their father's wretched age revere,<br/>
Forgive his anger, and produce the car.<br/>
High on the seat the cabinet they bind:<br/>
The new-made car with solid beauty shined;<br/>
Box was the yoke, emboss'd with costly pains,<br/>
And hung with ringlets to receive the reins;<br/>
Nine cubits long, the traces swept the ground:<br/>
These to the chariot's polish'd pole they bound.<br/>
Then fix'd a ring the running reins to guide,<br/>
And close beneath the gather'd ends were tied.<br/>
Next with the gifts (the price of Hector slain)<br/>
The sad attendants load the groaning wain:<br/>
Last to the yoke the well-matched mules they bring,<br/>
(The gift of Mysia to the Trojan king.)<br/>
But the fair horses, long his darling care,<br/>
Himself received, and harness'd to his car:<br/>
Grieved as he was, he not this task denied;<br/>
The hoary herald help'd him, at his side.<br/>
While careful these the gentle coursers join'd,<br/>
Sad Hecuba approach'd with anxious mind;<br/>
A golden bowl that foam'd with fragrant wine,<br/>
(Libation destined to the power divine,)<br/>
Held in her right, before the steed she stands,<br/>
And thus consigns it to the monarch's hands:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Take this, and pour to Jove; that safe from harms<br/>
His grace restore thee to our roof and arms.<br/>
Since victor of thy fears, and slighting mine,<br/>
Heaven, or thy soul, inspires this bold design;<br/>
Pray to that god, who high on Ida's brow<br/>
Surveys thy desolated realms below,<br/>
His winged messenger to send from high,<br/>
And lead thy way with heavenly augury:<br/>
Let the strong sovereign of the plumy race<br/>
Tower on the right of yon ethereal space.<br/>
That sign beheld, and strengthen'd from above,<br/>
Boldly pursue the journey mark'd by Jove:<br/>
But if the god his augury denies,<br/>
Suppress thy impulse, nor reject advice."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"'Tis just (said Priam) to the sire above<br/>
To raise our hands; for who so good as Jove?"<br/>
He spoke, and bade the attendant handmaid bring<br/>
The purest water of the living spring:<br/>
(Her ready hands the ewer and bason held:)<br/>
Then took the golden cup his queen had fill'd;<br/>
On the mid pavement pours the rosy wine,<br/>
Uplifts his eyes, and calls the power divine:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O first and greatest! heaven's imperial lord!<br/>
On lofty Ida's holy hill adored!<br/>
To stern Achilles now direct my ways,<br/>
And teach him mercy when a father prays.<br/>
If such thy will, despatch from yonder sky<br/>
Thy sacred bird, celestial augury!<br/>
Let the strong sovereign of the plumy race<br/>
Tower on the right of yon ethereal space;<br/>
So shall thy suppliant, strengthen'd from above,<br/>
Fearless pursue the journey mark'd by Jove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Jove heard his prayer, and from the throne on high,<br/>
Despatch'd his bird, celestial augury!<br/>
The swift-wing'd chaser of the feather'd game,<br/>
And known to gods by Percnos' lofty name.<br/>
Wide as appears some palace-gate display'd,<br/>
So broad, his pinions stretch'd their ample shade,<br/>
As stooping dexter with resounding wings<br/>
The imperial bird descends in airy rings.<br/>
A dawn of joy in every face appears:<br/>
The mourning matron dries her timorous tears:<br/>
Swift on his car the impatient monarch sprung;<br/>
The brazen portal in his passage rung;<br/>
The mules preceding draw the loaded wain,<br/>
Charged with the gifts: Idaeus holds the rein:<br/>
The king himself his gentle steeds controls,<br/>
And through surrounding friends the chariot rolls.<br/>
On his slow wheels the following people wait,<br/>
Mourn at each step, and give him up to fate;<br/>
With hands uplifted eye him as he pass'd,<br/>
And gaze upon him as they gazed their last.<br/>
Now forward fares the father on his way,<br/>
Through the lone fields, and back to Ilion they.<br/>
Great Jove beheld him as he cross'd the plain,<br/>
And felt the woes of miserable man.<br/>
Then thus to Hermes: "Thou whose constant cares<br/>
Still succour mortals, and attend their prayers;<br/>
Behold an object to thy charge consign'd:<br/>
If ever pity touch'd thee for mankind,<br/>
Go, guard the sire: the observing foe prevent,<br/>
And safe conduct him to Achilles' tent."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The god obeys, his golden pinions binds,<br/>
And mounts incumbent on the wings of winds,<br/>
That high, through fields of air, his flight sustain,<br/>
O'er the wide earth, and o'er the boundless main;<br/>
Then grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,<br/>
Or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye:<br/>
Thus arm'd, swift Hermes steers his airy way,<br/>
And stoops on Hellespont's resounding sea.<br/>
A beauteous youth, majestic and divine,<br/>
He seem'd; fair offspring of some princely line!<br/>
Now twilight veil'd the glaring face of day,<br/>
And clad the dusky fields in sober grey;<br/>
What time the herald and the hoary king<br/>
(Their chariots stopping at the silver spring,<br/>
That circling Ilus' ancient marble flows)<br/>
Allow'd their mules and steeds a short repose,<br/>
Through the dim shade the herald first espies<br/>
A man's approach, and thus to Priam cries:<br/>
"I mark some foe's advance: O king! beware;<br/>
This hard adventure claims thy utmost care!<br/>
For much I fear destruction hovers nigh:<br/>
Our state asks counsel; is it best to fly?<br/>
Or old and helpless, at his feet to fall,<br/>
Two wretched suppliants, and for mercy call?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The afflicted monarch shiver'd with despair;<br/>
Pale grew his face, and upright stood his hair;<br/>
Sunk was his heart; his colour went and came;<br/>
A sudden trembling shook his aged frame:<br/>
When Hermes, greeting, touch'd his royal hand,<br/>
And, gentle, thus accosts with kind demand:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Say whither, father! when each mortal sight<br/>
Is seal'd in sleep, thou wanderest through the night?<br/>
Why roam thy mules and steeds the plains along,<br/>
Through Grecian foes, so numerous and so strong?<br/>
What couldst thou hope, should these thy treasures view;<br/>
These, who with endless hate thy race pursue?<br/>
For what defence, alas! could'st thou provide;<br/>
Thyself not young, a weak old man thy guide?<br/>
Yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread;<br/>
From me no harm shall touch thy reverend head;<br/>
From Greece I'll guard thee too; for in those lines<br/>
The living image of my father shines."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thy words, that speak benevolence of mind,<br/>
Are true, my son! (the godlike sire rejoin'd:)<br/>
Great are my hazards; but the gods survey<br/>
My steps, and send thee, guardian of my way.<br/>
Hail, and be bless'd! For scarce of mortal kind<br/>
Appear thy form, thy feature, and thy mind."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Nor true are all thy words, nor erring wide;<br/>
(The sacred messenger of heaven replied;)<br/>
But say, convey'st thou through the lonely plains<br/>
What yet most precious of thy store remains,<br/>
To lodge in safety with some friendly hand:<br/>
Prepared, perchance, to leave thy native land?<br/>
Or fliest thou now?&mdash;What hopes can Troy retain,<br/>
Thy matchless son, her guard and glory, slain?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
The king, alarm'd: "Say what, and whence thou art<br/>
Who search the sorrows of a parent's heart,<br/>
And know so well how godlike Hector died?"<br/>
Thus Priam spoke, and Hermes thus replied:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"You tempt me, father, and with pity touch:<br/>
On this sad subject you inquire too much.<br/>
Oft have these eyes that godlike Hector view'd<br/>
In glorious fight, with Grecian blood embrued:<br/>
I saw him when, like Jove, his flames he toss'd<br/>
On thousand ships, and wither'd half a host:<br/>
I saw, but help'd not: stern Achilles' ire<br/>
Forbade assistance, and enjoy'd the fire.<br/>
For him I serve, of Myrmidonian race;<br/>
One ship convey'd us from our native place;<br/>
Polyctor is my sire, an honour'd name,<br/>
Old like thyself, and not unknown to fame;<br/>
Of seven his sons, by whom the lot was cast<br/>
To serve our prince, it fell on me, the last.<br/>
To watch this quarter, my adventure falls:<br/>
For with the morn the Greeks attack your walls;<br/>
Sleepless they sit, impatient to engage,<br/>
And scarce their rulers check their martial rage."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"If then thou art of stern Pelides' train,<br/>
(The mournful monarch thus rejoin'd again,)<br/>
Ah tell me truly, where, oh! where are laid<br/>
My son's dear relics? what befalls him dead?<br/>
Have dogs dismember'd (on the naked plains),<br/>
Or yet unmangled rest, his cold remains?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O favour'd of the skies! (thus answered then<br/>
The power that mediates between god and men)<br/>
Nor dogs nor vultures have thy Hector rent,<br/>
But whole he lies, neglected in the tent:<br/>
This the twelfth evening since he rested there,<br/>
Untouch'd by worms, untainted by the air.<br/>
Still as Aurora's ruddy beam is spread,<br/>
Round his friend's tomb Achilles drags the dead:<br/>
Yet undisfigured, or in limb or face,<br/>
All fresh he lies, with every living grace,<br/>
Majestical in death! No stains are found<br/>
O'er all the corse, and closed is every wound,<br/>
Though many a wound they gave. Some heavenly care,<br/>
Some hand divine, preserves him ever fair:<br/>
Or all the host of heaven, to whom he led<br/>
A life so grateful, still regard him dead."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus spoke to Priam the celestial guide,<br/>
And joyful thus the royal sire replied:<br/>
"Blest is the man who pays the gods above<br/>
The constant tribute of respect and love!<br/>
Those who inhabit the Olympian bower<br/>
My son forgot not, in exalted power;<br/>
And heaven, that every virtue bears in mind,<br/>
Even to the ashes of the just is kind.<br/>
But thou, O generous youth! this goblet take,<br/>
A pledge of gratitude for Hector's sake;<br/>
And while the favouring gods our steps survey,<br/>
Safe to Pelides' tent conduct my way."<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the latent god: "O king, forbear<br/>
To tempt my youth, for apt is youth to err.<br/>
But can I, absent from my prince's sight,<br/>
Take gifts in secret, that must shun the light?<br/>
What from our master's interest thus we draw,<br/>
Is but a licensed theft that 'scapes the law.<br/>
Respecting him, my soul abjures the offence;<br/>
And as the crime, I dread the consequence.<br/>
Thee, far as Argos, pleased I could convey;<br/>
Guard of thy life, and partner of thy way:<br/>
On thee attend, thy safety to maintain,<br/>
O'er pathless forests, or the roaring main."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, then took the chariot at a bound,<br/>
And snatch'd the reins, and whirl'd the lash around:<br/>
Before the inspiring god that urged them on,<br/>
The coursers fly with spirit not their own.<br/>
And now they reach'd the naval walls, and found<br/>
The guards repasting, while the bowls go round;<br/>
On these the virtue of his wand he tries,<br/>
And pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes:<br/>
Then heaved the massy gates, removed the bars,<br/>
And o'er the trenches led the rolling cars.<br/>
Unseen, through all the hostile camp they went,<br/>
And now approach'd Pelides' lofty tent.<br/>
On firs the roof was raised, and cover'd o'er<br/>
With reeds collected from the marshy shore;<br/>
And, fenced with palisades, a hall of state,<br/>
(The work of soldiers,) where the hero sat:<br/>
Large was the door, whose well-compacted strength<br/>
A solid pine-tree barr'd of wondrous length:<br/>
Scarce three strong Greeks could lift its mighty weight,<br/>
But great Achilles singly closed the gate.<br/>
This Hermes (such the power of gods) set wide;<br/>
Then swift alighted the celestial guide,<br/>
And thus reveal'd&mdash;"Hear, prince! and understand<br/>
Thou ow'st thy guidance to no mortal hand:<br/>
Hermes I am, descended from above,<br/>
The king of arts, the messenger of Jove,<br/>
Farewell: to shun Achilles' sight I fly;<br/>
Uncommon are such favours of the sky,<br/>
Nor stand confess'd to frail mortality.<br/>
Now fearless enter, and prefer thy prayers;<br/>
Adjure him by his father's silver hairs,<br/>
His son, his mother! urge him to bestow<br/>
Whatever pity that stern heart can know."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, he vanish'd from his eyes,<br/>
And in a moment shot into the skies:<br/>
The king, confirm'd from heaven, alighted there,<br/>
And left his aged herald on the car,<br/>
With solemn pace through various rooms he went,<br/>
And found Achilles in his inner tent:<br/>
There sat the hero: Alcimus the brave,<br/>
And great Automedon, attendance gave:<br/>
These served his person at the royal feast;<br/>
Around, at awful distance, stood the rest.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Unseen by these, the king his entry made:<br/>
And, prostrate now before Achilles laid,<br/>
Sudden (a venerable sight!) appears;<br/>
Embraced his knees, and bathed his hands in tears;<br/>
Those direful hands his kisses press'd, embrued<br/>
Even with the best, the dearest of his blood!<br/>
</p>
<p>
As when a wretch (who, conscious of his crime,<br/>
Pursued for murder, flies his native clime)<br/>
Just gains some frontier, breathless, pale, amazed,<br/>
All gaze, all wonder: thus Achilles gazed:<br/>
Thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise:<br/>
All mute, yet seem'd to question with their eyes:<br/>
Each look'd on other, none the silence broke,<br/>
Till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ah think, thou favour'd of the powers divine!<br/>
Think of thy father's age, and pity mine!<br/>
In me that father's reverend image trace,<br/>
Those silver hairs, that venerable face;<br/>
His trembling limbs, his helpless person, see!<br/>
In all my equal, but in misery!<br/>
Yet now, perhaps, some turn of human fate<br/>
Expels him helpless from his peaceful state;<br/>
Think, from some powerful foe thou seest him fly,<br/>
And beg protection with a feeble cry.<br/>
Yet still one comfort in his soul may rise;<br/>
He hears his son still lives to glad his eyes,<br/>
And, hearing, still may hope a better day<br/>
May send him thee, to chase that foe away.<br/>
No comfort to my griefs, no hopes remain,<br/>
The best, the bravest, of my sons are slain!<br/>
Yet what a race! ere Greece to Ilion came,<br/>
The pledge of many a loved and loving dame:<br/>
Nineteen one mother bore&mdash;Dead, all are dead!<br/>
How oft, alas! has wretched Priam bled!<br/>
Still one was left their loss to recompense;<br/>
His father's hope, his country's last defence.<br/>
Him too thy rage has slain! beneath thy steel,<br/>
Unhappy in his country's cause he fell!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"For him through hostile camps I bent my way,<br/>
For him thus prostrate at thy feet I lay;<br/>
Large gifts proportion'd to thy wrath I bear;<br/>
O hear the wretched, and the gods revere!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Think of thy father, and this face behold!<br/>
See him in me, as helpless and as old!<br/>
Though not so wretched: there he yields to me,<br/>
The first of men in sovereign misery!<br/>
Thus forced to kneel, thus grovelling to embrace<br/>
The scourge and ruin of my realm and race;<br/>
Suppliant my children's murderer to implore,<br/>
And kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
These words soft pity in the chief inspire,<br/>
Touch'd with the dear remembrance of his sire.<br/>
Then with his hand (as prostrate still he lay)<br/>
The old man's cheek he gently turn'd away.<br/>
Now each by turns indulged the gush of woe;<br/>
And now the mingled tides together flow:<br/>
This low on earth, that gently bending o'er;<br/>
A father one, and one a son deplore:<br/>
But great Achilles different passions rend,<br/>
And now his sire he mourns, and now his friend.<br/>
The infectious softness through the heroes ran;<br/>
One universal solemn shower began;<br/>
They bore as heroes, but they felt as man.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Satiate at length with unavailing woes,<br/>
From the high throne divine Achilles rose;<br/>
The reverend monarch by the hand he raised;<br/>
On his white beard and form majestic gazed,<br/>
Not unrelenting; then serene began<br/>
With words to soothe the miserable man:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Alas, what weight of anguish hast thou known,<br/>
Unhappy prince! thus guardless and alone<br/>
To pass through foes, and thus undaunted face<br/>
The man whose fury has destroy'd thy race!<br/>
Heaven sure has arm'd thee with a heart of steel,<br/>
A strength proportion'd to the woes you feel.<br/>
Rise, then: let reason mitigate your care:<br/>
To mourn avails not: man is born to bear.<br/>
Such is, alas! the gods' severe decree:<br/>
They, only they are blest, and only free.<br/>
Two urns by Jove's high throne have ever stood,<br/>
The source of evil one, and one of good;<br/>
From thence the cup of mortal man he fills,<br/>
Blessings to these, to those distributes ill;<br/>
To most he mingles both: the wretch decreed<br/>
To taste the bad unmix'd, is cursed indeed;<br/>
Pursued by wrongs, by meagre famine driven,<br/>
He wanders, outcast both of earth and heaven.<br/>
The happiest taste not happiness sincere;<br/>
But find the cordial draught is dash'd with care.<br/>
Who more than Peleus shone in wealth and power<br/>
What stars concurring bless'd his natal hour!<br/>
A realm, a goddess, to his wishes given;<br/>
Graced by the gods with all the gifts of heaven.<br/>
One evil yet o'ertakes his latest day:<br/>
No race succeeding to imperial sway;<br/>
An only son; and he, alas! ordain'd<br/>
To fall untimely in a foreign land.<br/>
See him, in Troy, the pious care decline<br/>
Of his weak age, to live the curse of thine!<br/>
Thou too, old man, hast happier days beheld;<br/>
In riches once, in children once excell'd;<br/>
Extended Phrygia own'd thy ample reign,<br/>
And all fair Lesbos' blissful seats contain,<br/>
And all wide Hellespont's unmeasured main.<br/>
But since the god his hand has pleased to turn,<br/>
And fill thy measure from his bitter urn,<br/>
What sees the sun, but hapless heroes' falls?<br/>
War, and the blood of men, surround thy walls!<br/>
What must be, must be. Bear thy lot, nor shed<br/>
These unavailing sorrows o'er the dead;<br/>
Thou canst not call him from the Stygian shore,<br/>
But thou, alas! may'st live to suffer more!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
To whom the king: "O favour'd of the skies!<br/>
Here let me grow to earth! since Hector lies<br/>
On the bare beach deprived of obsequies.<br/>
O give me Hector! to my eyes restore<br/>
His corse, and take the gifts: I ask no more.<br/>
Thou, as thou may'st, these boundless stores enjoy;<br/>
Safe may'st thou sail, and turn thy wrath from Troy;<br/>
So shall thy pity and forbearance give<br/>
A weak old man to see the light and live!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Move me no more, (Achilles thus replies,<br/>
While kindling anger sparkled in his eyes,)<br/>
Nor seek by tears my steady soul to bend:<br/>
To yield thy Hector I myself intend:<br/>
For know, from Jove my goddess-mother came,<br/>
(Old Ocean's daughter, silver-footed dame,)<br/>
Nor comest thou but by heaven; nor comest alone,<br/>
Some god impels with courage not thy own:<br/>
No human hand the weighty gates unbarr'd,<br/>
Nor could the boldest of our youth have dared<br/>
To pass our outworks, or elude the guard.<br/>
Cease; lest, neglectful of high Jove's command,<br/>
I show thee, king! thou tread'st on hostile land;<br/>
Release my knees, thy suppliant arts give o'er,<br/>
And shake the purpose of my soul no more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The sire obey'd him, trembling and o'eraw'd.<br/>
Achilles, like a lion, rush'd abroad:<br/>
Automedon and Alcimus attend,<br/>
(Whom most he honour'd, since he lost his friend,)<br/>
These to unyoke the mules and horses went,<br/>
And led the hoary herald to the tent;<br/>
Next, heap'd on high, the numerous presents bear,<br/>
(Great Hector's ransom,) from the polish'd car.<br/>
Two splendid mantles, and a carpet spread,<br/>
They leave: to cover and enwrap the dead.<br/>
Then call the handmaids, with assistant toil<br/>
To wash the body and anoint with oil,<br/>
Apart from Priam: lest the unhappy sire,<br/>
Provoked to passion, once more rouse to ire<br/>
The stern Pelides; and nor sacred age,<br/>
Nor Jove's command, should check the rising rage.<br/>
This done, the garments o'er the corse they spread;<br/>
Achilles lifts it to the funeral bed:<br/>
Then, while the body on the car they laid,<br/>
He groans, and calls on loved Patroclus' shade:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"If, in that gloom which never light must know,<br/>
The deeds of mortals touch the ghosts below,<br/>
O friend! forgive me, that I thus fulfil<br/>
(Restoring Hector) heaven's unquestion'd will.<br/>
The gifts the father gave, be ever thine,<br/>
To grace thy manes, and adorn thy shrine."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and, entering, took his seat of state;<br/>
Where full before him reverend Priam sate;<br/>
To whom, composed, the godlike chief begun:<br/>
"Lo! to thy prayer restored, thy breathless son;<br/>
Extended on the funeral couch he lies;<br/>
And soon as morning paints the eastern skies,<br/>
The sight is granted to thy longing eyes:<br/>
But now the peaceful hours of sacred night<br/>
Demand reflection, and to rest invite:<br/>
Nor thou, O father! thus consumed with woe,<br/>
The common cares that nourish life forego.<br/>
Not thus did Niobe, of form divine,<br/>
A parent once, whose sorrows equall'd thine:<br/>
Six youthful sons, as many blooming maids,<br/>
In one sad day beheld the Stygian shades;<br/>
Those by Apollo's silver bow were slain,<br/>
These, Cynthia's arrows stretch'd upon the plain:<br/>
So was her pride chastised by wrath divine,<br/>
Who match'd her own with bright Latona's line;<br/>
But two the goddess, twelve the queen enjoy'd;<br/>
Those boasted twelve, the avenging two destroy'd.<br/>
Steep'd in their blood, and in the dust outspread,<br/>
Nine days, neglected, lay exposed the dead;<br/>
None by to weep them, to inhume them none;<br/>
(For Jove had turn'd the nation all to stone.)<br/>
The gods themselves, at length relenting gave<br/>
The unhappy race the honours of a grave.<br/>
Herself a rock (for such was heaven's high will)<br/>
Through deserts wild now pours a weeping rill;<br/>
Where round the bed whence Achelous springs,<br/>
The watery fairies dance in mazy rings;<br/>
There high on Sipylus's shaggy brow,<br/>
She stands, her own sad monument of woe;<br/>
The rock for ever lasts, the tears for ever flow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Such griefs, O king! have other parents known;<br/>
Remember theirs, and mitigate thy own.<br/>
The care of heaven thy Hector has appear'd,<br/>
Nor shall he lie unwept, and uninterr'd;<br/>
Soon may thy aged cheeks in tears be drown'd,<br/>
And all the eyes of Ilion stream around."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He said, and, rising, chose the victim ewe<br/>
With silver fleece, which his attendants slew.<br/>
The limbs they sever from the reeking hide,<br/>
With skill prepare them, and in parts divide:<br/>
Each on the coals the separate morsels lays,<br/>
And, hasty, snatches from the rising blaze.<br/>
With bread the glittering canisters they load,<br/>
Which round the board Automedon bestow'd.<br/>
The chief himself to each his portion placed,<br/>
And each indulging shared in sweet repast.<br/>
When now the rage of hunger was repress'd,<br/>
The wondering hero eyes his royal guest:<br/>
No less the royal guest the hero eyes,<br/>
His godlike aspect and majestic size;<br/>
Here, youthful grace and noble fire engage;<br/>
And there, the mild benevolence of age.<br/>
Thus gazing long, the silence neither broke,<br/>
(A solemn scene!) at length the father spoke:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Permit me now, beloved of Jove! to steep<br/>
My careful temples in the dew of sleep:<br/>
For, since the day that number'd with the dead<br/>
My hapless son, the dust has been my bed;<br/>
Soft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes;<br/>
My only food, my sorrows and my sighs!<br/>
Till now, encouraged by the grace you give,<br/>
I share thy banquet, and consent to live."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With that, Achilles bade prepare the bed,<br/>
With purple soft and shaggy carpets spread;<br/>
Forth, by the flaming lights, they bend their way,<br/>
And place the couches, and the coverings lay.<br/>
Then he: "Now, father, sleep, but sleep not here;<br/>
Consult thy safety, and forgive my fear,<br/>
Lest any Argive, at this hour awake,<br/>
To ask our counsel, or our orders take,<br/>
Approaching sudden to our open'd tent,<br/>
Perchance behold thee, and our grace prevent.<br/>
Should such report thy honour'd person here,<br/>
The king of men the ransom might defer;<br/>
But say with speed, if aught of thy desire<br/>
Remains unask'd; what time the rites require<br/>
To inter thy Hector? For, so long we stay<br/>
Our slaughtering arm, and bid the hosts obey."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"If then thy will permit (the monarch said)<br/>
To finish all due honours to the dead,<br/>
This of thy grace accord: to thee are known<br/>
The fears of Ilion, closed within her town;<br/>
And at what distance from our walls aspire<br/>
The hills of Ide, and forests for the fire.<br/>
Nine days to vent our sorrows I request,<br/>
The tenth shall see the funeral and the feast;<br/>
The next, to raise his monument be given;<br/>
The twelfth we war, if war be doom'd by heaven!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"This thy request (replied the chief) enjoy:<br/>
Till then our arms suspend the fall of Troy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then gave his hand at parting, to prevent<br/>
The old man's fears, and turn'd within the tent;<br/>
Where fair Briseis, bright in blooming charms,<br/>
Expects her hero with desiring arms.<br/>
But in the porch the king and herald rest;<br/>
Sad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast.<br/>
Now gods and men the gifts of sleep partake;<br/>
Industrious Hermes only was awake,<br/>
The king's return revolving in his mind,<br/>
To pass the ramparts, and the watch to blind.<br/>
The power descending hover'd o'er his head:<br/>
"And sleep'st thou, father! (thus the vision said:)<br/>
Now dost thou sleep, when Hector is restored?<br/>
Nor fear the Grecian foes, or Grecian lord?<br/>
Thy presence here should stern Atrides see,<br/>
Thy still surviving sons may sue for thee;<br/>
May offer all thy treasures yet contain,<br/>
To spare thy age; and offer all in vain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Waked with the word the trembling sire arose,<br/>
And raised his friend: the god before him goes:<br/>
He joins the mules, directs them with his hand,<br/>
And moves in silence through the hostile land.<br/>
When now to Xanthus' yellow stream they drove,<br/>
(Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove,)<br/>
The winged deity forsook their view,<br/>
And in a moment to Olympus flew.<br/>
Now shed Aurora round her saffron ray,<br/>
Sprang through the gates of light, and gave the day:<br/>
Charged with the mournful load, to Ilion go<br/>
The sage and king, majestically slow.<br/>
Cassandra first beholds, from Ilion's spire,<br/>
The sad procession of her hoary sire;<br/>
Then, as the pensive pomp advanced more near,<br/>
(Her breathless brother stretched upon the bier,)<br/>
A shower of tears o'erflows her beauteous eyes,<br/>
Alarming thus all Ilion with her cries:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Turn here your steps, and here your eyes employ,<br/>
Ye wretched daughters, and ye sons of Troy!<br/>
If e'er ye rush'd in crowds, with vast delight,<br/>
To hail your hero glorious from the fight,<br/>
Now meet him dead, and let your sorrows flow;<br/>
Your common triumph, and your common woe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
In thronging crowds they issue to the plains;<br/>
Nor man nor woman in the walls remains;<br/>
In every face the self-same grief is shown;<br/>
And Troy sends forth one universal groan.<br/>
At Scaea's gates they meet the mourning wain,<br/>
Hang on the wheels, and grovel round the slain.<br/>
The wife and mother, frantic with despair,<br/>
Kiss his pale cheek, and rend their scatter'd hair:<br/>
Thus wildly wailing, at the gates they lay;<br/>
And there had sigh'd and sorrow'd out the day;<br/>
But godlike Priam from the chariot rose:<br/>
"Forbear (he cried) this violence of woes;<br/>
First to the palace let the car proceed,<br/>
Then pour your boundless sorrows o'er the dead."<br/>
</p>
<p>
The waves of people at his word divide,<br/>
Slow rolls the chariot through the following tide;<br/>
Even to the palace the sad pomp they wait:<br/>
They weep, and place him on the bed of state.<br/>
A melancholy choir attend around,<br/>
With plaintive sighs, and music's solemn sound:<br/>
Alternately they sing, alternate flow<br/>
The obedient tears, melodious in their woe.<br/>
While deeper sorrows groan from each full heart,<br/>
And nature speaks at every pause of art.<br/>
</p>
<p>
First to the corse the weeping consort flew;<br/>
Around his neck her milk-white arms she threw,<br/>
"And oh, my Hector! Oh, my lord! (she cries)<br/>
Snatch'd in thy bloom from these desiring eyes!<br/>
Thou to the dismal realms for ever gone!<br/>
And I abandon'd, desolate, alone!<br/>
An only son, once comfort of our pains,<br/>
Sad product now of hapless love, remains!<br/>
Never to manly age that son shall rise,<br/>
Or with increasing graces glad my eyes:<br/>
For Ilion now (her great defender slain)<br/>
Shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain.<br/>
Who now protects her wives with guardian care?<br/>
Who saves her infants from the rage of war?<br/>
Now hostile fleets must waft those infants o'er<br/>
(Those wives must wait them) to a foreign shore:<br/>
Thou too, my son, to barbarous climes shall go,<br/>
The sad companion of thy mother's woe;<br/>
Driven hence a slave before the victor's sword<br/>
Condemn'd to toil for some inhuman lord:<br/>
Or else some Greek whose father press'd the plain,<br/>
Or son, or brother, by great Hector slain,<br/>
In Hector's blood his vengeance shall enjoy,<br/>
And hurl thee headlong from the towers of Troy.<br/>
For thy stern father never spared a foe:<br/>
Thence all these tears, and all this scene of woe!<br/>
Thence many evils his sad parents bore,<br/>
His parents many, but his consort more.<br/>
Why gav'st thou not to me thy dying hand?<br/>
And why received not I thy last command?<br/>
Some word thou would'st have spoke, which, sadly dear,<br/>
My soul might keep, or utter with a tear;<br/>
Which never, never could be lost in air,<br/>
Fix'd in my heart, and oft repeated there!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus to her weeping maids she makes her moan,<br/>
Her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The mournful mother next sustains her part:<br/>
"O thou, the best, the dearest to my heart!<br/>
Of all my race thou most by heaven approved,<br/>
And by the immortals even in death beloved!<br/>
While all my other sons in barbarous bands<br/>
Achilles bound, and sold to foreign lands,<br/>
This felt no chains, but went a glorious ghost,<br/>
Free, and a hero, to the Stygian coast.<br/>
Sentenced, 'tis true, by his inhuman doom,<br/>
Thy noble corse was dragg'd around the tomb;<br/>
(The tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain;)<br/>
Ungenerous insult, impotent and vain!<br/>
Yet glow'st thou fresh with every living grace;<br/>
No mark of pain, or violence of face:<br/>
Rosy and fair! as Phoebus' silver bow<br/>
Dismiss'd thee gently to the shades below."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus spoke the dame, and melted into tears.<br/>
Sad Helen next in pomp of grief appears;<br/>
Fast from the shining sluices of her eyes<br/>
Fall the round crystal drops, while thus she cries.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ah, dearest friend! in whom the gods had join'd<br/>
The mildest manners with the bravest mind,<br/>
Now twice ten years (unhappy years) are o'er<br/>
Since Paris brought me to the Trojan shore,<br/>
(O had I perish'd, ere that form divine<br/>
Seduced this soft, this easy heart of mine!)<br/>
Yet was it ne'er my fate, from thee to find<br/>
A deed ungentle, or a word unkind.<br/>
When others cursed the authoress of their woe,<br/>
Thy pity check'd my sorrows in their flow.<br/>
If some proud brother eyed me with disdain,<br/>
Or scornful sister with her sweeping train,<br/>
Thy gentle accents soften'd all my pain.<br/>
For thee I mourn, and mourn myself in thee,<br/>
The wretched source of all this misery.<br/>
The fate I caused, for ever I bemoan;<br/>
Sad Helen has no friend, now thou art gone!<br/>
Through Troy's wide streets abandon'd shall I roam!<br/>
In Troy deserted, as abhorr'd at home!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
So spoke the fair, with sorrow-streaming eye.<br/>
Distressful beauty melts each stander-by.<br/>
On all around the infectious sorrow grows;<br/>
But Priam check'd the torrent as it rose:<br/>
"Perform, ye Trojans! what the rites require,<br/>
And fell the forests for a funeral pyre;<br/>
Twelve days, nor foes nor secret ambush dread;<br/>
Achilles grants these honours to the dead."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and, at his word, the Trojan train<br/>
Their mules and oxen harness to the wain,<br/>
Pour through the gates, and fell'd from Ida's crown,<br/>
Roll back the gather'd forests to the town.<br/>
These toils continue nine succeeding days,<br/>
And high in air a sylvan structure raise.<br/>
But when the tenth fair morn began to shine,<br/>
Forth to the pile was borne the man divine,<br/>
And placed aloft; while all, with streaming eyes,<br/>
Beheld the flames and rolling smokes arise.<br/>
Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn,<br/>
With rosy lustre streak'd the dewy lawn,<br/>
Again the mournful crowds surround the pyre,<br/>
And quench with wine the yet remaining fire.<br/>
The snowy bones his friends and brothers place<br/>
(With tears collected) in a golden vase;<br/>
The golden vase in purple palls they roll'd,<br/>
Of softest texture, and inwrought with gold.<br/>
Last o'er the urn the sacred earth they spread,<br/>
And raised the tomb, memorial of the dead.<br/>
(Strong guards and spies, till all the rites were done,<br/>
Watch'd from the rising to the setting sun.)<br/>
All Troy then moves to Priam's court again,<br/>
A solemn, silent, melancholy train:<br/>
Assembled there, from pious toil they rest,<br/>
And sadly shared the last sepulchral feast.<br/>
Such honours Ilion to her hero paid,<br/>
And peaceful slept the mighty Hector's shade.<br/>
</p>

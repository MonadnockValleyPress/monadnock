<h1>The Odyssey</h1>
<h3>Book IX</h3>
<h3>translated by Alexander Pope</h3>
<p>
Then thus Ulysses: "Thou whom first in sway,<br/>
As first in virtue, these thy realms obey;<br/>
How sweet the products of a peaceful reign!<br/>
The heaven-taught poet and enchanting strain;<br/>
The well-filled palace, the perpetual feast,<br/>
A land rejoicing, and a people bless'd!<br/>
How goodly seems it ever to employ<br/>
Man's social days in union and in joy;<br/>
The plenteous hoard high-heap'd with cates divine,<br/>
And o'er the foaming bowl the laughing wine!
</p>
<p>
"Amid these joys, why seeks thy mind to know<br/>
The unhappy series of a wanderer's woe?<br/>
Rememberance sad, whose image to review,<br/>
Alas, I must open all my wounds anew!<br/>
And oh, what first, what last shall I relate,<br/>
Of woes unnumbered sent by Heaven and Fate?
</p>
<p>
"Know first the man (though now a wretch distress'd)<br/>
Who hopes thee, monarch, for his future guest.<br/>
Behold Ulysses! no ignoble name,<br/>
Earth sounds my wisdom and high heaven my fame.
</p>
<p>
"My native soil is Ithaca the fair,<br/>
Where high Neritus waves his woods in air;<br/>
Dulichium, Same and Zaccynthus crown'd<br/>
With shady mountains spread their isles around.<br/>
(These to the north and night's dark regions run,<br/>
Those to Aurora and the rising sun).<br/>
Low lies our isle, yet bless'd in fruitful stores;<br/>
Strong are her sons, though rocky are her shores;<br/>
And none, ah none no lovely to my sight,<br/>
Of all the lands that heaven o'erspreads with light.<br/>
In vain Calypso long constrained my stay,<br/>
With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay;<br/>
With all her charms as vainly Circe strove,<br/>
And added magic to secure my love.<br/>
In pomps or joys, the palace or the grot,<br/>
My country's image never was forgot;<br/>
My absent parents rose before my sight,<br/>
And distant lay contentment and delight.
</p>
<p>
"Hear, then, the woes which mighty Jove ordain'd<br/>
To wait my passage from the Trojan land.<br/>
The winds from Ilion to the Cicons' shore,<br/>
Beneath cold Ismarus our vessels bore.<br/>
We boldly landed on the hostile place,<br/>
And sack'd the city, and destroy'd the race,<br/>
Their wives made captive, their possessions shared,<br/>
And every soldier found a like reward<br/>
I then advised to fly; not so the rest,<br/>
Who stay'd to revel, and prolong the feast:<br/>
The fatted sheep and sable bulls they slay,<br/>
And bowls flow round, and riot wastes the day.<br/>
Meantime the Cicons, to their holds retired,<br/>
Call on the Cicons, with new fury fired;<br/>
With early morn the gather'd country swarms,<br/>
And all the continent is bright with arms;<br/>
Thick as the budding leaves or rising flowers<br/>
O'erspread the land, when spring descends in showers:<br/>
All expert soldiers, skill'd on foot to dare,<br/>
Or from the bounding courser urge the war.<br/>
Now fortune changes (so the Fates ordain);<br/>
Our hour was come to taste our share of pain.<br/>
Close at the ships the bloody fight began,<br/>
Wounded they wound, and man expires on man.<br/>
Long as the morning sun increasing bright<br/>
O'er heaven's pure azure spreads the glowing light,<br/>
Promiscuous death the form of war confounds,<br/>
Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds;<br/>
But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,<br/>
Then conquest crown'd the fierce Ciconian train.<br/>
Six brave companions from each ship we lost,<br/>
The rest escape in haste, and quit the coast,<br/>
With sails outspread we fly the unequal strife,<br/>
Sad for their loss, but joyful of our life.<br/>
Yet as we fled, our fellows' rites we paid,<br/>
And thrice we call'd on each unhappy shade,
</p>
<p>
"Meanwhile the god, whose hand the thunder forms,<br/>
Drives clouds on clouds, and blackens heaven with storms:<br/>
Wide o'er the waste the rage of Boreas sweeps,<br/>
And night rush'd headlong on the shaded deeps.<br/>
Now here, now there, the giddy ships are borne,<br/>
And all the rattling shrouds in fragments torn.<br/>
We furl'd the sail, we plied the labouring oar,<br/>
Took down our masts, and row'd our ships to shore.<br/>
Two tedious days and two long nights we lay,<br/>
O'erwatch'd and batter'd in the naked bay.<br/>
But the third morning when Aurora brings,<br/>
We rear the masts, we spread the canvas wings;<br/>
Refresh'd and careless on the deck reclined,<br/>
We sit, and trust the pilot and the wind.<br/>
Then to my native country had I sail'd:<br/>
But, the cape doubled, adverse winds prevail'd.<br/>
Strong was the tide, which by the northern blast<br/>
Impell'd, our vessels on Cythera cast,<br/>
Nine days our fleet the uncertain tempest bore<br/>
Far in wide ocean, and from sight of shore:<br/>
The tenth we touch'd, by various errors toss'd,<br/>
The land of Lotus and the flowery coast.<br/>
We climb'd the beach, and springs of water found,<br/>
Then spread our hasty banquet on the ground.<br/>
Three men were sent, deputed from the crew<br/>
(A herald one) the dubious coast to view,<br/>
And learn what habitants possess'd the place.<br/>
They went, and found a hospitable race:<br/>
Not prone to ill, nor strange to foreign guest,<br/>
They eat, they drink, and nature gives the feast<br/>
The trees around them all their food produce:<br/>
Lotus the name: divine, nectareous juice!<br/>
(Thence call'd Lotophagi); which whose tastes,<br/>
Insatiate riots in the sweet repasts,<br/>
Nor other home, nor other care intends,<br/>
But quits his house, his country, and his friends.<br/>
The three we sent, from off the enchanting ground<br/>
We dragg'd reluctant, and by force we bound.<br/>
The rest in haste forsook the pleasing shore,<br/>
Or, the charm tasted, had return'd no more.<br/>
Now placed in order on their banks, they sweep<br/>
The sea's smooth face, and cleave the hoary deep:<br/>
With heavy hearts we labour through the tide,<br/>
To coasts unknown, and oceans yet untried.
</p>
<p>
"The land of Cyclops first, a savage kind,<br/>
Nor tamed by manners, nor by laws confined:<br/>
Untaught to plant, to turn the glebe, and sow,<br/>
They all their products to free nature owe:<br/>
The soil, untill'd, a ready harvest yields,<br/>
With wheat and barley wave the golden fields;<br/>
Spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour,<br/>
And Jove descends in each prolific shower,<br/>
By these no statues and no rights are known,<br/>
No council held, no monarch fills the throne;<br/>
But high on hills, or airy cliffs, they dwell,<br/>
Or deep in caves whose entrance leads to hell.<br/>
Each rules his race, his neighbour not his care,<br/>
Heedless of others, to his own severe.
</p>
<p>
"Opposed to the Cyclopæan coast, there lay<br/>
An isle, whose hill their subject fields survey;<br/>
Its name Lachaea, crown'd with many a grove,<br/>
Where savage goats through pathless thickets rove:<br/>
No needy mortals here, with hunger bold,<br/>
Or wretched hunters through the wintry cold<br/>
Pursue their flight; but leave them safe to bound<br/>
From hill to hill, o'er all the desert ground.<br/>
Nor knows the soil to feed the fleecy care,<br/>
Or feels the labours of the crooked share;<br/>
But uninhabited, untill'd, unsown,<br/>
It lies, and breeds the bleating goat alone.<br/>
For there no vessel with vermilion prore,<br/>
Or bark of traffic, glides from shore to shore;<br/>
The rugged race of savages, unskill'd<br/>
The seas to traverse, or the ships to build,<br/>
Gaze on the coast, nor cultivate the soil,<br/>
Unlearn'd in all the industrious art of toil,<br/>
Yet here all products and all plants abound,<br/>
Sprung from the fruitful genius of the ground;<br/>
Fields waving high with heavy crops are seen,<br/>
And vines that flourish in eternal green,<br/>
Refreshing meads along the murmuring main,<br/>
And fountains streaming down the fruitful plain.
</p>
<p>
"A port there is, inclosed on either side,<br/>
Where ships may rest, unanchor'd and untied;<br/>
Till the glad mariners incline to sail,<br/>
And the sea whitens with the rising gale,<br/>
High at the head, from out the cavern'd rock,<br/>
In living rills a gushing fountain broke:<br/>
Around it, and above, for ever green,<br/>
The busy alders form'd a shady scene;<br/>
Hither some favouring god, beyond our thought,<br/>
Through all surrounding shade our navy brought;<br/>
For gloomy night descended on the main,<br/>
Nor glimmer'd Phoebe in the ethereal plain:<br/>
But all unseen the clouded island lay,<br/>
And all unseen the surge and rolling sea,<br/>
Till safe we anchor'd in the shelter'd bay:<br/>
Our sails we gather'd, cast our cables o'er,<br/>
And slept secure along the sandy shore.<br/>
Soon as again the rosy morning shone,<br/>
Reveal'd the landscape and the scene unknown,<br/>
With wonder seized, we view the pleasing ground,<br/>
And walk delighted, and expatiate round.<br/>
Roused by the woodland nymphs at early dawn,<br/>
The mountain goats came bounding o'er the lawn:<br/>
In haste our fellows to the ships repair,<br/>
For arms and weapons of the sylvan war;<br/>
Straight in three squadrons all our crew we part,<br/>
And bend the bow, or wing the missile dart;<br/>
The bounteous gods afford a copious prey,<br/>
And nine fat goats each vessel bears away:<br/>
The royal bark had ten. Our ships complete<br/>
We thus supplied (for twelve were all the fleet).
</p>
<p>
"Here, till the setting sun roll'd down the light,<br/>
We sat indulging in the genial rite:<br/>
Nor wines were wanting; those from ample jars<br/>
We drain'd, the prize of our Ciconian wars.<br/>
The land of Cyclops lay in prospect near:<br/>
The voice of goats and bleating flocks we hear,<br/>
And from their mountains rising smokes appear.<br/>
Now sunk the sun, and darkness cover'd o'er<br/>
The face of things: along the sea-beat shore<br/>
Satiate we slept: but, when the sacred dawn<br/>
Arising glitter'd o'er the dewy lawn,<br/>
I call'd my fellows, and these words address'd<br/>
'My dear associates, here indulge your rest;<br/>
While, with my single ship, adventurous, I<br/>
Go forth, the manners of yon men to try;<br/>
Whether a race unjust, of barbarous might,<br/>
Rude and unconscious of a stranger's right;<br/>
Or such who harbour pity in their breast,<br/>
Revere the gods, and succour the distress'd,'
</p>
<p>
"This said, I climb'd my vessel's lofty side;<br/>
My train obey'd me, and the ship untied.<br/>
In order seated on their banks, they sweep<br/>
Neptune's smooth face, and cleave the yielding deep.<br/>
When to the nearest verge of land we drew,<br/>
Fast by the sea a lonely cave we view,<br/>
High, and with darkening laurels covered o'er;<br/>
Where sheep and goats lay slumbering round the shore:<br/>
Near this, a fence of marble from the rock,<br/>
Brown with o'erarching pine and spreading oak.<br/>
A giant shepherd here his flock maintains<br/>
Far from the rest, and solitary reigns,<br/>
In shelter thick of horrid shade reclined;<br/>
And gloomy mischiefs labour in his mind.<br/>
A form enormous! far unlike the race<br/>
Of human birth, in stature, or in face;<br/>
As some lone mountain's monstrous growth he stood,<br/>
Crown'd with rough thickets, and a nodding wood.<br/>
I left my vessel at the point of land,<br/>
And close to guard it, gave our crew command:<br/>
With only twelve, the boldest and the best,<br/>
I seek the adventure, and forsake the rest.<br/>
Then took a goatskin fill'd with precious wine,<br/>
The gift of Maron of Evantheus' line<br/>
(The priest of Phœbus at the Ismarian shrine).<br/>
In sacred shade his honour'd mansion stood<br/>
Amidst Apollo's consecrated wood;<br/>
Him, and his house, Heaven moved my mind to save,<br/>
And costly presents in return he gave;<br/>
Seven golden talents to perfection wrought,<br/>
A silver bowl that held a copious draught,<br/>
And twelve large vessels of unmingled wine,<br/>
Mellifluous, undecaying, and divine!<br/>
Which now, some ages from his race conceal'd,<br/>
The hoary sire in gratitude reveal'd.<br/>
Such was the wine: to quench whose fervent steam<br/>
Scarce twenty measures from the living stream<br/>
To cool one cup sufficed: the goblet crown'd<br/>
Breathed aromatic fragrances around.<br/>
Of this an ample vase we heaved aboard,<br/>
And brought another with provisions stored.<br/>
My soul foreboded I should find the bower<br/>
Of some fell monster, fierce with barbarous power;<br/>
Some rustic wretch, who lived in Heaven's despite,<br/>
Contemning laws, and trampling on the right.<br/>
The cave we found, but vacant all within<br/>
(His flock the giant tended on the green):<br/>
But round the grot we gaze; and all we view,<br/>
In order ranged our admiration drew:<br/>
The bending shelves with loads of cheeses press'd,<br/>
The folded flocks each separate from the rest<br/>
(The larger here, and there the lesser lambs,<br/>
The new-fallen young here bleating for their dams:<br/>
The kid distinguish'd from the lambkin lies);<br/>
The cavern echoes with responsive cries.<br/>
Capacious chargers all around were laid.<br/>
Full pails, and vessels of the milking trade.<br/>
With fresh provisions hence our fleet to store<br/>
My friends advise me, and to quit the shore.<br/>
Or drive a flock of sheep and goats away,<br/>
Consult our safety, and put off to sea.<br/>
Their wholesome counsel rashly I declined,<br/>
Curious to view the man of monstrous kind,<br/>
And try what social rites a savage lends:<br/>
Dire rites, alas! and fatal to my friends
</p>
<p>
"Then first a fire we kindle, and prepare<br/>
For his return with sacrifice and prayer;<br/>
The loaden shelves afford us full repast;<br/>
We sit expecting. Lo! he comes at last,<br/>
Near half a forest on his back he bore,<br/>
And cast the ponderous burden at the door.<br/>
It thunder'd as it fell. We trembled then,<br/>
And sought the deep recesses of the den.<br/>
New driven before him through the arching rock,<br/>
Came tumbling, heaps on heaps, the unnumber'd flock.<br/>
Big-udder'd ewes, and goats of female kind<br/>
(The males were penn'd in outward courts behind);<br/>
Then, heaved on high, a rock's enormous weight<br/>
To the cave's mouth he roll'd, and closed the gate<br/>
(Scarce twenty four-wheel'd cars, compact and strong,<br/>
The massy load could bear, or roll along).<br/>
He next betakes him to his evening cares,<br/>
And, sitting down, to milk his flocks prepares;<br/>
Of half their udders eases first the dams,<br/>
Then to the mother's teat submits the lambs;<br/>
Half the white stream to hardening cheese be press'd,<br/>
And high in wicker-baskets heap'd: the rest,<br/>
Reserved in bowls, supplied his nightly feast.<br/>
His labour done, he fired the pile, that gave<br/>
A sudden blaze, and lighted all the cave.<br/>
We stand discover'd by the rising fires;<br/>
Askance the giant glares, and thus inquires:
</p>
<p>
"'What are ye, guests? on what adventure, say,<br/>
Thus far ye wander through the watery way?<br/>
Pirates perhaps, who seek through seas unknown<br/>
The lives of others, and expose your own?'
</p>
<p>
"His voice like thunder through the cavern sounds;<br/>
My bold companions thrilling fear confounds,<br/>
Appall'd at sight of more than mortal man!<br/>
At length, with heart recover'd, I began:
</p>
<p>
"'From Troy's famed fields, sad wanderers o'er the main,<br/>
Behold the relics of the Grecian train:<br/>
Through various seas, by various perils toss'd,<br/>
And forced by storms, unwilling on your coast;<br/>
Far from our destined course and native land,<br/>
Such was our fate, and such high Jove's command!<br/>
Nor what we are befits us to disclaim,<br/>
Atrides' friends (in arms a mighty name),<br/>
Who taught proud Troy and all her sons to bow;<br/>
Victors of late, but humble suppliants now!<br/>
Low at thy knee thy succour we implore;<br/>
Respect us, human, and relieve us, poor.<br/>
At least, some hospitable gift bestow;<br/>
'Tis what the happy to the unhappy owe;<br/>
'Tis what the gods require: those gods revere;<br/>
The poor and stranger are their constant care;<br/>
To Jove their cause, and their revenge belongs,<br/>
He wanders with them, and he feels their wrongs."
</p>
<p>
"'Fools that ye are (the savage thus replies,<br/>
His inward fury blazing at his eyes),<br/>
Or strangers, distant far from our abodes,<br/>
To bid me reverence or regard the gods.<br/>
Know then, we Cyclops are a race above<br/>
Those air-bred people, and their goat-nursed Jove;<br/>
And learn, our power proceeds with thee and thine,<br/>
Not as he wills, but as ourselves incline.<br/>
But answer, the good ship that brought ye o'er,<br/>
Where lies she anchor'd? near or off the shore?'
</p>
<p>
"Thus he. His meditated fraud I find<br/>
(Versed in the turns of various human-kind):<br/>
And, cautious thus: 'Against a dreadful rock,<br/>
Fast by your shore the gallant vessel broke.<br/>
Scarce with these few I 'scaped; of all my train,<br/>
Whom angry Neptune, whelm'd beneath the main,<br/>
The scattered wreck the winds blew back again.'
</p>
<p>
"He answer'd with his deed: his bloody hand<br/>
Snatch'd two, unhappy! of my martial band;<br/>
And dash'd like dogs against the stony floor:<br/>
The pavement swims with brains and mingled gore.<br/>
Torn limb from limb, he spreads his horrid feast,<br/>
And fierce devours it like a mountain beast:<br/>
He sucks the marrow, and the blood he drains,<br/>
Nor entrails, flesh, nor solid bone remains.<br/>
We see the death from which we cannot move,<br/>
And humbled groan beneath the hand of Jove.<br/>
His ample maw with human carnage fill'd,<br/>
A milky deluge next the giant swill'd;<br/>
Then stretch'd in length o'er half the cavern'd rock,<br/>
Lay senseless, and supine, amidst the flock.<br/>
To seize the time, and with a sudden wound<br/>
To fix the slumbering monster to the ground,<br/>
My soul impels me! and in act I stand<br/>
To draw the sword; but wisdom held my hand.<br/>
A deed so rash had finished all our fate,<br/>
No mortal forces from the lofty gate<br/>
Could roll the rock. In hopeless grief we lay,<br/>
And sigh, expecting the return of day.<br/>
Now did the rosy-fingered morn arise,<br/>
And shed her sacred light along the skies;<br/>
He wakes, he lights the fire, he milks the dams,<br/>
And to the mother's teats submits the lambs.<br/>
The task thus finish'd of his morning hours,<br/>
Two more he snatches, murders, and devours.<br/>
Then pleased, and whistling, drives his flock before,<br/>
Removes the rocky mountain from the door,<br/>
And shuts again: with equal ease disposed,<br/>
As a light quiver's lid is oped and closed.<br/>
His giant voice the echoing region fills:<br/>
His flocks, obedient, spread o'er all the hills.
</p>
<p>
"Thus left behind, even in the last despair<br/>
I thought, devised, and Pallas heard my prayer.<br/>
Revenge, and doubt, and caution, work'd my breast;<br/>
But this of many counsels seem'd the best:<br/>
The monster's club within the cave I spied,<br/>
A tree of stateliest growth, and yet undried,<br/>
Green from the wood: of height and bulk so vast,<br/>
The largest ship might claim it for a mast.<br/>
This shorten'd of its top, I gave my train<br/>
A fathom's length, to shape it and to plane;<br/>
The narrower end I sharpen'd to a spire,<br/>
Whose point we harden'd with the force of fire,<br/>
And hid it in the dust that strew'd the cave,<br/>
Then to my few companions, bold and brave,<br/>
Proposed, who first the venturous deed should try,<br/>
In the broad orbit of his monstrous eye<br/>
To plunge the brand and twirl the pointed wood,<br/>
When slumber next should tame the man of blood.<br/>
Just as I wished, the lots were cast on four:<br/>
Myself the fifth. We stand and wait the hour.<br/>
He comes with evening: all his fleecy flock<br/>
Before him march, and pour into the rock:<br/>
Not one, or male or female, stayed behind<br/>
(So fortune chanced, or so some god designed);<br/>
Then heaving high the stone's unwieldy weight,<br/>
He roll'd it on the cave and closed the gate.<br/>
First down he sits, to milk the woolly dams,<br/>
And then permits their udder to the lambs.<br/>
Next seized two wretches more, and headlong cast,<br/>
Brain'd on the rock; his second dire repast.<br/>
I then approach'd him reeking with their gore,<br/>
And held the brimming goblet foaming o'er;<br/>
'Cyclop! since human flesh has been thy feast,<br/>
Now drain this goblet, potent to digest;<br/>
Know hence what treasures in our ship we lost,<br/>
And what rich liquors other climates boast.<br/>
We to thy shore the precious freight shall bear,<br/>
If home thou send us and vouchsafe to spare.<br/>
But oh! thus furious, thirsting thus for gore,<br/>
The sons of men shall ne'er approach thy shore,<br/>
And never shalt thou taste this nectar more,'
</p>
<p>
"He heard, he took, and pouring down his throat,<br/>
Delighted, swill'd the large luxurious draught,<br/>
'More! give me more (he cried): the boon be thine,<br/>
Whoe'er thou art that bear'st celestial wine!<br/>
Declare thy name: not mortal is this juice,<br/>
Such as the unbless'd Cyclopæan climes produce<br/>
(Though sure our vine the largest cluster yields,<br/>
And Jove's scorn'd thunder serves to drench our fields);<br/>
But this descended from the bless'd abodes,<br/>
A rill of nectar, streaming from the gods.'
</p>
<p>
"He said, and greedy grasped the heady bowl,<br/>
Thrice drained, and poured the deluge on his soul.<br/>
His sense lay covered with the dozy fume;<br/>
While thus my fraudful speech I reassume.<br/>
'Thy promised boon, O Cyclop! now I claim,<br/>
And plead my title; Noman is my name.<br/>
By that distinguish'd from my tender years,<br/>
'Tis what my parents call me, and my peers.
</p>
<p>
"The giant then: 'Our promis'd grace receive,<br/>
The hospitable boon we mean to give:<br/>
When all thy wretched crew have felt my power,<br/>
Noman shall be the last I will devour.'
</p>
<p>
"He said: then nodding with the fumes of wine<br/>
Droop'd his huge head, and snoring lay supine.<br/>
His neck obliquely o'er his shoulders hung,<br/>
Press'd with the weight of sleep that tames the strong:<br/>
There belch'd the mingled streams of wine and blood,<br/>
And human flesh, his indigested food.<br/>
Sudden I stir the embers, and inspire<br/>
With animating breath the seeds of fire:<br/>
Each drooping spirit with bold words repair,<br/>
And urged my train the dreadful deed to dare.<br/>
The stake now glow'd beneath the burning bed<br/>
(Green as it was) and sparkled fiery red,<br/>
Then forth the vengeful instrument I bring;<br/>
With beating hearts my fellows form a ring.<br/>
Urged my some present god, they swift let fall<br/>
The pointed torment on his visual ball.<br/>
Myself above them from a rising ground<br/>
Guide the sharp stake, and twirl it round and round.<br/>
As when a shipwright stands his workmen o'er,<br/>
Who ply the wimble, some huge beam to bore;<br/>
Urged on all hands, it nimbly spins about,<br/>
The grain deep-piercing till it scoops it out:<br/>
In his broad eye he whirls the fiery wood;<br/>
From the pierced pupil spouts the boiling blood;<br/>
Singed are his brows; the scorching lids grow black;<br/>
The jelly bubbles, and the fibres crack.<br/>
And as when armourers temper in the ford<br/>
The keen-edged pole-axe, or the shining sword,<br/>
The red-hot metal hisses in the lake,<br/>
Thus in his eye-ball hiss'd the plunging stake.<br/>
He sends a dreadful groan, the rocks around<br/>
Through all their inmost winding caves resound.<br/>
Scared we recoiled. Forth with frantic hand,<br/>
He tore and dash'd on earth and gory brand;<br/>
Then calls the Cyclops, all that round him dwell,<br/>
With voice like thunder, and a direful yell.<br/>
From all their dens the one-eyed race repair,<br/>
From rifted rocks, and mountains bleak in air.<br/>
All haste assembled, at his well-known roar,<br/>
Inquire the cause, and crowd the cavern door.
</p>
<p>
"'What hurts thee, Polypheme? what strange affright<br/>
Thus breaks our slumbers, and disturbs the night?<br/>
Does any mortal, in the unguarded hour<br/>
Of sleep, oppress thee, or by fraud or power?<br/>
Or thieves insidious thy fair flock surprise?'<br/>
Thus they; the Cyclop from his den replies:
</p>
<p>
"'Friends, Noman kills me; Noman in the hour<br/>
Of sleep, oppresses me with fraudful power.'<br/>
'If no man hurt thee, but the hand divine<br/>
Inflict disease, it fits thee to resign:<br/>
To Jove or to thy father Neptune pray.'<br/>
The brethren cried, and instant strode away.<br/>
"Joy touch'd my secret soul and conscious heart,<br/>
Pleased with the effect of conduct and of art.<br/>
Meantime the Cyclop, raging with his wound,<br/>
Spreads his wide arms, and searches round and round:<br/>
At last, the stone removing from the gate,<br/>
With hands extended in the midst he sate;<br/>
And search'd each passing sheep, and felt it o'er,<br/>
Secure to seize us ere we reach'd the door<br/>
(Such as his shallow wit he deem'd was mine);<br/>
But secret I revolved the deep design:<br/>
'Twas for our lives my labouring bosom wrought;<br/>
Each scheme I turn'd, and sharpen'd every thought;<br/>
This way and that I cast to save my friends,<br/>
Till one resolve my varying counsel ends.
</p>
<p>
"Strong were the rams, with native purple fair,<br/>
Well fed, and largest of the fleecy care,<br/>
These, three and three, with osier bands we tied<br/>
(The twining bands the Cyclop's bed supplied);<br/>
The midmost bore a man, the outward two<br/>
Secured each side: so bound we all the crew,<br/>
One ram remain'd, the leader of the flock:<br/>
In his deep fleece my grasping hands I lock,<br/>
And fast beneath, in wooly curls inwove,<br/>
There cling implicit, and confide in Jove.<br/>
When rosy morning glimmer'd o'er the dales,<br/>
He drove to pasture all the lusty males:<br/>
The ewes still folded, with distended thighs<br/>
Unmilk'd lay bleating in distressful cries.<br/>
But heedless of those cares, with anguish stung,<br/>
He felt their fleeces as they pass'd along<br/>
(Fool that he was.) and let them safely go,<br/>
All unsuspecting of their freight below.
</p>
<p>
"The master ram at last approach'd the gate,<br/>
Charged with his wool, and with Ulysses' fate.<br/>
Him while he pass'd, the monster blind bespoke:<br/>
'What makes my ram the lag of all the flock?<br/>
First thou wert wont to crop the flowery mead,<br/>
First to the field and river's bank to lead,<br/>
And first with stately step at evening hour<br/>
Thy fleecy fellows usher to their bower.<br/>
Now far the last, with pensive pace and slow<br/>
Thou movest, as conscious of thy master's woe!<br/>
Seest thou these lids that now unfold in vain?<br/>
(The deed of Noman and his wicked train!)<br/>
Oh! did'st thou feel for thy afflicted lord,<br/>
And would but Fate the power of speech afford.<br/>
Soon might'st thou tell me, where in secret here<br/>
The dastard lurks, all trembling with his fear:<br/>
Swung round and round, and dash'd from rock to rock,<br/>
His battered brains should on the pavement smoke<br/>
No ease, no pleasure my sad heart receives,<br/>
While such a monster as vile Noman lives.'
</p>
<p>
"The giant spoke, and through the hollow rock<br/>
Dismiss'd the ram, the father of the flock.<br/>
No sooner freed, and through the inclosure pass'd,<br/>
First I release myself, my fellows last:<br/>
Fat sheep and goats in throngs we drive before,<br/>
And reach our vessel on the winding shore.<br/>
With joy the sailors view their friends return'd,<br/>
And hail us living whom as dead they mourn'd<br/>
Big tears of transport stand in every eye:<br/>
I check their fondness, and command to fly.<br/>
Aboard in haste they heave the wealthy sheep,<br/>
And snatch their oars, and rush into the deep.
</p>
<p>
"Now off at sea, and from the shallows clear,<br/>
As far as human voice could reach the ear,<br/>
With taunts the distant giant I accost:<br/>
'Hear me, O Cyclop! hear, ungracious host!<br/>
'Twas on no coward, no ignoble slave,<br/>
Thou meditatest thy meal in yonder cave;<br/>
But one, the vengeance fated from above<br/>
Doom'd to inflict; the instrument of Jove.<br/>
Thy barbarous breach of hospitable bands,<br/>
The god, the god revenges by my hands.'
</p>
<p>
"These words the Cyclop's burning rage provoke;<br/>
From the tall hill he rends a pointed rock;<br/>
High o'er the billows flew the massy load,<br/>
And near the ship came thundering on the flood.<br/>
It almost brush'd the helm, and fell before:<br/>
The whole sea shook, and refluent beat the shore,<br/>
The strong concussion on the heaving tide<br/>
Roll'd back the vessel to the island's side:<br/>
Again I shoved her off: our fate to fly,<br/>
Each nerve we stretch, and every oar we ply.<br/>
Just 'scaped impending death, when now again<br/>
We twice as far had furrow'd back the main,<br/>
Once more I raise my voice; my friends, afraid,<br/>
With mild entreaties my design dissuade:<br/>
'What boots the godless giant to provoke,<br/>
Whose arm may sink us at a single stroke?<br/>
Already when the dreadful rock he threw,<br/>
Old Ocean shook, and back his surges flew.<br/>
The sounding voice directs his aim again;<br/>
The rock o'erwhelms us, and we 'scaped in vain.'
</p>
<p>
"But I, of mind elate, and scorning fear,<br/>
Thus with new taunts insult the monster's ear:<br/>
'Cyclop! if any, pitying thy disgrace.<br/>
Ask, who disfigured thus that eyeless face?<br/>
Say 'twas Ulysses: 'twas his deed declare,<br/>
Laertes' son, of Ithaca the fair;<br/>
Ulysses, far in fighting fields renown'd,<br/>
Before whose arm Troy tumbled to the ground.'
</p>
<p>
"The astonished savage with a roar replies:<br/>
'Oh heavens! oh faith of ancient prophecies!<br/>
This, Telemus Eurymedes foretold<br/>
(The mighty seer who on these hills grew old;<br/>
Skill'd the dark fates of mortals to declare,<br/>
And learn'd in all wing'd omens of the air);<br/>
Long since he menaced, such was Fate's command;<br/>
And named Ulysses as the destined hand.<br/>
I deem'd some godlike giant to behold,<br/>
Or lofty hero, haughty, brave, and bold;<br/>
Not this weak pigmy wretch, of mean design,<br/>
Who, not by strength subdued me, but by wine.<br/>
But come, accept our gifts, and join to pray<br/>
Great Neptune's blessing on the watery way;<br/>
For his I am, and I the lineage own;<br/>
The immortal father no less boasts the son.<br/>
His power can heal me, and relight my eye;<br/>
And only his, of all the gods on high.'<br/>
"'Oh! could this arm (I thus aloud rejoin'd)<br/>
From that vast bulk dislodge thy bloody mind,<br/>
And send thee howling to the realms of night!<br/>
As sure as Neptune cannot give thee sight.'<br/>
"Thus I; while raging he repeats his cries,<br/>
With hands uplifted to the starry skies?<br/>
'Hear me, O Neptune; thou whose arms are hurl'd<br/>
From shore to shore, and gird the solid world;<br/>
If thine I am, nor thou my birth disown,<br/>
And if the unhappy Cyclop be thy son,<br/>
Let not Ulysses breathe his native air,<br/>
Laertes' son, of Ithaca the fair.<br/>
If to review his country be his fate,<br/>
Be it through toils and sufferings long and late;<br/>
His lost companions let him first deplore;<br/>
Some vessel, not his own, transport him o'er;<br/>
And when at home from foreign sufferings freed,<br/>
More near and deep, domestic woes succeed!'<br/>
With imprecations thus he fill'd the air,<br/>
And angry Neptune heard the unrighteous prayer,<br/>
A larger rock then heaving from the plain,<br/>
He whirl'd it round: it sung across the main;<br/>
It fell, and brush'd the stern: the billows roar,<br/>
Shake at the weight, and refluent beat the shore.<br/>
With all our force we kept aloof to sea,<br/>
And gain'd the island where our vessels lay.<br/>
Our sight the whole collected navy cheer'd.<br/>
Who, waiting long, by turns had hoped and fear'd.<br/>
There disembarking on the green sea side,<br/>
We land our cattle, and the spoil divide;<br/>
Of these due shares to every sailor fall;<br/>
The master ram was voted mine by all;<br/>
And him (the guardian of Ulysses' fate)<br/>
With pious mind to heaven I consecrate.<br/>
But the great god, whose thunder rends the skies,<br/>
Averse, beholds the smoking sacrifice;<br/>
And sees me wandering still from coast to coast,<br/>
And all my vessels, all my people, lost!<br/>
While thoughtless we indulge the genial rite,<br/>
As plenteous cates and flowing bowls invite;<br/>
Till evening Phœbus roll'd away the light;<br/>
Stretch'd on the shore in careless ease we rest,<br/>
Till ruddy morning purpled o'er the east;<br/>
Then from their anchors all our ships unbind,<br/>
And mount the decks, and call the willing wind.<br/>
Now, ranged in order on our banks we sweep.<br/>
With hasty strokes the hoarse-resounding deep;<br/>
Blind to the future, pensive with our fears,<br/>
Glad for the living, for the dead in tears."

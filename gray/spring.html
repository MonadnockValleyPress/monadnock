<h1>Ode on the Spring</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Gray</h2>
<p>
Lo! where the rosy-bosom'd Hours,<br/>
Fair Venus' train appear,<br/>
Disclose the long-expecting flowers,<br/>
And wake the purple year!<br/>
The Attic warbler pours her throat,<br/>
Responsive to the cuckoo's note,<br/>
The untaught harmony of spring:<br/>
While whisp'ring pleasure as they fly,<br/>
Cool zephyrs thro' the clear blue sky<br/>
Their gather'd fragrance fling.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Where'er the oak's thick branches stretch<br/>
A broader, browner shade;<br/>
Where'er the rude and moss-grown beech<br/>
O'er-canopies the glade,<br/>
Beside some water's rushy brink<br/>
With me the Muse shall sit, and think<br/>
(At ease reclin'd in rustic state)<br/>
How vain the ardour of the crowd,<br/>
How low, how little are the proud,<br/>
How indigent the great!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Still is the toiling hand of Care:<br/>
The panting herds repose:<br/>
Yet hark, how thro' the peopled air<br/>
The busy murmur glows!<br/>
The insect youth are on the wing,<br/>
Eager to taste the honied spring,<br/>
And float amid the liquid noon:<br/>
Some lightly o'er the current skim,<br/>
Some show their gaily-gilded trim<br/>
Quick-glancing to the sun.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To Contemplation's sober eye<br/>
Such is the race of man:<br/>
And they that creep, and they that fly,<br/>
Shall end where they began.<br/>
Alike the busy and the gay<br/>
But flutter thro' life's little day,<br/>
In fortune's varying colours drest:<br/>
Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance,<br/>
Or chill'd by age, their airy dance<br/>
They leave, in dust to rest.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Methinks I hear in accents low<br/>
The sportive kind reply:<br/>
Poor moralist! and what art thou?<br/>
A solitary fly!<br/>
Thy joys no glitt'ring female meets,<br/>
No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,<br/>
No painted plumage to display:<br/>
On hasty wings thy youth is flown;<br/>
Thy sun is set, thy spring is gone&mdash;<br/>
We frolic, while 'tis May.<br/>
</p>

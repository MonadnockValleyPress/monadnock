<h1>Hymn to Adversity</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Gray</h2>
<p>
Daughter of Jove, relentless Power,<br/>
Thou tamer of the human breast,<br/>
Whose iron scourge and tort'ring hour<br/>
The Bad affright, afflict the Best!<br/>
Bound in thy adamantine chain<br/>
The Proud are taught to taste of pain,<br/>
And purple Tyrants vainly groan<br/>
With pangs unfelt before, unpitied and alone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When first thy Sire to send on earth<br/>
Virtue, his darling child, designed,<br/>
To thee he gave the heav'nly Birth,<br/>
And bade to form her infant mind.<br/>
Stern rugged Nurse! thy rigid lore<br/>
With patience many a year she bore:<br/>
What sorrow was, thou bad'st her know,<br/>
And from her own she learned to melt at others' woe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Scared at thy frown terrific, fly<br/>
Self-pleasing Folly's idle brood,<br/>
Wild Laughter, Noise, and thoughtless Joy,<br/>
And leave us leisure to be good.<br/>
Light they disperse, and with them go<br/>
The summer Friend, the flatt'ring Foe;<br/>
By vain Prosperity received,<br/>
To her they vow their truth, and are again believed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Wisdom in sable garb arrayed<br/>
Immersed in rapt'rous thought profound,<br/>
And Melancholy, silent maid<br/>
With leaden eye, that loves the ground,<br/>
Still on thy solemn steps attend:<br/>
Warm Charity, the gen'ral Friend,<br/>
With Justice, to herself severe,<br/>
And Pity dropping soft the sadly-pleasing tear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh, gently on thy Suppliant's head,<br/>
Dread Goddess, lay thy chast'ning hand!<br/>
Not in thy Gorgon terrors clad,<br/>
Not circled with the vengeful Band<br/>
(As by the Impious thou art seen),<br/>
With thund'ring voice, and threat'ning mien,<br/>
With screaming Horror's funeral cry,<br/>
Despair, and fell Disease, and ghastly Poverty.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thy form benign, O Goddess, wear,<br/>
Thy milder influence impart,<br/>
Thy philosophic Train be there<br/>
To soften, not to wound my heart.<br/>
The gen'rous spark extinct revive,<br/>
Teach me to love and to forgive,<br/>
Exact my own defects to scan,<br/>
What others are, to feel, and know myself a Man.<br/>

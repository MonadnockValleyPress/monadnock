<h1>Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Gray</h2>
<p>
The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,<br/>
The plowman homeward plods his weary way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaves the world to darkness and to me.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now fades the glimm'ring landscape on the sight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the air a solemn stillness holds,<br/>
Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;<br/>
</p>
<p>
Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moping owl does to the moon complain<br/>
Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molest her ancient solitary reign.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,<br/>
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,<br/>
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or busy housewife ply her evening care:<br/>
No children run to lisp their sire's return,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;<br/>
How jocund did they drive their team afield!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;<br/>
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short and simple annals of the poor.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,<br/>
Awaits alike th' inevitable hour.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paths of glory lead but to the grave.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophies raise,<br/>
Where thro' the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Can storied urn or animated bust<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?<br/>
Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;<br/>
Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wak'd to ecstasy the living lyre.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;<br/>
Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And froze the genial current of the soul.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Full many a gem of purest ray serene,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:<br/>
Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waste its sweetness on the desert air.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little tyrant of his fields withstood;<br/>
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threats of pain and ruin to despise,<br/>
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Their lot forbade: nor circumscrib'd alone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd;<br/>
Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,<br/>
</p>
<p>
The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,<br/>
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;<br/>
Along the cool sequester'd vale of life<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some frail memorial still erected nigh,<br/>
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place of fame and elegy supply:<br/>
And many a holy text around she strews,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That teach the rustic moralist to die.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,<br/>
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?<br/>
</p>
<p>
On some fond breast the parting soul relies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some pious drops the closing eye requires;<br/>
Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;<br/>
If chance, by lonely contemplation led,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn<br/>
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"There at the foot of yonder nodding beech<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,<br/>
His listless length at noontide would he stretch,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pore upon the brook that babbles by.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,<br/>
Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;<br/>
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"The next with dirges due in sad array<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.<br/>
Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."<br/>
</p>
<p>THE EPITAPH</p>
<p>
Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.<br/>
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:<br/>
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.<br/>
</p>
<p>
No farther seek his merits to disclose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,<br/>
(There they alike in trembling hope repose)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bosom of his Father and his God.<br/>

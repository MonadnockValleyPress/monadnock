<h1>The Mad Maid's Song</h1>
<h2>by Robert Herrick</h2>
<p>
Good-morrow to the day so fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good-morning, sir, to you;<br/>
Good-morrow to mine own torn hair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedabbled with the dew.
</p>
<p>
Good-morning to this primrose too,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good-morrow to each maid<br/>
That will with flowers the tomb bestrew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein my love is laid.
</p>
<p>
Ah! woe is me, woe, woe is me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alack and well-a-day!<br/>
For pity, sir, find out that bee<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which bore my love away.
</p>
<p>
I'll seek him in your bonnet brave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll seek him in your eyes;<br/>
Nay, now I think th'ave made his grave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I' th' bed of strawberries.
</p>
<p>
I'll seek him there; I know ere this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold, cold earth doth shake him;<br/>
But I will go or send a kiss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By you, sir, to awake him.
</p>
<p>
Pray, hurt him not, though he be dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows well who do love him,<br/>
And who with green turfs rear his head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who do rudely move him.
</p>
<p>
He's soft and tender (pray take heed);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bands of cowslips bind him,<br/>
And bring him home; but 'tis decreed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I shall never find him.

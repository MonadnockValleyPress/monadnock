<h1>The Funeral Rites of the Rose</h1>
<h2>by Robert Herrick</h2>
<p>
The rose was sick, and smiling died;<br/>
And, being to be sanctified,<br/>
About the bed there sighing stood<br/>
The sweet and flowery sisterhood.<br/>
Some hung the head, while some did bring,<br/>
To wash her, water from the spring.<br/>
Some laid her forth, while others wept,<br/>
But all a solemn fast there kept.<br/>
The holy sisters, some among,<br/>
The sacred dirge and trentall sung.<br/>
But ah! what sweets smelt everywhere,<br/>
As heaven had spent all perfumes there.<br/>
At last, when prayers for the dead<br/>
And rites were all accomplished,<br/>
They, weeping, spread a lawny loom<br/>
And clos'd her up, as in a tomb.

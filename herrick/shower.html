<h1>The Shower of Blossoms</h1>
<h2>by Robert Herrick</h2>
<p>
Love in a shower of blossoms came<br/>
Down, and half drown'd me with the same:<br/>
The blooms that fell were white and red;<br/>
But with such sweets commingl&egrave;d,<br/>
As whether&mdash;this I cannot tell&mdash;<br/>
My sight was pleas'd more, or my smell:<br/>
But true it was, as I roll'd there,<br/>
Without a thought of hurt or fear,<br/>
Love turn'd himself into a bee,<br/>
And with his javelin wounded me:<br/>
From which mishap this use I make,<br/>
<em>Where most sweets are, there lies a snake:</em><br/>
<em>Kisses and favours are sweet things;</em><br/>
<em>But those have thorns and these have stings.</em>

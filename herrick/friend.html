<h1>To His Peculiar Friend, M. Jo. Wicks</h1>
<h2>by Robert Herrick</h2>
<p>
Since shed or cottage I have none,<br/>
I sing the more, that thou hast one<br/>
To whose glad threshold, and free door,<br/>
I may a poet come, though poor,<br/>
And eat with thee a savoury bit,<br/>
Paying but common thanks for it.<br/>
Yet should I chance, my Wicks, to see<br/>
An over-leaven look in thee,<br/>
To sour the bread, and turn the beer<br/>
To an exalted vinegar:<br/>
Or should'st thou prize me as a dish<br/>
Of thrice-boiled worts, or third-day's fish;<br/>
I'd rather hungry go and come,<br/>
Than to thy house be burdensome;<br/>
Yet, in my depth of grief, I'd be<br/>
One that should drop his beads for thee.

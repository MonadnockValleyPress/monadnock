<h1>On Another's Sorrow</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
Can I see another's woe,<br/>
And not be in sorrow too?<br/>
Can I see another's grief,<br/>
And not seek for kind relief?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Can I see a falling tear,<br/>
And not feel my sorrow's share?<br/>
Can a father see his child<br/>
Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Can a mother sit and hear<br/>
An infant groan, an infant fear?<br/>
No, no! never can it be!<br/>
Never, never can it be!<br/>
</p>
<p>
And can He who smiles on all<br/>
Hear the wren with sorrows small,<br/>
Hear the small bird's grief and care,<br/>
Hear the woes that infants bear&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
And not sit beside the nest,<br/>
Pouring pity in their breast,<br/>
And not sit the cradle near,<br/>
Weeping tear on infant's tear?<br/>
</p>
<p>
And not sit both night and day,<br/>
Wiping all our tears away?<br/>
O no! never can it be!<br/>
Never, never can it be!<br/>
</p>
<p>
He doth give His joy to all:<br/>
He becomes an infant small,<br/>
He becomes a man of woe,<br/>
He doth feel the sorrow too.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,<br/>
And thy Maker is not by:<br/>
Think not thou canst weep a tear,<br/>
And thy Maker is not near.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O He gives to us His joy,<br/>
That our grief He may destroy:<br/>
Till our grief is fled and gone<br/>
He doth sit by us and moan.<br/>
</p>
<p>THE END</p>

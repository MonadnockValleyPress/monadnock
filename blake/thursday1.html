<h1>Holy Thursday</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
'Twas on a holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,<br/>
The children walking two and two, in red, and blue, and green:<br/>
Grey-headed beadles walked before, with wands as white as snow,<br/>
Till into the high dome of Paul's they like Thames waters flow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O what a multitude they seemed, these flowers of London town!<br/>
Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own.<br/>
The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,<br/>
Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song,<br/>
Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among:<br/>
Beneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor.<br/>
Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.<br/>

<h1>The Little Girl Found</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
All the night in woe<br/>
Lyca's parents go<br/>
Over valleys deep,<br/>
While the deserts weep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Tired and woe-begone,<br/>
Hoarse with making moan,<br/>
Arm in arm, seven days<br/>
They traced the desert ways.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Seven nights they sleep<br/>
Among shadows deep,<br/>
And dream they see their child<br/>
Starved in desert wild.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pale through pathless ways<br/>
The fancied image strays,<br/>
Famished, weeping, weak,<br/>
With hollow piteous shriek.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Rising from unrest,<br/>
The trembling woman pressed<br/>
With feet of weary woe;<br/>
She could no further go.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In his arms he bore<br/>
Her, armed with sorrow sore;<br/>
Till before their way<br/>
A couching lion lay.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Turning back was vain:<br/>
Soon his heavy mane<br/>
Bore them to the ground,<br/>
Then he stalked around,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Smelling to his prey;<br/>
But their fears allay<br/>
When he licks their hands,<br/>
And silent by them stands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
They look upon his eyes,<br/>
Filled with deep surprise;<br/>
And wondering behold<br/>
A spirit armed in gold.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On his head a crown,<br/>
On his shoulders down<br/>
Flowed his golden hair.<br/>
Gone was all their care.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Follow me,' he said;<br/>
'Weep not for the maid;<br/>
In my palace deep,<br/>
Lyca lies asleep.'<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then they follow√®d<br/>
Where the vision led,<br/>
And saw their sleeping child<br/>
Among tigers wild.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To this day they dwell<br/>
In a lonely dell,<br/>
Nor fear the wolvish howl<br/>
Nor the lion's growl.<br/>

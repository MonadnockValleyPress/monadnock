<h1>The Angel</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean?<br/>
And that I was a maiden Queen<br/>
Guarded by an Angel mild:<br/>
Witless woe was ne'er beguiled!<br/>
</p>
<p>
And I wept both night and day,<br/>
And he wiped my tears away;<br/>
And I wept both day and night,<br/>
And hid from him my heart's delight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So he took his wings, and fled;<br/>
Then the morn blushed rosy red.<br/>
I dried my tears, and armed my fears<br/>
With ten thousand shields and spears.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Soon my Angel came again;<br/>
I was armed, he came in vain;<br/>
For the time of youth was fled,<br/>
And grey hairs were on my head.<br/>

<h1>The Little Black Boy</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
My mother bore me in the southern wild,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am black, but O my soul is white!<br/>
White as an angel is the English child,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am black, as if bereaved of light.
</p>
<p>
My mother taught me underneath a tree,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, sitting down before the heat of day,<br/>
She took me on her lap and kissèd me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, pointing to the East, began to say:
</p>
<p>
'Look on the rising sun: there God does live,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gives His light, and gives His heat away,<br/>
And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.
</p>
<p>
'And we are put on earth a little space,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we may learn to bear the beams of love;<br/>
And these black bodies and this sunburnt face<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are but a cloud, and like a shady grove.
</p>
<p>
'For, when our souls have learned the heat to bear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,<br/>
Saying, “Come out from the grove, my love and care,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.”'
</p>
<p>
Thus did my mother say, and kissed me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus I say to little English boy.<br/>
When I from black, and he from white cloud free,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And round the tent of God like lambs we joy,
</p>
<p>
I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;<br/>
And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be like him, and he will then love me.

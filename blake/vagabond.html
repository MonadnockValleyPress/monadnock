<h1>The Little Vagabond</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
Dear mother, dear mother, the Church is cold;<br/>
But the Alehouse is healthy, and pleasant, and warm.<br/>
Besides, I can tell where I am used well;<br/>
Such usage in heaven will never do well.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But, if at the Church they would give us some ale,<br/>
And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,<br/>
We'd sing and we'd pray all the livelong day,<br/>
Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing,<br/>
And we'd be as happy as birds in the spring;<br/>
And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,<br/>
Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And God, like a father, rejoicing to see<br/>
His children as pleasant and happy as He,<br/>
Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel,<br/>
But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.<br/>

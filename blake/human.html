<h1>The Human Abstract</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
Pity would be no more<br/>
If we did not make somebody poor,<br/>
And Mercy no more could be<br/>
If all were as happy as we.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And mutual fear brings Peace,<br/>
Till the selfish loves increase;<br/>
Then Cruelty knits a snare,<br/>
And spreads his baits with care.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He sits down with holy fears,<br/>
And waters the ground with tears;<br/>
Then Humility takes its root<br/>
Underneath his foot.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Soon spreads the dismal shade<br/>
Of Mystery over his head,<br/>
And the caterpillar and fly<br/>
Feed on the Mystery.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And it bears the fruit of Deceit,<br/>
Ruddy and sweet to eat,<br/>
And the raven his nest has made<br/>
In its thickest shade.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The gods of the earth and sea<br/>
Sought through nature to find this tree,<br/>
But their search was all in vain:<br/>
There grows one in the human Brain.<br/>

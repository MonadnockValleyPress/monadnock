<h1>A Poison Tree</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
I was angry with my friend:<br/>
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.<br/>
I was angry with my foe:<br/>
I told it not, my wrath did grow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And I watered it in fears<br/>
Night and morning with my tears,<br/>
And I sunn√®d it with smiles<br/>
And with soft deceitful wiles.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And it grew both day and night,<br/>
Till it bore an apple bright,<br/>
And my foe beheld it shine,<br/>
And he knew that it was mine,&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
And into my garden stole<br/>
When the night had veiled the pole;<br/>
In the morning, glad, I see<br/>
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.<br/>

<h1>A Little Girl Lost</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
Children of the future age,<br/>
Reading this indignant page,<br/>
Know that in a former time<br/>
Love, sweet love, was thought a crime.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In the age of gold,<br/>
Free from winter's cold,<br/>
Youth and maiden bright,<br/>
To the holy light,<br/>
Naked in the sunny beams' delight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once a youthful pair,<br/>
Filled with softest care,<br/>
Met in garden bright<br/>
Where the holy light<br/>
Had just removed the curtains of the night.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There, in rising day,<br/>
On the grass they play;<br/>
Parents were afar,<br/>
Strangers came not near,<br/>
And the maiden soon forgot her fear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Tired with kisses sweet,<br/>
They agree to meet<br/>
When the silent sleep<br/>
Waves o'er heaven's deep,<br/>
And the weary tired wanderers weep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To her father white<br/>
Came the maiden bright;<br/>
But his loving look,<br/>
Like the holy book,<br/>
All her tender limbs with terror shook.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Ona, pale and weak,<br/>
To thy father speak!<br/>
O the trembling fear!<br/>
O the dismal care<br/>
That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair!'<br/>

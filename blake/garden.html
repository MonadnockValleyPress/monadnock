<h1>The Garden of Love</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
I went to the Garden of Love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw what I never had seen;<br/>
A Chapel was built in the midst,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I used to play on the green.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the gates of this Chapel were shut,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'Thou shalt not' writ over the door;<br/>
So I turned to the Garden of Love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That so many sweet flowers bore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And I saw it was filled with graves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tombstones where flowers should be;<br/>
And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And binding with briars my joys and desires.<br/>

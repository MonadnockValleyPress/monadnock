<h1>A Little Boy Lost</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
'Nought loves another as itself,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor venerates another so,<br/>
Nor is it possible to thought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greater than itself to know.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And, father, how can I love you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or any of my brothers more?<br/>
I love you like the little bird<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That picks up crumbs around the door.'<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Priest sat by and heard the child;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In trembling zeal he seized his hair,<br/>
He led him by his little coat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all admired his priestly care.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And standing on the altar high,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Lo, what a fiend is here!' said he:<br/>
'One who sets reason up for judge<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our most holy mystery.'<br/>
</p>
<p>
The weeping child could not be heard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weeping parents wept in vain:<br/>
They stripped him to his little shirt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bound him in an iron chain,<br/>
</p>
<p>
And burned him in a holy place<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where many had been burned before;<br/>
The weeping parents wept in vain.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are such things done on Albion's shore?<br/>

<h1>Night</h1>
<h2>by William Blake</h2>
<p>
The sun descending in the West,<br/>
The evening star does shine;<br/>
The birds are silent in their nest,<br/>
And I must seek for mine.<br/>
The moon, like a flower<br/>
In heaven's high bower,<br/>
With silent delight,<br/>
Sits and smiles on the night.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Farewell, green fields and happy groves,<br/>
Where flocks have took delight,<br/>
Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves<br/>
The feet of angels bright;<br/>
Unseen, they pour blessing,<br/>
And joy without ceasing,<br/>
On each bud and blossom,<br/>
And each sleeping bosom.<br/>
</p>
<p>
They look in every thoughtless nest<br/>
Where birds are covered warm;<br/>
They visit caves of every beast,<br/>
To keep them all from harm:<br/>
If they see any weeping<br/>
That should have been sleeping,<br/>
They pour sleep on their head,<br/>
And sit down by their bed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When wolves and tigers howl for prey,<br/>
They pitying stand and weep;<br/>
Seeking to drive their thirst away,<br/>
And keep them from the sheep.<br/>
But, if they rush dreadful,<br/>
The angels, most heedful,<br/>
Receive each mild spirit,<br/>
New worlds to inherit.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And there the lion's ruddy eyes<br/>
Shall flow with tears of gold:<br/>
And pitying the tender cries,<br/>
And walking round the fold,<br/>
Saying: 'Wrath by His meekness,<br/>
And, by His health, sickness,<br/>
Is driven away<br/>
From our immortal day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And now beside thee, bleating lamb,<br/>
I can lie down and sleep,<br/>
Or think on Him who bore thy name,<br/>
Graze after thee, and weep.<br/>
For, washed in life's river,<br/>
My bright mane for ever<br/>
Shall shine like the gold,<br/>
As I guard o'er the fold.<br/>

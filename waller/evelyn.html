<h1>To His Worthy Friend Master Evelyn, Upon His Translation of Lucretius</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Waller</h2>
<p>
Lucretius, (with a stork-like fate,<br/>
Born, and translated, in a state)<br/>
Comes to proclaim, in English verse,<br/>
No Monarch rules the universe;<br/>
But chance, and atoms, make this All<br/>
In order democratical,<br/>
Where bodies freely run their course,<br/>
Without design, or fate, or force.<br/>
And this in such a strain he sings,<br/>
As if his Muse, with angels' wings,<br/>
Had soar'd beyond our utmost sphere,<br/>
And other worlds discover'd there;<br/>
For his immortal, boundless wit,<br/>
To Nature does no bounds permit,<br/>
But boldly has removed those bars<br/>
Of heaven, and earth, and seas, and stars,<br/>
By which they were before supposed,<br/>
By narrow wits, to be enclosed,<br/>
Till his free Muse threw down the pale,<br/>
And did at once dispark them all.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So vast this argument did seem,<br/>
That the wise author did esteem<br/>
The Roman language (which was spread<br/>
O'er the whole world, in triumph led)<br/>
A tongue too narrow to unfold<br/>
The wonders which he would have told.<br/>
This speaks thy glory, noble friend!<br/>
And British language does commend;<br/>
For here Lucretius whole we find,<br/>
His words, his music, and his mind.<br/>
Thy art has to our country brought<br/>
All that he writ, and all he thought.<br/>
Ovid translated, Virgil too,<br/>
Show'd long since what our tongue could do;<br/>
Nor Lucan we, nor Horace spared;<br/>
Only Lucretius was too hard.<br/>
Lucretius, like a fort, did stand<br/>
Untouch'd, till your victorious hand<br/>
Did from his head this garland bear,<br/>
Which now upon your own you wear:<br/>
A garland made of such new bays,<br/>
And sought in such untrodden ways,<br/>
As no man's temples e'er did crown,<br/>
Save this great author's, and your own!<br/>

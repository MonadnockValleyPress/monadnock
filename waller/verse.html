<h1>Of English Verse</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Waller</h2>
<p>
Poets may boast, as safely vain,<br/>
Their works shall with the world remain:<br/>
Both, bound together, live or die,<br/>
The verses and the prophecy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But who can hope his line should long<br/>
Last in a daily changing tongue?<br/>
While they are new, envy prevails;<br/>
And as that dies, our language fails.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When architects have done their part,<br/>
The matter may betray their art;<br/>
Time, if we use ill-chosen stone,<br/>
Soon brings a well-built palace down.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Poets that lasting marble seek,<br/>
Must carve in Latin, or in Greek;<br/>
We write in sand, our language grows,<br/>
And like the tide, our work o'erflows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Chaucer his sense can only boast;<br/>
The glory of his numbers lost!<br/>
Years have defaced his matchless strain;<br/>
And yet he did not sing in vain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The beauties which adorn'd that age,<br/>
The shining subjects of his rage,<br/>
Hoping they should immortal prove,<br/>
Rewarded with success his love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This was the gen'rous poet's scope;<br/>
And all an English pen can hope,<br/>
To make the fair approve his flame,<br/>
That can so far extend their fame.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Verse, thus design'd, has no ill fate,<br/>
If it arrive but at the date<br/>
Of fading beauty; if it prove<br/>
But as long-lived as present love.<br/>

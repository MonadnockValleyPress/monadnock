<h1>Upon Ben Jonson</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Waller</h2>
<p>
Mirror of poets! mirror of our age!<br/>
Which her whole face beholding on thy stage,<br/>
Pleased and displeased with her own faults, endures<br/>
A remedy like those whom music cures.<br/>
Thou hast alone those various inclinations<br/>
Which Nature gives to ages, sexes, nations;<br/>
So trac√®d with thy all-resembling pen,<br/>
That whate'er custom has imposed on men,<br/>
Or ill-got habit (which deforms them so,<br/>
That scarce a brother can his brother know)<br/>
Is represented to the wond'ring eyes<br/>
Of all that see, or read, thy comedies.<br/>
Whoever in those glasses looks, may find<br/>
The spots return'd, or graces, of his mind;<br/>
And by the help of so divine an art,<br/>
At leisure view, and dress, his nobler part.<br/>
Narcissus, cozen'd by that flatt'ring well,<br/>
Which nothing could but of his beauty tell,<br/>
Had here, discov'ring the deformed estate<br/>
Of his fond mind, preserved himself with hate.<br/>
But virtue too, as well as vice, is clad<br/>
In flesh and blood so well, that Plato had<br/>
Beheld, what his high fancy once embraced,<br/>
Virtue with colours, speech, and motion graced.<br/>
The sundry postures of thy copious Muse<br/>
Who would express, a thousand tongues must use;<br/>
Whose fate's no less peculiar than thy art;<br/>
For as thou couldst all characters impart,<br/>
So none could render thine, which still escapes,<br/>
Like Proteus, in variety of shapes;<br/>
Who was nor this nor that; but all we find,<br/>
And all we can imagine, in mankind.<br/>

<h1>Of My Lady Isabella, Playing on the Lute</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Waller</h2>
<p>
Such moving sounds from such a careless touch!<br/>
So unconcern'd herself, and we so much!<br/>
What art is this, that with so little pains<br/>
Transports us thus, and o'er our spirits reigns?<br/>
The trembling strings about her fingers crowd,<br/>
And tell their joy for every kiss aloud.<br/>
Small force there needs to make them tremble so;<br/>
Touch'd by that hand, who would not tremble too?<br/>
Here Love takes stand, and while she charms the ear,<br/>
Empties his quiver on the list'ning deer.<br/>
Music so softens and disarms the mind,<br/>
That not an arrow does resistance find.<br/>
Thus the fair tyrant celebrates the prize,<br/>
And acts herself the triumph of her eyes:<br/>
So Nero once, with harp in hand, survey'd<br/>
His flaming Rome, and as it burn'd he play'd.<br/>

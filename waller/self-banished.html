<h1>The Self-Banished</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Waller</h2>
<p>
It is not that I love you less,<br/>
Than when before your feet I lay;<br/>
But to prevent the sad increase<br/>
Of hopeless love, I keep away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In vain, alas! for everything<br/>
Which I have known belong to you,<br/>
Your form does to my fancy bring,<br/>
And makes my old wounds bleed anew.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Who in the spring, from the new sun,<br/>
Already has a fever got,<br/>
Too late begins those shafts to shun,<br/>
Which Phoebus through his veins has shot;<br/>
</p>
<p>
Too late he would the pain assuage,<br/>
And to thick shadows does retire;<br/>
About with him he bears the rage,<br/>
And in his tainted blood the fire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But vow'd I have, and never must<br/>
Your banish'd servant trouble you;<br/>
For if I break, you may mistrust<br/>
The vow I made&mdash;to love you too.<br/>
</p>

<h1>Epitaph on the Lady Sedley</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Waller</h2>
<p>
Here lies the learned Savil's heir,<br/>
So early wise, and lasting fair,<br/>
That none, except her years they told,<br/>
Thought her a child, or thought her old.<br/>
All that her father knew or got,<br/>
His art, his wealth, fell to her lot;<br/>
And she so well improved that stock,<br/>
Both of his knowledge and his flock,<br/>
That wit and fortune, reconciled<br/>
In her, upon each other smiled.<br/>
While she to every well-taught mind<br/>
Was so propitiously inclined,<br/>
And gave such title to her store,<br/>
That none, but th'ignorant, were poor.<br/>
The Muses daily found supplies,<br/>
Both from her hands and from her eyes.<br/>
Her bounty did at once engage,<br/>
And matchless beauty warm their rage.<br/>
Such was this dame in calmer days,<br/>
Her nation's ornament and praise!<br/>
But when a storm disturb'd our rest,<br/>
The port and refuge of the oppress'd.<br/>
This made her fortune understood,<br/>
And look'd on as some public good.<br/>
So that (her person and her state,<br/>
Exempted from the common fate)<br/>
In all our civil fury she<br/>
Stood, like a sacred temple, free.<br/>
May here her monument stand so,<br/>
To credit this rude age! and show<br/>
To future times, that even we<br/>
Some patterns did of virtue see;<br/>
And one sublime example had<br/>
Of good, among so many bad.<br/>

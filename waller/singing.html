<h1>To a Lady Singing a Song of His Composing</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Waller</h2>
<p>
Chloris! yourself you so excel,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you vouchsafe to breathe my thought,<br/>
That, like a spirit, with this spell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my own teaching, I am caught.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That eagle's fate and mine are one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, on the shaft that made him die,<br/>
Espied a feather of his own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith he wont to soar so high.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Had Echo, with so sweet a grace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Narcissus' loud complaints return'd,<br/>
Not for reflection of his face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But of his voice, the boy had burn'd.<br/>

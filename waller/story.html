<h1>The Story of Phoebus and Daphne, Applied</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Waller</h2>
<p>
Thyrsis, a youth of the inspir√®d train,<br/>
Fair Saccharissa loved, but loved in vain;<br/>
Like Phoebus sung the no less am'rous boy;<br/>
Like Daphne she, as lovely, and as coy!<br/>
With numbers he the flying nymph pursues,<br/>
With numbers such as Phoebus' self might use!<br/>
Such is the chase when Love and Fancy leads,<br/>
O'er craggy mountains, and through flow'ry meads;<br/>
Invoked to testify the lover's care,<br/>
Or form some image of his cruel fair.<br/>
Urged with his fury, like a wounded deer,<br/>
O'er these he fled; and now approaching near,<br/>
Had reach'd the nymph with his harmonious lay,<br/>
Whom all his charms could not incline to stay.<br/>
Yet what he sung in his immortal strain,<br/>
Though unsuccessful, was not sung in vain;<br/>
All, but the nymph that should redress his wrong,<br/>
Attend his passion, and approve his song.<br/>
Like Phoebus thus, acquiring unsought praise,<br/>
He catch'd at love, and fill'd his arms with bays.<br/>

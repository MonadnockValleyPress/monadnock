<h1>Of the Last Verses in the Book</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Waller</h2>
<p>
When we for age could neither read nor write,<br/>
The subject made us able to indite;<br/>
The soul, with nobler resolutions deck'd,<br/>
The body stooping, does herself erect.<br/>
No mortal parts are requisite to raise<br/>
Her that, unbodied, can her Maker praise.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The seas are quiet when the winds give o'er;<br/>
So, calm are we when passions are no more!<br/>
For then we know how vain it was to boast<br/>
Of fleeting things, so certain to be lost.<br/>
Clouds of affection from our younger eyes<br/>
Conceal that emptiness which age descries.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,<br/>
Lets in new light through chinks that time has made;<br/>
Stronger by weakness, wiser men become,<br/>
As they draw near to their eternal home.<br/>
Leaving the old, both worlds at once they view,<br/>
That stand upon the threshold of the new.<br/>

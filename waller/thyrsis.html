<h1>Thyrsis and Galatea</h1>
<h2>by Edmund Waller</h2>
<h4>THYRSIS.</h4>
<p>
As lately I on silver Thames did ride,<br/>
Sad Galatea on the bank I spied;<br/>
Such was her look as sorrow taught to shine,<br/>
And thus she graced me with a voice divine.<br/>
</p>
<h4>GALATEA.</h4>
<p>
You that can tune your sounding strings so well,<br/>
Of ladies' beauties, and of love to tell,<br/>
Once change your note, and let your lute report<br/>
The justest grief that ever touch'd the Court.<br/>
</p>
<h4>THYRSIS.</h4>
<p>
Fair nymph! I have in your delights no share,<br/>
Nor ought to be concerned in your care;<br/>
Yet would I sing if I your sorrows knew,<br/>
And to my aid invoke no Muse but you.<br/>
</p>
<h4>GALATEA.</h4>
<p>
Hear then, and let your song augment our grief,<br/>
Which is so great as not to wish relief.<br/>
She that had all which Nature gives, or Chance,<br/>
Whom Fortune join'd with Virtue to advance<br/>
To all the joys this island could afford,<br/>
The greatest mistress, and the kindest lord;<br/>
Who with the royal mix'd her noble blood,<br/>
And in high grace with Gloriana stood;<br/>
Her bounty, sweetness, beauty, goodness, such,<br/>
That none e'er thought her happiness too much;<br/>
So well-inclined her favours to confer,<br/>
And kind to all, as Heaven had been to her!<br/>
The virgin's part, the mother, and the wife,<br/>
So well she acted in this span of life,<br/>
That though few years (too flew, alas!) she told,<br/>
She seem'd in all things, but in beauty, old.<br/>
As unripe fruit, whose verdant stalks do cleave<br/>
Close to the tree, which grieves no less to leave<br/>
The smiling pendant which adorns her so,<br/>
And until autumn on the bough should grow;<br/>
So seem'd her youthful soul not eas'ly forced,<br/>
Or from so fair, so sweet a seat divorced.<br/>
Her fate at once did hasty seem and slow;<br/>
At once too cruel, and unwilling too.<br/>
</p>
<h4>THYRSIS.</h4>
<p>
Under how hard a law are mortals born!<br/>
Whom now we envy, we anon must mourn;<br/>
What Heaven sets highest, and seems most to prize,<br/>
Is soon removed from our wond'ring eyes!<br/>
But since the Sisters did so soon untwine<br/>
So fair a thread, I'll strive to piece the line.<br/>
Vouchsafe, sad nymph! to let me know the dame,<br/>
And to the Muses I'll commend her name;<br/>
Make the wide country echo to your moan,<br/>
The list'ning trees and savage mountains groan.<br/>
What rock's not mov√®d when the death is sung<br/>
Of one so good, so lovely, and so young?<br/>
</p>
<h4>GALATEA.</h4>
<p>
'Twas Hamilton!&mdash;whom I had named before,<br/>
But naming her, grief lets me say no more.<br/>

<h1>On My First Daughter</h1>
<h2>by Ben Jonson</h2>
<p>
Here lies, to each her parents' ruth,<br/>
Mary, the daughter of their youth;<br/>
Yet, all heaven's gifts, being heaven's due,<br/>
It makes the father less to rue.<br/>
At six months' end, she parted hence,<br/>
With safety of her innocence;<br/>
Whose soul heaven's queen, whose name she bears,<br/>
In comfort of her mother's tears,<br/>
Hath placed amongst her virgin-train;<br/>
Where, while that severed doth remain,<br/>
This grave partakes the fleshly birth;<br/>
Which cover lightly, gentle earth!

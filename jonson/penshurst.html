<h1>To Penshurst</h1>
<h2>by Ben Jonson</h2>
<p>
Thou art not, Penshurst, built to envious show,<br/>
Of touch or marble; nor canst boast a row<br/>
Of polished pillars, or a roof of gold;<br/>
Thou hast no lantern, whereof tales are told,<br/>
Or stair, or courts; but stand'st an ancient pile,<br/>
And, these grudged at, art reverenced the while.<br/>
Thou joy'st in better marks, of soil, of air,<br/>
Of wood, of water; therein thou art fair.<br/>
Thou hast thy walks for health, as well as sport;<br/>
Thy mount, to which the dryads do resort,<br/>
Where Pan and Bacchus their high feasts have made,<br/>
Beneath the broad beech and the chestnut shade;<br/>
That taller tree, which of a nut was set<br/>
At his great birth where all the Muses met.<br/>
There in the writh√®d bark are cut the names<br/>
Of many a sylvan, taken with his flames;<br/>
And thence the ruddy satyrs oft provoke<br/>
The lighter fauns to reach thy Lady's Oak.<br/>
Thy copse too, named of Gamage, thou hast there,<br/>
That never fails to serve thee seasoned deer<br/>
When thou wouldst feast or exercise thy friends.<br/>
The lower land, that to the river bends,<br/>
Thy sheep, thy bullocks, kine, and calves do feed;<br/>
The middle grounds thy mares and horses breed.<br/>
Each bank doth yield thee conies; and the tops,<br/>
Fertile of wood, Ashore and Sidney's copse,<br/>
To crown thy open table, doth provide<br/>
The purpled pheasant with the speckled side;<br/>
The painted partridge lies in every field,<br/>
And for thy mess is willing to be killed.<br/>
And if the high-swollen Medway fail thy dish,<br/>
Thou hast thy ponds, that pay thee tribute fish,<br/>
Fat aged carps that run into thy net,<br/>
And pikes, now weary their own kind to eat,<br/>
As loath the second draught or cast to stay,<br/>
Officiously at first themselves betray;<br/>
Bright eels that emulate them, and leap on land<br/>
Before the fisher, or into his hand.<br/>
Then hath thy orchard fruit, thy garden flowers,<br/>
Fresh as the air, and new as are the hours.<br/>
The early cherry, with the later plum,<br/>
Fig, grape, and quince, each in his time doth come;<br/>
The blushing apricot and woolly peach<br/>
Hang on thy walls, that every child may reach.<br/>
And though thy walls be of the country stone,<br/>
They're reared with no man's ruin, no man's groan;<br/>
There's none that dwell about them wish them down;<br/>
But all come in, the farmer and the clown,<br/>
And no one empty-handed, to salute<br/>
Thy lord and lady, though they have no suit.<br/>
Some bring a capon, some a rural cake,<br/>
Some nuts, some apples; some that think they make<br/>
The better cheeses bring them, or else send<br/>
By their ripe daughters, whom they would commend<br/>
This way to husbands, and whose baskets bear<br/>
An emblem of themselves in plum or pear.<br/>
But what can this (more than express their love)<br/>
Add to thy free provisions, far above<br/>
The need of such? whose liberal board doth flow<br/>
With all that hospitality doth know;<br/>
Where comes no guest but is allowed to eat,<br/>
Without his fear, and of thy lord's own meat;<br/>
Where the same beer and bread, and selfsame wine,<br/>
This is his lordship's shall be also mine,<br/>
And I not fain to sit (as some this day<br/>
At great men's tables), and yet dine away.<br/>
Here no man tells my cups; nor, standing by,<br/>
A waiter doth my gluttony envy,<br/>
But gives me what I call, and lets me eat;<br/>
He knows below he shall find plenty of meat.<br/>
The tables hoard not up for the next day;<br/>
Nor, when I take my lodging, need I pray<br/>
For fire, or lights, or livery; all is there,<br/>
As if thou then wert mine, or I reigned here:<br/>
There's nothing I can wish, for which I stay.<br/>
That found King James when, hunting late this way<br/>
With his brave son, the prince, they saw thy fires<br/>
Shine bright on every hearth, as the desires<br/>
Of thy Penates had been set on flame<br/>
To entertain them; or the country came<br/>
With all their zeal to warm their welcome here.<br/>
What (great I will not say, but) sudden cheer<br/>
Didst thou then make 'em! and what praise was heaped<br/>
On thy good lady then, who therein reaped<br/>
The just reward of her high housewifery;<br/>
To have her linen, plate, and all things nigh,<br/>
When she was far; and not a room but dressed<br/>
As if it had expected such a guest!<br/>
These, Penshurst, are thy praise, and yet not all.<br/>
Thy lady's noble, fruitful, chaste withal.<br/>
His children thy great lord may call his own,<br/>
A fortune in this age but rarely known.<br/>
They are, and have been, taught religion; thence<br/>
Their gentler spirits have sucked innocence.<br/>
Each morn and even they are taught to pray,<br/>
With the whole household, and may, every day,<br/>
Read in their virtuous parents' noble parts<br/>
The mysteries of manners, arms, and arts.<br/>
Now, Penshurst, they that will proportion thee<br/>
With other edifices, when they see<br/>
Those proud, ambitious heaps, and nothing else,<br/>
May say their lords have built, but thy lord dwells.

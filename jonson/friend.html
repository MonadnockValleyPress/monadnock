<h1>Inviting a Friend to Supper</h1>
<h2>by Ben Jonson</h2>
<p>
To-night, grave sir, both my poor house and I<br/>
Do equally desire your company;<br/>
Not that we think us worthy such a guest,<br/>
But that your worth will dignify our feast,<br/>
With those that come; whose grace may make that seem<br/>
Something, which else could hope for no esteem.<br/>
It is the fair acceptance, sir, creates<br/>
The entertainment perfect, not the cates.<br/>
Yet shall you have, to rectify your palate,<br/>
An olive, capers, or some bitter salad<br/>
Ushering the mutton; with a short-legged hen,<br/>
If we can get her, full of eggs, and then,<br/>
Lemons and wine for sauce: to these, a coney<br/>
Is not to be despaired of for our money;<br/>
And though fowl now be scarce, yet there are clerks,<br/>
The sky not falling, think we may have larks.<br/>
I'll tell you of more, and lie, so you will come:<br/>
Of partridge, pheasant, woodcock, of which some<br/>
May yet be there; and godwit if we can;<br/>
Knat, rail, and ruff, too. Howsoe'er, my man<br/>
Shall read a piece of Virgil, Tacitus,<br/>
Livy, or of some better book to us,<br/>
Of which we'll speak our minds, amidst our meat;<br/>
And I'll profess no verses to repeat:<br/>
To this if aught appear, which I not know of,<br/>
That will the pastry, not my paper, show of.<br/>
Digestive cheese, and fruit there sure will be;<br/>
But that which most doth take my muse and me,<br/>
Is a pure cup of rich canary wine,<br/>
Which is the Mermaid's now, but shall be mine:<br/>
Of which had Horace, or Anacreon tasted,<br/>
Their lives, as do their lines, till now had lasted.<br/>
Tobacco, nectar, or the Thespian spring,<br/>
Are all but Luther's beer, to this I sing.<br/>
Of this we will sup free, but moderately,<br/>
And we will have no Pooly' or Parrot by;<br/>
Nor shall our cups make any guilty men;<br/>
But at our parting we will be as when<br/>
We innocently met. No simple word<br/>
That shall be uttered at our mirthful board,<br/>
Shall make us sad next morning; or affright<br/>
The liberty that we'll enjoy to-night.

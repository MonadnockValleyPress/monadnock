<h1>An Elegy</h1>
<h2>by Ben Jonson</h2>
<p>
Though beauty be the mark of praise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yours, of whom I sing, be such<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As not the world can praise too much,<br/>
Yet is 't your virtue now I raise.
</p>
<p>
A virtue, like allay, so gone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout your form, as though that move,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And draw, and conquer all men's love,<br/>
This subjects you to love of one,
</p>
<p>
Wherein you triumph yet: because<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis of yourself, and that you use<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noblest freedom, not to choose<br/>
Against or faith, or honour's laws.
</p>
<p>
But who could less expect from you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In whom alone Love lives again?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By whom he is restored to men;<br/>
And kept, and bred, and brought up true?
</p>
<p>
His falling temples you have reared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The withered garlands ta'en away;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His altars kept from the decay<br/>
That envy wished, and nature feared;
</p>
<p>
And on them burns so chaste a flame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With so much loyalty's expense,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Love, t' acquit such excellence,<br/>
Is gone himself into your name.
</p>
<p>
And you are he: the deity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom all lovers are designed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would their better objects find;<br/>
Among which faithful troop am I;
</p>
<p>
Who, as an offering at your shrine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have sung this hymn, and here entreat<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One spark of your diviner heat<br/>
To light upon a love of mine;
</p>
<p>
Which, if it kindle not, but scant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appear, and that to shortest view,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet give me leave t' adore in you<br/>
What I, in her, am grieved to want.

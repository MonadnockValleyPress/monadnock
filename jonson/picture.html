<h1>My Picture Left in Scotland</h1>
<h2>by Ben Jonson</h2>
<p>
I now think Love is rather deaf than blind,<br/>
For else it could not be<br/>
That she,<br/>
Whom I adore so much, should so slight me<br/>
And cast my love behind.<br/>
I'm sure my language to her was as sweet,<br/>
And every close did meet<br/>
In sentence of as subtle feet,<br/>
As hath the youngest He<br/>
That sits in shadow of Apollo's tree.
</p>
<p>
O, but my conscious fears,<br/>
That fly my thoughts between,<br/>
Tell me that she hath seen<br/>
My hundred of gray hairs,<br/>
Told seven and forty years<br/>
Read so much waste, as she cannot embrace<br/>
My mountain belly and my rocky face;<br/>
And all these through her eyes have stopp'd her ears.

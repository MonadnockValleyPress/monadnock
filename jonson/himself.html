<h1>An Ode to Himself</h1>
<h2>by Ben Jonson</h2>
<p>
Come leave the loathéd stage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the more loathsome age,
Where pride and impudence in faction knit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usurp the chair of wit,
Indicting and arraigning, every day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something they call a play.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let their fastidious, vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commission of the brain
Run on, and rage, sweat, censure, and condemn:
They were not made for thee, less thou for them.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say that thou pour'st 'em wheat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they would acorns eat;
‘Twere simple fury, still thyself to waste
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On such as have no taste;
To offer them a surfeit of pure bread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose appetites are dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, give them grains their fill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Husks, draff to drink, and swill;
If they love lees, and leave the lusty wine,
Envy them not, their palate's with the swine.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt a moldy tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Pericles, and stale
As the shrive's crusts, and nasty as his fish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scraps out of every dish
Thrown forth, and raked into the common tub,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May keep up the Play Club.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broome's sweepings do as well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There as his master's meal;
For who the relish of these guests will fit
Needs set them but the alms-basket of wit.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And much good do't ye then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brave plush and velvet men
Can feed on orts, and safe in your scene clothes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dare quit upon your oaths
The stagers, and the stage-wrights too (your peers)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of stuffing your large ears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rage of comic socks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrought upon twenty blocks;
Which, if they're torn, and foul, and patched enough,
The gamesters share your guilt, and you their stuff.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave things so prostitute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And take th'Alcaic lute;
Or thine own Horace, or Anacreon's lyre;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warm thee by Pindar's fire;
And though thy nerves be shrunk, and blood be cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere years have made thee old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike that disdainful heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout, to their defeat;
As curious fools, and envious of thy stain,
May, blushing, swear no palsy's in thy brain.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when they hear thee sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glories of thy King,
His zeal to God, and his just awe of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They may be blood-shaken, then
Feel such a flesh-quake to possess their powers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That no tuned harp like ours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sound of peace or wars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall truly hit the stars
When they shall read the acts of Charles his reign,
And see his chariot triumph 'bove his wain.

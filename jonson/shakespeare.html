<h1>To the memory of my beloved, The AUTHOR Mr. William Shakespeare: And what he hath left us</h1>
<h2>by Ben Jonson</h2>
<p>
To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,<br/>
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;<br/>
While I confess thy writings to be such,<br/>
As neither man, nor muse can praise too much.<br/>
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage.  But these ways<br/>
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;<br/>
For silliest ignorance on these may light,<br/>
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;<br/>
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance<br/>
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;<br/>
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,<br/>
And think to ruin, where it seemed to raise.<br/>
These are, as some infamous bawd, or whore,<br/>
Should praise a matron; what would hurt her more?<br/>
But thou art proof against them, and, indeed,<br/>
Above the ill-fortune of them, or the need.<br/>
I, therefore, will begin: Soul of the age!<br/>
The applause! delight! and wonder of our stage!<br/>
My Shakespeare rise!  I will not lodge thee by<br/>
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie<br/>
A little further off, to make thee room:<br/>
Thou art a monument without a tomb,<br/>
And art alive still, while thy book doth live<br/>
And we have wits to read, and praise to give.<br/>
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,<br/>
I mean with great, but disproportioned Muses;<br/>
For if I thought my judgment were of years,<br/>
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,<br/>
And tell how far thou didst our Lily outshine,<br/>
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlow's mighty line.<br/>
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,<br/>
From thence to honour thee, I will not seek<br/>
For names: but call forth thundering Eschylus,<br/>
Euripides, and Sophocles to us,<br/>
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordoua dead,<br/>
To live again, to hear thy buskin tread,<br/>
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,<br/>
Leave thee alone for the comparison<br/>
Of all that insolent Greece, or haughty Rome<br/>
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.<br/>
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show,<br/>
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.<br/>
He was not of an age, but for all time!<br/>
And all the Muses still were in their prime,<br/>
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm<br/>
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!<br/>
Nature herself was proud of his designs,<br/>
And joyed to wear the dressing of his lines!<br/>
Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit,<br/>
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit.<br/>
The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes,<br/>
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please;<br/>
But antiquated and deserted lie,<br/>
As they were not of nature's family.<br/>
Yet must I not give nature all; thy art,<br/>
My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.<br/>
For though the poet's matter nature be,<br/>
His heart doth give the fashion: and, that he<br/>
Who casts to write a living line, must sweat,<br/>
(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat<br/>
Upon the Muse's anvil; turn the same,<br/>
And himself with it, that he thinks to frame;<br/>
Or for the laurel, he may gain a scorn;<br/>
For a good poet's made, as well as born.<br/>
And such wert thou!  Look how the father's face<br/>
Lives in his issue, even so the race<br/>
Of Shakespeare's mind and manners brightly shines<br/>
In his well-turnèd, and true filèd lines;<br/>
In each of which he seems to shake a lance,<br/>
As brandished at the eyes of ignorance.<br/>
Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were<br/>
To see thee in our water yet appear,<br/>
And make those flights upon the banks of Thames,<br/>
That so did take Eliza, and our James!<br/>
But stay, I see thee in the hemisphere<br/>
Advanced, and made a constellation there!<br/>
Shine forth, thou star of poets, and with rage,<br/>
Or influence, chide, or cheer the drooping stage,<br/>
Which, since thy flight from hence, hath mourned like night,<br/>
And despairs day, but for thy volume's light.

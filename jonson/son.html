<h1>On My First Son</h1>
<h2>by Ben Jonson</h2>
<p>
Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;<br/>
My sin was too much hope of thee, loved boy;<br/>
Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay,<br/>
Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.<br/>
Oh! could I lose all father, now! for why,<br/>
Will man lament the state he should envy?<br/>
To have so soon 'scaped world's, and flesh's rage,<br/>
And, if no other misery, yet age!<br/>
Rest in soft peace, and, asked, say here doth lie<br/>
Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry;<br/>
For whose sake, henceforth, all his vows be such,<br/>
As what he loves may never like too much.

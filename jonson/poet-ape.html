<h1>On Poet-Ape</h1>
<h2>by Ben Jonson</h2>
<p>
Poore Poet-Ape, that would be thought our chiefe,<br/>
Whose works are eene the fripperie of wit,<br/>
From brockage is become so bold a thiefe,<br/>
As we, the rob’d, leave rage, and pittie it.<br/>
At first he makes low shifts, would picke and gleane,<br/>
Buy the reversion of old playes; now growne<br/>
To a little wealth, and credit in the scene,<br/>
He takes up all, makes each man’s wit his own.<br/>
And told of this, he slights it. Tut, such crimes,<br/>
The sluggish gaping auditor devoures;<br/>
He markes not whose twas first; and after-times<br/>
May judge it to be his, as well as ours.<br/>
Foole, as if halfe eyes will not know the fleece<br/>
From locks of wool, or shreds from the whole piece.

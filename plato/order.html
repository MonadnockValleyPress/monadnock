<h1>The Dramatic Order of Plato's Dialogues</h1>
<p>What's the best order in which to read the dialogues of Plato? Scholars have debated this question for centuries (starting with Thrasyllus in ancient times) and it is unlikely that we'll ever have a definitive answer. However, Catherine Zuckert (<cite>Plato's Philosophers</cite>) and Debra Nails (<cite>The People of Plato</cite>) make a compelling case for honoring not the order in which Plato wrote the dialogues but their dramatic order, focused on the central character of Socrates and ending with his death in 399 BCE. The most thorough research on the dramatic order of the dialogues has been performed by <a href='https://cambridge.academia.edu/ChristopherPlaneaux'>Christopher Planeaux</a>, whose work I lean on heavily in what follows.</p>
<h2>Laws and Epinomis (~460 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='laws.html'>Laws</a> and <a href='epinomis.html'>Epinomis</a> ("after-laws") are set in Crete (not Athens) and are the only two dialogues that do not involve Socrates. Because Plato wrote these toward the end of his life, some scholars argue that they should be read last &mdash; even, bizarrely, that the Athenian Stranger is Socrates in the afterlife. Internal evidence points to a date around 460 BCE, when Socrates was ~8 years old. Thus these dialogues form something of a preface to Socrates.</p>
<h2>Parmenides (450 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='parmenides.html'>Parmenides</a> takes place during a Greater Panathenaea festival (held in June every fourth year), most likely the one in 450 BCE. Parmenides himself is portrayed as around 65 years old (he is thought to have been born around 515 BCE) and Socrates is portrayed as a very young man (he was born in May of 468 BCE, so in June of 450 BCE he would have just "reached the 19th year" as the Athenians said).</p>
<h2>Protagoras (~434 BCE)</h2>
<p>Alcibiades (born around 450 BCE) is said to have just grown a beard at the time of the <a href='protagoras.html'>Protagoras</a>, so a date around 434 BCE is reasonable.</p>
<h2>First Alcibiades (432 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the <a href='alcibiades.html'>First Alcibiades</a>, Alcibiades has just finished his military training at the age of 20, and he and Socrates are about to be shipped off to the siege at Potidaea.</p>
<h2>Charmides (429 BCE)</h2>
<p>The night before the <a href='charmides.html'>Charmides</a>, Socrates returned to Athens from the defeat of the Athenian army at the siege of Potidaea; this happened in late May of 429 BCE.</p>
<h2>Republic (429 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='republic.html'>Republic</a> begins with a recounting of the first Athenian celebration of the festival of the Thracian goddess Bendis, which occurred in June of 429 BCE. Despite the frequent claim that this greatest of Plato's dialogues is set in 411 BCE (repeated by Catherine Zuckert), Christopher Planeaux presents a convincing case that 429 BCE makes more sense (see his paper "Socrates, Bendis, and Cephalus: Does Plato's Republic Have an Historical Setting?").</p>
<h2>Laches (~424 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='laches.html'>Laches</a> happens after the Battle of Delium in 424 BCE (referred to in the dialogue) and before 418 BCE (the year in which Nicias died); Nails, Zuckert, and Planeaux all date it to 424 or 423 BCE.</p>
<h2>Lysis (~421 BCE)</h2>
<p>Menexenus (see below) is in his early teens in the <a href='lysis.html'>Lysis</a>, whereas in his namesake dialogue (in 401/400 BCE) he is in his early thirties; thus Christopher Planeaux argues for a date of 421 BCE. The dialogue takes place on the festival of the dead, i.e., the third day ("Chytroi") of Anthesteria in late winter / early spring.</p>
<h2>Minos (~421 BCE?)</h2>
<p>The <a href='minos.html'>Minos</a> is perhaps a precursor to the <a href='timaeus.html'>Timaeus</a>, but there is no internal evidence from within the dialogue, so a date of 421 BCE is speculative.</p>
<h2>Timaeus and Critias (~421 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='timaeus.html'>Timaeus</a> (which continues into the <a href='critias.html'>Critias</a>) is often thought to take place right after the <a href='republic.html'>Republic</a> in 429 BCE because it mentions a discussion of the ideal city as having happened the day before. However, Christopher Planeaux argues for a date of 421 BCE, which would comport with considering the character Critias to be the grandfather of the more famous Critias of the Thirty Tyrants (who lived c. 460-403 BCE) and with the internal evidence of the dialogue <a href='critias.html'>Critias</a> (in which Critias's great-grandfather Dropides heard the story of Atlantis from Solon, who lived c. 630-560 BCE).</p>
<h2>Hippias Major and Hippias Minor (~420 BCE)</h2>
<p>Because the sophist Hippias was from Elis, which was allied with Sparta during the Pelopennesian War, it's plausible that he was unable to visit Athens until the Peace of Nicias from 421 to 418 BCE; therefore a date around 420 BCE seems appropriate for both the <a href='hippias-major.html'>Hippias Major</a> and <a href='hippias-minor.html'>Hippias Minor</a>.</p>
<h2>Symposium (416 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='symposium.html'>Symposium</a> takes place two nights after the playwright Agathon won a prize with his first tragedy, which happened in 416 BCE (but see below on the date of the retelling).</p>
<h2>Hipparchus (415 BCE)</h2>
<p>Why all this talk about Hipparchus (an Athenian "tyrant" who was assassinated in 514 BCE) and the statues of Hermes that he had set up throughout Athens and the rest of Attica? It seems likely that the <a href='hipparchus.html'>Hipparchus</a> can be dated to 415 BCE, after the desecration of these statues right before the Sicilian Expedition during the Pelopennesian War.</p>
<h2>Ion (414 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='ion.html'>Ion</a> is set during or after the Sicilian Expedition of 415-413 BCE (when the Athenians were desperate for military leaders &mdash; notice the banter about rhapsodes being good generals) and before the Ionian revolt of 412 BCE (since Ion's home city of Ephesus is described as still under Athenian rule). A date in the spring of 414 BCE is most likely, given that Socrates mentions the upcoming Great Panathenaea to be held in June of 414 BCE.</p>
<h2>Erastai (412/411 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='erastai.html'>Erastai</a> (also known as "The Rival Lovers") is set in the school of the poet and orator Dionysius Chalcus, who helped to found the Athenian colony of Thurii in 443 BCE and likely returned to Athens along with the rest of the colonists in 412 or 411 BCE.</p>
<h2>Euthydemus (412/411 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='euthydemus.html'>Euthydemus</a> takes place soon after the brothers Euthydemus and Dionysodorus arrived in Athens along with the other exiles from Thurii in 412 or 411 BCE. (Christopher Planeaux argues for a dramatic date of 418 BCE, but I don't see how to square that with the expulsion from Thurii.)</p>
<h2>Clitophon (412/411 BCE)</h2>
<p>Christopher Planeaux (in the abovementioned article) argues that the <a href='clitophon.html'>Clitophon</a> takes place after Lysias returned to Athens from Thurii in 412 or 411 BCE.</p>
<h2>Theages (~409 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='theages.html'>Theages</a> takes place after the general Thrasyllos left Athens to lead a military campaign in Ionia (mentioned in the dialogue), which happened in 409 or 408 BCE. Note that the Theages character in this dialogue is different from the one in the <a href='republic.html'>Republic</a>.</p>
<h2>Second Alcibiades (407/406 BCE)</h2>
<p>One clue to the dramatic date of the <a href='alcibiades2.html'>Second Alcibiades</a> is the quote at the end from <cite>The Phoenician Women</cite> by Euripides, which was performed in 409 BCE. Therefore the dialogue must be set after the return of Alcibiades to Athens in May or June of 407 BCE and before he set out for the Battle of Notium (never to return to Athens) in 406 BCE. The <a href='alcibiades.html'>First Alcibiades</a> and <a href='alcibiades2.html'>Second Alcibiades</a> therefore serve as bookends on the Athenian political career of Alcibiades himself.</p>
<h2>Gorgias (405 BCE)</h2>
<p>Although the sophist Gorgias is known to have first visited Athens in 427 BCE, the <a href='gorgias.html'>Gorgias</a> is set in 405 BCE, the year after Socrates served on the presiding Council of Athens in 406 BCE (referred to in the dialogue).</p>
<h2>Phaedrus (~404 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='phaedrus.html'>Phaedrus</a> is bit of a puzzler. One could argue that it takes place after Lysias returned to Athens from Thurii in 412 or 411 BCE, but Phaedrus himself was banished from Athens in 415. Christopher Planeaux argues that Phaedrus likely returned after the general amnesty of 405/404 BCE (indeed, Phaedrus seems to have been living in Athens again by 404 BCE). Debra Nails argues for a dramatic date of 418-416 BCE and speculates that Lysias visited Athens around this time; she pins this on Socrates's question about whether Lysias was "in the town", but since his family lived in the Athenian port of Piraeus this is not definitive ("the town" was Athens proper; compare Brooklynites going into "the city").</p>
<h2>Meno (~402 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='meno.html'>Meno</a> is set before the death of Meno himself in Persia as described by Xenophon in the <cite>Anabasis</cite>; because the famous "Ten Thousand" Greek mercenaries departed for Persia in 401 BCE, the <cite>Meno</cite> can be dated around 402 BCE at the latest.</p>
<h2>Menexenus (401/400 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='menexenus.html'>Menexenus</a> is set right before a public funeral ceremony for Athenian war dead. The funeral oration of Aspasia recounted by Socrates mentions events from throughout the Pelopennesian War and also the suppression of the oligarchy at Eleusis in 401 BCE, so Debra Nails dates it to the winter of 401/400 BCE, whereas Christopher Planeaux prefers the late fall or early winter of 403 BCE. (Confusingly, the dialogue also contains mentions of events from the Corinthian War of 395-387 BCE, which started after the deaths of both Socrates and Aspasia; these might be later interpolations &mdash; although Catherine Zuckert dates it, impossibly, to 387-386 BCE, 12+ years after Socrates died.) Menexenus is old enough to serve in office, so he must be at least 30, but likely not much older because Socrates observes that Menexenus is "rather young for the post" of a governing council.</p>
<h2>Theaetetus (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the end of the <a href='theaetetus.html'>Theaetetus</a>, Socrates mentions that the next day he must go to hear his indictment on charges of impiety in the Spring of 399 BCE and expresses hope that the next day he will meet Theodorus in the same place.</p>
<h2>Euthyphro (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the <a href='euthyphro.html'>Euthyphro</a>, Socrates meets Euthyphro on the Porch of the King Archon, just before he is to be indicted.</p> 
<h2>Cratylus (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the <a href='cratylus.html'>Cratylus</a>, Socrates refers several times to the conversation of the <a href='euthyphro.html'>Euthyphro</a> as having occurred that very morning (for details, see "On Causal Priority and the Dramatic Date of Plato’s <cite>Cratylus</cite>" by Colin Smith).</p>
<h2>Sophist (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the start of the <a href='sophist.html'>Sophist</a>, Theodorus says that he and Theaetetus have fulfilled their promise of the day before to have a conversation with Socrates.</p>
<h2>Statesman (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='statesman.html'>Statesman</a> is a continuation of the <a href='sophist.html'>Sophist</a>.</p>
<h2>Apology (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the <a href='apology.html'>Apology</a>, Socrates, having already been indicted, faces trial and is condemned to death. (Christopher Planeaux deduces that the retelling of the <a href='symposium.html'>Symposium</a> happens immediately before the trial of Socrates, so one could profitably read the <a href='symposium.html'>Symposium</a> between the <a href='statesman.html'>Statesman</a> and the <a href='apology.html'>Apology</a>.)</p>
<h2>Philebus (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>In another brilliant insight, Christopher Planeaux identifies the time and place of the <a href='philebus.html'>Philebus</a> as the cell in which Socrates was jailed after his trial; thus this dialogue occurs between the <a href='apology.html'>Apology</a> and the <a href='crito.html'>Crito</a>.</p>
<h2>Crito (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>The events recounted in the <a href='crito.html'>Crito</a> take place the night before the death of Socrates.</p>
<h2>Phaedo (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>The dialogues end with the death of Socrates in the Summer of 399 BCE as recounted in the <a href='phaedo.html'>Phaedo</a>.</p>

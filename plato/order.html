<h1>The Order of Plato's Dialogues</h1>
<p>What's the best order in which to read the dialogues of Plato? Scholars have debated this question for centuries (indeed starting with Thrasyllus in ancient times) and it is unlikely that we'll ever have a definitive answer. However, Catherine Zuckert (<cite>Plato's Philosophers</cite>) and Debra Nails (<cite>The People of Plato</cite>) make a compelling case for honoring not the order in which Plato wrote the dialogues but their dramatic order, focused on the central character of Socrates and ending with his death in 399 BCE. Further details and justifications for this order are provided below.</p>
<h2>Laws (~460 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='laws.html'>Laws</a> takes place in Crete (not Athens) and is one of the only dialogues that does not involve Socrates. Because Plato wrote it toward the end of his life, some scholars argue that it should be read last &mdash; even, bizarrely, that the Athenian Stranger is Socrates in the afterlife. It's more natural that the <a href='laws.html'>Laws</a> predates Socrates. Internal evidence points to a date around 460 BCE, when Socrates was 9 years old.</p>
<h2>Epinomis (~460 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='epinomis.html'>Epinomis</a> ("after-laws") is a kind of appendix to the <a href='laws.html'>Laws</a> and thus can be taken as occurring around the same time.</p>
<h2>Parmenides (~450 BCE)</h2>
<p>Socrates is portrayed as a very young man in this dialogue (he was born around 469 BCE, so a date of 450 BCE would make him 19 here) and Parmenides is portrayed as 65 years old (he is thought to have been born around 515 BCE).</p>
<h2>Erastai (~435 BCE?)</h2>
<p>The date of the <a href='erastai.html'>Erastai</a> ("The Rival Lovers") is unclear, but it's possible that the one of the handsome youths portrayed in the dialogue is a very young Alcibiades</p>
<h2>Hipparchus</h2>
<p>The <a href='hipparchus.html'>Hipparchus</a> is a lesser-known dialogue (in fact many modern scholars think it is spurious, even though the ancients considered it to be written by Plato) and it doesn't contain any historical clues, so its dramatic date is difficult to determine.</p>
<h2>Protagoras (~433 BCE)</h2>
<p>Alcibiades (born around 450 BCE) is said to have just grown a beard at the time of this dialogue, so a date around 433 BCE is reasonable.</p>
<h2>First Alcibiades and Second Alcibiades (~433 BCE)</h2>
<p>In these dialogues, Alcibiades is around the same age as he was in the <a href='protagoras.html'>Protagoras</a>.</p>
<h2>Theages (~432 BCE)</h2>
<p>Although it's difficult to date the <a href='theages.html'>Theages</a>, it likely predates the <a href='republic.html'>Republic</a> because the character Theages is also mentioned there and in this dialogue Socrates is introduced to Theages by his father Demodocus.</p>
<h2>Minos (~432 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='minos.html'>Minos</a> is perhaps a precursor to the <a href='timaeus.html'>Timaeus</a>.</p>
<h2>Timaeus (~432 BCE)</h2>
<p>The dramatic date of the Timaeus is something of a puzzle. The character Hermocrates is usually thought to be a general from Sicily who was an enemy of Athens during the Pelopennesian War, which started in 430. Thus a date of 432 or 431 at the latest seems reasonable, despite the fact that scholars often date the dialogue to 411. This would comport with considering the character Critias to be the grandfather of the more famous Critias of the Thirty Tyrants (who lived c. 460-403) and with the internal evidence of the dialogue <a href='critias.html'>Critias</a> (in which Critias's great-grandfather Dropides heard the story of Atlantis from Solon, who lived c. 630-560).</p>
<h2>Critias (~432 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='critias.html'>Critias</a> is a continuation of the <a href='timaeus.html'>Timaeus</a>.</p>
<h2>Charmides (429 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the Charmides, Socrates has just returned to Athens from the defeat of the Athenian army at the siege of Potidaea, which happened in late May of 429 BCE (Socrates was likely away at the siege in 430 as well, and perhaps as early as 431 or 432).</p>
<h2>Republic (429 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='republic.html'>Republic</a> begins with a recounting of the first Athenian celebration of the festival of the Thracian goddess Bendis, which occurred in June of 429 BCE. Despite the frequent claim that this greatest of Plato's dialogues is set in 411 BCE, Christopher Planeaux presents a convincing case that 429 BCE makes more sense (see his paper "Socrates, Bendis, and Cephalus: Does Plato's Republic Have an Historical Setting?").</p>
<h2>Laches (~423 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='laches.html'>Laches</a> takes place after the Battle of Delium in 424 BCE (referred to in the dialogue) and before 418 BCE (the year in which Laches died).</p>
<h2>Hippias Major and Hippias Minor (~420 BCE)</h2>
<p>Because the sophist Hippias was from Elis, which was allied with Sparta during the Pelopennesian War, it's plausible that he was unable to visit Athens until the Peace of Nicias from 421 to 418 BCE; therefore a date around 420 seems appropriate for both the <a href='hippias-major.html'>Hippias Major</a> and <a href='hippias-minor.html'>Hippias Minor</a>.</p>
<h2>Symposium (416 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='symposium.html'>Symposium</a> takes place on the night of the playwright Agathon's winning a prize with his first tragedy; this happened in 416 BCE.</p>
<h2>Lysis (~414 BCE)</h2>
<p>Menexenus (see below) is in his early teens in this dialogue, whereas in his namesake dialogue he is in his early twenties.</p>
<h2>Ion (~413 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='ion.html'>Ion</a> is set after the Sicilian Expedition of 415-413 BCE (when the Athenians were desperate for military leaders - notice the banter about rhapsodes being good generals) and before the Ionian revolt of 412 BCE (since Ion's home city of Ephesus is described as still under Athenian rule).</p>
<h2>Clitophon (~411 BCE)</h2>
<p>Christopher Planeaux (in the abovementioned article) argues that the <a href='clitophon.html'>Clitophon</a> takes place after Lysias returned to Athens from Thurii in 412 or 411 BCE.</p>
<h2>Phaedrus (~411 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='phaedrus.html'>Phaedrus</a> is another puzzler. It must occur after Lysias returned to Athens from Thurii (see above), but the character Phaedrus was banished from Athens in 415 (although perhaps he returned after the coup of 411).</p>
<h2>Euthydemus (~411 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='euthydemus.html'>Euthydemus</a> appears to take place after the brothers Euthydemus and Dionysodorus came to Athens from Thurii, likely in 411.</p>
<h2>Gorgias (405 BCE)</h2>
<p>Although the sophist Gorgias is known to have first visited Athens in 427 BCE, the <a href='gorgias.html'>Gorgias</a> is set in 405 BCE, the year after Socrates served on the presiding Council of Athens in 406 BCE (referred to in the dialogue).</p>
<h2>Menexenus (~404 BCE)</h2>
<p>Because the <a href='menexenus.html'>Menexenus</a> takes place right before a public funeral ceremony for Athenian war dead, it likely takes place in 404 BCE when the Pelopennesian War ended, since the funeral oration of Aspasia recounted by Socrates mentions events from throughout that war (although, confusingly, it also mentions events from the Corinthian War of 395-387 BCE, which started after the deaths of both Socrates and Aspasia!).</p>
<h2>Meno (~402 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='meno.html'>Meno</a> is set before the death of Meno himself in Persia as described by Xenophon in the <cite>Anabasis</cite>, his account of the "Ten Thousand" Greek mercenaries who departed in 401 BCE.</p>
<h2>Philebus</h2>
<p>There are few if any clues to the dramatic date of the <a href='philebus.html'>Philebus</a>.</p>
<h2>Theaetetus (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the end of the <a href='theaetetus.html'>Theaetetus</a>, Socrates mentions that the next day he must go to hear his indictment on charges of impiety and expresses hope that the next day he will meet Theodorus in the same place.</p>
<h2>Euthyphro (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the <a href='euthyphro.html'>Euthyphro</a>, Socrates meets Euthyphro on the Porch of the King Archon, just before he is to be indicted.</p> 
<h2>Cratylus (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the <a href='cratylus.html'>Cratylus</a>, Socrates refers several times to the conversation of the <a href='euthyphro.html'>Euthyphro</a> as having occurred that very morning (see also "On Causal Priority and the Dramatic Date of Platoâ€™s <cite>Cratylus</cite>" by Colin Smith).</p>
<h2>Sophist (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the start of the <a href='sophist.html'>Sophist</a>, Theodorus says that he and Theaetetus have fulfilled their promise of the day before to have a conversation with Socrates.</p>
<h2>Statesman (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='statesman.html'>Statesman</a> is a continuation of the <a href='sophist.html'>Sophist</a>.</p>
<h2>Apology (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the <a href='apology.html'>Apology</a>, Socrates, having already been indicted, faces trial and is condemned to death.</p>
<h2>Crito (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>The events recounted in the <a href='crito.html'>Crito</a> take place the night before the death of Socrates.</p>
<h2>Phaedo (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>The dialogues end with the death of Socrates in 399 BCE as recounted in the <a href='phaedo.html'>Phaedo</a>.</p>

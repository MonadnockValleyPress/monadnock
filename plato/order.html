<h1>The Order of Plato's Dialogues</h1>
<p>What's the best order in which to read the dialogues of Plato? Scholars have debated this question for centuries (indeed starting with Thrasyllus in ancient times) and it is unlikely that we'll ever have a firm answer. However, Catherine Zuckert (<cite>Plato's Philosophers</cite>) and Debra Nails (<cite>The People of Plato</cite>) make a compelling case for honoring the dramatic order of the dialogues, focused on the central character of Socrates and ending with his death in 399 BCE. Further details and justifications for this order are provided below.</p>
<h2>Laws (~460 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <cite>Laws</cite> takes place in Crete (not Athens) and is one of the only dialogues that does not involve Socrates. Because Plato wrote it toward the end of his life, some scholars argue that it should be read last &mdash; even, bizarrely, that the Athenian Stranger is Socrates in the afterlife. It's more natural that the <cite>Laws</cite> predates Socrates. Internal evidence points to a date around 460 BCE, when Socrates was 9 years old.</p>
<h2>Epinomis (~460 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <cite>Epinomis</cite> ("after-laws") is a kind of appendix to the <cite>Laws</cite> and thus can be taken as occurring around the same time.</p>
<h2>Parmenides (~450 BCE)</h2>
<p>Socrates is portrayed as a very young man in this dialogue (he was born around 469 BCE, so a date of 450 BCE would make him 19 here) and Parmenides is portrayed as 65 years old (he is thought to have been born around 515 BCE).</p>
<h2>Protagoras (~433 BCE)</h2>
<p>Alcibiades (born around 450 BCE) is said to have just grown a beard at the time of this dialogue, so a date around 433 BCE is reasonable.</p>
<h2>First Alcibiades (~432 BCE)</h2>
<p>In this dialogue and the next, Alcibiades is around the same age as he was in the <cite>Protagoras</cite>.</p>
<h2>Second Alcibiades (~432 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Charmides (429 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the Charmides, Socrates has just returned to Athens from the defeat of the Athenian army in Potidea, which happened in late May of 429 BCE.</p>
<h2>Republic (429 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <cite>Republic</cite> begins with a recounting of the first Athenian celebration of the festival of the Thracian goddess Bendis, which occurred in June of 429 BCE. Despite the frequent claim that this greatest of Plato's dialogues took place in 411 BCE, Christopher Planeaux presents a convincing case that 429 BCE makes more sense (see his paper "Socrates, Bendis, and Cephalus: Does Plato's Republic Have an Historical Setting?").</p>
<h2>Hipparchus</h2>
<h2>Laches (~424 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Hippias Major (~420 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Hippias Minor (~420 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Erastai</h2>
<h2>Symposium (416 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <cite>Symposium</cite> takes place on the night of the playwright Agathon's winning a prize with his first tragedy; this happened in 416 BCE.</p>
<h2>Phaedrus (~416 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Ion (~413 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Clitophon (~411 BCE)</h2>
<p>Planeaux argues that this dialogue takes place after Lysias returned to Athens from Thurii in 412 or 411 BCE.</p>
<h2>Minos (~411 BCE)</h2>
<p>Perhaps a precursor to the <cite>Timaeus</cite>.</p>
<h2>Timaeus (~411 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Critias (~411 BCE)</h2>
<p>A continuation of the <cite>Timaeus</cite>.</p>
<h2>Philebus</h2>
<h2>Theages (~409 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Euthydemus (~407 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Lysis (~406 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Gorgias (~405 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Meno (~402 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Menexenus (~401 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Cratylus (~399 BCE)</h2>
<h2>Theaetetus (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the end of the <cite>Theaetetus</cite>, Socrates mentions that the next day he must go to hear his indictment on charges of impiety and expresses hope that the next day he will meet Theodorus in the same place.</p>
<h2>Euthyphro (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the <cite>Euthyphro</cite>, Socrates meets Euthyphro on the Porch of the King Archon, just before he is to be indicted.</p> 
<h2>Sophist (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the start of this dialogue, Theodorus says that he and Theaetetus have fulfilled their promise of the day before to have a conversation with Socrates.</p>
<h2>Statesman (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>A continuation of the <cite>Sophist</cite>.</p>
<h2>Apology (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>Having already been indicted, Socrates faces trial and is condemned to death.</p>
<h2>Crito (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>The events recounted in the <cite>Crito</cite> take place the night before the death of Socrates.</p>
<h2>Phaedo (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>The dialogues end with the death of Socrates in 399 BCE.</p>

<h1>The Dramatic Order of Plato's Dialogues</h1>
<p>What's the best order in which to read the dialogues of Plato? Scholars have debated this question for centuries (starting with Thrasyllus in ancient times) and it is unlikely that we'll ever have a definitive answer. However, Catherine Zuckert (<cite>Plato's Philosophers</cite>) and Debra Nails (<cite>The People of Plato</cite>) make a compelling case for honoring not the order in which Plato wrote the dialogues but their dramatic order, focused on the central character of Socrates and ending with his death in 399 BCE. The most thorough research on the dramatic order of the dialogues has been performed by Christopher Planeaux, whose work I lean on heavily in what follows.</p>
<p><em>Note: This page is a work in progress!</em></p>
<h2>Laws (~460 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='laws.html'>Laws</a> takes place in Crete (not Athens) and is one of the only dialogues that does not involve Socrates. Because Plato wrote it toward the end of his life, some scholars argue that it should be read last &mdash; even, bizarrely, that the Athenian Stranger is Socrates in the afterlife. It's more natural that the <a href='laws.html'>Laws</a> predates Socrates. Internal evidence points to a date around 460 BCE, when Socrates was 9 years old.</p>
<h2>Epinomis (~460 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='epinomis.html'>Epinomis</a> ("after-laws") is a kind of appendix to the <a href='laws.html'>Laws</a> and thus can be taken as occurring around the same time.</p>
<h2>Parmenides (~450 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the <a href='parmenides.html'>Parmenides</a>, Socrates is portrayed as a very young man (he was born around 469 BCE, so a date of 450 BCE would make him 19 here) and Parmenides is portrayed as 65 years old (he is thought to have been born around 515 BCE).</p>
<h2>Erastai (~435 BCE?)</h2>
<p>The date of the <a href='erastai.html'>Erastai</a> ("The Rival Lovers") is unclear, but it's possible that one of the handsome youths portrayed in the dialogue is a very young Alcibiades (this, however, is pure guesswork).</p>
<h2>Hipparchus</h2>
<p>The <a href='hipparchus.html'>Hipparchus</a> is a lesser-known dialogue (in fact many modern scholars think it is spurious, although the ancients considered it to be written by Plato) and it doesn't contain any historical clues, so its dramatic date is difficult to determine.</p>
<h2>Protagoras (~434 BCE)</h2>
<p>Alcibiades (born around 450 BCE) is said to have just grown a beard at the time of the <a href='protagoras.html'>Protagoras</a>, so a date around 434 BCE is reasonable.</p>
<h2>First Alcibiades and Second Alcibiades (~432 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the <a href='alcibiades.html'>First Alcibiades</a> and <a href='alcibiades2.html'>Second Alcibiades</a>, Alcibiades is around the same age as he was in the <a href='protagoras.html'>Protagoras</a>.</p>
<h2>Charmides (429 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the <a href='charmides.html'>Charmides</a>, Socrates has just returned to Athens from the defeat of the Athenian army at the siege of Potidaea, which happened in late May of 429 BCE (Socrates was likely away at the siege starting in 432, when the hostilities at Potidaea began).</p>
<h2>Republic (429 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='republic.html'>Republic</a> begins with a recounting of the first Athenian celebration of the festival of the Thracian goddess Bendis, which occurred in June of 429 BCE. Despite the frequent claim that this greatest of Plato's dialogues is set in 411 BCE (cf. Zuckert), Planeaux presents a convincing case that 429 BCE makes more sense (see his paper "Socrates, Bendis, and Cephalus: Does Plato's Republic Have an Historical Setting?").</p>
<h2>Laches (~423 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='laches.html'>Laches</a> takes place after the Battle of Delium in 424 BCE (referred to in the dialogue) and before 418 BCE (the year in which Nicias died); Nails, Zuckert, and Planeaux all date it to 424 or 423 BCE.</p>
<h2>Minos (~421 BCE?)</h2>
<p>The <a href='minos.html'>Minos</a> is perhaps a precursor to the <a href='timaeus.html'>Timaeus</a>, but there is no internal evidence from within the dialogue, so a date of 421 BCE is speculative.</p>
<h2>Timaeus (~421 BCE)</h2>
<p>The dramatic date of the <a href='timaeus.html'>Timaeus</a> is something of a puzzle. It is often tought to take place right after the <a href='republic.html'>Republic</a> in 429 BCE because it mentions a discussion of the ideal city having taken place the day before. Planeaux argues for a date of 421 BCE, which would comport with considering the character Critias to be the grandfather of the more famous Critias of the Thirty Tyrants (who lived c. 460-403 BCE) and with the internal evidence of the dialogue <a href='critias.html'>Critias</a> (in which Critias's great-grandfather Dropides heard the story of Atlantis from Solon, who lived c. 630-560 BCE).</p>
<h2>Critias (~421 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='critias.html'>Critias</a> is a continuation of the <a href='timaeus.html'>Timaeus</a>.</p>
<h2>Hippias Major and Hippias Minor (~420 BCE)</h2>
<p>Because the sophist Hippias was from Elis, which was allied with Sparta during the Pelopennesian War, it's plausible that he was unable to visit Athens until the Peace of Nicias from 421 to 418 BCE; therefore a date around 420 BCE seems appropriate for both the <a href='hippias-major.html'>Hippias Major</a> and <a href='hippias-minor.html'>Hippias Minor</a>.</p>
<h2>Symposium (416 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='symposium.html'>Symposium</a> takes place on the night of the playwright Agathon's winning a prize with his first tragedy, which happened in 416 BCE (but see below on the date of the retelling).</p>
<h2>Ion (414 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='ion.html'>Ion</a> is set during or after the Sicilian Expedition of 415-413 BCE (when the Athenians were desperate for military leaders &mdash; notice the banter about rhapsodes being good generals) and before the Ionian revolt of 412 BCE (since Ion's home city of Ephesus is described as still under Athenian rule). A date in the spring of 414 BCE is most likely, given that Socrates mentions the upcoming Great Panathaea (held in June every fourth year, 414 BCE being such a year).</p>
<h2>Clitophon (~411 BCE)</h2>
<p>Christopher Planeaux (in the abovementioned article) argues that the <a href='clitophon.html'>Clitophon</a> takes place after Lysias returned to Athens from Thurii in 412 or 411 BCE.</p>
<h2>Lysis (~410 BCE)</h2>
<p>Menexenus (see below) is in his early teens in the <a href='lysis.html'>Lysis</a>, whereas in his namesake dialogue he seems to be in his early twenties. Christopher Planeaux argues for a date of 421 BCE, which is another possibility and would place this dialogue after the <a href='laches.html'>Laches</a>.</p>
<h2>Theages (~409 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='theages.html'>Theages</a> takes place after the general Thrasyllos left Athens to lead a campaign in Ionia (mentioned in the dialogue), which happened in 409 or perhaps 408 BCE. Note that the Theages character in this dialogue is different from the one in the <a href='republic.html'>Republic</a>.</p>
<h2>Euthydemus (~407 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='euthydemus.html'>Euthydemus</a> takes place after the brothers Euthydemus and Dionysodorus came to Athens from Thurii in 412 or 411 BCE; however, Ctesippus appears to be a few years older here than in the <a href='lysis.html'>Lysis</a>, where he is also present. (If we accept Planeaux's date of 421 for the <a href='lysis.html'>Lysis</a>, then the <a href='euthydemus.html'>Euthydemus</a> would take place around 418 BCE.)</p>
<h2>Gorgias (405 BCE)</h2>
<p>Although the sophist Gorgias is known to have first visited Athens in 427 BCE, the <a href='gorgias.html'>Gorgias</a> is set in 405 BCE, the year after Socrates served on the presiding Council of Athens in 406 BCE (referred to in the dialogue).</p>
<h2>Phaedrus (~404 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='phaedrus.html'>Phaedrus</a> is bit of a puzzler. One could argue that takes place after Lysias returned to Athens from Thurii in 412 or 411 BCE, but Phaedrus himself was banished from Athens in 415. Christopher Planeaux argues that Phaedrus likely returned after the general amnesty of 405/404 BCE (indeed, Phaedrus seems to have been living in Athens again by 404 BCE). Debra Nails argues for a dramatic date of 418-416 BCE and speculates that Lysias visited Athens around this time; she pins this on Socrates's question about whether Lysias was "in the town", but since his family lived in the Athenian port of Piraeus this is not definitive ("the town" was Athens proper; compare Brooklynites going into "the city").</p>
<h2>Meno (~402 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='meno.html'>Meno</a> is set before the death of Meno himself in Persia as described by Xenophon in the <cite>Anabasis</cite>; because the famous "Ten Thousand" Greek mercenaries departed for Persia in 401 BCE, the <cite>Meno</cite> can be dated to 402 BCE at the latest.</p>
<h2>Menexenus (401/400 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='menexenus.html'>Menexenus</a> is set right before a public funeral ceremony for Athenian war dead. The funeral oration of Aspasia recounted by Socrates mentions events from throughout the Pelopennesian War and also the suppression of the oligarchy at Eleusis in 401 BCE, so Debra Nails dates it to the winter of 401/400 BCE, whereas Christopher Planeaux prefers the late fall or early winter of 403 BCE. (Confusingly, the dialogue also contains mentions of events from the Corinthian War of 395-387 BCE, which started after the deaths of both Socrates and Aspasia; these might be later interpolations &mdash; although Catherine Zuckert dates it, impossibly, to 387-386.)</p>
<h2>Theaetetus (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the end of the <a href='theaetetus.html'>Theaetetus</a>, Socrates mentions that the next day he must go to hear his indictment on charges of impiety in the Spring of 399 BCE and expresses hope that the next day he will meet Theodorus in the same place.</p>
<h2>Euthyphro (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the <a href='euthyphro.html'>Euthyphro</a>, Socrates meets Euthyphro on the Porch of the King Archon, just before he is to be indicted.</p> 
<h2>Cratylus (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the <a href='cratylus.html'>Cratylus</a>, Socrates refers several times to the conversation of the <a href='euthyphro.html'>Euthyphro</a> as having occurred that very morning (for details, see "On Causal Priority and the Dramatic Date of Plato’s <cite>Cratylus</cite>" by Colin Smith).</p>
<h2>Sophist (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>At the start of the <a href='sophist.html'>Sophist</a>, Theodorus says that he and Theaetetus have fulfilled their promise of the day before to have a conversation with Socrates.</p>
<h2>Statesman (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>The <a href='statesman.html'>Statesman</a> is a continuation of the <a href='sophist.html'>Sophist</a>.</p>
<h2>Apology (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>In the <a href='apology.html'>Apology</a>, Socrates, having already been indicted, faces trial and is condemned to death. (Christopher Planeaux deduces that the retelling of the <a href='symposium.html'>Symposium</a> happens immediately before the trial of Socrates, so one could profitably read the <a href='symposium.html'>Symposium</a> between the <a href='statesman.html'>Statesman</a> and the <a href='apology.html'>Apology</a>.)</p>
<h2>Philebus (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>In another brilliant insight, Christopher Planeaux identifies the time and place of the <a href='philebus.html'>Philebus</a> as the cell in which Socrates was jailed after his trial; thus this dialogue occurs between the <a href='apology.html'>Apology</a> and the <a href='crito.html'>Crito</a>.</p>
<h2>Crito (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>The events recounted in the <a href='crito.html'>Crito</a> take place the night before the death of Socrates.</p>
<h2>Phaedo (399 BCE)</h2>
<p>The dialogues end with the death of Socrates in 399 BCE as recounted in the <a href='phaedo.html'>Phaedo</a>.</p>

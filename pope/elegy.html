<h1>Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady</h1>
<h2>by Alexander Pope (1717)</h2>
<p>
What beckoning ghost, along the moonlight shade<br/>
Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?<br/>
'Tis she!&mdash;but why that bleeding bosom gored,<br/>
Why dimly gleams the visionary sword?<br/>
Oh, ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell,<br/>
Is it, in heaven, a crime to love too well?<br/>
To bear too tender, or too firm a heart,<br/>
To act a lover's or a Roman's part?<br/>
Is there no bright reversion in the sky,<br/>
For those who greatly think, or bravely die?
</p>
<p>
Why bade ye else, ye Powers! her soul aspire<br/>
Above the vulgar flight of low desire?<br/>
Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes;<br/>
The glorious fault of angels and of gods:<br/>
Thence to their images on earth it flows,<br/>
And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows.<br/>
Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age,<br/>
Dull, sullen prisoners in the body's cage:<br/>
Dim lights of life, that burn a length of years<br/>
Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres;<br/>
Like Eastern kings a lazy state they keep,<br/>
And, close confined to their own palace, sleep.
</p>
<p>
From these perhaps (ere Nature bade her die)<br/>
Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky.<br/>
As into air the purer spirits flow,<br/>
And separate from their kindred dregs below;<br/>
So flew the soul to its congenial place,<br/>
Nor left one virtue to redeem her race.
</p>
<p>
But thou, false guardian of a charge too good,<br/>
Thou, mean deserter of thy brother's blood!<br/>
See on these ruby lips the trembling breath,<br/>
These cheeks, now fading at the blast of death;<br/>
Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before,<br/>
And those love-darting eyes must roll no more.<br/>
Thus, if Eternal Justice rules the ball,<br/>
Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall:<br/>
On all the line a sudden vengeance waits,<br/>
And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates.<br/>
There passengers shall stand, and pointing say,<br/>
(While the long funerals blacken all the way)<br/>
'Lo, these were they, whose souls the Furies steel'd,<br/>
And cursed with hearts unknowing how to yield.'<br/>
Thus unlamented pass the proud away,<br/>
The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day!<br/>
So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow<br/>
For others' good, or melt at others' woe.
</p>
<p>
What can atone (O ever-injured Shade!)<br/>
Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid?<br/>
No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear<br/>
Pleased thy pale ghost, or graced thy mournful bier,<br/>
By foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed,<br/>
By foreign hands thy decent limbs composed,<br/>
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,<br/>
By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd!<br/>
What, though no friends in sable weeds appear,<br/>
Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,<br/>
And bear about the mockery of woe<br/>
To midnight dances, and the public show?<br/>
What, though no weeping loves thy ashes' grace,<br/>
Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face?<br/>
What, though no sacred earth allow thee room,<br/>
Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb?<br/>
Yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be dress'd,<br/>
And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast:<br/>
There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,<br/>
There the first roses of the year shall blow;<br/>
While angels with their silver wings o'ershade<br/>
The ground, now sacred by thy relics made.
</p>
<p>
So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name,<br/>
What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame.<br/>
How loved, how honour'd once, avails thee not,<br/>
To whom related, or by whom begot;<br/>
A heap of dust alone remains of thee,<br/>
'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be!
</p>
<p>
Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung,<br/>
Deaf the praised ear, and mute the tuneful tongue.<br/>
Even he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays,<br/>
Shall shortly want the generous tear he pays;<br/>
Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part,<br/>
And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart;<br/>
Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er,<br/>
The Muse forgot, and thou beloved no more!

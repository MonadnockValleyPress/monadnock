<h1>Agamemnon's Tomb</h1>
<h2>by Emma Lazarus</h2>
<p>
Uplift the ponderous, golden mask of death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the sun shine on him as it did<br/>
How many thousand years agone!  Beneath<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This worm-defying, uncorrupted lid,<br/>
Behold the young, heroic face, round-eyed,<br/>
Of one who in his full-flowered manhood died;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nobler frame than creatures of to-day,<br/>
Swathed in fine linen cerecloths fold on fold,<br/>
With carven weapons wrought of bronze and gold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Accoutred like a warrior for the fray.
</p>
<p>
We gaze in awe at these huge-modeled limbs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrunk in death's narrow house, but hinting yet<br/>
Their ancient majesty; these sightless rims<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose living eyes the eyes of Helen met;<br/>
The speechless lips that ah! what tales might tell<br/>
Of earth's morning-tide when gods did dwell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst a generous-fashioned, god-like race,<br/>
Who dwarf our puny semblance, and who won<br/>
The secret soul of Beauty for their own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While all our art but crudely apes their grace.
</p>
<p>
We gather all the precious relics up,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden buttons chased with wondrous craft,<br/>
The sculptured trinkets and the crystal cup,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheathed, bronze sword, the knife with brazen haft.<br/>
Fain would we wrest with curious eyes from these<br/>
Unnumbered long-forgotten histories,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The deeds heroic of this mighty man,<br/>
On whom once more the living daylight beams,<br/>
To shame our littleness, to mock our dreams,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the abyss of centuries to span.
</p>
<p>
Yet could we rouse him from his blind repose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How might we meet his searching questionings,<br/>
Concerning all the follies, wrongs, and woes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since his great day whom men call King of Kings,<br/>
Victorious Agamemnon?  How might we<br/>
Those large, clear eyes confront, which scornfully<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would view us as a poor, degenerate race,<br/>
Base-souled and mean-proportioned?  What reply<br/>
Give to the beauty-loving Greek's heart-cry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking his ancient gods in vacant space?
</p>
<p>
What should he find within a world grown cold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save doubt and trouble?  To his sunny creed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand gloomy, warring sects succeed.<br/>
How of the Prince of Peace might he be told,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When over half the world the war-cloud lowers?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How would he mock these faltering hopes of ours,<br/>
Who knows the secret now of death and fate!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Humbly we gaze on the colossal frame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mutely we accept the mortal shame,<br/>
Of men degraded from a high estate.

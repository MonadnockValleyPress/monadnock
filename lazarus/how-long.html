<h1>How Long?</h1>
<h2>by Emma Lazarus</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How long, and yet how long,<br/>
Our leaders will we hail from over seas,<br/>
Master and kings from feudal monarchies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mock their ancient song<br/>
With echoes weak of foreign melodies?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That distant isle mist-wreathed,<br/>
Mantled in unimaginable green,<br/>
Too long hath been our mistress and our queen.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fathers have bequeathed<br/>
Too deep a love for her, our hearts within.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She made the whole world ring<br/>
With the brave exploits of her children strong,<br/>
And with the matchless music of her song.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too late, too late we cling<br/>
To alien legends, and their strains prolong.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This fresh young world I see,<br/>
With heroes, cities, legends of her own;<br/>
With a new race of men, and overblown<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By winds from sea to sea,<br/>
Decked with the majesty of every zone.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the glittering tops<br/>
Of snow-peaked mounts, the wid'ning vale's expanse,<br/>
Large prairies where free herds of horses prance,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhaustless wealth of crops,<br/>
In vast, magnificent extravagance.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These grand, exuberant plains,<br/>
These stately rivers, each with many a mouth,<br/>
The exquisite beauty of the soft-aired south,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The boundless seas of grains,<br/>
Luxuriant forests' lush and splendid growth.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant siren-song<br/>
Of the green island in the eastern sea,<br/>
Is not the lay for this new chivalry.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not free and strong<br/>
To chant on prairies 'neath this brilliant sky.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The echo faints and fails;<br/>
It suiteth not, upon this western plain,<br/>
Out voice or spirit; we should stir again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilderness, and make the vales<br/>
Resound unto a yet unheard-of strain.

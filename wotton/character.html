<h1>Elegy</h1>
<h2>by Sir Henry Wotton</h2>
<p>
How happy is he born and taught<br/>
That serveth not another's will;<br/>
Whose armour is his honest thought,<br/>
And simple truth his utmost skill!
</p>
<p>
Whose passions not his masters are;<br/>
Whose soul is still prepared for death,<br/>
Untied unto the world by care<br/>
Of public fame or private breath;
</p>
<p>
Who envies none that chance doth raise,<br/>
Nor vice; who never understood<br/>
How deepest wounds are given by praise;<br/>
Nor rules of state, but rules of good;
</p>
<p>
Who hath his life from rumours freed;<br/>
Whose conscience is his strong retreat;<br/>
Whose state can neither flatterers feed,<br/>
Nor ruin make oppressors great;
</p>
<p>
Who God doth late and early pray<br/>
More of His grace than gifts to lend;<br/>
And entertains the harmless day<br/>
With a religious book or friend;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;This man is freed from servile bands<br/>
Of hope to rise or fear to fall:<br/>
Lord of himself, though not of lands,<br/>
And having nothing, yet hath all.
</p>

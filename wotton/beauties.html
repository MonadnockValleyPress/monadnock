<h1>You Meaner Beauties of the Night</h1>
<h2>by Sir Henry Wotton</h2>
<p>
You meaner beauties of the night,<br/>
That poorly satisfy our eyes<br/>
More by your number than your light;<br/>
You common people of the skies,<br/>
What are you when the sun shall rise?
</p>
<p>
You curious chanters of the wood,<br/>
That warble forth Dame Nature's lays,<br/>
Thinking your voices understood<br/>
By your weak accents; what's your praise<br/>
When Philomel her voice shall raise?
</p>
<p>
You violets that first appear,<br/>
By your pure purple mantles known,<br/>
Like the proud virgins of the year,<br/>
As if the spring were all your own;<br/>
What are you when the rose is blown?
</p>
<p>
So, when my mistress shall be seen<br/>
In form and beauty of her mind,<br/>
By virtue first, then choice, a queen,<br/>
Tell me, if she were not design'd<br/>
Th' eclipse and glory of her kind?
</p>

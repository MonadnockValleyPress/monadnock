<h1>After Blenheim</h1>
<h2>by Robert Southey</h2>
<p>
It was a summer evening,<br/>
Old Kaspar's work was done,<br/>
And he before his cottage door<br/>
Was sitting in the sun,<br/>
And by him sported on the green<br/>
His little grandchild Wilhelmine.
</p>
<p>
She saw her brother Peterkin<br/>
Roll something large and round,<br/>
Which he beside the rivulet<br/>
In playing there had found;<br/>
He came to ask what he had found,<br/>
That was so large, and smooth, and round.
</p>
<p>
Old Kaspar took it from the boy,<br/>
Who stood expectant by;<br/>
And then the old man shook his head,<br/>
And, with a natural sigh,<br/>
"'Tis some poor fellow's skull," said he,<br/>
'Who fell in the great victory.
</p>
<p>
"I find them in the garden,<br/>
For there's many here about;<br/>
And often when I go to plough,<br/>
The ploughshare turns them out!<br/>
For many thousand men," said he,<br/>
"Were slain in that great victory."
</p>
<p>
"Now tell us what 'twas all about,"<br/>
Young Peterkin, he cries;<br/>
And little Wilhelmine looks up<br/>
With wonder-waiting eyes;<br/>
"Now tell us all about the war,<br/>
And what they fought each other for."
</p>
<p>
"It was the English," Kaspar cried,<br/>
"Who put the French to rout;<br/>
But what they fought each other for,<br/>
I could not well make out;<br/>
But everybody said," quoth he,<br/>
"That 'twas a famous victory.
</p>
<p>
"My father lived at Blenheim then,<br/>
Yon little stream hard by;<br/>
They burnt his dwelling to the ground,<br/>
And he was forced to fly;<br/>
So with his wife and child he fled,<br/>
Nor had he where to rest his head.
</p>
<p>
"With fire and sword the country round<br/>
Was wasted far and wide,<br/>
And many a childing mother then,<br/>
And new-born baby died;<br/>
But things like that, you know, must be<br/>
At every famous victory.
</p>
<p>
"They say it was a shocking sight<br/>
After the field was won;<br/>
For many thousand bodies here<br/>
Lay rotting in the sun;<br/>
But things like that, you know, must be<br/>
After a famous victory.
</p>
<p>
"Great praise the Duke of Marlbro' won,<br/>
And our good Prince Eugene."<br/>
"Why, 'twas a very wicked thing!"<br/>
Said little Wilhelmine.<br/>
"Nay... nay... my little girl," quoth he,<br/>
"It was a famous victory.
</p>
<p>
"And everybody praised the Duke<br/>
Who this great fight did win."<br/>
"But what good came of it at last?"<br/>
Quoth little Peterkin.<br/>
"Why that I cannot tell," said he,<br/>
"But 'twas a famous victory."

<h1>My Days among the Dead are Past</h1>
<h2>by Robert Southey</h2>
<p>
My days among the Dead are past;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around me I behold,<br/>
Where'er these casual eyes are cast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty minds of old;<br/>
My never-failing friends are they,<br/>
With whom I converse day by day.
</p>
<p>
With them I take delight in weal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seek relief in woe;<br/>
And while I understand and feel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much to them I owe,<br/>
My cheeks have often been bedew'd<br/>
With tears of thoughtful gratitude.
</p>
<p>
My thoughts are with the Dead, with them<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live in long-past years,<br/>
Their virtues love, their faults condemn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partake their hopes and fears,<br/>
And from their lessons seek and find<br/>
Instruction with an humble mind.
</p>
<p>
My hopes are with the Dead, anon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My place with them will be,<br/>
And I with them shall travel on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all Futurity;<br/>
Yet leaving here a name, I trust,<br/>
That will not perish in the dust.
</p>

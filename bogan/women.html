<h1>Women</h1>
<h2>by Louise Bogan</h2>
<p>
Women have no wilderness in them,<br/>
They are provident instead,<br/>
Content in the tight hot cell of their hearts<br/>
To eat dusty bread.
</p>
<p>
They do not see cattle cropping red winter grass,<br/>
They do not hear<br/>
Snow water going down under culverts<br/>
Shallow and clear.
</p>
<p>
They wait, when they should turn to journeys,<br/>
They stiffen, when they should bend.<br/>
They use against themselves that benevolence<br/>
To which no man is friend.
</p>
<p>
They cannot think of so many crops to a field<br/>
Or of clean wood cleft by an axe.<br/>
Their love is an eager meaninglessness<br/>
Too tense, or too lax.
</p>
<p>
They hear in every whisper that speaks to them<br/>
A shout and a cry.<br/>
As like as not, when they take life over their door-sills<br/>
They should let it go by.
</p>

<h1>Medusa</h1>
<h2>by Louise Bogan</h2>
<p>
I had come to the house, in a cave of trees,<br/>
Facing a sheer sky.<br/>
Everything moved,&mdash;a bell hung ready to strike,<br/>
Sun and reflection wheeled by.
</p>
<p>
When the bare eyes were before me<br/>
And the hissing hair,<br/>
Held up at a window, seen through a door.<br/>
The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead<br/>
Formed in the air.
</p>
<p>
This is a dead scene forever now.<br/>
Nothing will ever stir.<br/>
The end will never brighten it more than this,<br/>
Nor the rain blur.
</p>
<p>
The water will always fall, and will not fall,<br/>
And the tipped bell make no sound.<br/>
The grass will always be growing for hay<br/>
Deep on the ground.
</p>
<p>
And I shall stand here like a shadow<br/>
Under the great balanced day,<br/>
My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind,<br/>
And does not drift away.
</p>

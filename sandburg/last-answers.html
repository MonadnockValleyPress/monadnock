<h2>by Carl Sandburg</h2>
<p>
I wrote a poem on the mist<br/>
And a woman asked me what I meant by it.<br/>
I had thought till then only of the beauty of the mist, how pearl and gray of it mix and reel,<br/>
And change the drab shanties with lighted lamps at evening into points of mystery quivering with color.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered:<br/>
The whole world was mist once long ago and some day it will all go back to mist,<br/>
Our skulls and lungs are more water than bone and tissue<br/>
And all poets love dust and mist because all the last answers<br/>
Go running back to dust and mist.

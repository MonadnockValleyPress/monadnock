<h1>Skyscraper</h1>
<h2>by Carl Sandburg</h2>
<p>
By day the skyscraper looms in the smoke and sun and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has a soul.<br/>
Prairie and valley, streets of the city, pour people into<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it and they mingle among its twenty floors and are<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poured out again back to the streets, prairies and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valleys.<br/>
It is the men and women, boys and girls so poured in and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out all day that give the building a soul of dreams<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thoughts and memories.<br/>
(Dumped in the sea or fixed in a desert, who would care<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the building or speak its name or ask a policeman<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way to it?)
</p>
<p>
Elevators slide on their cables and tubes catch letters and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parcels and iron pipes carry gas and water in and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sewage out.<br/>
Wires climb with secrets, carry light and carry words,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tell terrors and profits and loves&mdash;curses of men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grappling plans of business and questions of women<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in plots of love.
</p>
<p>
Hour by hour the caissons reach down to the rock of the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth and hold the building to a turning planet.<br/>
Hour by hour the girders play as ribs and reach out and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold together the stone walls and floors.
</p>
<p>
Hour by hour the hand of the mason and the stuff of the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mortar clinch the pieces and parts to the shape an<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;architect voted.<br/>
Hour by hour the sun and the rain, the air and the rust,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the press of time running into centuries, play<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the building inside and out and use it.
</p>
<p>
Men who sunk the pilings and mixed the mortar are laid<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in graves where the wind whistles a wild song<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without words<br/>
And so are men who strung the wires and fixed the pipes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tubes and those who saw it rise floor by floor.<br/>
Souls of them all are here, even the hod carrier begging<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at back doors hundreds of miles away and the brick-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layer who went to state's prison for shooting another<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man while drunk.<br/>
(One man fell from a girder and broke his neck at the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end of a straight plunge&mdash;he is here&mdash;his soul has<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone into the stones of the building.)
</p>
<p>
On the office doors from tier to tier&mdash;hundreds of names<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and each name standing for a face written across<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a dead child, a passionate lover, a driving<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ambition for a million dollar business or a lobster's<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ease of life.
</p>
<p>
Behind the signs on the doors they work and the walls<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell nothing from room to room.<br/>
Ten-dollar-a-week stenographers take letters from<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corporation officers, lawyers, efficiency engineers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tons of letters go bundled from the building to all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ends of the earth.<br/>
Smiles and tears of each office girl go into the soul of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the building just the same as the master-men who<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule the building.
</p>
<p>
Hands of clocks turn to noon hours and each floor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;empties its men and women who go away and eat<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and come back to work.<br/>
Toward the end of the afternoon all work slackens and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all jobs go slower as the people feel day closing on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.<br/>
One by one the floors are emptied. . . The uniformed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elevator men are gone. Pails clang. . . Scrubbers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work, talking in foreign tongues. Broom and water<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and mop clean from the floors human dust and spit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and machine grime of the day.<br/>
Spelled in electric fire on the roof are words telling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miles of houses and people where to buy a thing for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;money. The sign speaks till midnight.
</p>
<p>
Darkness on the hallways. Voices echo. Silence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holds. . . Watchmen walk slow from floor to floor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and try the doors. Revolvers bulge from their hip<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pockets. . . Steel safes stand in corners. Money<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is stacked in them.<br/>
A young watchman leans at a window and sees the lights<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of barges butting their way across a harbor, nets of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;red and white lanterns in a railroad yard, and a span<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of glooms splashed with lines of white and blurs of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crosses and clusters over the sleeping city.<br/>
By night the skyscraper looms in the smoke and the stars<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has a soul.

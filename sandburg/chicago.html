<h1>Chicago</h1>
<h2>by Carl Sandburg</h2>
<p>
Hog Butcher for the World,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stormy, husky, brawling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City of the Big Shoulders:
</p>
<p>
They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I have seen your painted women under the gas lamps luring the farm boys.<br/>
And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it is true I have seen the gunman kill and go free to kill again.<br/>
And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the faces of women and children I have seen the marks of wanton hunger.<br/>
And having answered so I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer and say to them:<br/>
Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.<br/>
Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on job, here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against the little soft cities;<br/>
Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning as a savage pitted against the wilderness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bareheaded,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoveling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrecking,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building, breaking, rebuilding,<br/>
Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with white teeth,<br/>
Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young man laughs,<br/>
Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has never lost a battle,<br/>
Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse, and under his ribs the heart of the people,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing!<br/>
Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter of Youth, half-naked, sweating, proud to be Hog Butcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation.

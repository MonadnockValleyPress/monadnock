<h1>Ease</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<h4>I</h4>
<p>
How easily doth Nature teach the soul<br/>
How irresistible is her infusion!<br/>
There's nothing found that can her force control<br/>
But sin. How weak and feeble's all delusion!<br/>
</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>
Things false are forc'd and most elaborate,<br/>
Things pure and true are obvious unto sense;<br/>
The first impressions in our earthly state<br/>
Are made by things most great in excellence.<br/>
</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p>
How easy is it to believe the sky<br/>
Is wide and great and fair! How soon may we<br/>
Be made to know the Sun is bright and high,<br/>
And very glorious, when its beams we see!<br/>
</p>
<h4>IV</h4>
<p>
That all the Earth is one continued globe,<br/>
And that all men therein are living treasures,<br/>
That fields and meadows are a glorious robe<br/>
Adorning it with smooth and heavenly pleasures.<br/>
</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p>
That all we see is ours, and every one<br/>
Possessor of the whole; that every man<br/>
Is like a God Incarnate on the Throne,<br/>
Even like the first for whom the world began;<br/>
</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p>
Whom all are taught to honour, serve, and love,<br/>
Because he is belov'd of God unknown;<br/>
And therefore is on Earth itself above<br/>
All others, that His wisdom might be shewn.<br/>
</p>
<h4>VII</h4>
<p>
That all may happy be, each one most blest,<br/>
Both in himself and others; all most high,<br/>
While all by each, and each by all possest<br/>
Are intermutual joys beneath the sky.<br/>
</p>
<h4>VIII</h4>
<p>
This shows a wise contrivance, and discovers<br/>
Some great Creator sitting on the Throne,<br/>
That so disposeth things for all His lovers,<br/>
That every one might reign like God alone.<br/>

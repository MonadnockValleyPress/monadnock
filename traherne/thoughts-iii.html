<h1>Thoughts (III)</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<p>
Thoughts are the Angels which we send abroad,<br/>
To visit all the parts of God's abode.<br/>
Thoughts are the things wherein we all confess<br/>
The quintessence of sin and holiness<br/>
Is laid. All wisdom in a thought doth shine,<br/>
By thoughts alone the soul is made divine.<br/>
Thoughts are the springs of all our actions here<br/>
On earth, tho' they themselves do not appear.<br/>
They are the springs of beauty, order, peace,<br/>
The city's gallantries, the fields' increase.<br/>
Rule, government, and kingdoms flow from them,<br/>
And so doth all the New Jerusalem,<br/>
At least the glory, splendour, and delight,<br/>
For 'tis by thoughts that even she is bright.<br/>
Thoughts are the things wherewith even God is crown'd,<br/>
And as the soul without them's useless found,<br/>
So are all other creatures too. A thought<br/>
Is even the very cream of all He wrought.<br/>
All holy fear, and love, and reverence,<br/>
With honour, joy, and praise, as well as sense,<br/>
Are hidden in our thoughts. Thoughts are the things<br/>
That us affect: The honey and the stings<br/>
Of all that is are seated in a thought,<br/>
Even while it seemeth weak, and next to nought.<br/>
The matter of all pleasure, virtue, worth,<br/>
Grief, anger, hate, revenge, which words set forth,<br/>
Are thoughts alone. Thoughts are the highest things,<br/>
The very offspring of the King of Kings.<br/>
Thoughts are a kind of strange celestial creature<br/>
That when they're good, they're such in every feature.<br/>
They bear the image of their Father's face,<br/>
And beautify even all His dwelling-place:<br/>
So nimble, volatile, and unconfined,<br/>
Illimited, to which no form's assigned,<br/>
So changeable, capacious, easy, free,<br/>
That what itself doth please a thought may be.<br/>
From nothing to infinity it turns,<br/>
Even in a moment: Now like fire it burns,<br/>
Now's frozen ice: Now shapes the glorious sun,<br/>
Now darkness in a moment doth become.<br/>
Now all at once: Now crowded in a sand,<br/>
Now fills the hemisphere, and sees a land:<br/>
Now on a sudden's wider than the sky,<br/>
And now runs parile with the Deity.<br/>
'Tis such that it may all or nothing be,<br/>
And's made so active, voluble, and free<br/>
Because 'tis capable of all that's good,<br/>
And is the end of all when understood.<br/>
A thought can clothe itself with all the treasures<br/>
Of God, and be the greatest of His pleasures.<br/>
It all His laws, and glorious works, and ways,<br/>
And attributes and counsels, all His praise<br/>
It can conceive and imitate, and give:<br/>
It is the only being that doth live.<br/>
'Tis capable of all perfection here,<br/>
Of all His love and joy and glory there.<br/>
It is the only beauty that doth shine,<br/>
Most great, transcendent, heavenly, and divine.<br/>
The very best or worst of things it is,<br/>
The basis of all misery or bliss.<br/>
Its measures and capacities are such,<br/>
Their utmost measure we can never touch.<br/>
Here ornament on ornament may still<br/>
Be laid; beauty on beauty, skill on skill,<br/>
Strength still on strength, and life itself on life,<br/>
'Tis Queen of all things, and its Maker's wife.<br/>
The best of thoughts is yet a thing unknown,<br/>
But when 'tis perfect it is like His own:<br/>
Intelligible, endless, yet a sphere<br/>
Substantial too: In which all things appear,<br/>
All worlds, all excellencies, senses, graces,<br/>
Joys, pleasures, creatures, and the angels' faces.<br/>
It shall be married ever unto all,<br/>
And all embrace, tho' now it seemeth small.<br/>
A thought my soul may omnipresent be,<br/>
For all it toucheth which a thought can see.<br/>
O that mysterious Being! Thoughts are things<br/>
Which rightly used make His creatures Kings.<br/>

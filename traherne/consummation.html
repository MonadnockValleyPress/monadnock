<h1>Consummation</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thoughts of Men appear<br/>
Freely to mov within a Sphere<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of endless Reach; and run,<br/>
Tho in the Soul, beyond the Sun.<br/>
The Ground on which they acted be<br/>
Is unobserv'd Infinity.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traversing throu the Sky,<br/>
Tho here, beyond it far they fly:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abiding in the Mind<br/>
An endless Liberty they find:<br/>
Throu-out all Spaces can extend,<br/>
Nor ever meet or know an End.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, in their native Sphere,<br/>
At boundless Distances appear:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternity can measure;<br/>
Its no Beginning see with Pleasure.<br/>
Thus in the Mind an endless Space<br/>
Doth nat'rally display its face.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein becaus we no<br/>
Object distinctly find or know;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sundry Things invent,<br/>
That may our Fancy giv content;<br/>
See Points of Space beyond the Sky,<br/>
And in those Points see Creatures ly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spy Fishes in the Seas,<br/>
Conceit them swimming there with Eas;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dolphins and the Whales,<br/>
Their very Finns, their very Scales,<br/>
As there within the briny Deep<br/>
Their Tails the flowing Waters sweep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can see the very Skies,<br/>
As if the same were in our Eys;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sun, tho in the Night,<br/>
As if it mov'd within our Sight;<br/>
One Space beyond another still<br/>
Discovered; think while ye will.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, tho we don't descry,<br/>
(Much like by night an useless Ey,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not shaded with a Lid,<br/>
But in a darksom Dungeon hid)<br/>
At last shall in a glorious Day<br/>
Be made its Objects to display<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then shall Ages be<br/>
Within its wide Eternity;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Kingdoms stand,<br/>
Howe're remote, yet nigh at hand;<br/>
The Skies, and what beyond them ly,<br/>
Exposed unto evry Ey.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor shall we then invent<br/>
Nor alter Things; but with content<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in their places see,<br/>
As doth the Glorious Deity;<br/>
Within the Scope of whose Great Mind,<br/>
We all in their tru Nature find.<br/>

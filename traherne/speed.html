<h1>Speed</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<h4>I</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liquid pearl in springs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The useful and the precious things<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are in a moment known.<br/>
Their very glory does reveal their worth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(And that doth set their glory forth);<br/>
As soon as I was born they all were shewn.<br/>
</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True living wealth did flow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In crystal streams below<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My feet, and trilling down<br/>
In pure, transparent, soft, sweet, melting pleasures,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like precious and diffusive treasures,<br/>
At once my body fed, and soul did crown.<br/>
</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was as high and great<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Kings are in their seat.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other things were mine.<br/>
The world my house, the creatures were my goods,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fields, mountains, valleys, woods,<br/>
Men and their arts to make me rich combine.<br/>
</p>
<h4>IV</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, lofty, endless, stable,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various and Innumerable,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright, useful, fair, divine.<br/>
Immovable and sweet the treasures were,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred objects did appear<br/>
More rich and beautiful, as well as mine.<br/>
</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New all! new-burnisht joys;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' now by other toys<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eclipst: new all and mine.<br/>
Great Truth so sacred seemed for this to me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the things which I did see<br/>
Were such, my state I knew to be divine.<br/>
</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did the Angels' faces,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glories and the graces,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty, peace and joy<br/>
Of Heaven itself, more sweetness yield to me.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till filthy sin did all destroy<br/>
Those were the offspring of the Deity.<br/>

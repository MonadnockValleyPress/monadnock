<h1>Wonder</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<h4>I</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How like an Angel came I down!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How bright are all things here!<br/>
When first among His works I did appear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O how their Glory me did crown!<br/>
The world resembled His Eternity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which my soul did walk;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every thing that I did see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did with me talk.<br/>
</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The skies in their magnificence,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lively, lovely air;<br/>
Oh how divine, how soft, how sweet, how fair!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars did entertain my sense,<br/>
And all the works of God, so bright and pure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So rich and great did seem,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they ever must endure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my esteem.<br/>
</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A native health and innocence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within my bones did grow,<br/>
And while my God did all his Glories show,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt a vigour in my sense<br/>
That was all Spirit. I within did flow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With seas of life, like wine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I nothing in the world did know<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 'twas divine.<br/>
</p>
<h4>IV</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Harsh ragged objects were concealed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oppressions, tears and cries,<br/>
Sins, griefs, complaints, dissensions, weeping eyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were hid, and only things revealed<br/>
Which heavenly Spirits and the Angels prize.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of Innocence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bliss, not trades and poverties,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did fill my sense.<br/>
</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets were paved with golden stones,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys and girls were mine,<br/>
Oh how did all their lovely faces shine!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sons of men were holy ones,<br/>
In joy and beauty they appeared to me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every thing which here I found,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While like an angel I did see,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adorned the ground.<br/>
</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich diamond and pearl and gold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every place was seen;<br/>
Rare splendours, yellow, blue, red, white and green,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine eyes did everywhere behold.<br/>
Great Wonders clothed with glory did appear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazement was my bliss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That and my wealth was everywhere;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No joy to this!<br/>
</p>
<h4>VII</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed and devised proprieties,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With envy, avarice<br/>
And fraud, those fiends that spoil even Paradise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew from the splendour of mine eyes,<br/>
And so did hedges, ditches, limits, bounds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dreamed not aught of those,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But wandered over all men's grounds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And found repose.<br/>
</p>
<h4>VIII</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Proprieties themselves were mine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hedges ornaments,<br/>
Walls, boxes, coffers, and their rich contents<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not divide my joys, but all combine.<br/>
Clothes, ribbons, jewels, laces, I esteemed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My joys by others worn:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For me they all to wear them seemed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was born.<br/>

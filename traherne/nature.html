<h1>Nature</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<p>
That Custom is a second Nature, we<br/>
Most plainly find by Nature's purity.<br/>
For Nature teacheth nothing but the truth;<br/>
I'm sure that mine did in my virgin youth:<br/>
The very Day my Spirit did inspire,<br/>
The world's fair beauty set my soul on fire.<br/>
My senses were informers to my heart,<br/>
The conduits of His glory, power, and art.<br/>
His greatness, wisdom, goodness, I did see,<br/>
His glorious Love, and His Eternitie,<br/>
Almost as soon as born; and every sense<br/>
Was in me like to some Intelligence.<br/>
I was by nature prone and apt to love<br/>
All light and beauty, both in Heaven above,<br/>
And Earth beneath, prone even to admire,<br/>
Adore, and praise as well as to desire.<br/>
My inclinations raised me up on high,<br/>
And guided me to all Infinity.<br/>
A secret self I had enclosed within,<br/>
That was not bounded with my clothes or skin,<br/>
Or terminated with my sight, the sphere<br/>
Of which was bounded with the Heavens here:<br/>
But that did rather, like the subtile light,<br/>
Secured from rough and raging storms by night,<br/>
Break through the lanthorn's sides, and freely ray<br/>
Dispersing and dilating every way:<br/>
Whose steady beams too subtile for the wind,<br/>
Are such that we their bounds can scarcely find.<br/>
It did encompass, and possess rare things,<br/>
But yet felt more, and on its angel's wings<br/>
Pierced through the skies immediately, and sought<br/>
For all that could beyond all worlds be thought.<br/>
It did not move, nor one way go, but stood,<br/>
And by dilating of itself, all good<br/>
It strove to see, as if 'twere present there,<br/>
Even while it present stood conversing here:<br/>
And more suggested than I could discern,<br/>
Or ever since by any means could learn.<br/>
Vast, unaffected wonderful desires,<br/>
Like inward, native, uncaus'd hidden fires,<br/>
Sprang up with expectations very strange,<br/>
Which into new desires did quickly change:<br/>
For all I saw beyond the azure round,<br/>
Was endless darkness with no beauty crown'd.<br/>
Why beauty should not there, as well as here,<br/>
Why goodness should not likewise there appear,<br/>
Why treasures and delights should bounded be,<br/>
Since there is such a wide Infinitie;<br/>
These were the doubts and troubles of my Soul,<br/>
By which I do perceive without control,<br/>
A world of endless joys by Nature made,<br/>
That needs must flourish ever, never fade.<br/>
A wide, magnificent and spacious sky,<br/>
So rich 'tis worthy of the Deity,<br/>
Clouds here and there like winged charets flying,<br/>
Flowers ever flourishing, yet always dying,<br/>
A day of glory where I all things see,<br/>
As 'twere enrich'd with beams of light for me,<br/>
And drown'd in glorious rays of purer light,<br/>
Succeeded with a black, yet glorious night;<br/>
Stars sweetly shedding to my pleased sense,<br/>
On all things their nocturnal influence,<br/>
With secret rooms in times and ages more,<br/>
Past and to come enlarging my great store:<br/>
These all in order present unto me<br/>
My happy eyes did in a moment see,<br/>
With wonders there-too, to my Soul unknown,<br/>
Till they by men and reading first were shewn.<br/>
All which were made that I might ever be<br/>
With some great workman, some Great Deity.<br/>
But yet there were new rooms and spaces more,<br/>
Beyond all these, new regions o'er and o'er,<br/>
Into all which my pent-up Soul like fire<br/>
Did break, surmounting all I here admire.<br/>
The spaces fill'd were like a cabinet<br/>
Of joys before me most distinctly set:<br/>
The empty like to large and vacant room<br/>
For fancy to enlarge in, and presume<br/>
A space for more, remov'd, but yet adorning<br/>
Those near at hand, that pleased me every morning.<br/>
Here I was seated to behold new things,<br/>
In the fair fabric of the King of Kings.<br/>
All, all was mine. The fountain tho' not known,<br/>
Yet that there must be one was plainly shewn,<br/>
Which fountain of delights must needs be Love,<br/>
As all the goodness of the things did prove.<br/>
It shines upon me from the highest skies,<br/>
And all its creatures for my sake doth prize,<br/>
Of whose enjoyment I am made the end,<br/>
While how the same is so I comprehend.<br/>

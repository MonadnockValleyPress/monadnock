<h1>To the Same Purpose</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<p>
To the same purpose: he, not long before<br/>
Brought home from nurse, going to the door<br/>
To do some little thing<br/>
He must not do within,<br/>
With wonder cries,<br/>
As in the skies<br/>
He saw the moon, "O yonder is the moon,<br/>
Newly come after me to town,<br/>
That shined at Lugwardin but yesternight,<br/>
Where I enjoyed the self-same sight."
</p>
<p>
As if it had ev'n twenty thousand faces,<br/>
It shines at once in many places;<br/>
To all the earth so wide<br/>
God doth the stars divide,<br/>
With so much art<br/>
The moon impart,<br/>
They serve us all; serve wholly every one<br/>
As if they serv√®d him alone.<br/>
While every single person hath such store,<br/>
'Tis want of sense that makes us poor.

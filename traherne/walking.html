<h1>Walking</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<p>
To walk abroad is, not with eyes,<br/>
But thoughts, the fields to see and prize;<br/>
Else may the silent feet,<br/>
Like logs of wood,<br/>
Move up and down, and see no good<br/>
Nor joy nor glory meet.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ev'n carts and wheels their place do change,<br/>
But cannot see, though very strange<br/>
The glory that is by;<br/>
Dead puppets may<br/>
Move in the bright and glorious day,<br/>
Yet not behold the sky.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And are not men than they more blind,<br/>
Who having eyes yet never find<br/>
The bliss in which they move;<br/>
Like statues dead<br/>
They up and down are carried<br/>
Yet never see nor love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To walk is by a thought to go;<br/>
To move in spirit to and fro;<br/>
To mind the good we see;<br/>
To taste the sweet;<br/>
Observing all the things we meet<br/>
How choice and rich they be.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To note the beauty of the day,<br/>
And golden fields of corn survey;<br/>
Admire each pretty flow'r<br/>
With its sweet smell;<br/>
To praise their Maker, and to tell<br/>
The marks of his great pow'r.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To fly abroad like active bees,<br/>
Among the hedges and the trees,<br/>
To cull the dew that lies<br/>
On ev'ry blade,<br/>
From ev'ry blossom; till we lade<br/>
Our minds, as they their thighs.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Observe those rich and glorious things,<br/>
The rivers, meadows, woods, and springs,<br/>
The fructifying sun;<br/>
To note from far<br/>
The rising of each twinkling star<br/>
For us his race to run.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A little child these well perceives,<br/>
Who, tumbling in green grass and leaves,<br/>
May rich as kings be thought,<br/>
But there's a sight<br/>
Which perfect manhood may delight,<br/>
To which we shall be brought.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While in those pleasant paths we talk,<br/>
'Tis that tow'rds which at last we walk;<br/>
For we may by degrees<br/>
Wisely proceed<br/>
Pleasures of love and praise to heed,<br/>
From viewing herbs and trees.<br/>

<h1>My Spirit</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<h4>I</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My naked simple Life was I;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Act so strongly shin'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the earth, the sea, the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the substance of my mind;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense itself was I.<br/>
I felt no dross nor matter in my Soul,<br/>
No brims nor borders, such as in a bowl<br/>
We see. My essence was capacity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That felt all things;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought that springs<br/>
Therefrom's itself. It hath no other wings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To spread abroad, nor eyes to see,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor hands distinct to feel,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor knees to kneel.<br/>
But being simple like the Deity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In its own centre is a sphere<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not shut up here, but everywhere.<br/>
</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It acts not from a centre to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its object as remote,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But present is when it doth view,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being with the Being it doth note<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever it doth do.<br/>
It doth not by another engine work,<br/>
But by itself; which in the act doth lurk.<br/>
Its essence is transformed into a true<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And perfect act,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so exact<br/>
Hath God appeared in this mysterious fact,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That 'tis all eye, all act, all sight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And what it please can be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only see,<br/>
Or do; for 'tis more voluble than light:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which can put on ten thousand forms,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being cloth'd with what itself adorns.<br/>
</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This made me present evermore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With whatsoe'er I saw.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An object, if it were before<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My eye, was by Dame Nature's law,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within my soul. Her store<br/>
Was all at once within me; all Her treasures<br/>
Were my immediate and internal pleasures,<br/>
Substantial joys, which did inform my mind.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all she wrought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul was fraught,<br/>
And every object in my heart a thought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Begot, or was; I could not tell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the things did there<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Themselves appear,<br/>
Which in my Spirit truly seem'd to dwell;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or whether my conforming mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were not even all that therein shin'd.<br/>
</p>
<h4>IV</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet of this I was most sure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That at the utmost length,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(So worthy was it to endure)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul could best express its strength.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was so quick and pure,<br/>
That all my mind was wholly everywhere,<br/>
Whate'er it saw, 'twas ever wholly there;<br/>
The sun ten thousand legions off, was nigh:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The utmost star,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though seen from far,<br/>
Was present in the apple of my eye.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There was my sight, my life, my sense,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My substance, and my mind;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My spirit shin'd<br/>
Even there, not by a transient influence:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The act was immanent, yet there:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing remote, yet felt even here.<br/>
</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O Joy! O wonder and delight!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O sacred mystery!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My Soul a Spirit infinite!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An image of the Deity!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A pure substantial light!<br/>
That Being greatest which doth nothing seem!<br/>
Why, 'twas my all, I nothing did esteem<br/>
But that alone. A strange mysterious sphere!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep abyss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That sees and is<br/>
The only proper place of Heavenly Bliss.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To its Creator 'tis so near<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In love and excellence,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In life and sense,<br/>
In greatness, worth, and nature; and so dear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In it, without hyperbole,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Son and friend of God we see.<br/>
</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange extended orb of Joy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Proceeding from within,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which did on every side, convey<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Itself, and being nigh of kin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To God did every way<br/>
Dilate itself even in an instant, and<br/>
Like an indivisible centre stand,<br/>
At once surrounding all eternity.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas not a sphere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet did appear,<br/>
One infinite. 'Twas somewhat everywhere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tho' it had a power to see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Far more, yet still it shin'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was a mind<br/>
Exerted for it saw Infinity.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas not a sphere, but 'twas a might<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible, and yet gave light.<br/>
</p>
<h4>VII</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O wondrous Self! O sphere of light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O sphere of joy most fair;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O act, O power infinite;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O subtile and unbounded air!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O living orb of sight!<br/>
Thou which within me art, yet me! Thou eye,<br/>
And temple of His whole infinity!<br/>
O what a world art Thou! A world within!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All things appear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All objects are<br/>
Alive in Thee! Supersubstantial, rare,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Above themselves, and nigh of kin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To those pure things we find<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In His great mind<br/>
Who made the world! Tho' now eclipsed by sin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There they are useful and divine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exalted there they ought to shine.<br/>

<h1>Right Apprehension</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<p>
Give but to things their true esteem,<br/>
And those which now so vile and worthless seem<br/>
Will so much fill and please the mind<br/>
That we shall there the only riches find.<br/>
How wise was I<br/>
In infancy!<br/>
I then saw in the clearest light;<br/>
But corrupt is a second night.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Custom, that must a trophy be<br/>
When wisdom shall complete her victory;<br/>
For trades, opinions, errors, are<br/>
False lights, but yet received to set off ware<br/>
More false; we're sold<br/>
For worthless gold.<br/>
Diana was a goddess made<br/>
That silversmiths might have the better trade.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But give to things their true esteem,<br/>
And then what's magnified most vile will seem;<br/>
What's commonly despised will be<br/>
The truest and the greatest rarity.<br/>
What men should prize<br/>
They all despise:<br/>
The best enjoyments are abused;<br/>
The only wealth by madmen is refused.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A globe of earth is better far<br/>
Than if it were a globe of gold; a star<br/>
More brighter than a precious stone;<br/>
The sun more glorious than a costly throne â€”<br/>
His warming beam,<br/>
A living stream<br/>
Of liquid pearl, that from a spring<br/>
Waters the earth, is a most precious thing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
What newness once suggested to,<br/>
Now clearer reason doth improve my view;<br/>
By novelty my soul was taught<br/>
At first, but now reality my thought<br/>
Inspires; and I<br/>
Perspicuously<br/>
Each way instructed am by sense,<br/>
Experience, reason, and intelligence.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A globe of gold must barren be,<br/>
Untilled and useless; we should neither see<br/>
Trees, flowers, grass, or corn<br/>
Such a metalline massy globe adorn;<br/>
As splendor blinds<br/>
So hardness binds,<br/>
No fruitfulness it can produce;<br/>
A golden world can't be of any use.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ah me! this world is more divine;<br/>
The wisdom of a God in this doth shine.<br/>
What ails mankind to be so cross?<br/>
The useful earth they count vile dirt and dross,<br/>
And neither prize<br/>
Its equalities<br/>
Nor Donor's love. I fain would know<br/>
How or why men God's goodness disallow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The earth's rare ductile soil,<br/>
Which duly yields unto the plowman's toil<br/>
Its fertile nature, gives offense,<br/>
And its improvement by the influence<br/>
Of Heav'n; for these<br/>
Do not well please,<br/>
Because they do upbraid men's hardened hearts,<br/>
And each of them an evidence imparts.<br/>
He too well knows<br/>
That no fruit grows<br/>
In him, obdurate wretch, who yields<br/>
Obedience to Heav'n less than the fields.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But being, like his loved gold,<br/>
Stiff, barren, and impen'trable, though told<br/>
He should be otherwise, he is<br/>
Uncapable of any heavn'ly bliss.<br/>
His gold and he<br/>
Do well agree,<br/>
For he's a formal hypocrite,<br/>
Like that, unfruitful, yet on th' outside bright.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ah, happy infant! wealthy heir!<br/>
How blessed did the heaven and earth appear<br/>
Before thou knew'st there was a thing<br/>
Called gold! barren of good, of ill the spring<br/>
Beyond compare!<br/>
Most quiet were<br/>
Those infant days when I did see<br/>
Wisdom and wealth couched in simplicity.<br/>

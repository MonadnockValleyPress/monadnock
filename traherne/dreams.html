<h1>Dreams</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<h4>I</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis strange! I saw the skies;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the hills before mine eyes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparrow fly;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lands that did about me lie;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The real sun, that heavenly eye!<br/>
Can closed eyes even in the darkest night<br/>
See through their lids, and be inform'd with sight?<br/>
</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people were to me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As true as those by day I see;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As true the air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth as sweet, as fresh, as fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As that which did by day repair<br/>
Unto my waking sense! Can all the sky,<br/>
Can all the world, within my brain-pan lie?<br/>
</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sacred secret's this,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which seems to intimate my bliss?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow confines of my skin,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is alive and feels within<br/>
When I am dead? Can magnitude possess<br/>
An active memory, yet not be less?<br/>
</p>
<h4>IV</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May all that I can see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awake, by night within me be?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My childhood knew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No difference, but all was true,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As real all as what I view;<br/>
The world itself was there. 'Twas wondrous strange,<br/>
That Heaven and earth should so their place exchange.<br/>
</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till that which vulgar sense<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth falsely call experience,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinguish'd things:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ribbons, and the gaudy wings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of birds, the virtues, and the sins,<br/>
That represented were in dreams by night<br/>
As really my senses did delight,<br/>
</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or grieve, as those I saw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By day: things terrible did awe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul with fear;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The apparitions seem'd as near<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As things could be, and things they were.<br/>
Yet were they all by fancy in me wrought,<br/>
And all their being founded in a thought.<br/>
</p>
<h4>VII</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O what a thing is thought!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which seems a dream; yea, seemeth nought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet doth the mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Affect as much as what we find<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Most near and true! Sure men are blind,<br/>
And can't the forcible reality<br/>
Of things that secret are within them see.<br/>
<h4>VIII</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought! Surely thoughts are true,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They please as much as things can do:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, things are dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in themselves are severed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From souls; nor can they fill the head<br/>
Without our thoughts. Thoughts are the real things<br/>
From whence all joy, from whence all sorrow springs.<br/>

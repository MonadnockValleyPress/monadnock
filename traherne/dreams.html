<h1>Dreams</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<h4>I</h4>
<p>
'Tis strange! I saw the skies;<br/>
I saw the hills before mine eyes;<br/>
The sparrow fly;<br/>
The lands that did about me lie;<br/>
The real sun, that heavenly eye!<br/>
Can closed eyes even in the darkest night<br/>
See through their lids, and be inform'd with sight?<br/>
</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>
The people were to me<br/>
As true as those by day I see;<br/>
As true the air,<br/>
The earth as sweet, as fresh, as fair<br/>
As that which did by day repair<br/>
Unto my waking sense! Can all the sky,<br/>
Can all the world, within my brain-pan lie?<br/>
</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p>
What sacred secret's this,<br/>
Which seems to intimate my bliss?<br/>
What is there in<br/>
The narrow confines of my skin,<br/>
That is alive and feels within<br/>
When I am dead? Can magnitude possess<br/>
An active memory, yet not be less?<br/>
</p>
<h4>IV</h4>
<p>
May all that I can see<br/>
Awake, by night within me be?<br/>
My childhood knew<br/>
No difference, but all was true,<br/>
As real all as what I view;<br/>
The world itself was there. 'Twas wondrous strange,<br/>
That Heaven and earth should so their place exchange.<br/>
</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p>
Till that which vulgar sense<br/>
Doth falsely call experience,<br/>
Distinguish'd things:<br/>
The ribbons, and the gaudy wings<br/>
Of birds, the virtues, and the sins,<br/>
That represented were in dreams by night<br/>
As really my senses did delight,<br/>
</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p>
Or grieve, as those I saw<br/>
By day: things terrible did awe<br/>
My soul with fear;<br/>
The apparitions seem'd as near<br/>
As things could be, and things they were.<br/>
Yet were they all by fancy in me wrought,<br/>
And all their being founded in a thought.<br/>
</p>
<h4>VII</h4>
<p>
O what a thing is thought!<br/>
Which seems a dream; yea, seemeth nought,<br/>
Yet doth the mind<br/>
Affect as much as what we find<br/>
Most near and true! Sure men are blind,<br/>
And can't the forcible reality<br/>
Of things that secret are within them see.<br/>
<h4>VIII</h4>
<p>
Thought! Surely thoughts are true,<br/>
They please as much as things can do:<br/>
Nay, things are dead,<br/>
And in themselves are severed<br/>
From souls; nor can they fill the head<br/>
Without our thoughts. Thoughts are the real things<br/>
From whence all joy, from whence all sorrow springs.<br/>

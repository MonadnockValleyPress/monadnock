<h1>Shadows in the Water</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<p>
In unexperienced infancy<br/>
Many a sweet mistake doth lie:<br/>
Mistake though false, intending true;<br/>
A seeming somewhat more than view;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That doth instruct the mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In things that lie behind,<br/>
And many secrets to us show<br/>
Which afterwards we come to know.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus did I by the water’s brink<br/>
Another world beneath me think;<br/>
And while the lofty spacious skies<br/>
Reversèd there, abused mine eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fancied other feet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came mine to touch or meet;<br/>
As by some puddle I did play<br/>
Another world within it lay.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Beneath the water people drowned,<br/>
Yet with another heaven crowned,<br/>
In spacious regions seemed to go<br/>
As freely moving to and fro:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bright and open space<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw their very face;<br/>
Eyes, hands, and feet they had like mine;<br/>
Another sun did with them shine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
’Twas strange that people there should walk,<br/>
And yet I could not hear them talk;<br/>
That through a little watery chink,<br/>
Which one dry ox or horse might drink,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We other worlds should see,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet not admitted be;<br/>
And other confines there behold<br/>
Of light and darkness, heat and cold.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I called them oft, but called in vain;<br/>
No speeches we could entertain:<br/>
Yet did I there expect to find<br/>
Some other world, to please my mind.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I plainly saw by these<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new antipodes,<br/>
Whom, though they were so plainly seen,<br/>
A film kept off that stood between.<br/>
</p>
<p>
By walking men’s reversèd feet<br/>
I chanced another world to meet;<br/>
Though it did not to view exceed<br/>
A phantom, ’tis a world indeed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where skies beneath us shine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And earth by art divine<br/>
Another face presents below,<br/>
Where people’s feet against ours go.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Within the regions of the air,<br/>
Compassed about with heavens fair,<br/>
Great tracts of land there may be found<br/>
Enriched with fields and fertile ground;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where many numerous hosts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those far distant coasts,<br/>
For other great and glorious ends<br/>
Inhabit, my yet unknown friends.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O ye that stand upon the brink,<br/>
Whom I so near me through the chink<br/>
With wonder see: what faces there,<br/>
Whose feet, whose bodies, do ye wear?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I my companions see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In you, another me.<br/>
They seemèd others, but are we;<br/>
Our second selves these shadows be.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Look how far off those lower skies<br/>
Extend themselves! scarce with mine eyes<br/>
I can them reach. O ye my friends,<br/>
What secret borders on those ends?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are lofty heavens hurled<br/>
’Bout your inferior world?<br/>
Are yet the representatives<br/>
Of other peoples’ distant lives?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of all the playmates which I knew<br/>
That here I do the image view<br/>
In other selves, what can it mean?<br/>
But that below the purling stream<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some unknown joys there be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid up in store for me;<br/>
To which I shall, when that thin skin<br/>
Is broken, be admitted in.<br/>

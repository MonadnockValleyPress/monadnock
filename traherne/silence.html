<h1>Silence</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Traherne</h2>
<p>
A quiet silent person may possess<br/>
All that is great or high in Blessedness.<br/>
The inward work is the supreme: for all<br/>
The other were occasioned by the fall.<br/>
A man that seemeth idle to the view<br/>
Of others, may the greatest business do.<br/>
Those acts which Adam in his innocence<br/>
Performed, carry all the excellence.<br/>
Those outward busy acts he knew not, were<br/>
But meaner matters of a lower sphere.<br/>
Building of churches, giving to the poor,<br/>
In dust and ashes lying on the floor,<br/>
Administering of justice, preaching peace,<br/>
Ploughing and toiling for a forct increase,<br/>
With visiting the sick, or governing<br/>
The rude and ignorant: this was a thing<br/>
As then unknown. For neither ignorance<br/>
Nor poverty, nor sickness did advance<br/>
Their banner in the world, till sin came in.<br/>
Those therefore were occasioned all by sin.<br/>
The first and only work he had to do,<br/>
Was in himself to feel his bliss, to view<br/>
His sacred treasures, to admire, rejoice,<br/>
Sing praises with a sweet and heavenly voice,<br/>
See, prize, give hourly thanks within, and love,<br/>
Which is the high and only work above<br/>
Them all. And this at first was mine; these were<br/>
My exercises of the highest sphere.<br/>
To see, approve, take pleasure, and rejoice<br/>
Within, is better than an empty voice.<br/>
No melody in words can equal that;<br/>
The sweetest organ, lute, or harp is flat<br/>
And dull, compared thereto. And O that still<br/>
I might admire my Father's love and skill!<br/>
This is to honour, worship, and adore,<br/>
This is to love Him: nay, it is far more,<br/>
It is to enjoy Him, and to imitate<br/>
The life and glory of His high Estate.<br/>
'Tis to receive with holy reverence,<br/>
To understand His gifts, and with a sense<br/>
Of pure devotion and humility,<br/>
To prize His works, His Love to magnify.<br/>
O happy ignorance of other things<br/>
Which made me present with that King of Kings!<br/>
And like Him too! All spirit, life, and power,<br/>
All love and joy, in His Eternal Bower,<br/>
A world of innocence as then was mine,<br/>
In which the joys of Paradise did shine:<br/>
And while I was not here I was in Heaven,<br/>
Not resting one, but every, day in seven,<br/>
For ever minding with a lively sense,<br/>
The universe in all its excellence.<br/>
No other thoughts did intervene, to cloy,<br/>
Divert, extinguish, or eclipse my joy,<br/>
No other customs, new-found wants, or dreams<br/>
Invented here polluted my pure streams,<br/>
No aloes or drugs, no wormwood star<br/>
Was seen to fall into the sea from far;<br/>
No rotten soul, did like an apple near<br/>
My soul approach. There's no contagion here.<br/>
An unperceived donor gave all pleasures,<br/>
There nothing was but I, and all my treasures.<br/>
In that fair world, one only was the Friend,<br/>
One golden stream, one spring, one only end.<br/>
There only one did sacrifice and sing<br/>
To only one Eternal Heavenly King.<br/>
The union was so strait between them two,<br/>
That all was either's which my soul could view:<br/>
His gifts and my possessions, both our treasures;<br/>
He mine, and I the ocean of His pleasures.<br/>
He was an ocean of delights from Whom<br/>
The living springs and golden streams did come:<br/>
My bosom was an ocean into which<br/>
They all did run. And me they did enrich.<br/>
A vast and infinite capacity,<br/>
Did make my bosom like the Deity,<br/>
In whose mysterious and celestial mind<br/>
All ages and all worlds together shin'd,<br/>
Who tho' He nothing said did always reign,<br/>
And in Himself Eternity contain.<br/>
The world was more in me, than I in it.<br/>
The King of Glory in my soul did sit,<br/>
And to Himself in me he always gave<br/>
All that He takes delight to see me have,<br/>
For so my spirit was an endless Sphere,<br/>
Like God Himself, and Heaven, and Earth was there.<br/>

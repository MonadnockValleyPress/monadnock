<h1>To Happiness</h1>
<h2>by Robert Lovell</h2>
<p>
Say, lovely fugitive, where dost thou dwell?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Desir'd of all, and sought through every scene,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In pomp of courts, and in the rural green,<br/>
Life's public walk, and hermit's lonely cell.<br/>
Thee, goddess! sought of all, but found by few,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We seek in vain, bewilder'd as we go;<br/>
Tir'd of the chace, man ceases to pursue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sighing, says, thou dwellest not below.<br/>
Does he not after fairy shadows run?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Follows he not some wild illusive dream,<br/>
Like children who would catch the radiant sun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grasp at its image in the glittering stream?<br/>
If right he sought, then man would meet success,<br/>
For surely "Virtue leads to happiness."

<h1>The Wish</h1>
<h2>by Robert Lovell</h2>
<p>
The Muse who struck to moral strains the lyre,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now turns to court a visionary theme,<br/>
To frame the wish which flattering hopes inspire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When fancy revels in her golden dream.
</p>
<p>
I ask no lone retreat, no shady grove,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor grove nor bower can boast a charm for me;<br/>
I muse on Justice, Liberty, and Love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, need I, Orson! tell my wish to thee?
</p>
<p>
I bend, great Justice! at thine awful throne,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal arbiter of good and ill,</br/>
The sons of soul shall make thy laws their own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And form their dictates by thy sov'reign will.
</p>
<p>
But oft perverted is thy high behest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And oft I'm doom'd oppression's rod to see;<br/>
I see wealth triumph, and the poor opprest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, need I, Orson! tell my wish to thee?
</p>
<p>
How bounds the soul at freedom's sacred call?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How shrinks from slavery's heart-appalling train?<br/>
But still her victims avarice will inthral,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Afric's sad sons still wear the accursed chain.
</p>
<p>
Still, power despotic, with ambition join'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would crush the soul determin'd to be free;<br/>
I see debas'd man's dignity of mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, need I, Orson! tell my wish to thee?
</p>
<p>
Were justice follow'd, then would man be good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were freedom guarded, then would man be blest;<br/>
No generous impulse of the soul subdu'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But love, unfraught with anguish, fill the breast.
</p>
<p>
I felt the magic of Lucinda's eye,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought her charms were of no mean degree;<br/>
Lucinda's name inspir'd the secret sigh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, need I, Orson! tell my wish to thee?
</p>
<p>
One only wish remain'd! oh! might I find,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid this scene of danger and of strife,<br/>
Some kindred spirit, some congenial mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To cheer my journey through the vale of life.
</p>
<p>
Indulgent heav'n vouchsafed the boon to send,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth I found, and just and mild was he;<br/>
My heart sprang mutual to embrace its friend,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, need I, Orson! name that friend to thee?

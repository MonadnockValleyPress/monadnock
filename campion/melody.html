<h1>Come, Let Us Sound With Melody</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Campion (1601)</h2>
<p>
Come, let us sound with melody, the praises
Of the king's king, th' omnipotent creator,
Author of number, that hath all the world in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmonie framed.
</p>
<p>
Heav'n is His throne perpetually shining,
His divine power and glorie, thence he thunders,
One in all, and all still in one abiding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Father and Sonne.
</p>
<p>
O sacred sprite, invisible, eternal
Ev'ry where, yet unlimited, that all things
Cans't in one moment penetrate, revive me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
Rescue, O rescue me from earthly darkness,
Banish hence all these elementall objects,
guide my soule that thirsts to the lively Fountaine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy divineness.
</p>
<p>
Cleanse my soule, O God, thy bespotted Image,
Altered with sinne so that heav'nly pureness
Cannot acknowledge me, but in thy mercies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Father of grace.
</p>
<p>
But when once thy beames do remove my darkness,
O then I'll shine forth as an Angel of light,
And record, with more than an earthly voice, thy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infinite honours.

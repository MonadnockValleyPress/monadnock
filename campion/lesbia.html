<h1>My Sweetest Lesbia</h1>
<h2>by Thomas Campion (1601)</h2>
<p>
My sweetest Lesbia, let us live and love,<br/>
And though the sager sort our deeds reprove,<br/>
Let us not weigh them: heav'ns great lamps do dive<br/>
Into their west, and straight again revive,<br/>
But soon as once set is our little light,<br/>
Then must we sleep one ever-during night.
</p>
<p>
If all would lead their lives in love like me,<br/>
Then bloody swords and armour should not be,<br/>
No drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move,<br/>
Unless alarm came from the camp of love:<br/>
But fools do live, and waste their little light,<br/>
And seek with pain their ever-during night.
</p>
<p>
When timely death my life and fortune ends,<br/>
Let not my hearse be vex't with mourning friends,<br/>
But let all lovers rich in triumph come,<br/>
And with sweet pastimes grace my happy tomb;<br/>
And Lesbia close up thou my little light,<br/>
And crown with love my ever-during night.
</p>

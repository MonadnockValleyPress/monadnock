<h1>A Song to Amoret</h1>
<h2>by Henry Vaughan</h2>
<p>
If I were dead, and in my place<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fresher youth design'd<br/>
To warm thee with new fires, and grace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those arms I left behind;<br/>
</p>
<p>
Were he as faithful as the sun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's wedded to the sphere;<br/>
His blood as chaste and temp'rate run,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As April's mildest tear;<br/>
</p>
<p>
Or were he rich, and with his heaps<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spacious share of earth,<br/>
Could make divine affection cheap,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And court his golden birth:<br/>
</p>
<p>
For all these arts I'd not believe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;No, though he should be thine&mdash;<br/>
The mighty amorist could give<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So rich a heart as mine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fortune and beauty thou might'st find,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And greater men than I:<br/>
But my true resolv√®d mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never shall come nigh.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For I not for an hour did love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or for a day desire,<br/>
But with my soul had from above<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This endless, holy fire.<br/>

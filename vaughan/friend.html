<h1>To My Worthy Friend, Master T. Lewes</h1>
<h2>by Henry Vaughan</h2>
<p>
Sees not my friend, what a deep snow<br/>
Candies our country's woody brow?<br/>
The yielding branch his load scarce bears,<br/>
Oppress'd with snow and frozen tears;<br/>
While the dumb rivers slowly float,<br/>
All bound up in an icy coat.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Let us meet then! and while this world<br/>
In wild eccentrics now is hurl'd,<br/>
Keep we, like nature, the same key,<br/>
And walk in our forefathers' way.<br/>
Why any more cast we an eye<br/>
On what may come, not what is nigh?<br/>
Why vex ourselves with fear, or hope<br/>
And cares beyond our horoscope?<br/>
Who into future times would peer,<br/>
Looks oft beyond his term set here,<br/>
And cannot go into those grounds<br/>
But through a churchyard, which them bounds.<br/>
Sorrows and sighs and searches spend<br/>
And draw our bottom to an end,<br/>
But discreet joys lengthen the lease,<br/>
Without which life were a disease;<br/>
And who this age a mourner goes,<br/>
Doth with his tears but feed his foes.<br/>
</p>

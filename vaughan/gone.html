<h1>To Amoret Gone from Him</h1>
<h2>by Henry Vaughan</h2>
<p>
Fancy and I, last evening, walk'd,<br/>
And Amoret, of thee we talk'd;<br/>
The West just then had stolen the sun,<br/>
And his last blushes were begun:<br/>
We sate, and mark'd how everything<br/>
Did mourn his absence: how the spring<br/>
That smil'd and curl'd about his beams,<br/>
Whilst he was here, now check'd her streams:<br/>
The wanton eddies of her face<br/>
Were taught less noise, and smoother grace;<br/>
And in a slow, sad channel went,<br/>
Whisp'ring the banks their discontent:<br/>
The careless ranks of flowers that spread<br/>
Their perfum'd bosoms to his head.<br/>
And with an open, free embrace,<br/>
Did entertain his beamy face,<br/>
Like absent friends point to the West,<br/>
And on that weak reflection feast.<br/>
If creatures then that have no sense,<br/>
But the loose tie of influence,<br/>
Though fate and time each day remove<br/>
Those things that element their love,<br/>
At such vast distance can agree,<br/>
Why, Amoret, why should not we?<br/>

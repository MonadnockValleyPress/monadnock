<h1>To His Books</h1>
<h2>by Henry Vaughan</h2>
<p>
Bright books! the perspectives to our weak sights,<br/>
The clear projections of discerning lights,<br/>
Burning and shining thoughts, man's posthume day,<br/>
The track of fled souls, and their Milky Way,<br/>
The dead alive and busy, the still voice<br/>
Of enlarg'd spirits, kind Heav'n's white decoys!<br/>
Who lives with you, lives like those knowing flow'rs,<br/>
Which in commerce with light spend all their hours:<br/>
Which shut to clouds, and shadows nicely shun,<br/>
But with glad haste unveil to kiss the sun.<br/>
Beneath you, all is dark, and a dead night,<br/>
Which whoso lives in, wants both health and sight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
By sucking you, the wise&mdash;like bees&mdash;do grow<br/>
Healing and rich, though this they do most slow,<br/>
Because most choicely; for as great a store<br/>
Have we of books, as bees of herbs, or more:<br/>
And the great task, to try, then know, the good.<br/>
To discern weeds, and judge of wholesome food,<br/>
Is a rare, scant performance: for man dies<br/>
Oft ere 'tis done, while the bee feeds and flies.<br/>
But you were all choice flow'rs, all set and drest<br/>
By old sage florists, who well knew the best:<br/>
And I amidst you all am turned a weed!<br/>
Not wanting knowledge, but for want of heed.<br/>
Then thank thyself, wild fool, that wouldst not be<br/>
Content to know&mdash;what was too much for thee!<br/>

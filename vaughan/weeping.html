<h1>To Amoret Weeping</h1>
<h2>by Henry Vaughan</h2>
<p>
Leave Amoret, melt not away so fast<br/>
Thy eyes' fair treasure; Fortune's wealthiest cast<br/>
Deserves not one such pearl; for these, well spent,<br/>
Can purchase stars, and buy a tenement<br/>
For us in heaven; though here the pious streams<br/>
Avail us not; who from that clue of sunbeams<br/>
Could ever steal one thread? or with a kind<br/>
Persuasive accent charm the wild loud wind?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fate cuts us all in marble, and the Book<br/>
Forestalls our glass of minutes; we may look<br/>
But seldom meet a change; think you a tear<br/>
Can blot the flinty volume? shall our fear<br/>
Or grief add to their triumphs? and must we<br/>
Give an advantage to adversity?<br/>
Dear, idle prodigal! is it not just<br/>
We bear our stars? What though I had not dust<br/>
Enough to cabinet a worm? nor stand<br/>
Enslav'd unto a little dirt, or sand?<br/>
I boast a better purchase, and can show<br/>
The glories of a soul that's simply true.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But grant some richer planet at my birth<br/>
Had spied me out, and measur'd so much earth<br/>
Or gold unto my share: I should have been<br/>
Slave to these lower elements, and seen<br/>
My high-born soul flag with their dross, and lie<br/>
A pris'ner to base mud, and alchemy.<br/>
I should perhaps eat orphans, and suck up<br/>
A dozen distress'd widows in one cup;<br/>
Nay, further, I should by that lawful stealth,<br/>
Damn'd usury, undo the commonwealth;<br/>
Or patent it in soap, and coals, and so<br/>
Have the smiths curse me, and my laundress too;<br/>
Geld wine, or his friend tobacco; and so bring<br/>
The incens'd subject rebel to his king;<br/>
And after all&mdash;as those first sinners fell&mdash;<br/>
Sink lower than my gold, and lie in hell.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thanks then for this deliv'rance! blessed pow'rs,<br/>
You that dispense man's fortune and his hours,<br/>
How am I to you all engag'd! that thus<br/>
By such strange means, almost miraculous,<br/>
You should preserve me; you have gone the way<br/>
To make me rich by taking all away.<br/>
For I&mdash;had I been rich&mdash;as sure as fate,<br/>
Would have been meddling with the king, or State,<br/>
Or something to undo me; and 'tis fit,<br/>
We know, that who hath wealth should have no wit,<br/>
But, above all, thanks to that Providence<br/>
That arm'd me with a gallant soul, and sense,<br/>
'Gainst all misfortunes, that hath breath'd so much<br/>
Of Heav'n into me, that I scorn the touch<br/>
Of these low things; and can with courage dare<br/>
Whatever fate or malice can prepare:<br/>
I envy no man's purse or mines: I know<br/>
That, losing them, I've lost their curses too;<br/>
And Amoret&mdash;although our share in these<br/>
Is not contemptible, nor doth much please&mdash;<br/>
Yet, whilst content and love we jointly vie,<br/>
We have a blessing which no gold can buy.<br/>

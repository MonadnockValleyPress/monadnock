<h1>Etesia Absent</h1>
<h2>by Henry Vaughan</h2>
<p>
Love, the world's life! what a sad death<br/>
Thy absence is! to lose our breath<br/>
At once and die, is but to live<br/>
Enlarg'd, without the scant reprieve<br/>
Of pulse and air; whose dull returns<br/>
And narrow circles the soul mourns.<br/>
But to be dead alive, and still<br/>
To wish, but never have our will,<br/>
To be possess'd, and yet to miss,<br/>
To wed a true but absent bliss,<br/>
Are ling'ring tortures, and their smart<br/>
Dissects and racks and grinds the heart!<br/>
As soul and body in that state<br/>
Which unto us, seems separate,<br/>
Cannot be said to live, until<br/>
Reunion; which days fulfil<br/>
And slow-pac'd seasons; so in vain<br/>
Through hours and minutes&mdash;Time's long train&mdash;<br/>
I look for thee, and from thy sight,<br/>
As from my soul, for life and light.<br/>
For till thine eyes shine so on me,<br/>
Mine are fast-clos'd and will not see.<br/>

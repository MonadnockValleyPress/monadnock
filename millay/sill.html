<h1>There Was Upon the Sill</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
There was upon the sill a pencil mark,<br/>
Vital with shadow when the sun stood still<br/>
At noon, but now, because the day was dark,<br/>
It was a pencil mark upon the sill.<br/>
And the mute clock, maintaining ever the same<br/>
Dead moment, blank and vacant of itself,<br/>
Was a pink shepherdess, a picture frame,<br/>
A shell marked Souvenir, there on the shelf.<br/>
Whence it occurred to her that <em>he</em> might be,<br/>
The mainspring being broken in his mind,<br/>
A clock himself, if one were so inclined,<br/>
That stood at twenty minutes after three&mdash;<br/>
The reason being for this, it might be said,<br/>
That things in death were neither clocks nor people, but only dead.

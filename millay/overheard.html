<h1>She Is Overheard Singing</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p><em>(This poem follows <a href='singing-woman.html'>The Singing-Woman from the Wood's Edge</a>.)</em></p>
<p>
Oh, Prue she has a patient man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Joan a gentle lover,<br/>
And Agatha's Arth' is a hug-the-hearth,&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my true love's a rover!
</p>
<p>
Mig, her man's as good as cheese<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And honest as a briar,<br/>
Sue tells her love what he's thinking of,&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my dear lad's a liar!
</p>
<p>
Oh, Sue and Prue and Agatha<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are thick with Mig and Joan!<br/>
They bite their threads and shake their heads<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gnaw my name like a bone;
</p>
<p>
And Prue says, "Mine's a patient man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As never snaps me up,"<br/>
And Agatha, "Arth' is a hug-the-hearth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could live content in a cup;"
</p>
<p>
Sue's man's mind is like good jell&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All one colour, and clear &#151;<br/>
And Mig's no call to think at all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's to come next year,
</p>
<p>
While Joan makes boast of a gentle lad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's troubled with that and this;&#151;<br/>
But they all would give the life they live<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a look from the man I kiss!
</p>
<p>
Cold he slants his eyes about,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And few enough's his choice,&#151;<br/>
Though he'd slip me clean for a nun, or a queen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a beggar with knots in her voice,&#151;
</p>
<p>
And Agatha will turn awake<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While her good man sleeps sound,<br/>
And Mig and Sue and Joan and Prue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will hear the clock strike round,
</p>
<p>
For Prue she has a patient man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As asks not when or why,<br/>
And Mig and Sue have naught to do<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But peep who's passing by,
</p>
<p>
Joan is paired with a putterer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bastes and tastes and salts,<br/>
And Agatha's Arth' is a hug-the-hearth,&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my true love is false!

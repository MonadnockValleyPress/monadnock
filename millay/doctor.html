<h1>The Doctor Asked Her</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
The doctor asked her what she wanted done<br/>
With him, that could not lie there many days.<br/>
And she was shocked to see how life goes on<br/>
Even after death, in irritating ways;<br/>
And mused how if he had not died at all<br/>
'Twould have been easier&mdash;then there need not be<br/>
The stiff disorder of a funeral<br/>
Everywhere, and the hideous industry,<br/>
And crowds of people calling her by name<br/>
And questioning her, she'd never seen before,<br/>
But only watching by his bed once more<br/>
And sitting silent if a knocking came . . .<br/>
She said at length, feeling the doctor's eyes,<br/>
"I don't know what you do exactly when a person dies."

<h1>The Bean-Stalk</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Ho, Giant!  This is I!<br/>
I have built me a bean-stalk into your sky!<br/>
La,&#151;but it's lovely, up so high!
</p>
<p>
This is how I came,&#151;I put<br/>
Here my knee, there my foot,<br/>
Up and up, from shoot to shoot&#151;<br/>
And the blessed bean-stalk thinning<br/>
Like the mischief all the time,<br/>
Till it took me rocking, spinning,<br/>
In a dizzy, sunny circle,<br/>
Making angles with the root,<br/>
Far and out above the cackle<br/>
Of the city I was born in,<br/>
Till the little dirty city<br/>
In the light so sheer and sunny<br/>
Shone as dazzling bright and pretty<br/>
As the money that you find<br/>
In a dream of finding money&#151;<br/>
What a wind!  What a morning!&#151;
</p>
<p>
Till the tiny, shiny city,<br/>
When I shot a glance below,<br/>
Shaken with a giddy laughter,<br/>
Sick and blissfully afraid,<br/>
Was a dew-drop on a blade,<br/>
And a pair of moments after<br/>
Was the whirling guess I made,&#151;<br/>
And the wind was like a whip
</p>
<p>
Cracking past my icy ears,<br/>
And my hair stood out behind,<br/>
And my eyes were full of tears,<br/>
Wide-open and cold,<br/>
More tears than they could hold,<br/>
The wind was blowing so,<br/>
And my teeth were in a row,<br/>
Dry and grinning,<br/>
And I felt my foot slip,<br/>
And I scratched the wind and whined,<br/>
And I clutched the stalk and jabbered,<br/>
With my eyes shut blind,&#151;<br/>
What a wind!  What a wind!
</p>
<p>
Your broad sky, Giant,<br/>
Is the shelf of a cupboard;<br/>
I make bean-stalks, I'm<br/>
A builder, like yourself,<br/>
But bean-stalks is my trade,<br/>
I couldn't make a shelf,<br/>
Don't know how they're made,<br/>
Now, a bean-stalk is more pliant&#151;<br/>
La, what a climb!

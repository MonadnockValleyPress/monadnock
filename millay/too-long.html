<h1>Sonnet: "When I too long have looked upon your face"</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
When I too long have looked upon your face,<br/>
Wherein for me a brightness unobscured<br/>
Save by the mists of brightness has its place,<br/>
And terrible beauty not to be endured,<br/>
I turn away reluctant from your light,<br/>
And stand irresolute, a mind undone,<br/>
A silly, dazzled thing deprived of sight<br/>
From having looked too long upon the sun.<br/>
Then is my daily life a narrow room<br/>
In which a little while, uncertainly,<br/>
Surrounded by impenetrable gloom,<br/>
Among familiar things grown strange to me<br/>
Making my way, I pause, and feel, and hark,<br/>
Till I become accustomed to the dark.

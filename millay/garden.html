<h1>Sonnet: "No rose that in a garden ever grew"</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
No rose that in a garden ever grew,<br/>
In Homer's or in Omar's or in mine,<br/>
Though buried under centuries of fine<br/>
Dead dust of roses, shut from sun and dew<br/>
Forever, and forever lost from view,<br/>
But must again in fragrance rich as wine<br/>
The grey aisles of the air incarnadine<br/>
When the old summers surge into a new.<br/>
Thus when I swear, "I love with all my heart,"<br/>
'Tis with the heart of Lilith that I swear,<br/>
'Tis with the love of Lesbia and Lucrece;<br/>
And thus as well my love must lose some part<br/>
Of what it is, had Helen been less fair,<br/>
Or perished young, or stayed at home in Greece.

<h1>Sonnet: "I think I should have loved you presently"</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I think I should have loved you presently,<br/>
And given in earnest words I flung in jest;<br/>
And lifted honest eyes for you to see,<br/>
And caught your hand against my cheek and breast;<br/>
And all my pretty follies flung aside<br/>
That won you to me, and beneath your gaze,<br/>
Naked of reticence and shorn of pride,<br/>
Spread like a chart my little wicked ways.<br/>
I, that had been to you, had you remained,<br/>
But one more waking from a recurrent dream,<br/>
Cherish no less the certain stakes I gained,<br/>
And walk your memory's halls, austere, supreme,<br/>
A ghost in marble of a girl you knew<br/>
Who would have loved you in a day or two.

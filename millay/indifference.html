<h1>Indifference</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I said, &#151; for Love was laggard, O, Love was slow to come, &#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll hear his step and know his step when I am warm in bed;<br/>
But I'll never leave my pillow, though there be some<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As would let him in &#151; and take him in with tears!" I said.<br/>
I lay, &#151; for Love was laggard, O, he came not until dawn, &#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lay and listened for his step and could not get to sleep;<br/>
And he found me at my window with my big cloak on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sorry with the tears some folks might weep!

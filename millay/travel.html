<h1>Travel</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
The railroad track is miles away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the day is loud with voices speaking,<br/>
Yet there isn't a train goes by all day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I hear its whistle shrieking.
</p>
<p>
All night there isn't a train goes by,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming<br/>
But I see its cinders red on the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear its engine steaming.
</p>
<p>
My heart is warm with the friends I make,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And better friends I'll not be knowing,<br/>
Yet there isn't a train I wouldn't take,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter where it's going.

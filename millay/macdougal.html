<h1>Macdougal Street</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
As I went walking up and down to take the evening air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Sweet to meet upon the street, why must I be so shy?)<br/>
I saw him lay his hand upon her torn black hair;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;("Little dirty Latin child, let the lady by!")
</p>
<p>
The women squatting on the stoops were slovenly and fat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Lay me out in organdie, lay me out in lawn!)<br/>
And everywhere I stepped there was a baby or a cat;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Lord God in Heaven, will it never be dawn?)
</p>
<p>
The fruit-carts and clam-carts were ribald as a fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Pink nets and wet shells trodden under heel)<br/>
She had haggled from the fruit-man of his rotting ware;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I shall never get to sleep, the way I feel!)
</p>
<p>
He walked like a king through the filth and the clutter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Sweet to meet upon the street, why did you glance me by?)<br/>
But he caught the quaint Italian quip she flung him from the gutter;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(What can there be to cry about that I should lie and cry?)
</p>
<p>
He laid his darling hand upon her little black head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I wish I were a ragged child with ear-rings in my ears!)<br/>
And he said she was a baggage to have said what she had said;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Truly I shall be ill unless I stop these tears!)

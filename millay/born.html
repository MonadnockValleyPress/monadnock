<h1>I, Being Born a Woman</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I, being born a woman and distressed<br/>
By all the needs and notions of my kind,<br/>
Am urged by your propinquity to find<br/>
Your person fair, and feel a certain zest<br/>
To bear your body's weight upon my breast:<br/>
So subtly is the fume of life designed,<br/>
To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,<br/>
And leave me once again undone, possessed.<br/>
Think not for this, however, the poor treason<br/>
Of my stout blood against my staggering brain,<br/>
I shall remember you with love, or season<br/>
My scorn with pity,&mdash;let me make it plain:<br/>
I find this frenzy insufficient reason<br/>
For conversation when we meet again.

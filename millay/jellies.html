<h1>She Let Them Leave Their Jellies</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
She let them leave their jellies at the door<br/>
And go away, reluctant, down the walk.<br/>
She heard them talking as they passed before<br/>
The blind, but could not quite make out their talk<br/>
For noise in the room&mdash;the sudden heavy fall<br/>
And roll of a charred log, and the roused shower<br/>
Of snapping sparks; then sharply from the wall<br/>
The unforgivable crowing of the hour.<br/>
One instant set ajar, her quiet ear<br/>
Was stormed and forced by the full rout of day:<br/>
The rasp of a saw, the fussy cluck and bray<br/>
Of hens, the wheeze of a pump, she needs must hear;<br/>
She inescapably must endure to feel<br/>
Across her teeth the grinding of a backing wagon wheel.

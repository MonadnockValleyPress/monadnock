<h1>Recuerdo</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
We were very tired, we were very merry&#151;<br/>
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.<br/>
It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable&#151;<br/>
But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,<br/>
We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;<br/>
And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon.
</p>
<p>
We were very tired, we were very merry&#151;<br/>
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;<br/>
And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,<br/>
From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;<br/>
And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,<br/>
And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.
</p>
<p>
We were very tired, we were very merry,<br/>
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.<br/>
We hailed, "Good morrow, mother!" to a shawl-covered head,<br/>
And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;<br/>
And she wept, "God bless you!" for the apples and pears,<br/>
And we gave her all our money but our subway fares.

<h1>Second April</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay (1921)</h2>

<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>
To what purpose, April, do you return again?<br />
Beauty is not enough.<br />
You can no longer quiet me with the redness<br />
Of little leaves opening stickily.<br />
I know what I know.<br />
The sun is hot on my neck as I observe<br />
The spikes of the crocus.<br />
The smell of the earth is good.<br />
It is apparent that there is no death.<br />
But what does that signify?<br />
Not only under ground are the brains of men<br />
Eaten by maggots,<br />
Life in itself<br />
Is nothing,<br />
An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.<br />
It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,<br />
April<br />
Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.<br />
</p>

<h3>City Trees</h3>
<p>
The trees along this city street,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save for the traffic and the trains,<br />
Would make a sound as thin and sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As trees in country lanes.
</p>
<p>
And people standing in their shade<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of a shower, undoubtedly<br />
Would hear such music as is made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a country tree.
</p>
<p>
Oh, little leaves that are so dumb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the shrieking city air,<br />
I watch you when the wind has come,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know what sound is there.
</p>

<h3>The Blue-Flag in the Bog</h3>
<p>
God had called us, and we came;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our loved Earth to ashes left;<br />
Heaven was a neighbor's house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open to us, bereft.
</p>
<p>
Gay the lights of Heaven showed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'twas God who walked ahead;<br />
Yet I wept along the road,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanting my own house instead.
</p>
<p>
Wept unseen, unheeded cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All you things my eyes have kissed,<br />
Fare you well!  We meet no more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely, lovely tattered mist!
</p>
<p>
Weary wings that rise and fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long above the fire!"&#151;<br />
Red with heat was every wall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough with heat was every wire&#151;
</p>
<p>
"Fare you well, you little winds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the flying embers chase!<br />
Fare you well, you shuddering day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your hands before your face!
</p>
<p>
And, ah, blackened by strange blight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to a false sun unfurled,<br />
Now forevermore goodbye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gardens in the world!
</p>
<p>
On the windless hills of Heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I have no wish to see,<br />
White, eternal lilies stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a lake of ebony.
</p>
<p>
But the Earth forevermore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a place where nothing grows,&#151;<br />
Dawn will come, and no bud break;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evening, and no blossom close.
</p>
<p>
Spring will come, and wander slow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over an indifferent land,<br />
Stand beside an empty creek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold a dead seed in her hand."
</p>
<p>
God had called us, and we came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the blessed road I trod<br />
Was a bitter road to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at heart I questioned God.
</p>
<p>
"Though in Heaven," I said, "be all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the heart would most desire,<br />
Held Earth naught save souls of sinners<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worth the saving from a fire?
</p>
<p>
Withered grass,&#151;the wasted growing!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aimless ache of laden boughs!"<br />
Little things God had forgotten<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called me, from my burning house.
</p>
<p>
"Though in Heaven," I said, "be all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the eye could ask to see,<br />
All the things I ever knew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are this blaze in back of me."
</p>
<p>
"Though in Heaven," I said, "be all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the ear could think to lack,<br />
All the things I ever knew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are this roaring at my back."
</p>
<p>
It was God who walked ahead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a shepherd to the fold;<br />
In his footsteps fared the weak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the weary and the old,
</p>
<p>
Glad enough of gladness over,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready for the peace to be,&#151;<br />
But a thing God had forgotten<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the growing bones of me.
</p>
<p>
And I drew a bit apart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I lagged a bit behind,<br />
And I thought on Peace Eternal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest He look into my mind:
</p>
<p>
And I gazed upon the sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I thought of Heavenly Rest,&#151;<br />
And I slipped away like water<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the fingers of the blest!
</p>
<p>
All their eyes were fixed on Glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a glance brushed over me;<br />
"Alleluia!  Alleluia!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the road,&#151;and I was free.
</p>
<p>
And my heart rose like a freshet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it swept me on before,<br />
Giddy as a whirling stick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I felt the earth once more.
</p>
<p>
All the earth was charred and black,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire had swept from pole to pole;<br />
And the bottom of the sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was as brittle as a bowl;
</p>
<p>
And the timbered mountain-top<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was as naked as a skull,&#151;<br />
Nothing left, nothing left,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Earth so beautiful!
</p>
<p>
"Earth," I said, "how can I leave you?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are all I have," I said;<br />
"What is left to take my mind up,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living always, and you dead?"
</p>
<p>
"Speak!" I said, "Oh, tell me something!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a sign that I can see!<br />
For a keepsake!  To keep always!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick!&#151;before God misses me!"
</p>
<p>
And I listened for a voice;&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my heart was all I heard;<br />
Not a screech-owl, not a loon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a tree-toad said a word.
</p>
<p>
And I waited for a sign;&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coals and cinders, nothing more;<br />
And a little cloud of smoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating on a valley floor.
</p>
<p>
And I peered into the smoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it rotted, like a fog:&#151;<br />
There, encompassed round by fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood a blue-flag in a bog!
</p>
<p>
Little flames came wading out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straining, straining towards its stem,<br />
But it was so blue and tall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it scorned to think of them!
</p>
<p>
Red and thirsty were their tongues,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the tongues of wolves must be,<br />
But it was so blue and tall&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see!
</p>
<p>
All my heart became a tear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my soul became a tower,<br />
Never loved I anything<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I loved that tall blue flower!
</p>
<p>
It was all the little boats<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had ever sailed the sea,<br />
It was all the little books<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had gone to school with me;
</p>
<p>
On its roots like iron claws<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rearing up so blue and tall,&#151;<br />
It was all the gallant Earth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its back against a wall!
</p>
<p>
In a breath, ere I had breathed,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see!&#151;<br />
I was kneeling at its side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it leaned its head on me!
</p>
<p>
Crumbling stones and sliding sand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the road to Heaven now;<br />
Icy at my straining knees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drags the awful under-tow;
</p>
<p>
Soon but stepping-stones of dust<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the road to Heaven be,&#151;<br />
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach a hand and rescue me!
</p>
<p>
"There&#151;there, my blue-flag flower;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush&#151;hush&#151;go to sleep;<br />
That is only God you hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counting up His folded sheep!
</p>
<p>
Lullabye&#151;lullabye&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is only God that calls,<br />
Missing me, seeking me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the road to nothing falls!
</p>
<p>
He will set His mighty feet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firmly on the sliding sand;<br />
Like a little frightened bird<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will creep into His hand;
</p>
<p>
I will tell Him all my grief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell Him all my sin;<br />
He will give me half His robe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a cloak to wrap you in.
</p>
<p>
Lullabye&#151;lullabye&#151;"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocks the burnt-out planet free!&#151;<br />
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach a hand and rescue me!
</p>
<p>
Ah, the voice of love at last!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo, at last the face of light!<br />
And the whole of His white robe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a cloak against the night!
</p>
<p>
And upon my heart asleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the things I ever knew!&#151;<br />
"Holds Heaven not some cranny, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a flower so tall and blue?"
</p>
<p>
All's well and all's well!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gay the lights of Heaven show!<br />
In some moist and Heavenly place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will set it out to grow.
</p>

<h3>Journey</h3>
<p>
Ah, could I lay me down in this long grass<br />
And close my eyes, and let the quiet wind<br />
Blow over me&#151;I am so tired, so tired<br />
Of passing pleasant places!  All my life,<br />
Following Care along the dusty road,<br />
Have I looked back at loveliness and sighed;<br />
Yet at my hand an unrelenting hand<br />
Tugged ever, and I passed.  All my life long<br />
Over my shoulder have I looked at peace;<br />
And now I fain would lie in this long grass<br />
And close my eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet onward!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cat birds call<br />
Through the long afternoon, and creeks at dusk<br />
Are guttural.  Whip-poor-wills wake and cry,<br />
Drawing the twilight close about their throats.<br />
Only my heart makes answer.  Eager vines<br />
Go up the rocks and wait; flushed apple-trees<br />
Pause in their dance and break the ring for me;<br />
Dim, shady wood-roads, redolent of fern<br />
And bayberry, that through sweet bevies thread<br />
Of round-faced roses, pink and petulant,<br />
Look back and beckon ere they disappear.<br />
Only my heart, only my heart responds.<br />
Yet, ah, my path is sweet on either side<br />
All through the dragging day,&#151;sharp underfoot<br />
And hot, and like dead mist the dry dust hangs&#151;<br />
But far, oh, far as passionate eye can reach,<br />
And long, ah, long as rapturous eye can cling,<br />
The world is mine: blue hill, still silver lake,<br />
Broad field, bright flower, and the long white road<br />
A gateless garden, and an open path:<br />
My feet to follow, and my heart to hold.
</p>

<h3>Eel-Grass</h3>
<p>
No matter what I say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that I really love<br />
Is the rain that flattens on the bay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the eel-grass in the cove;<br />
The jingle-shells that lie and bleach<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the tide-line, and the trace<br />
Of higher tides along the beach:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this place.
</p>

<h3>Elegy Before Death</h3>
<p>
There will be rose and rhododendron<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are dead and under ground;<br />
Still will be heard from white syringas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy with bees, a sunny sound;
</p>
<p>
Still will the tamaracks be raining<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the rain has ceased, and still<br />
Will there be robins in the stubble,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown sheep upon the warm green hill.
</p>
<p>
Spring will not ail nor autumn falter;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing will know that you are gone,<br />
Saving alone some sullen plough-land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None but yourself sets foot upon;
</p>
<p>
Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing will know that you are dead,&#151;<br />
These, and perhaps a useless wagon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing beside some tumbled shed.
</p>
<p>
Oh, there will pass with your great passing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little of beauty not your own,&#151;<br />
Only the light from common water,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the grace from simple stone!
</p>

<h3>The Bean-Stalk</h3>
<p>
Ho, Giant!  This is I!<br />
I have built me a bean-stalk into your sky!<br />
La,&#151;but it's lovely, up so high!
</p>
<p>
This is how I came,&#151;I put<br />
Here my knee, there my foot,<br />
Up and up, from shoot to shoot&#151;<br />
And the blessed bean-stalk thinning<br />
Like the mischief all the time,<br />
Till it took me rocking, spinning,<br />
In a dizzy, sunny circle,<br />
Making angles with the root,<br />
Far and out above the cackle<br />
Of the city I was born in,<br />
Till the little dirty city<br />
In the light so sheer and sunny<br />
Shone as dazzling bright and pretty<br />
As the money that you find<br />
In a dream of finding money&#151;<br />
What a wind!  What a morning!&#151;
</p>
<p>
Till the tiny, shiny city,<br />
When I shot a glance below,<br />
Shaken with a giddy laughter,<br />
Sick and blissfully afraid,<br />
Was a dew-drop on a blade,<br />
And a pair of moments after<br />
Was the whirling guess I made,&#151;<br />
And the wind was like a whip
</p>
<p>
Cracking past my icy ears,<br />
And my hair stood out behind,<br />
And my eyes were full of tears,<br />
Wide-open and cold,<br />
More tears than they could hold,<br />
The wind was blowing so,<br />
And my teeth were in a row,<br />
Dry and grinning,<br />
And I felt my foot slip,<br />
And I scratched the wind and whined,<br />
And I clutched the stalk and jabbered,<br />
With my eyes shut blind,&#151;<br />
What a wind!  What a wind!
</p>
<p>
Your broad sky, Giant,<br />
Is the shelf of a cupboard;<br />
I make bean-stalks, I'm<br />
A builder, like yourself,<br />
But bean-stalks is my trade,<br />
I couldn't make a shelf,<br />
Don't know how they're made,<br />
Now, a bean-stalk is more pliant&#151;<br />
La, what a climb!
</p>

<h3>Weeds</h3>
<p>
White with daisies and red with sorrel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And empty, empty under the sky!&#151;<br />
Life is a quest and love a quarrel&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a place for me to lie.
</p>
<p>
Daisies spring from damned seeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this red fire that here I see<br />
Is a worthless crop of crimson weeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed by farmers thriftily.
</p>
<p>
But here, unhated for an hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorrel runs in ragged flame,<br />
The daisy stands, a bastard flower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like flowers that bear an honest name.
</p>
<p>
And here a while, where no wind brings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baying of a pack athirst,<br />
May sleep the sleep of blessed things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood too bright, the brow accurst.
</p>

<h3>Passer Mortuus Est</h3>
<p>
Death devours all lovely things;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lesbia with her sparrow<br />
Shares the darkness,&#151;presently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every bed is narrow.
</p>
<p>
Unremembered as old rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dries the sheer libation,<br />
And the little petulant hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is an annotation.
</p>
<p>
After all, my erstwhile dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My no longer cherished,<br />
Need we say it was not love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that love is perished?
</p>

<h3>Pastoral</h3>
<p>
If it were only still!&#151;<br />
With far away the shrill<br />
Crying of a cock;<br />
Or the shaken bell<br />
From a cow's throat<br />
Moving through the bushes;<br />
Or the soft shock<br />
Of wizened apples falling<br />
From an old tree<br />
In a forgotten orchard<br />
Upon the hilly rock!
</p>
<p>
Oh, grey hill,<br />
Where the grazing herd<br />
Licks the purple blossom,<br />
Crops the spiky weed!<br />
Oh, stony pasture,<br />
Where the tall mullein<br />
Stands up so sturdy<br />
On its little seed!
</p>

<h3>Assault</h3>

<h4>I</h4>
<p>
I had forgotten how the frogs must sound<br />
After a year of silence, else I think<br />
I should not so have ventured forth alone<br />
At dusk upon this unfrequented road.
</p>

<h4>II</h4>
<p>
I am waylaid by Beauty.  Who will walk<br />
Between me and the crying of the frogs?<br />
Oh, savage Beauty, suffer me to pass,<br />
That am a timid woman, on her way<br />
From one house to another!
</p>

<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>
The railroad track is miles away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the day is loud with voices speaking,<br />
Yet there isn't a train goes by all day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I hear its whistle shrieking.
</p>
<p>
All night there isn't a train goes by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming<br />
But I see its cinders red on the sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear its engine steaming.
</p>
<p>
My heart is warm with the friends I make,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And better friends I'll not be knowing,<br />
Yet there isn't a train I wouldn't take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter where it's going.
</p>

<h3>Low-Tide</h3>
<p>
These wet rocks where the tide has been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barnacled white and weeded brown<br />
And slimed beneath to a beautiful green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wet rocks where the tide went down<br />
Will show again when the tide is high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faint and perilous, far from shore,<br />
No place to dream, but a place to die,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the sea once more.<br />
There was a child that wandered through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A giant's empty house all day,&#151;<br />
House full of wonderful things and new,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no fit place for a child to play.
</p>

<h3>Song of a Second April</h3>
<p>
April this year, not otherwise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than April of a year ago,<br />
Is full of whispers, full of sighs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dazzling mud and dingy snow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepaticas that pleased you so<br />
Are here again, and butterflies.
</p>
<p>
There rings a hammering all day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shingles lie about the doors;<br />
In orchards near and far away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey wood-pecker taps and bores;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men are merry at their chores,<br />
And children earnest at their play.
</p>
<p>
The larger streams run still and deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noisy and swift the small brooks run<br />
Among the mullein stalks the sheep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go up the hillside in the sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensively,&#151;only you are gone,<br />
You that alone I cared to keep.
</p>

<h3>Rosemary</h3>
<p>
For the sake of some things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That be now no more<br />
I will strew rushes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my chamber-floor,<br />
I will plant bergamot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my kitchen-door.
</p>
<p>
For the sake of dim things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That were once so plain<br />
I will set a barrel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out to catch the rain,<br />
I will hang an iron pot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an iron crane.
</p>
<p>
Many things be dead and gone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That were brave and gay;<br />
For the sake of these things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will learn to say,<br />
"An it please you, gentle sirs,"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alack!" and "Well-a-day!"
</p>

<h3>The Poet and His Book</h3>
<p>
Down, you mongrel, Death!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back into your kennel!<br />
I have stolen breath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a stalk of fennel!<br />
You shall scratch and you shall whine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a night, and you shall worry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a bone, before you bury<br />
One sweet bone of mine!
</p>
<p>
When shall I be dead?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my flesh is withered,<br />
And above my head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow pollen gathered<br />
All the empty afternoon?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sweet lovers pause and wonder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am I that lie thereunder,<br />
Hidden from the moon?
</p>
<p>
This my personal death?&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lungs be failing<br />
To inhale the breath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are exhaling?<br />
This my subtle spirit's end?&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, when the thawed winter splashes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over these chance dust and ashes,<br />
Weep not me, my friend!
</p>
<p>
Me, by no means dead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that hour, but surely<br />
When this book, unread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rots to earth obscurely,<br />
And no more to any breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close against the clamorous swelling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the thing there is no telling,<br />
Are these pages pressed!
</p>
<p>
When this book is mould,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a book of many<br />
Waiting to be sold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a casual penny,<br />
In a little open case,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a street unclean and cluttered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a heavy mud is spattered<br />
From the passing drays,
</p>
<p>
Stranger, pause and look;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the dust of ages<br />
Lift this little book,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn the tattered pages,<br />
Read me, do not let me die!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Search the fading letters, finding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steadfast in the broken binding<br />
All that once was I!
</p>
<p>
When these veins are weeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these hollowed sockets<br />
Watch the rooty seeds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bursting down like rockets,<br />
And surmise the spring again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, remote in that black cupboard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch the pink worms writhing upward<br />
At the smell of rain,
</p>
<p>
Boys and girls that lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispering in the hedges,<br />
Do not let me die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix me with your pledges;<br />
Boys and girls that slowly walk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woods, and weep, and quarrel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staring past the pink wild laurel,<br />
Mix me with your talk,
</p>
<p>
Do not let me die!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers at your raking,<br />
When the sun is high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the hay is making,<br />
When, along the stubble strewn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withering on their stalks uneaten,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strawberries turn dark and sweeten<br />
In the lapse of noon;
</p>
<p>
Shepherds on the hills,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pastures, drowsing<br />
To the tinkling bells<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the brown sheep browsing;<br />
Sailors crying through the storm;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scholars at your study; hunters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost amid the whirling winter's<br />
Whiteness uniform;
</p>
<p>
Men that long for sleep;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men that wake and revel;&#151;<br />
If an old song leap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To your senses' level<br />
At such moments, may it be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, though a moment only,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some forgotten, quaint and homely<br />
Vehicle of me!
</p>
<p>
Women at your toil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women at your leisure<br />
Till the kettle boil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snatch of me your pleasure,<br />
Where the broom-straw marks the leaf;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women quiet with your weeping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest you wake a workman sleeping,<br />
Mix me with your grief!
</p>
<p>
Boys and girls that steal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shocking laughter<br />
Of the old, to kneel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a dripping rafter<br />
Under the discolored eaves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of trunks with hingeless covers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifting tales of saints and lovers,<br />
Travelers, goblins, thieves,
</p>
<p>
Suns that shine by night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountains made from valleys,&#151;<br />
Bear me to the light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flat upon your bellies<br />
By the webby window lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the little flies are crawling,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read me, margin me with scrawling,<br />
Do not let me die!
</p>
<p>
Sexton, ply your trade!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a shower of gravel<br />
Stamp upon your spade!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a rose shall ravel,<br />
Many a metal wreath shall rust<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rain, and I go singing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the lots where you are flinging<br />
Yellow clay on dust!
</p>

<h3>Alms</h3>
<p>
My heart is what it was before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A house where people come and go;<br />
But it is winter with your love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sashes are beset with snow.
</p>
<p>
I light the lamp and lay the cloth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blow the coals to blaze again;<br />
But it is winter with your love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frost is thick upon the pane.
</p>
<p>
I know a winter when it comes:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves are listless on the boughs;<br />
I watched your love a little while,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brought my plants into the house.
</p>
<p>
I water them and turn them south,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I snap the dead brown from the stem;<br />
But it is winter with your love,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only tend and water them.
</p>
<p>
There was a time I stood and watched<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small, ill-natured sparrows' fray;<br />
I loved the beggar that I fed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cared for what he had to say,
</p>
<p>
I stood and watched him out of sight;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I reach around the door<br />
And set a bowl upon the step;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is what it was before,
</p>
<p>
But it is winter with your love;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I scatter crumbs upon the sill,<br />
And close the window,&#151;and the birds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May take or leave them, as they will.
</p>

<h3>Inland</h3>
<p>
People that build their houses inland,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People that buy a plot of ground<br />
Shaped like a house, and build a house there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the sea-board, far from the sound
</p>
<p>
Of water sucking the hollow ledges,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tons of water striking the shore,&#151;<br />
What do they long for, as I long for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One salt smell of the sea once more?
</p>
<p>
People the waves have not awakened,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spanking the boats at the harbor's head,<br />
What do they long for, as I long for,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting up in my inland bed,
</p>
<p>
Beating the narrow walls, and finding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither a window nor a door,<br />
Screaming to God for death by drowning,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One salt taste of the sea once more?
</p>

<h3>To a Poet that Died Young</h3>
<p>
Minstrel, what have you to do<br />
With this man that, after you,<br />
Sharing not your happy fate,<br />
Sat as England's Laureate?<br />
Vainly, in these iron days,<br />
Strives the poet in your praise,<br />
Minstrel, by whose singing side<br />
Beauty walked, until you died.
</p>
<p>
Still, though none should hark again,<br />
Drones the blue-fly in the pane,<br />
Thickly crusts the blackest moss,<br />
Blows the rose its musk across,<br />
Floats the boat that is forgot<br />
None the less to Camelot.
</p>
<p>
Many a bard's untimely death<br />
Lends unto his verses breath;<br />
Here's a song was never sung:<br />
Growing old is dying young.<br />
Minstrel, what is this to you:<br />
That a man you never knew,<br />
When your grave was far and green,<br />
Sat and gossipped with a queen?
</p>
<p>
Thalia knows how rare a thing<br />
Is it, to grow old and sing;<br />
When a brown and tepid tide<br />
Closes in on every side.<br />
Who shall say if Shelley's gold<br />
Had withstood it to grow old?
</p>

<h3>Wraith</h3>
<p>
"Thin Rain, whom are you haunting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you haunt my door?"<br />
&#151;Surely it is not I she's wanting;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone living here before&#151;<br />
"Nobody's in the house but me:<br />
You may come in if you like and see."
</p>
<p>
Thin as thread, with exquisite fingers,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you seen her, any of you?&#151;<br />
Grey shawl, and leaning on the wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the garden showing through?
</p>
<p>
Glimmering eyes,&#151;and silent, mostly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort of a whisper, sort of a purr,<br />
Asking something, asking it over,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you get a sound from her.&#151;
</p>
<p>
Ever see her, any of you?&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangest thing I've ever known,&#151;<br />
Every night since I moved in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I came to be alone.
</p>
<p>
"Thin Rain, hush with your knocking!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not come in!<br />
This is I that you hear rocking;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody's with me, nor has been!"
</p>
<p>
Curious, how she tried the window,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odd, the way she tries the door,&#151;<br />
Wonder just what sort of people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could have had this house before . . .
</p>

<h3>Ebb</h3>
<p>
I know what my heart is like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since your love died:<br />
It is like a hollow ledge<br />
Holding a little pool<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left there by the tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little tepid pool,<br />
Drying inward from the edge.
</p>

<h3>Elaine</h3>
<p>
Oh, come again to Astolat!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not ask you to be kind.<br />
And you may go when you will go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will stay behind.
</p>
<p>
I will not say how dear you are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or ask you if you hold me dear,<br />
Or trouble you with things for you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I did last year.
</p>
<p>
So still the orchard, Lancelot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So very still the lake shall be,<br />
You could not guess&#151;though you should guess&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is become of me.
</p>
<p>
So wide shall be the garden-walk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden-seat so very wide,<br />
You needs must think&#151;if you should think&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lily maid had died.
</p>
<p>
Save that, a little way away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd watch you for a little while,<br />
To see you speak, the way you speak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smile,&#151;if you should smile.
</p>

<h3>Burial</h3>
<p>
Mine is a body that should die at sea!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have for a grave, instead of a grave<br />
Six feet deep and the length of me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the water that is under the wave!
</p>
<p>
And terrible fishes to seize my flesh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as a living man might fear,<br />
And eat me while I am firm and fresh,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not wait till I've been dead for a year!
</p>

<h3>Mariposa</h3>
<p>
Butterflies are white and blue<br />
In this field we wander through.<br />
Suffer me to take your hand.<br />
Death comes in a day or two.
</p>
<p>
All the things we ever knew<br />
Will be ashes in that hour,<br />
Mark the transient butterfly,<br />
How he hangs upon the flower.
</p>
<p>
Suffer me to take your hand.<br />
Suffer me to cherish you<br />
Till the dawn is in the sky.<br />
Whether I be false or true,<br />
Death comes in a day or two.
</p>

<h3>The Little Hill</h3>
<p>
Oh, here the air is sweet and still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soft's the grass to lie on;<br />
And far away's the little hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took for Christ to die on.
</p>
<p>
And there's a hill across the brook,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down the brook's another;<br />
But, oh, the little hill they took,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I am its mother!
</p>
<p>
The moon that saw Gethsemane,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watch it rise and set:<br />
It has so many things to see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They help it to forget.
</p>
<p>
But little hills that sit at home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many hundred years,<br />
Remember Greece, remember Rome,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember Mary's tears.
</p>
<p>
And far away in Palestine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadder than any other,<br />
Grieves still the hill that I call mine,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I am its mother!
</p>

<h3>Doubt No More That Oberon</h3>
<p>
Doubt no more that Oberon&#151;<br />
Never doubt that Pan<br />
Lived, and played a reed, and ran<br />
After nymphs in a dark forest,<br />
In the merry, credulous days,&#151;<br />
Lived, and led a fairy band<br />
Over the indulgent land!<br />
Ah, for in this dourest, sorest<br />
Age man's eye has looked upon,<br />
Death to fauns and death to fays,<br />
Still the dog-wood dares to raise&#151;<br />
Healthy tree, with trunk and root&#151;<br />
Ivory bowls that bear no fruit,<br />
And the starlings and the jays&#151;<br />
Birds that cannot even sing&#151;<br />
Dare to come again in spring!
</p>

<h3>Lament</h3>
<p>
Listen, children:<br />
Your father is dead.<br />
From his old coats<br />
I'll make you little jackets;<br />
I'll make you little trousers<br />
From his old pants.<br />
There'll be in his pockets<br />
Things he used to put there,<br />
Keys and pennies<br />
Covered with tobacco;<br />
Dan shall have the pennies<br />
To save in his bank;<br />
Anne shall have the keys<br />
To make a pretty noise with.<br />
Life must go on,<br />
And the dead be forgotten;<br />
Life must go on,<br />
Though good men die;<br />
Anne, eat your breakfast;<br />
Dan, take your medicine;<br />
Life must go on;<br />
I forget just why.
</p>

<h3>Exiled</h3>
<p>
Searching my heart for its true sorrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the thing I find to be:<br />
That I am weary of words and people,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick of the city, wanting the sea;
</p>
<p>
Wanting the sticky, salty sweetness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the strong wind and shattered spray;<br />
Wanting the loud sound and the soft sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the big surf that breaks all day.
</p>
<p>
Always before about my dooryard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marking the reach of the winter sea,<br />
Rooted in sand and dragging drift-wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straggled the purple wild sweet-pea;
</p>
<p>
Always I climbed the wave at morning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook the sand from my shoes at night,<br />
That now am caught beneath great buildings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stricken with noise, confused with light.
</p>
<p>
If I could hear the green piles groaning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the windy wooden piers,<br />
See once again the bobbing barrels,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the black sticks that fence the weirs,
</p>
<p>
If I could see the weedy mussels<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crusting the wrecked and rotting hulls,<br />
Hear once again the hungry crying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overhead, of the wheeling gulls,
</p>
<p>
Feel once again the shanty straining<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the turning of the tide,<br />
Fear once again the rising freshet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dread the bell in the fog outside,&#151;
</p>
<p>
I should be happy,&#151;that was happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long on the coast of Maine!<br />
I have a need to hold and handle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shells and anchors and ships again!
</p>
<p>
I should be happy, that am happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never at all since I came here.<br />
I am too long away from water.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a need of water near.
</p>

<h3>The Death of Autumn</h3>
<p>
When reeds are dead and a straw to thatch the marshes,<br />
And feathered pampas-grass rides into the wind<br />
Like aged warriors westward, tragic, thinned<br />
Of half their tribe, and over the flattened rushes,<br />
Stripped of its secret, open, stark and bleak,<br />
Blackens afar the half-forgotten creek,&#151;<br />
Then leans on me the weight of the year, and crushes<br />
My heart.  I know that Beauty must ail and die,<br />
And will be born again,&#151;but ah, to see<br />
Beauty stiffened, staring up at the sky!<br />
Oh, Autumn!  Autumn!&#151;What is the Spring to me?
</p>

<h3>Ode to Silence</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, but she?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your other sister and my other soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grave Silence, lovelier<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the three loveliest maidens, what of her?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clio, not you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not you, Calliope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor all your wanton line,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Beauty's perfect self shall comfort me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Silence once departed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her the cool-tongued, her the tranquil-hearted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom evermore I follow wistfully,<br />
Wandering Heaven and Earth and Hell and the four seasons through;<br />
Thalia, not you,<br />
Not you, Melpomene,<br />
Not your incomparable feet, O thin Terpsichore,<br />
I seek in this great hall,<br />
But one more pale, more pensive, most beloved of you all.<br />
I seek her from afar,<br />
I come from temples where her altars are,<br />
From groves that bear her name,<br />
Noisy with stricken victims now and sacrificial flame,<br />
And cymbals struck on high and strident faces<br />
Obstreperous in her praise<br />
They neither love nor know,<br />
A goddess of gone days,<br />
Departed long ago,<br />
Abandoning the invaded shrines and fanes<br />
Of her old sanctuary,<br />
A deity obscure and legendary,<br />
Of whom there now remains,<br />
For sages to decipher and priests to garble,<br />
Only and for a little while her letters wedged in marble,<br />
Which even now, behold, the friendly mumbling rain erases,<br />
And the inarticulate snow,<br />
Leaving at last of her least signs and traces<br />
None whatsoever, nor whither she is vanished from these places.<br />
"She will love well," I said,<br />
"If love be of that heart inhabiter,<br />
The flowers of the dead;<br />
The red anemone that with no sound<br />
Moves in the wind, and from another wound<br />
That sprang, the heavily-sweet blue hyacinth,<br />
That blossoms underground,<br />
And sallow poppies, will be dear to her.<br />
And will not Silence know<br />
In the black shade of what obsidian steep<br />
Stiffens the white narcissus numb with sleep?<br />
(Seed which Demeter's daughter bore from home,<br />
Uptorn by desperate fingers long ago,<br />
Reluctant even as she,<br />
Undone Persephone,<br />
And even as she set out again to grow<br />
In twilight, in perdition's lean and inauspicious loam).<br />
She will love well," I said,<br />
"The flowers of the dead;<br />
Where dark Persephone the winter round,<br />
Uncomforted for home, uncomforted,<br />
Lacking a sunny southern slope in northern Sicily,<br />
With sullen pupils focussed on a dream,<br />
Stares on the stagnant stream<br />
That moats the unequivocable battlements of Hell,<br />
There, there will she be found,<br />
She that is Beauty veiled from men and Music in a swound."
</p>
<p>
"I long for Silence as they long for breath<br />
Whose helpless nostrils drink the bitter sea;<br />
What thing can be<br />
So stout, what so redoubtable, in Death<br />
What fury, what considerable rage, if only she,<br />
Upon whose icy breast,<br />
Unquestioned, uncaressed,<br />
One time I lay,<br />
And whom always I lack,<br />
Even to this day,<br />
Being by no means from that frigid bosom weaned away,<br />
If only she therewith be given me back?"<br />
I sought her down that dolorous labyrinth,<br />
Wherein no shaft of sunlight ever fell,<br />
And in among the bloodless everywhere<br />
I sought her, but the air,<br />
Breathed many times and spent,<br />
Was fretful with a whispering discontent,<br />
And questioning me, importuning me to tell<br />
Some slightest tidings of the light of day they know no more,<br />
Plucking my sleeve, the eager shades were with me where I went.<br />
I paused at every grievous door,<br />
And harked a moment, holding up my hand,&#151;and for a space<br />
A hush was on them, while they watched my face;<br />
And then they fell a-whispering as before;<br />
So that I smiled at them and left them, seeing she was not there.<br />
I sought her, too,<br />
Among the upper gods, although I knew<br />
She was not like to be where feasting is,<br />
Nor near to Heaven's lord,<br />
Being a thing abhorred<br />
And shunned of him, although a child of his,<br />
(Not yours, not yours; to you she owes not breath,<br />
Mother of Song, being sown of Zeus upon a dream of Death).<br />
Fearing to pass unvisited some place<br />
And later learn, too late, how all the while,<br />
With her still face,<br />
She had been standing there and seen me pass, without a smile,<br />
I sought her even to the sagging board whereat<br />
The stout immortals sat;<br />
But such a laughter shook the mighty hall<br />
No one could hear me say:<br />
Had she been seen upon the Hill that day?<br />
And no one knew at all<br />
How long I stood, or when at last I sighed and went away.
</p>
<p>
There is a garden lying in a lull<br />
Between the mountains and the mountainous sea,<br />
I know not where, but which a dream diurnal<br />
Paints on my lids a moment till the hull<br />
Be lifted from the kernel<br />
And Slumber fed to me.<br />
Your foot-print is not there, Mnemosene,<br />
Though it would seem a ruined place and after<br />
Your lichenous heart, being full<br />
Of broken columns, caryatides<br />
Thrown to the earth and fallen forward on their jointless knees,<br />
And urns funereal altered into dust<br />
Minuter than the ashes of the dead,<br />
And Psyche's lamp out of the earth up-thrust,<br />
Dripping itself in marble wax on what was once the bed<br />
Of Love, and his young body asleep, but now is dust instead.
</p>
<p>
There twists the bitter-sweet, the white wisteria<br />
Fastens its fingers in the strangling wall,<br />
And the wide crannies quicken with bright weeds;<br />
There dumbly like a worm all day the still white orchid feeds;<br />
But never an echo of your daughters' laughter<br />
Is there, nor any sign of you at all<br />
Swells fungous from the rotten bough, grey mother of Pieria!
</p>
<p>
Only her shadow once upon a stone<br />
I saw,&#151;and, lo, the shadow and the garden, too, were gone.
</p>
<p>
I tell you you have done her body an ill,<br />
You chatterers, you noisy crew!<br />
She is not anywhere!<br />
I sought her in deep Hell;<br />
And through the world as well;<br />
I thought of Heaven and I sought her there;<br />
Above nor under ground<br />
Is Silence to be found,<br />
That was the very warp and woof of you,<br />
Lovely before your songs began and after they were through!<br />
Oh, say if on this hill<br />
Somewhere your sister's body lies in death,<br />
So I may follow there, and make a wreath<br />
Of my locked hands, that on her quiet breast<br />
Shall lie till age has withered them!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Ah, sweetly from the rest<br />
I see<br />
Turn and consider me<br />
Compassionate Euterpe!)<br />
"There is a gate beyond the gate of Death,<br />
Beyond the gate of everlasting Life,<br />
Beyond the gates of Heaven and Hell," she saith,<br />
"Whereon but to believe is horror!<br />
Whereon to meditate engendereth<br />
Even in deathless spirits such as I<br />
A tumult in the breath,<br />
A chilling of the inexhaustible blood<br />
Even in my veins that never will be dry,<br />
And in the austere, divine monotony<br />
That is my being, the madness of an unaccustomed mood.
</p>
<p>
This is her province whom you lack and seek;<br />
And seek her not elsewhere.<br />
Hell is a thoroughfare<br />
For pilgrims,&#151;Herakles,<br />
And he that loved Euridice too well,<br />
Have walked therein; and many more than these;<br />
And witnessed the desire and the despair<br />
Of souls that passed reluctantly and sicken for the air;<br />
You, too, have entered Hell,<br />
And issued thence; but thence whereof I speak<br />
None has returned;&#151;for thither fury brings<br />
Only the driven ghosts of them that flee before all things.<br />
Oblivion is the name of this abode: and she is there."
</p>
<p>
Oh, radiant Song!  Oh, gracious Memory!<br />
Be long upon this height<br />
I shall not climb again!<br />
I know the way you mean,&#151;the little night,<br />
And the long empty day,&#151;never to see<br />
Again the angry light,<br />
Or hear the hungry noises cry my brain!<br />
Ah, but she,<br />
Your other sister and my other soul,<br />
She shall again be mine;<br />
And I shall drink her from a silver bowl,<br />
A chilly thin green wine,<br />
Not bitter to the taste,<br />
Not sweet,<br />
Not of your press, oh, restless, clamorous nine,&#151;<br />
To foam beneath the frantic hoofs of mirth&#151;
But savoring faintly of the acid earth,<br />
And trod by pensive feet<br />
From perfect clusters ripened without haste<br />
Out of the urgent heat<br />
In some clear glimmering vaulted twilight under the odorous vine.
</p>
<p>
Lift up your lyres!  Sing on!<br />
But as for me, I seek your sister whither she is gone.
</p>

<h3>Memorial to D. C. [Vassar College, 1918]</h3>
<p>
Oh, loveliest throat of all sweet throats,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where now no more the music is,<br />
With hands that wrote you little notes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I write you little elegies!
</p>

<h3>Epitaph</h3>
<p>
Heap not on this mound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roses that she loved so well;<br />
Why bewilder her with roses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she cannot see or smell?<br />
She is happy where she lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dust upon her eyes.
</p>

<h3>Prayer to Persephone</h3>
<p>
Be to her, Persephone,<br />
All the things I might not be;<br />
Take her head upon your knee.<br />
She that was so proud and wild,<br />
Flippant, arrogant and free,<br />
She that had no need of me,<br />
Is a little lonely child<br />
Lost in Hell,&#151;Persephone,<br />
Take her head upon your knee;<br />
Say to her, "My dear, my dear,<br />
It is not so dreadful here."
</p>

<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>
Give away her gowns,<br />
Give away her shoes;<br />
She has no more use<br />
For her fragrant gowns;<br />
Take them all down,<br />
Blue, green, blue,<br />
Lilac, pink, blue,<br />
From their padded hangers;<br />
She will dance no more<br />
In her narrow shoes;<br />
Sweep her narrow shoes<br />
From the closet floor.
</p>

<h3>Elegy</h3>
<p>
Let them bury your big eyes<br />
In the secret earth securely,<br />
Your thin fingers, and your fair,<br />
Soft, indefinite-colored hair,&#151;<br />
All of these in some way, surely,<br />
From the secret earth shall rise;<br />
Not for these I sit and stare,<br />
Broken and bereft completely;<br />
Your young flesh that sat so neatly<br />
On your little bones will sweetly<br />
Blossom in the air.
</p>
<p>
But your voice,&#151;never the rushing<br />
Of a river underground,<br />
Not the rising of the wind<br />
In the trees before the rain,<br />
Not the woodcock's watery call,<br />
Not the note the white-throat utters,<br />
Not the feet of children pushing<br />
Yellow leaves along the gutters<br />
In the blue and bitter fall,<br />
Shall content my musing mind<br />
For the beauty of that sound<br />
That in no new way at all<br />
Ever will be heard again.
</p>
<p>
Sweetly through the sappy stalk<br />
Of the vigorous weed,<br />
Holding all it held before,<br />
Cherished by the faithful sun,<br />
On and on eternally<br />
Shall your altered fluid run,<br />
Bud and bloom and go to seed;<br />
But your singing days are done;<br />
But the music of your talk<br />
Never shall the chemistry<br />
Of the secret earth restore.<br />
All your lovely words are spoken.<br />
Once the ivory box is broken,<br />
Beats the golden bird no more.
</p>

<h3>Dirge</h3>
<p>
Boys and girls that held her dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do your weeping now;<br />
All you loved of her lies here.
</p>
<p>
Brought to earth the arrogant brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the withering tongue<br />
Chastened; do your weeping now.
</p>
<p>
Sing whatever songs are sung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind whatever wreath,<br />
For a playmate perished young,
</p>
<p>
For a spirit spent in death.<br />
Boys and girls that held her dear,<br />
All you loved of her lies here.
</p>

<h3>Sonnets</h3>

<h4>I</h4>
<p>
We talk of taxes, and I call you friend;<br />
Well, such you are,&#151;but well enough we know<br />
How thick about us root, how rankly grow<br />
Those subtle weeds no man has need to tend,<br />
That flourish through neglect, and soon must send<br />
Perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow<br />
Our steady senses; how such matters go<br />
We are aware, and how such matters end.<br />
Yet shall be told no meagre passion here;<br />
With lovers such as we forevermore<br />
Isolde drinks the draught, and Guinevere<br />
Receives the Table's ruin through her door,<br />
Francesca, with the loud surf at her ear,<br />
Lets fall the colored book upon the floor.
</p>

<h4>II</h4>
<p>
Into the golden vessel of great song<br />
Let us pour all our passion; breast to breast<br />
Let other lovers lie, in love and rest;<br />
Not we,&#151;articulate, so, but with the tongue<br />
Of all the world: the churning blood, the long<br />
Shuddering quiet, the desperate hot palms pressed<br />
Sharply together upon the escaping guest,<br />
The common soul, unguarded, and grown strong.<br />
Longing alone is singer to the lute;<br />
Let still on nettles in the open sigh<br />
The minstrel, that in slumber is as mute<br />
As any man, and love be far and high,<br />
That else forsakes the topmost branch, a fruit<br />
Found on the ground by every passer-by.
</p>

<h4>III</h4>
<p>
Not with libations, but with shouts and laughter<br />
We drenched the altars of Love's sacred grove,<br />
Shaking to earth green fruits, impatient after<br />
The launching of the colored moths of Love.<br />
Love's proper myrtle and his mother's zone<br />
We bound about our irreligious brows,<br />
And fettered him with garlands of our own,<br />
And spread a banquet in his frugal house.<br />
Not yet the god has spoken; but I fear<br />
Though we should break our bodies in his flame,<br />
And pour our blood upon his altar, here<br />
Henceforward is a grove without a name,<br />
A pasture to the shaggy goats of Pan,<br />
Whence flee forever a woman and a man.
</p>

<h4>IV</h4>
<p>
Only until this cigarette is ended,<br />
A little moment at the end of all,<br />
While on the floor the quiet ashes fall,<br />
And in the firelight to a lance extended,<br />
Bizarrely with the jazzing music blended,<br />
The broken shadow dances on the wall,<br />
I will permit my memory to recall<br />
The vision of you, by all my dreams attended.<br />
And then adieu,&#151;farewell!&#151;the dream is done.<br />
Yours is a face of which I can forget<br />
The color and the features, every one,<br />
The words not ever, and the smiles not yet;<br />
But in your day this moment is the sun<br />
Upon a hill, after the sun has set.
</p>

<h4>V</h4>
<p>
Once more into my arid days like dew,<br />
Like wind from an oasis, or the sound<br />
Of cold sweet water bubbling underground,<br />
A treacherous messenger, the thought of you<br />
Comes to destroy me; once more I renew<br />
Firm faith in your abundance, whom I found<br />
Long since to be but just one other mound<br />
Of sand, whereon no green thing ever grew.<br />
And once again, and wiser in no wise,<br />
I chase your colored phantom on the air,<br />
And sob and curse and fall and weep and rise<br />
And stumble pitifully on to where,<br />
Miserable and lost, with stinging eyes,<br />
Once more I clasp,&#151;and there is nothing there.
</p>

<h4>VI</h4>
<p>
No rose that in a garden ever grew,<br />
In Homer's or in Omar's or in mine,<br />
Though buried under centuries of fine<br />
Dead dust of roses, shut from sun and dew<br />
Forever, and forever lost from view,<br />
But must again in fragrance rich as wine<br />
The grey aisles of the air incarnadine<br />
When the old summers surge into a new.<br />
Thus when I swear, "I love with all my heart,"<br />
'Tis with the heart of Lilith that I swear,<br />
'Tis with the love of Lesbia and Lucrece;<br />
And thus as well my love must lose some part<br />
Of what it is, had Helen been less fair,<br />
Or perished young, or stayed at home in Greece.
</p>

<h4>VII</h4>
<p>
When I too long have looked upon your face,<br />
Wherein for me a brightness unobscured<br />
Save by the mists of brightness has its place,<br />
And terrible beauty not to be endured,<br />
I turn away reluctant from your light,<br />
And stand irresolute, a mind undone,<br />
A silly, dazzled thing deprived of sight<br />
From having looked too long upon the sun.<br />
Then is my daily life a narrow room<br />
In which a little while, uncertainly,<br />
Surrounded by impenetrable gloom,<br />
Among familiar things grown strange to me<br />
Making my way, I pause, and feel, and hark,<br />
Till I become accustomed to the dark.
</p>

<h4>VIII</h4>
<p>
And you as well must die, beloved dust,<br />
And all your beauty stand you in no stead;<br />
This flawless, vital hand, this perfect head,<br />
This body of flame and steel, before the gust<br />
Of Death, or under his autumnal frost,<br />
Shall be as any leaf, be no less dead<br />
Than the first leaf that fell,&#151;this wonder fled.<br />
Altered, estranged, disintegrated, lost.<br />
Nor shall my love avail you in your hour.<br />
In spite of all my love, you will arise<br />
Upon that day and wander down the air<br />
Obscurely as the unattended flower,<br />
It mattering not how beautiful you were,<br />
Or how beloved above all else that dies.
</p>

<h4>IX</h4>
<p>
Let you not say of me when I am old,<br />
In pretty worship of my withered hands<br />
Forgetting who I am, and how the sands<br />
Of such a life as mine run red and gold<br />
Even to the ultimate sifting dust, "Behold,<br />
Here walketh passionless age!"&#151;for there expands<br />
A curious superstition in these lands,<br />
And by its leave some weightless tales are told.<br />
</p>
<p>
In me no lenten wicks watch out the night;<br />
I am the booth where Folly holds her fair;<br />
Impious no less in ruin than in strength,<br />
When I lie crumbled to the earth at length,<br />
Let you not say, "Upon this reverend site<br />
The righteous groaned and beat their breasts in prayer."
</p>

<h4>X</h4>
<p>
Oh, my beloved, have you thought of this:<br />
How in the years to come unscrupulous Time,<br />
More cruel than Death, will tear you from my kiss,<br />
And make you old, and leave me in my prime?<br />
How you and I, who scale together yet<br />
A little while the sweet, immortal height<br />
No pilgrim may remember or forget,<br />
As sure as the world turns, some granite night<br />
Shall lie awake and know the gracious flame<br />
Gone out forever on the mutual stone;<br />
And call to mind that on the day you came<br />
I was a child, and you a hero grown?&#151;<br />
And the night pass, and the strange morning break<br />
Upon our anguish for each other's sake!
</p>

<h4>XI</h4>
<p>
As to some lovely temple, tenantless<br />
Long since, that once was sweet with shivering brass,<br />
Knowing well its altars ruined and the grass<br />
Grown up between the stones, yet from excess<br />
Of grief hard driven, or great loneliness,<br />
The worshiper returns, and those who pass<br />
Marvel him crying on a name that was,&#151;<br />
So is it now with me in my distress.<br />
Your body was a temple to Delight;<br />
Cold are its ashes whence the breath is fled,<br />
Yet here one time your spirit was wont to move;<br />
Here might I hope to find you day or night,<br />
And here I come to look for you, my love,<br />
Even now, foolishly, knowing you are dead.
</p>

<h4>XII</h4>
<p>
Cherish you then the hope I shall forget<br />
At length, my lord, Pieria?&#151;put away<br />
For your so passing sake, this mouth of clay<br />
These mortal bones against my body set,<br />
For all the puny fever and frail sweat<br />
Of human love,&#151;renounce for these, I say,<br />
The Singing Mountain's memory, and betray<br />
The silent lyre that hangs upon me yet?<br />
Ah, but indeed, some day shall you awake,<br />
Rather, from dreams of me, that at your side<br />
So many nights, a lover and a bride,<br />
But stern in my soul's chastity, have lain,<br />
To walk the world forever for my sake,<br />
And in each chamber find me gone again!
</p>

<h3>Wild Swans</h3>
<p>
I looked in my heart while the wild swans went over.<br />
And what did I see I had not seen before?<br />
Only a question less or a question more;<br />
Nothing to match the flight of wild birds flying.<br />
Tiresome heart, forever living and dying,<br />
House without air, I leave you and lock your door.<br />
Wild swans, come over the town, come over<br />
The town again, trailing your legs and crying!

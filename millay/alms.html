<h1>Alms</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
My heart is what it was before,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A house where people come and go;<br/>
But it is winter with your love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sashes are beset with snow.
</p>
<p>
I light the lamp and lay the cloth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blow the coals to blaze again;<br/>
But it is winter with your love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frost is thick upon the pane.
</p>
<p>
I know a winter when it comes:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves are listless on the boughs;<br/>
I watched your love a little while,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brought my plants into the house.
</p>
<p>
I water them and turn them south,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I snap the dead brown from the stem;<br/>
But it is winter with your love,&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only tend and water them.
</p>
<p>
There was a time I stood and watched<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small, ill-natured sparrows' fray;<br/>
I loved the beggar that I fed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cared for what he had to say,
</p>
<p>
I stood and watched him out of sight;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I reach around the door<br/>
And set a bowl upon the step;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is what it was before,
</p>
<p>
But it is winter with your love;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I scatter crumbs upon the sill,<br/>
And close the window,&#151;and the birds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May take or leave them, as they will.

<h1>Ode to Silence</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, but she?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your other sister and my other soul<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grave Silence, lovelier<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the three loveliest maidens, what of her?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clio, not you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not you, Calliope,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor all your wanton line,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Beauty's perfect self shall comfort me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Silence once departed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her the cool-tongued, her the tranquil-hearted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom evermore I follow wistfully,<br/>
Wandering Heaven and Earth and Hell and the four seasons through;<br/>
Thalia, not you,<br/>
Not you, Melpomene,<br/>
Not your incomparable feet, O thin Terpsichore,<br/>
I seek in this great hall,<br/>
But one more pale, more pensive, most beloved of you all.<br/>
I seek her from afar,<br/>
I come from temples where her altars are,<br/>
From groves that bear her name,<br/>
Noisy with stricken victims now and sacrificial flame,<br/>
And cymbals struck on high and strident faces<br/>
Obstreperous in her praise<br/>
They neither love nor know,<br/>
A goddess of gone days,<br/>
Departed long ago,<br/>
Abandoning the invaded shrines and fanes<br/>
Of her old sanctuary,<br/>
A deity obscure and legendary,<br/>
Of whom there now remains,<br/>
For sages to decipher and priests to garble,<br/>
Only and for a little while her letters wedged in marble,<br/>
Which even now, behold, the friendly mumbling rain erases,<br/>
And the inarticulate snow,<br/>
Leaving at last of her least signs and traces<br/>
None whatsoever, nor whither she is vanished from these places.<br/>
"She will love well," I said,<br/>
"If love be of that heart inhabiter,<br/>
The flowers of the dead;<br/>
The red anemone that with no sound<br/>
Moves in the wind, and from another wound<br/>
That sprang, the heavily-sweet blue hyacinth,<br/>
That blossoms underground,<br/>
And sallow poppies, will be dear to her.<br/>
And will not Silence know<br/>
In the black shade of what obsidian steep<br/>
Stiffens the white narcissus numb with sleep?<br/>
(Seed which Demeter's daughter bore from home,<br/>
Uptorn by desperate fingers long ago,<br/>
Reluctant even as she,<br/>
Undone Persephone,<br/>
And even as she set out again to grow<br/>
In twilight, in perdition's lean and inauspicious loam).<br/>
She will love well," I said,<br/>
"The flowers of the dead;<br/>
Where dark Persephone the winter round,<br/>
Uncomforted for home, uncomforted,<br/>
Lacking a sunny southern slope in northern Sicily,<br/>
With sullen pupils focussed on a dream,<br/>
Stares on the stagnant stream<br/>
That moats the unequivocable battlements of Hell,<br/>
There, there will she be found,<br/>
She that is Beauty veiled from men and Music in a swound."
</p>
<p>
"I long for Silence as they long for breath<br/>
Whose helpless nostrils drink the bitter sea;<br/>
What thing can be<br/>
So stout, what so redoubtable, in Death<br/>
What fury, what considerable rage, if only she,<br/>
Upon whose icy breast,<br/>
Unquestioned, uncaressed,<br/>
One time I lay,<br/>
And whom always I lack,<br/>
Even to this day,<br/>
Being by no means from that frigid bosom weaned away,<br/>
If only she therewith be given me back?"<br/>
I sought her down that dolorous labyrinth,<br/>
Wherein no shaft of sunlight ever fell,<br/>
And in among the bloodless everywhere<br/>
I sought her, but the air,<br/>
Breathed many times and spent,<br/>
Was fretful with a whispering discontent,<br/>
And questioning me, importuning me to tell<br/>
Some slightest tidings of the light of day they know no more,<br/>
Plucking my sleeve, the eager shades were with me where I went.<br/>
I paused at every grievous door,<br/>
And harked a moment, holding up my hand,&#151;and for a space<br/>
A hush was on them, while they watched my face;<br/>
And then they fell a-whispering as before;<br/>
So that I smiled at them and left them, seeing she was not there.<br/>
I sought her, too,<br/>
Among the upper gods, although I knew<br/>
She was not like to be where feasting is,<br/>
Nor near to Heaven's lord,<br/>
Being a thing abhorred<br/>
And shunned of him, although a child of his,<br/>
(Not yours, not yours; to you she owes not breath,<br/>
Mother of Song, being sown of Zeus upon a dream of Death).<br/>
Fearing to pass unvisited some place<br/>
And later learn, too late, how all the while,<br/>
With her still face,<br/>
She had been standing there and seen me pass, without a smile,<br/>
I sought her even to the sagging board whereat<br/>
The stout immortals sat;<br/>
But such a laughter shook the mighty hall<br/>
No one could hear me say:<br/>
Had she been seen upon the Hill that day?<br/>
And no one knew at all<br/>
How long I stood, or when at last I sighed and went away.
</p>
<p>
There is a garden lying in a lull<br/>
Between the mountains and the mountainous sea,<br/>
I know not where, but which a dream diurnal<br/>
Paints on my lids a moment till the hull<br/>
Be lifted from the kernel<br/>
And Slumber fed to me.<br/>
Your foot-print is not there, Mnemosene,<br/>
Though it would seem a ruined place and after<br/>
Your lichenous heart, being full<br/>
Of broken columns, caryatides<br/>
Thrown to the earth and fallen forward on their jointless knees,<br/>
And urns funereal altered into dust<br/>
Minuter than the ashes of the dead,<br/>
And Psyche's lamp out of the earth up-thrust,<br/>
Dripping itself in marble wax on what was once the bed<br/>
Of Love, and his young body asleep, but now is dust instead.
</p>
<p>
There twists the bitter-sweet, the white wisteria<br/>
Fastens its fingers in the strangling wall,<br/>
And the wide crannies quicken with bright weeds;<br/>
There dumbly like a worm all day the still white orchid feeds;<br/>
But never an echo of your daughters' laughter<br/>
Is there, nor any sign of you at all<br/>
Swells fungous from the rotten bough, grey mother of Pieria!
</p>
<p>
Only her shadow once upon a stone<br/>
I saw,&#151;and, lo, the shadow and the garden, too, were gone.
</p>
<p>
I tell you you have done her body an ill,<br/>
You chatterers, you noisy crew!<br/>
She is not anywhere!<br/>
I sought her in deep Hell;<br/>
And through the world as well;<br/>
I thought of Heaven and I sought her there;<br/>
Above nor under ground<br/>
Is Silence to be found,<br/>
That was the very warp and woof of you,<br/>
Lovely before your songs began and after they were through!<br/>
Oh, say if on this hill<br/>
Somewhere your sister's body lies in death,<br/>
So I may follow there, and make a wreath<br/>
Of my locked hands, that on her quiet breast<br/>
Shall lie till age has withered them!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Ah, sweetly from the rest<br/>
I see<br/>
Turn and consider me<br/>
Compassionate Euterpe!)<br/>
"There is a gate beyond the gate of Death,<br/>
Beyond the gate of everlasting Life,<br/>
Beyond the gates of Heaven and Hell," she saith,<br/>
"Whereon but to believe is horror!<br/>
Whereon to meditate engendereth<br/>
Even in deathless spirits such as I<br/>
A tumult in the breath,<br/>
A chilling of the inexhaustible blood<br/>
Even in my veins that never will be dry,<br/>
And in the austere, divine monotony<br/>
That is my being, the madness of an unaccustomed mood.
</p>
<p>
This is her province whom you lack and seek;<br/>
And seek her not elsewhere.<br/>
Hell is a thoroughfare<br/>
For pilgrims,&#151;Herakles,<br/>
And he that loved Euridice too well,<br/>
Have walked therein; and many more than these;<br/>
And witnessed the desire and the despair<br/>
Of souls that passed reluctantly and sicken for the air;<br/>
You, too, have entered Hell,<br/>
And issued thence; but thence whereof I speak<br/>
None has returned;&#151;for thither fury brings<br/>
Only the driven ghosts of them that flee before all things.<br/>
Oblivion is the name of this abode: and she is there."
</p>
<p>
Oh, radiant Song!  Oh, gracious Memory!<br/>
Be long upon this height<br/>
I shall not climb again!<br/>
I know the way you mean,&#151;the little night,<br/>
And the long empty day,&#151;never to see<br/>
Again the angry light,<br/>
Or hear the hungry noises cry my brain!<br/>
Ah, but she,<br/>
Your other sister and my other soul,<br/>
She shall again be mine;<br/>
And I shall drink her from a silver bowl,<br/>
A chilly thin green wine,<br/>
Not bitter to the taste,<br/>
Not sweet,<br/>
Not of your press, oh, restless, clamorous nine,&#151;<br/>
To foam beneath the frantic hoofs of mirth&#151;
But savoring faintly of the acid earth,<br/>
And trod by pensive feet<br/>
From perfect clusters ripened without haste<br/>
Out of the urgent heat<br/>
In some clear glimmering vaulted twilight under the odorous vine.
</p>
<p>
Lift up your lyres!  Sing on!<br/>
But as for me, I seek your sister whither she is gone.

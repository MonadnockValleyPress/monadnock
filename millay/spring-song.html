<h1>Spring Song</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I know why the yellow forsythia<br/>
Holds its breath and will not bloom,<br/>
And the robin thrusts his beak in his wing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Want me to tell you? Think you can bear it?<br/>
Cover your eyes with your hand and hear it.<br/>
You know how cold the days are still?<br/>
And everybody saying how late the Spring is?<br/>
Well&mdash;cover your eyes with your hand&mdash;the thing is,<br/>
There isn't going to be any Spring.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>No parking here! No parking here!<br/>
They said to Spring: No parking here!</em><br/>
</p>
<p>
Spring came on as she always does,<br/>
Laid her hand on the yellow forsythia,&mdash;<br/>
Little boys turned in their sleep and smiled,<br/>
Dreaming of marbles, dreaming of agates;<br/>
Little girls leapt from their beds to see<br/>
Spring come by with her painted wagons,<br/>
Colored wagons creaking with wonder&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
Laid her hand on the robin's throat;<br/>
When up comes you-know-who, my dear,<br/>
You-know-who in a fine blue coat,<br/>
And says to Spring: No parking here!<br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>No parking here! No parking here!<br/>
Move on! Move on! No parking here!</em><br/>
</p>
<p>
Come walk with me in the city gardens.<br/>
(Better keep an eye out for you-know-who)<br/>
Did ever you see such a sickly showing?&mdash;<br/>
Middle of June, and nothing growing;<br/>
The gardeners peer and scratch their heads<br/>
And drop their sweat on the tulip-beds,<br/>
But not a blade thrusts through.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>Come, move on! Don't you know how to walk?<br/>
No parking here! And no back-talk!</em><br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh, well&mdash;hell, it's all for the best.<br/>
She certainly made a lot of clutter,<br/>
Dropping petals under the trees,<br/>
Taking your mind off your bread and butter.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, it's nothing to me.<br/>
I can remember, and so can you.<br/>
(Though we'd better watch out for you-know-who,<br/>
When we sit around remembering Spring.)<br/>
</p>
<p>
We shall hardly notice in a year or two.<br/>
You can get accustomed to anything.

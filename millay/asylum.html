<h1>A Visit to the Asylum</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Once from a big, big building,<br/>
When I was small, small,<br/>
The queer folk in the windows<br/>
Would smile at me and call.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And in the hard wee gardens<br/>
Such pleasant men would hoe:<br/>
"Sir, may we touch the little girl's hair?"&mdash;<br/>
It was so red, you know.<br/>
</p>
<p>
They cut me colored asters<br/>
With shears so sharp and neat,<br/>
They brought me grapes and plums and pears<br/>
And pretty cakes to eat.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And out of all the windows,<br/>
No matter where we went,<br/>
The merriest eyes would follow me<br/>
And make me compliment.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There were a thousand windows,<br/>
All latticed up and down.<br/>
And up to all the windows,<br/>
When we went back to town,<br/>
</p>
<p>
The queer folk put their faces,<br/>
As gentle as could be;<br/>
"Come again, little girl!" they called, and I<br/>
Called back, "You come see me!"

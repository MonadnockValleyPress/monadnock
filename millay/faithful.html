<h1>Sonnet: "Oh, think not I am faithful to a vow!"</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Oh, think not I am faithful to a vow!<br/>
Faithless am I save to love's self alone.<br/>
Were you not lovely I would leave you now;<br/>
After the feet of beauty fly my own.<br/>
Were you not still my hunger's rarest food,<br/>
And water ever to my wildest thirst,<br/>
I would desert you&#151;think not but I would!&#151;<br/>
And seek another as I sought you first.<br/>
But you are mobile as the veering air,<br/>
And all your charms more changeful than the tide,<br/>
Wherefore to be inconstant is no care:<br/>
I have but to continue at your side.<br/>
So wanton, light and false, my love, are you,<br/>
I am most faithless when I most am true.

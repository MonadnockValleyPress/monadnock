<h1>The Wagon Stopped before the House</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
A wagon stopped before the house; she heard<br/>
The heavy oilskins of the grocer's man<br/>
Slapping against his legs. Of a sudden whirred<br/>
Her heart like a frightened partridge, and she ran<br/>
And slid the bolt, leaving his entrance free;<br/>
Then in the cellar way till he was gone<br/>
Hid, breathless, praying that he might not see<br/>
The chair sway she had laid her hand upon<br/>
In passing. Sour and damp from that dark vault<br/>
Arose to her the well-remembered chill;<br/>
She saw the narrow wooden stairway still<br/>
Plunging into the earth, and the thin salt<br/>
Crusting the crocks; until she knew him far,<br/>
So stood, with listening eyes upon the empty doughnut jar.

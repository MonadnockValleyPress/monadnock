<h1>The Little Ghost</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I knew her for a little ghost<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in my garden walked;<br/>
The wall is high &#151; higher than most &#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the green gate was locked.
</p>
<p>
And yet I did not think of that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till after she was gone &#151;<br/>
I knew her by the broad white hat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ruffled, she had on.
</p>
<p>
By the dear ruffles round her feet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By her small hands that hung<br/>
In their lace mitts, austere and sweet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her gown's white folds among.
</p>
<p>
I watched to see if she would stay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she would do &#151; and oh!<br/>
She looked as if she liked the way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I let my garden grow!
</p>
<p>
She bent above my favourite mint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With conscious garden grace,<br/>
She smiled and smiled &#151; there was no hint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sadness in her face.
</p>
<p>
She held her gown on either side<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let her slippers show,<br/>
And up the walk she went with pride,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way great ladies go.
</p>
<p>
And where the wall is built in new<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is of ivy bare<br/>
She paused &#151; then opened and passed through<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gate that once was there.

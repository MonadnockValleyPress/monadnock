<h1>Renascence</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
All I could see from where I stood<br/>
Was three long mountains and a wood;<br/>
I turned and looked another way,<br/>
And saw three islands in a bay.<br/>
So with my eyes I traced the line<br/>
Of the horizon, thin and fine,<br/>
Straight around till I was come<br/>
Back to where I'd started from;<br/>
And all I saw from where I stood<br/>
Was three long mountains and a wood.<br/>
Over these things I could not see;<br/>
These were the things that bounded me;<br/>
And I could touch them with my hand,<br/>
Almost, I thought, from where I stand.<br/>
And all at once things seemed so small<br/>
My breath came short, and scarce at all.<br/>
But, sure, the sky is big, I said;<br/>
Miles and miles above my head;<br/>
So here upon my back I'll lie<br/>
And look my fill into the sky.<br/>
And so I looked, and, after all,<br/>
The sky was not so very tall.<br/>
The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,<br/>
And &#151; sure enough! &#151; I see the top!<br/>
The sky, I thought, is not so grand;<br/>
I 'most could touch it with my hand!<br/>
And reaching up my hand to try,<br/>
I screamed to feel it touch the sky.<br/>
I screamed, and &#151; lo! &#151; Infinity<br/>
Came down and settled over me;<br/>
Forced back my scream into my chest,<br/>
Bent back my arm upon my breast,<br/>
And, pressing of the Undefined<br/>
The definition on my mind,<br/>
Held up before my eyes a glass<br/>
Through which my shrinking sight did pass<br/>
Until it seemed I must behold<br/>
Immensity made manifold;<br/>
Whispered to me a word whose sound<br/>
Deafened the air for worlds around,<br/>
And brought unmuffled to my ears<br/>
The gossiping of friendly spheres,<br/>
The creaking of the tented sky,<br/>
The ticking of Eternity.<br/>
I saw and heard, and knew at last<br/>
The How and Why of all things, past,<br/>
And present, and forevermore.<br/>
The Universe, cleft to the core,<br/>
Lay open to my probing sense<br/>
That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence<br/>
But could not, &#151; nay! But needs must suck<br/>
At the great wound, and could not pluck<br/>
My lips away till I had drawn<br/>
All venom out. &#151; Ah, fearful pawn!<br/>
For my omniscience paid I toll<br/>
In infinite remorse of soul.<br/>
All sin was of my sinning, all<br/>
Atoning mine, and mine the gall<br/>
Of all regret. Mine was the weight<br/>
Of every brooded wrong, the hate<br/>
That stood behind each envious thrust,<br/>
Mine every greed, mine every lust.<br/>
And all the while for every grief,<br/>
Each suffering, I craved relief<br/>
With individual desire, &#151;<br/>
Craved all in vain!  And felt fierce fire<br/>
About a thousand people crawl;<br/>
Perished with each, &#151; then mourned for all!<br/>
A man was starving in Capri;<br/>
He moved his eyes and looked at me;<br/>
I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,<br/>
And knew his hunger as my own.<br/>
I saw at sea a great fog bank<br/>
Between two ships that struck and sank;<br/>
A thousand screams the heavens smote;<br/>
And every scream tore through my throat.<br/>
No hurt I did not feel, no death<br/>
That was not mine; mine each last breath<br/>
That, crying, met an answering cry<br/>
From the compassion that was I.<br/>
All suffering mine, and mine its rod;<br/>
Mine, pity like the pity of God.<br/>
Ah, awful weight!  Infinity<br/>
Pressed down upon the finite Me!<br/>
My anguished spirit, like a bird,<br/>
Beating against my lips I heard;<br/>
Yet lay the weight so close about<br/>
There was no room for it without.<br/>
And so beneath the weight lay I<br/>
And suffered death, but could not die.
</p>
<p>
Long had I lain thus, craving death,<br/>
When quietly the earth beneath<br/>
Gave way, and inch by inch, so great<br/>
At last had grown the crushing weight,<br/>
Into the earth I sank till I<br/>
Full six feet under ground did lie,<br/>
And sank no more, &#151; there is no weight<br/>
Can follow here, however great.<br/>
From off my breast I felt it roll,<br/>
And as it went my tortured soul<br/>
Burst forth and fled in such a gust<br/>
That all about me swirled the dust.
</p>
<p>
Deep in the earth I rested now;<br/>
Cool is its hand upon the brow<br/>
And soft its breast beneath the head<br/>
Of one who is so gladly dead.<br/>
And all at once, and over all<br/>
The pitying rain began to fall;<br/>
I lay and heard each pattering hoof<br/>
Upon my lowly, thatched roof,<br/>
And seemed to love the sound far more<br/>
Than ever I had done before.<br/>
For rain it hath a friendly sound<br/>
To one who's six feet underground;<br/>
And scarce the friendly voice or face:<br/>
A grave is such a quiet place.
</p>
<p>
The rain, I said, is kind to come<br/>
And speak to me in my new home.<br/>
I would I were alive again<br/>
To kiss the fingers of the rain,<br/>
To drink into my eyes the shine<br/>
Of every slanting silver line,<br/>
To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze<br/>
From drenched and dripping apple-trees.<br/>
For soon the shower will be done,<br/>
And then the broad face of the sun<br/>
Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth<br/>
Until the world with answering mirth<br/>
Shakes joyously, and each round drop<br/>
Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.<br/>
How can I bear it; buried here,<br/>
While overhead the sky grows clear<br/>
And blue again after the storm?<br/>
O, multi-colored, multiform,<br/>
Beloved beauty over me,<br/>
That I shall never, never see<br/>
Again!  Spring-silver, autumn-gold,<br/>
That I shall never more behold!<br/>
Sleeping your myriad magics through,<br/>
Close-sepulchred away from you!<br/>
O God, I cried, give me new birth,<br/>
And put me back upon the earth!<br/>
Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd<br/>
And let the heavy rain, down-poured<br/>
In one big torrent, set me free,<br/>
Washing my grave away from me!
</p>
<p>
I ceased; and through the breathless hush<br/>
That answered me, the far-off rush<br/>
Of herald wings came whispering<br/>
Like music down the vibrant string<br/>
Of my ascending prayer, and &#151; crash!<br/>
Before the wild wind's whistling lash<br/>
The startled storm-clouds reared on high<br/>
And plunged in terror down the sky,<br/>
And the big rain in one black wave<br/>
Fell from the sky and struck my grave.<br/>
I know not how such things can be;<br/>
I only know there came to me<br/>
A fragrance such as never clings<br/>
To aught save happy living things;<br/>
A sound as of some joyous elf<br/>
Singing sweet songs to please himself,<br/>
And, through and over everything,<br/>
A sense of glad awakening.<br/>
The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,<br/>
Whispering to me I could hear;<br/>
I felt the rain's cool finger-tips<br/>
Brushed tenderly across my lips,<br/>
Laid gently on my sealed sight,<br/>
And all at once the heavy night<br/>
Fell from my eyes and I could see, &#151;<br/>
A drenched and dripping apple-tree,<br/>
A last long line of silver rain,<br/>
A sky grown clear and blue again.<br/>
And as I looked a quickening gust<br/>
Of wind blew up to me and thrust<br/>
Into my face a miracle<br/>
Of orchard-breath, and with the smell, &#151;<br/>
I know not how such things can be! &#151;<br/>
I breathed my soul back into me.<br/>
Ah!  Up then from the ground sprang I<br/>
And hailed the earth with such a cry<br/>
As is not heard save from a man<br/>
Who has been dead, and lives again.<br/>
About the trees my arms I wound;<br/>
Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;<br/>
I raised my quivering arms on high;<br/>
I laughed and laughed into the sky,<br/>
Till at my throat a strangling sob<br/>
Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb<br/>
Sent instant tears into my eyes;<br/>
O God, I cried, no dark disguise<br/>
Can e'er hereafter hide from me<br/>
Thy radiant identity!<br/>
Thou canst not move across the grass<br/>
But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,<br/>
Nor speak, however silently,<br/>
But my hushed voice will answer Thee.<br/>
I know the path that tells Thy way<br/>
Through the cool eve of every day;<br/>
God, I can push the grass apart<br/>
And lay my finger on Thy heart!
</p>
<p>
The world stands out on either side<br/>
No wider than the heart is wide;<br/>
Above the world is stretched the sky, &#151;<br/>
No higher than the soul is high.<br/>
The heart can push the sea and land<br/>
Farther away on either hand;<br/>
The soul can split the sky in two,<br/>
And let the face of God shine through.<br/>
But East and West will pinch the heart<br/>
That can not keep them pushed apart;<br/>
And he whose soul is flat &#151; the sky<br/>
Will cave in on him by and by.

<h1>Renascence and Other Poems</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay (1917)</h2>

<h3>Renascence</h3>
<p>
All I could see from where I stood<br />
Was three long mountains and a wood;<br />
I turned and looked another way,<br />
And saw three islands in a bay.<br />
So with my eyes I traced the line<br />
Of the horizon, thin and fine,<br />
Straight around till I was come<br />
Back to where I'd started from;<br />
And all I saw from where I stood<br />
Was three long mountains and a wood.<br />
Over these things I could not see;<br />
These were the things that bounded me;<br />
And I could touch them with my hand,<br />
Almost, I thought, from where I stand.<br />
And all at once things seemed so small<br />
My breath came short, and scarce at all.<br />
But, sure, the sky is big, I said;<br />
Miles and miles above my head;<br />
So here upon my back I'll lie<br />
And look my fill into the sky.<br />
And so I looked, and, after all,<br />
The sky was not so very tall.<br />
The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,<br />
And &#151; sure enough! &#151; I see the top!<br />
The sky, I thought, is not so grand;<br />
I 'most could touch it with my hand!<br />
And reaching up my hand to try,<br />
I screamed to feel it touch the sky.<br />
I screamed, and &#151; lo! &#151; Infinity<br />
Came down and settled over me;<br />
Forced back my scream into my chest,<br />
Bent back my arm upon my breast,<br />
And, pressing of the Undefined<br />
The definition on my mind,<br />
Held up before my eyes a glass<br />
Through which my shrinking sight did pass<br />
Until it seemed I must behold<br />
Immensity made manifold;<br />
Whispered to me a word whose sound<br />
Deafened the air for worlds around,<br />
And brought unmuffled to my ears<br />
The gossiping of friendly spheres,<br />
The creaking of the tented sky,<br />
The ticking of Eternity.<br />
I saw and heard, and knew at last<br />
The How and Why of all things, past,<br />
And present, and forevermore.<br />
The Universe, cleft to the core,<br />
Lay open to my probing sense<br />
That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence<br />
But could not, &#151; nay! But needs must suck<br />
At the great wound, and could not pluck<br />
My lips away till I had drawn<br />
All venom out. &#151; Ah, fearful pawn!<br />
For my omniscience paid I toll<br />
In infinite remorse of soul.<br />
All sin was of my sinning, all<br />
Atoning mine, and mine the gall<br />
Of all regret. Mine was the weight<br />
Of every brooded wrong, the hate<br />
That stood behind each envious thrust,<br />
Mine every greed, mine every lust.<br />
And all the while for every grief,<br />
Each suffering, I craved relief<br />
With individual desire, &#151;<br />
Craved all in vain!  And felt fierce fire<br />
About a thousand people crawl;<br />
Perished with each, &#151; then mourned for all!<br />
A man was starving in Capri;<br />
He moved his eyes and looked at me;<br />
I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,<br />
And knew his hunger as my own.<br />
I saw at sea a great fog bank<br />
Between two ships that struck and sank;<br />
A thousand screams the heavens smote;<br />
And every scream tore through my throat.<br />
No hurt I did not feel, no death<br />
That was not mine; mine each last breath<br />
That, crying, met an answering cry<br />
From the compassion that was I.<br />
All suffering mine, and mine its rod;<br />
Mine, pity like the pity of God.<br />
Ah, awful weight!  Infinity<br />
Pressed down upon the finite Me!<br />
My anguished spirit, like a bird,<br />
Beating against my lips I heard;<br />
Yet lay the weight so close about<br />
There was no room for it without.<br />
And so beneath the weight lay I<br />
And suffered death, but could not die.
</p>
<p>
Long had I lain thus, craving death,<br />
When quietly the earth beneath<br />
Gave way, and inch by inch, so great<br />
At last had grown the crushing weight,<br />
Into the earth I sank till I<br />
Full six feet under ground did lie,<br />
And sank no more, &#151; there is no weight<br />
Can follow here, however great.<br />
From off my breast I felt it roll,<br />
And as it went my tortured soul<br />
Burst forth and fled in such a gust<br />
That all about me swirled the dust.
</p>
<p>
Deep in the earth I rested now;<br />
Cool is its hand upon the brow<br />
And soft its breast beneath the head<br />
Of one who is so gladly dead.<br />
And all at once, and over all<br />
The pitying rain began to fall;<br />
I lay and heard each pattering hoof<br />
Upon my lowly, thatched roof,<br />
And seemed to love the sound far more<br />
Than ever I had done before.<br />
For rain it hath a friendly sound<br />
To one who's six feet underground;<br />
And scarce the friendly voice or face:<br />
A grave is such a quiet place.
</p>
<p>
The rain, I said, is kind to come<br />
And speak to me in my new home.<br />
I would I were alive again<br />
To kiss the fingers of the rain,<br />
To drink into my eyes the shine<br />
Of every slanting silver line,<br />
To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze<br />
From drenched and dripping apple-trees.<br />
For soon the shower will be done,<br />
And then the broad face of the sun<br />
Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth<br />
Until the world with answering mirth<br />
Shakes joyously, and each round drop<br />
Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.<br />
How can I bear it; buried here,<br />
While overhead the sky grows clear<br />
And blue again after the storm?<br />
O, multi-colored, multiform,<br />
Beloved beauty over me,<br />
That I shall never, never see<br />
Again!  Spring-silver, autumn-gold,<br />
That I shall never more behold!<br />
Sleeping your myriad magics through,<br />
Close-sepulchred away from you!<br />
O God, I cried, give me new birth,<br />
And put me back upon the earth!<br />
Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd<br />
And let the heavy rain, down-poured<br />
In one big torrent, set me free,<br />
Washing my grave away from me!
</p>
<p>
I ceased; and through the breathless hush<br />
That answered me, the far-off rush<br />
Of herald wings came whispering<br />
Like music down the vibrant string<br />
Of my ascending prayer, and &#151; crash!<br />
Before the wild wind's whistling lash<br />
The startled storm-clouds reared on high<br />
And plunged in terror down the sky,<br />
And the big rain in one black wave<br />
Fell from the sky and struck my grave.<br />
I know not how such things can be;<br />
I only know there came to me<br />
A fragrance such as never clings<br />
To aught save happy living things;<br />
A sound as of some joyous elf<br />
Singing sweet songs to please himself,<br />
And, through and over everything,<br />
A sense of glad awakening.<br />
The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,<br />
Whispering to me I could hear;<br />
I felt the rain's cool finger-tips<br />
Brushed tenderly across my lips,<br />
Laid gently on my sealed sight,<br />
And all at once the heavy night<br />
Fell from my eyes and I could see, &#151;<br />
A drenched and dripping apple-tree,<br />
A last long line of silver rain,<br />
A sky grown clear and blue again.<br />
And as I looked a quickening gust<br />
Of wind blew up to me and thrust<br />
Into my face a miracle<br />
Of orchard-breath, and with the smell, &#151;<br />
I know not how such things can be! &#151;<br />
I breathed my soul back into me.<br />
Ah!  Up then from the ground sprang I<br />
And hailed the earth with such a cry<br />
As is not heard save from a man<br />
Who has been dead, and lives again.<br />
About the trees my arms I wound;<br />
Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;<br />
I raised my quivering arms on high;<br />
I laughed and laughed into the sky,<br />
Till at my throat a strangling sob<br />
Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb<br />
Sent instant tears into my eyes;<br />
O God, I cried, no dark disguise<br />
Can e'er hereafter hide from me<br />
Thy radiant identity!<br />
Thou canst not move across the grass<br />
But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,<br />
Nor speak, however silently,<br />
But my hushed voice will answer Thee.<br />
I know the path that tells Thy way<br />
Through the cool eve of every day;<br />
God, I can push the grass apart<br />
And lay my finger on Thy heart!
</p>
<p>
The world stands out on either side<br />
No wider than the heart is wide;<br />
Above the world is stretched the sky, &#151;<br />
No higher than the soul is high.<br />
The heart can push the sea and land<br />
Farther away on either hand;<br />
The soul can split the sky in two,<br />
And let the face of God shine through.<br />
But East and West will pinch the heart<br />
That can not keep them pushed apart;<br />
And he whose soul is flat &#151; the sky<br />
Will cave in on him by and by.
</p>

<h3>Interim</h3>
<p>
The room is full of you! &#151; As I came in<br />
And closed the door behind me, all at once<br />
A something in the air, intangible,<br />
Yet stiff with meaning, struck my senses sick! &#151;
</p>
<p>
Sharp, unfamiliar odors have destroyed<br />
Each other room's dear personality.<br />
The heavy scent of damp, funereal flowers, &#151;<br />
The very essence, hush-distilled, of Death &#151;<br />
Has strangled that habitual breath of home<br />
Whose expiration leaves all houses dead;<br />
And wheresoe'er I look is hideous change.<br />
Save here.  Here 'twas as if a weed-choked gate<br />
Had opened at my touch, and I had stepped<br />
Into some long-forgot, enchanted, strange,<br />
Sweet garden of a thousand years ago<br />
And suddenly thought, "I have been here before!"
</p>
<p>
You are not here.  I know that you are gone,<br />
And will not ever enter here again.<br />
And yet it seems to me, if I should speak,<br />
Your silent step must wake across the hall;<br />
If I should turn my head, that your sweet eyes<br />
Would kiss me from the door. &#151; So short a time<br />
To teach my life its transposition to<br />
This difficult and unaccustomed key! &#151;<br />
The room is as you left it; your last touch &#151;<br />
A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself<br />
As saintly &#151; hallows now each simple thing;<br />
Hallows and glorifies, and glows between<br />
The dust's grey fingers like a shielded light.
</p>
<p>
There is your book, just as you laid it down,<br />
Face to the table, &#151; I cannot believe<br />
That you are gone! &#151; Just then it seemed to me<br />
You must be here.  I almost laughed to think<br />
How like reality the dream had been;<br />
Yet knew before I laughed, and so was still.<br />
That book, outspread, just as you laid it down!<br />
Perhaps you thought, "I wonder what comes next,<br />
And whether this or this will be the end";<br />
So rose, and left it, thinking to return.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps that chair, when you arose and passed<br />
Out of the room, rocked silently a while<br />
Ere it again was still. When you were gone<br />
Forever from the room, perhaps that chair,<br />
Stirred by your movement, rocked a little while,<br />
Silently, to and fro. . .
</p>
<p>
And here are the last words your fingers wrote,<br />
Scrawled in broad characters across a page<br />
In this brown book I gave you. Here your hand,<br />
Guiding your rapid pen, moved up and down.<br />
Here with a looping knot you crossed a "t",<br />
And here another like it, just beyond<br />
These two eccentric "e's".  You were so small,<br />
And wrote so brave a hand!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How strange it seems<br />
That of all words these are the words you chose!<br />
And yet a simple choice; you did not know<br />
You would not write again.  If you had known &#151;<br />
But then, it does not matter, &#151; and indeed<br />
If you had known there was so little time<br />
You would have dropped your pen and come to me<br />
And this page would be empty, and some phrase<br />
Other than this would hold my wonder now.<br />
Yet, since you could not know, and it befell<br />
That these are the last words your fingers wrote,<br />
There is a dignity some might not see<br />
In this, "I picked the first sweet-pea to-day."<br />
To-day!  Was there an opening bud beside it<br />
You left until to-morrow? &#151; O my love,<br />
The things that withered, &#151; and you came not back!<br />
That day you filled this circle of my arms<br />
That now is empty.  (O my empty life!)<br />
That day &#151; that day you picked the first sweet-pea, &#151;<br />
And brought it in to show me!  I recall<br />
With terrible distinctness how the smell<br />
Of your cool gardens drifted in with you.<br />
I know, you held it up for me to see<br />
And flushed because I looked not at the flower,<br />
But at your face; and when behind my look<br />
You saw such unmistakable intent<br />
You laughed and brushed your flower against my lips.<br />
(You were the fairest thing God ever made,<br />
I think.)  And then your hands above my heart<br />
Drew down its stem into a fastening,<br />
And while your head was bent I kissed your hair.<br />
I wonder if you knew.  (Beloved hands!<br />
Somehow I cannot seem to see them still.<br />
Somehow I cannot seem to see the dust<br />
In your bright hair.)  What is the need of Heaven<br />
When earth can be so sweet? &#151; If only God<br />
Had let us love, &#151; and show the world the way!<br />
Strange cancellings must ink th' eternal books<br />
When love-crossed-out will bring the answer right!<br />
That first sweet-pea!  I wonder where it is.<br />
It seems to me I laid it down somewhere,<br />
And yet, &#151; I am not sure. I am not sure,<br />
Even, if it was white or pink; for then<br />
'Twas much like any other flower to me,<br />
Save that it was the first.  I did not know,<br />
Then, that it was the last.  If I had known &#151;<br />
But then, it does not matter.  Strange how few,<br />
After all's said and done, the things that are<br />
Of moment.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Few indeed!  When I can make<br />
Of ten small words a rope to hang the world!<br />
"I had you and I have you now no more."<br />
There, there it dangles, &#151; where's the little truth<br />
That can for long keep footing under that<br />
When its slack syllables tighten to a thought?<br />
Here, let me write it down!  I wish to see<br />
Just how a thing like that will look on paper!
</p>
<p>
<em>"I had you and I have you now no more."</em>
</p>
<p>
O little words, how can you run so straight<br />
Across the page, beneath the weight you bear?<br />
How can you fall apart, whom such a theme<br />
Has bound together, and hereafter aid<br />
In trivial expression, that have been<br />
So hideously dignified? &#151; Would God<br />
That tearing you apart would tear the thread<br />
I strung you on!  Would God &#151; O God, my mind<br />
Stretches asunder on this merciless rack<br />
Of imagery!  O, let me sleep a while!<br />
Would I could sleep, and wake to find me back<br />
In that sweet summer afternoon with you.<br />
Summer?  'Tis summer still by the calendar!<br />
How easily could God, if He so willed,<br />
Set back the world a little turn or two!<br />
Correct its griefs, and bring its joys again!
</p>
<p>
We were so wholly one I had not thought<br />
That we could die apart.  I had not thought<br />
That I could move, &#151; and you be stiff and still!<br />
That I could speak, &#151; and you perforce be dumb!<br />
I think our heart-strings were, like warp and woof<br />
In some firm fabric, woven in and out;<br />
Your golden filaments in fair design<br />
Across my duller fibre.  And to-day<br />
The shining strip is rent; the exquisite<br />
Fine pattern is destroyed; part of your heart<br />
Aches in my breast; part of my heart lies chilled<br />
In the damp earth with you.  I have been torn<br />
In two, and suffer for the rest of me.<br />
What is my life to me?  And what am I<br />
To life, &#151; a ship whose star has guttered out?<br />
A Fear that in the deep night starts awake<br />
Perpetually, to find its senses strained<br />
Against the taut strings of the quivering air,<br />
Awaiting the return of some dread chord?
</p>
<p>
Dark, Dark, is all I find for metaphor;<br />
All else were contrast, &#151; save that contrast's wall<br />
Is down, and all opposed things flow together<br />
Into a vast monotony, where night<br />
And day, and frost and thaw, and death and life,<br />
Are synonyms.  What now &#151; what now to me<br />
Are all the jabbering birds and foolish flowers<br />
That clutter up the world?  You were my song!<br />
Now, let discord scream!  You were my flower!<br />
Now let the world grow weeds!  For I shall not<br />
Plant things above your grave &#151; (the common balm<br />
Of the conventional woe for its own wound!)<br />
Amid sensations rendered negative<br />
By your elimination stands to-day,<br />
Certain, unmixed, the element of grief;<br />
I sorrow; and I shall not mock my truth<br />
With travesties of suffering, nor seek<br />
To effigy its incorporeal bulk<br />
In little wry-faced images of woe.
</p>
<p>
I cannot call you back; and I desire<br />
No utterance of my immaterial voice.<br />
I cannot even turn my face this way<br />
Or that, and say, "My face is turned to you";<br />
I know not where you are, I do not know<br />
If Heaven hold you or if earth transmute,<br />
Body and soul, you into earth again;<br />
But this I know: &#151; not for one second's space<br />
Shall I insult my sight with visionings<br />
Such as the credulous crowd so eager-eyed<br />
Beholds, self-conjured, in the empty air.<br />
Let the world wail!  Let drip its easy tears!<br />
My sorrow shall be dumb!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#151; What do I say?<br />
God! God! &#151; God pity me!  Am I gone mad<br />
That I should spit upon a rosary?<br />
Am I become so shrunken?  Would to God<br />
I too might feel that frenzied faith whose touch<br />
Makes temporal the most enduring grief;<br />
Though it must walk a while, as is its wont,<br />
With wild lamenting!  Would I too might weep<br />
Where weeps the world and hangs its piteous wreaths<br />
For its new dead!  Not Truth, but Faith, it is<br />
That keeps the world alive.  If all at once<br />
Faith were to slacken, &#151; that unconscious faith<br />
Which must, I know, yet be the corner-stone<br />
Of all believing, &#151; birds now flying fearless<br />
Across would drop in terror to the earth;<br />
Fishes would drown; and the all-governing reins<br />
Would tangle in the frantic hands of God<br />
And the worlds gallop headlong to destruction!
</p>
<p>
O God, I see it now, and my sick brain<br />
Staggers and swoons!  How often over me<br />
Flashes this breathlessness of sudden sight<br />
In which I see the universe unrolled<br />
Before me like a scroll and read thereon<br />
Chaos and Doom, where helpless planets whirl<br />
Dizzily round and round and round and round,<br />
Like tops across a table, gathering speed<br />
With every spin, to waver on the edge<br />
One instant &#151; looking over &#151; and the next<br />
To shudder and lurch forward out of sight &#151;<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*    *    *    *    *
</p>
<p>
Ah, I am worn out &#151; I am wearied out &#151;<br />
It is too much &#151; I am but flesh and blood,<br />
And I must sleep.  Though you were dead again,<br />
I am but flesh and blood and I must sleep.
</p>

<h3>The Suicide</h3>
<p>
"Curse thee, Life, I will live with thee no more!<br />
Thou hast mocked me, starved me, beat my body sore!<br />
And all for a pledge that was not pledged by me,<br />
I have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly<br />
That I might eat again, and met thy sneers<br />
With deprecations, and thy blows with tears, &#151;<br />
Aye, from thy glutted lash, glad, crawled away,<br />
As if spent passion were a holiday!<br />
And now I go.  Nor threat, nor easy vow<br />
Of tardy kindness can avail thee now<br />
With me, whence fear and faith alike are flown;<br />
Lonely I came, and I depart alone,<br />
And know not where nor unto whom I go;<br />
But that thou canst not follow me I know."
</p>
<p>
Thus I to Life, and ceased; but through my brain<br />
My thought ran still, until I spake again:
</p>
<p>
"Ah, but I go not as I came, &#151; no trace<br />
Is mine to bear away of that old grace<br />
I brought!  I have been heated in thy fires,<br />
Bent by thy hands, fashioned to thy desires,<br />
Thy mark is on me!  I am not the same<br />
Nor ever more shall be, as when I came.<br />
Ashes am I of all that once I seemed.<br />
In me all's sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed<br />
Is wakeful for alarm, &#151; oh, shame to thee,<br />
For the ill change that thou hast wrought in me,<br />
Who laugh no more nor lift my throat to sing!<br />
Ah, Life, I would have been a pleasant thing<br />
To have about the house when I was grown<br />
If thou hadst left my little joys alone!<br />
I asked of thee no favor save this one:<br />
That thou wouldst leave me playing in the sun!<br />
And this thou didst deny, calling my name<br />
Insistently, until I rose and came.<br />
I saw the sun no more. &#151; It were not well<br />
So long on these unpleasant thoughts to dwell,<br />
Need I arise to-morrow and renew<br />
Again my hated tasks, but I am through<br />
With all things save my thoughts and this one night,<br />
So that in truth I seem already quite<br />
Free and remote from thee, &#151; I feel no haste<br />
And no reluctance to depart; I taste<br />
Merely, with thoughtful mien, an unknown draught,<br />
That in a little while I shall have quaffed."
</p>
<p>
Thus I to Life, and ceased, and slightly smiled,<br />
Looking at nothing; and my thin dreams filed<br />
Before me one by one till once again<br />
I set new words unto an old refrain:
</p>
<p>
"Treasures thou hast that never have been mine!<br />
Warm lights in many a secret chamber shine<br />
Of thy gaunt house, and gusts of song have blown<br />
Like blossoms out to me that sat alone!<br />
And I have waited well for thee to show<br />
If any share were mine, &#151; and now I go!<br />
Nothing I leave, and if I naught attain<br />
I shall but come into mine own again!"<br />
Thus I to Life, and ceased, and spake no more,<br />
But turning, straightway, sought a certain door<br />
In the rear wall.  Heavy it was, and low<br />
And dark, &#151; a way by which none e'er would go<br />
That other exit had, and never knock<br />
Was heard thereat, &#151; bearing a curious lock<br />
Some chance had shown me fashioned faultily,<br />
Whereof Life held content the useless key,<br />
And great coarse hinges, thick and rough with rust,<br />
Whose sudden voice across a silence must,<br />
I knew, be harsh and horrible to hear, &#151;<br />
A strange door, ugly like a dwarf. &#151; So near<br />
I came I felt upon my feet the chill<br />
Of acid wind creeping across the sill.<br />
So stood longtime, till over me at last<br />
Came weariness, and all things other passed<br />
To make it room; the still night drifted deep<br />
Like snow about me, and I longed for sleep.
</p>
<p>
But, suddenly, marking the morning hour,<br />
Bayed the deep-throated bell within the tower!<br />
Startled, I raised my head, &#151; and with a shout<br />
Laid hold upon the latch, &#151; and was without.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*    *    *    *    *
</p>
<p>
Ah, long-forgotten, well-remembered road,<br />
Leading me back unto my old abode,<br />
My father's house!  There in the night I came,<br />
And found them feasting, and all things the same<br />
As they had been before.  A splendour hung<br />
Upon the walls, and such sweet songs were sung<br />
As, echoing out of very long ago,<br />
Had called me from the house of Life, I know.<br />
So fair their raiment shone I looked in shame<br />
On the unlovely garb in which I came;<br />
Then straightway at my hesitancy mocked:<br />
"It is my father's house!" I said and knocked;<br />
And the door opened.  To the shining crowd<br />
Tattered and dark I entered, like a cloud,<br />
Seeing no face but his; to him I crept,<br />
And "Father!" I cried, and clasped his knees, and wept.<br />
Ah, days of joy that followed!  All alone<br />
I wandered through the house.  My own, my own,<br />
My own to touch, my own to taste and smell,<br />
All I had lacked so long and loved so well!<br />
None shook me out of sleep, nor hushed my song,<br />
Nor called me in from the sunlight all day long.
</p>
<p>
I know not when the wonder came to me<br />
Of what my father's business might be,<br />
And whither fared and on what errands bent<br />
The tall and gracious messengers he sent.<br />
Yet one day with no song from dawn till night<br />
Wondering, I sat, and watched them out of sight.<br />
And the next day I called; and on the third<br />
Asked them if I might go, &#151; but no one heard.<br />
Then, sick with longing, I arose at last<br />
And went unto my father, &#151; in that vast<br />
Chamber wherein he for so many years<br />
Has sat, surrounded by his charts and spheres.<br />
"Father," I said, "Father, I cannot play<br />
The harp that thou didst give me, and all day<br />
I sit in idleness, while to and fro<br />
About me thy serene, grave servants go;<br />
And I am weary of my lonely ease.<br />
Better a perilous journey overseas<br />
Away from thee, than this, the life I lead,<br />
To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed<br />
That grows to naught, &#151; I love thee more than they<br />
Who serve thee most; yet serve thee in no way.<br />
Father, I beg of thee a little task<br />
To dignify my days, &#151; 'tis all I ask<br />
Forever, but forever, this denied,<br />
I perish."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Child," my father's voice replied,<br />
"All things thy fancy hath desired of me<br />
Thou hast received.  I have prepared for thee<br />
Within my house a spacious chamber, where<br />
Are delicate things to handle and to wear,<br />
And all these things are thine.  Dost thou love song?<br />
My minstrels shall attend thee all day long.<br />
Or sigh for flowers?  My fairest gardens stand<br />
Open as fields to thee on every hand.<br />
And all thy days this word shall hold the same:<br />
No pleasure shalt thou lack that thou shalt name.<br />
But as for tasks &#151;" he smiled, and shook his head;<br />
"Thou hadst thy task, and laidst it by", he said.
</p>

<h3>God's World</h3>
<p>
O world, I cannot hold thee close enough!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy winds, thy wide grey skies!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy mists, that roll and rise!<br />
Thy woods, this autumn day, that ache and sag<br />
And all but cry with colour!  That gaunt crag<br />
To crush!  To lift the lean of that black bluff!<br />
World, World, I cannot get thee close enough!
</p>
<p>
Long have I known a glory in it all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never knew I this;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here such a passion is<br />
As stretcheth me apart, &#151; Lord, I do fear<br />
Thou'st made the world too beautiful this year;<br />
My soul is all but out of me, &#151; let fall<br />
No burning leaf; prithee, let no bird call.
</p>

<h3>Afternoon on a Hill</h3>
<p>
I will be the gladdest thing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sun!<br />
I will touch a hundred flowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not pick one.
</p>
<p>
I will look at cliffs and clouds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With quiet eyes,<br />
Watch the wind bow down the grass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grass rise.
</p>
<p>
And when lights begin to show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up from the town,<br />
I will mark which must be mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then start down!
</p>

<h3>Sorrow</h3>
<p>
Sorrow like a ceaseless rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beats upon my heart.<br />
People twist and scream in pain, &#151;<br />
Dawn will find them still again;<br />
This has neither wax nor wane,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither stop nor start.
</p>
<p>
People dress and go to town;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit in my chair.<br />
All my thoughts are slow and brown:<br />
Standing up or sitting down<br />
Little matters, or what gown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or what shoes I wear.
</p>

<h3>Tavern</h3>
<p>
I'll keep a little tavern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the high hill's crest,<br />
Wherein all grey-eyed people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May set them down and rest.
</p>
<p>
There shall be plates a-plenty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mugs to melt the chill<br />
Of all the grey-eyed people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who happen up the hill.
</p>
<p>
There sound will sleep the traveller,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dream his journey's end,<br />
But I will rouse at midnight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The falling fire to tend.
</p>
<p>
Aye, 'tis a curious fancy &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all the good I know<br />
Was taught me out of two grey eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago.
</p>

<h3>Ashes of Life</h3>
<p>
Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eat I must, and sleep I will, &#151; and would that night were here!<br />
But ah! &#151; to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that it were day again! &#151; with twilight near!
</p>
<p>
Love has gone and left me and I don't know what to do;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This or that or what you will is all the same to me;<br />
But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through, &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's little use in anything as far as I can see.
</p>
<p>
Love has gone and left me, &#151; and the neighbors knock and borrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse, &#151;<br />
And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's this little street and this little house.
</p>

<h3>The Little Ghost</h3>
<p>
I knew her for a little ghost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in my garden walked;<br />
The wall is high &#151; higher than most &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the green gate was locked.
</p>
<p>
And yet I did not think of that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till after she was gone &#151;<br />
I knew her by the broad white hat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ruffled, she had on.
</p>
<p>
By the dear ruffles round her feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By her small hands that hung<br />
In their lace mitts, austere and sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her gown's white folds among.
</p>
<p>
I watched to see if she would stay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she would do &#151; and oh!<br />
She looked as if she liked the way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I let my garden grow!
</p>
<p>
She bent above my favourite mint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With conscious garden grace,<br />
She smiled and smiled &#151; there was no hint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sadness in her face.
</p>
<p>
She held her gown on either side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let her slippers show,<br />
And up the walk she went with pride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way great ladies go.
</p>
<p>
And where the wall is built in new<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is of ivy bare<br />
She paused &#151; then opened and passed through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gate that once was there.
</p>

<h3>Kin to Sorrow</h3>
<p>
Am I kin to Sorrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That so oft<br />
Falls the knocker of my door &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither loud nor soft,<br />
But as long accustomed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Sorrow's hand?<br />
Marigolds around the step<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rosemary stand,<br />
And then comes Sorrow &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what does Sorrow care<br />
For the rosemary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the marigolds there?<br />
Am I kin to Sorrow?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we kin?<br />
That so oft upon my door &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Oh, come in!</em>
</p>

<h3>Three Songs of Shattering</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p>
The first rose on my rose-tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budded, bloomed, and shattered,<br />
During sad days when to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Nothing mattered.
</p>
<p>
Grief of grief has drained me clean;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still it seems a pity<br />
No one saw, &#151; it must have been<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Very pretty.
</p>

<h4>II</h4>
<p>
Let the little birds sing;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the little lambs play;<br />
Spring is here; and so 'tis spring; &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not in the old way!
</p>
<p>
I recall a place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a plum-tree grew;<br />
There you lifted up your face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blossoms covered you.
</p>
<p>
If the little birds sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the little lambs play,<br />
Spring is here; and so 'tis spring &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not in the old way!
</p>

<h4>III</h4>
<p>
All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere spring was going &#151; ah, spring is gone!<br />
And there comes no summer to the like of you and me, &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossom time is early, but no fruit sets on.
</p>
<p>
All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browned at the edges, turned in a day;<br />
And I would with all my heart they trimmed a mound for me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weeds were tall on all the paths that led that way!
</p>

<h3>The Shroud</h3>
<p>
Death, I say, my heart is bowed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto thine, &#151; O mother!<br />
This red gown will make a shroud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good as any other!
</p>
<p>
(I, that would not wait to wear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own bridal things,<br />
In a dress dark as my hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made my answerings.
</p>
<p>
I, to-night, that till he came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not, could not wait,<br />
In a gown as bright as flame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held for them the gate.)
</p>
<p>
Death, I say, my heart is bowed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto thine, &#151; O mother!<br />
This red gown will make a shroud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good as any other!
</p>

<h3>The Dream</h3>
<p>
Love, if I weep it will not matter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you laugh I shall not care;<br />
Foolish am I to think about it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is good to feel you there.
</p>
<p>
Love, in my sleep I dreamed of waking, &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White and awful the moonlight reached<br />
Over the floor, and somewhere, somewhere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shutter loose, &#151; it screeched!
</p>
<p>
Swung in the wind, &#151; and no wind blowing! &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was afraid, and turned to you,<br />
Put out my hand to you for comfort, &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you were gone!  Cold, cold as dew,
</p>
<p>
Under my hand the moonlight lay!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, if you laugh I shall not care,<br />
But if I weep it will not matter, &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, it is good to feel you there!
</p>

<h3>Indifference</h3>
<p>
I said, &#151; for Love was laggard, O, Love was slow to come, &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll hear his step and know his step when I am warm in bed;<br />
But I'll never leave my pillow, though there be some<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As would let him in &#151; and take him in with tears!" I said.<br />
I lay, &#151; for Love was laggard, O, he came not until dawn, &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lay and listened for his step and could not get to sleep;<br />
And he found me at my window with my big cloak on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sorry with the tears some folks might weep!
</p>

<h3>Witch-Wife</h3>
<p>
She is neither pink nor pale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she never will be all mine;<br />
She learned her hands in a fairy-tale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her mouth on a valentine.
</p>
<p>
She has more hair than she needs;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sun 'tis a woe to me!<br />
And her voice is a string of colored beads,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or steps leading into the sea.
</p>
<p>
She loves me all that she can,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her ways to my ways resign;<br />
But she was not made for any man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she never will be all mine.
</p>

<h3>Blight</h3>
<p>
Hard seeds of hate I planted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should by now be grown, &#151;<br />
Rough stalks, and from thick stamens<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poisonous pollen blown,<br />
And odors rank, unbreathable,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From dark corollas thrown!
</p>
<p>
At dawn from my damp garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook the chilly dew;<br />
The thin boughs locked behind me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sprang to let me through;<br />
The blossoms slept, &#151; I sought a place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where nothing lovely grew.
</p>
<p>
And there, when day was breaking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knelt and looked around:<br />
The light was near, the silence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was palpitant with sound;<br />
I drew my hate from out my breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrust it in the ground.
</p>
<p>
Oh, ye so fiercely tended,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye little seeds of hate!<br />
I bent above your growing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early and noon and late,<br />
Yet are ye drooped and pitiful, &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot rear ye straight!
</p>
<p>
The sun seeks out my garden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No nook is left in shade,<br />
No mist nor mold nor mildew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endures on any blade,<br />
Sweet rain slants under every bough:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye falter, and ye fade.
</p>

<h3>When the Year Grows Old</h3>
<p>
I cannot but remember<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the year grows old &#151;<br />
October &#151; November &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How she disliked the cold!
</p>
<p>
She used to watch the swallows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go down across the sky,<br />
And turn from the window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little sharp sigh.
</p>
<p>
And often when the brown leaves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were brittle on the ground,<br />
And the wind in the chimney<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a melancholy sound,
</p>
<p>
She had a look about her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I wish I could forget &#151;<br />
The look of a scared thing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting in a net!
</p>
<p>
Oh, beautiful at nightfall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft spitting snow!<br />
And beautiful the bare boughs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubbing to and fro!
</p>
<p>
But the roaring of the fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the warmth of fur,<br />
And the boiling of the kettle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were beautiful to her!
</p>
<p>
I cannot but remember<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the year grows old &#151;<br />
October &#151; November &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How she disliked the cold!
</p>

<h3>Sonnets</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p>
Thou art not lovelier than lilacs, &#151; no,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor honeysuckle; thou art not more fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than small white single poppies, &#151; I can bear<br />
Thy beauty; though I bend before thee, though<br />
From left to right, not knowing where to go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn my troubled eyes, nor here nor there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find any refuge from thee, yet I swear<br />
So has it been with mist, &#151; with moonlight so.
</p>
<p>
Like him who day by day unto his draught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of delicate poison adds him one drop more<br />
Till he may drink unharmed the death of ten,<br />
Even so, inured to beauty, who have quaffed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each hour more deeply than the hour before,<br />
I drink &#151; and live &#151; what has destroyed some men.
</p>

<h4>II</h4>
<p>
Time does not bring relief; you all have lied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who told me time would ease me of my pain!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I miss him in the weeping of the rain;<br />
I want him at the shrinking of the tide;<br />
The old snows melt from every mountain-side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And last year's leaves are smoke in every lane;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But last year's bitter loving must remain<br />
Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide!
</p>
<p>
There are a hundred places where I fear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go, &#151; so with his memory they brim!<br />
And entering with relief some quiet place<br />
Where never fell his foot or shone his face<br />
I say, "There is no memory of him here!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so stand stricken, so remembering him!
</p>

<h4>III</h4>
<p>
Mindful of you the sodden earth in spring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the flowers that in the springtime grow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dusty roads, and thistles, and the slow<br />
Rising of the round moon, all throats that sing<br />
The summer through, and each departing wing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the nests that the bared branches show,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all winds that in any weather blow,<br />
And all the storms that the four seasons bring.
</p>
<p>
You go no more on your exultant feet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up paths that only mist and morning knew,<br />
Or watch the wind, or listen to the beat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a bird's wings too high in air to view, &#151;<br />
But you were something more than young and sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fair, &#151; and the long year remembers you.
</p>

<h4>IV</h4>
<p>
Not in this chamber only at my birth &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the long hours of that mysterious night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were over, and the morning was in sight &#151;<br />
I cried, but in strange places, steppe and firth<br />
I have not seen, through alien grief and mirth;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never shall one room contain me quite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in so many rooms first saw the light,<br />
Child of all mothers, native of the earth.
</p>
<p>
So is no warmth for me at any fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day, when the world's fire has burned so low;<br />
I kneel, spending my breath in vain desire,<br />
At that cold hearth which one time roared so strong,<br />
And straighten back in weariness, and long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gather up my little gods and go.
</p>

<h4>V</h4>
<p>
If I should learn, in some quite casual way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you were gone, not to return again &#151;<br />
Read from the back-page of a paper, say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held by a neighbor in a subway train,<br />
How at the corner of this avenue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such a street (so are the papers filled)<br />
A hurrying man &#151; who happened to be you &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon to-day had happened to be killed,<br />
I should not cry aloud &#151; I could not cry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloud, or wring my hands in such a place &#151;<br />
I should but watch the station lights rush by<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a more careful interest on my face,<br />
Or raise my eyes and read with greater care<br />
Where to store furs and how to treat the hair.
</p>

<h4>VI Bluebeard</h4>
<p>
This door you might not open, and you did;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So enter now, and see for what slight thing<br />
You are betrayed. . . .  Here is no treasure hid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cauldron, no clear crystal mirroring<br />
The sought-for truth, no heads of women slain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For greed like yours, no writhings of distress,<br />
But only what you see. . . .  Look yet again &#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An empty room, cobwebbed and comfortless.<br />
Yet this alone out of my life I kept<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto myself, lest any know me quite;<br />
And you did so profane me when you crept<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the threshold of this room to-night<br />
That I must never more behold your face.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This now is yours.  I seek another place.

<h1>To a Friend Estranged from Me</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Now goes under, and I watch it go under, the sun<br/>
That will not rise again.<br/>
Today has seen the setting, in your eyes cold and senseless as the sea,<br/>
Of friendship better than bread, and of bright charity<br/>
That lifts a man a little above the beasts that run.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That this could be!<br/>
That I should live to see<br/>
Most vulgar Pride, that stale obstreperous clown,<br/>
So fitted out with purple robe and crown<br/>
To stand among his betters! Face to face<br/>
With outraged me in this once holy place,<br/>
Where Wisdom was a favoured guest and hunted<br/>
Truth was harboured out of danger,<br/>
He bulks enthroned, a lewd, an insupportable stranger!<br/>
</p>
<p>
I would have sworn, indeed I swore it:<br/>
The hills may shift, the waters may decline,<br/>
Winter may twist the stem from the twig that bore it,<br/>
But never your love from me, your hand from mine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now goes under the sun, and I watch it go under.<br/>
Farewell, sweet light, great wonder!<br/>
You, too, farewell,&mdash;but fare not well enough to dream<br/>
You have done wisely to invite the night before the darkness came.<br/>
</p>

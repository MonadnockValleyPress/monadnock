<h1>Gazing upon Him Now</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Gazing upon him now, severe and dead,<br/>
It seemed a curious thing that she had lain<br/>
Beside him many a night in that cold bed,<br/>
And that had been which would not be again.<br/>
From his desirous body the great heat<br/>
Was gone at last, it seemed, and the taut nerves<br/>
Loosened forever. Formally the sheet<br/>
Set forth for her to-day those heavy curves<br/>
And lengths familiar as the bedroom door.<br/>
She was as one that enters, sly, and proud,<br/>
To where her husband speaks before a crowd,<br/>
And sees a man she never saw before&mdash;<br/>
The man who eats his victuals at her side,<br/>
Small, and absurd, and hers: for once, not hers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unclassified.

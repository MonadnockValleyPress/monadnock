<h1>The Last White Sawdust</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
The last white sawdust on the floor was grown<br/>
Gray as the first, so long had he been ill;<br/>
The axe was nodding in the block; fresh-blown<br/>
And foreign came the rain across the sill,<br/>
But on the roof so steadily it drummed<br/>
She could not think a time it might not be&mdash;<br/>
In hazy summer, when the hot air hummed<br/>
With mowing, and locusts rising raspingly,<br/>
When that small bird with iridescent wings<br/>
And long incredible sudden silver tongue<br/>
Had just flashed (and yet may be not!) among<br/>
The dwarf nasturtiums&mdash;when no sagging springs<br/>
Of shower were in the whole bright sky, somehow<br/>
Upon this roof the rain would drum as it was drumming now.

<h1>The Penitent</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I had a little Sorrow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born of a little Sin,<br/>
I found a room all damp with gloom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shut us all within;<br/>
And, "Little Sorrow, weep," said I,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, Little Sin, pray God to die,<br/>
And I upon the floor will lie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think how bad I've been!"
</p>
<p>
Alas for pious planning&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It mattered not a whit!<br/>
As far as gloom went in that room,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp might have been lit!<br/>
My little Sorrow would not weep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My little Sin would go to sleep&#151;<br/>
To save my soul I could not keep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My graceless mind on it!
</p>
<p>
So up I got in anger,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took a book I had,<br/>
And put a ribbon on my hair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To please a passing lad,<br/>
And, "One thing there's no getting by&#151;<br/>
I've been a wicked girl," said I;<br/>
"But if I can't be sorry, why,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might as well be glad!"

<h1>The Singing-Woman from the Wood's Edge</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
What should I be but a prophet and a liar,<br/>
Whose mother was a leprechaun, whose father was a friar?<br/>
Teethed on a crucifix and cradled under water,<br/>
What should I be but the fiend's god-daughter?
</p>
<p>
And who should be my playmates but the adder and the frog,<br/>
That was got beneath a furze-bush and born in a bog?<br/>
And what should be my singing, that was christened at an altar,<br/>
But Aves and Credos and Psalms out of the Psalter?
</p>
<p>
You will see such webs on the wet grass, maybe,<br/>
As a pixie-mother weaves for her baby,<br/>
You will find such flame at the wave's weedy ebb<br/>
As flashes in the meshes of a mer-mother's web,
</p>
<p>
But there comes to birth no common spawn<br/>
From the love of a priest for a leprechaun,<br/>
And you never have seen and you never will see<br/>
Such things as the things that swaddled me!
</p>
<p>
After all's said and after all's done,<br/>
What should I be but a harlot and a nun?
</p>
<p>
In through the bushes, on any foggy day,<br/>
My Da would come a-swishing of the drops away,<br/>
With a prayer for my death and a groan for my birth,<br/>
A-mumbling of his beads for all that he was worth.
</p>
<p>
And there'd sit my Ma, with her knees beneath her chin,<br/>
A-looking in his face and a-drinking of it in,<br/>
And a-marking in the moss some funny little saying<br/>
That would mean just the opposite of all that he was praying!
</p>
<p>
He taught me the holy-talk of Vesper and of Matin,<br/>
He heard me my Greek and he heard me my Latin,<br/>
He blessed me and crossed me to keep my soul from evil,<br/>
And we watched him out of sight, and we conjured up the devil!
</p>
<p>
Oh, the things I haven't seen and the things I haven't known.<br/>
What with hedges and ditches till after I was grown,<br/>
And yanked both ways by my mother and my father,<br/>
With a "Which would you better?" and a "Which would you rather?"
</p>
<p>
With him for a sire and her for a dam,<br/>
What should I be but just what I am?

<h1>For Pao-Chin, a Boatman on the Yellow Sea</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Where is he now, in his soiled shirt reeking of garlic,<br/>
Sculling his sampan home, and night approaching fast &mdash;<br/>
The red sail hanging wrinkled on the bamboo mast;
</p>
<p>
Where is he now, I shall remember my whole life long<br/>
With love and praise, for the sake of a small song<br/>
Played on a Chinese flute?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been sad;<br/>
I have been in cities where the song was all I had, &mdash;<br/>
A treasure never to be bartered by the hungry days.
</p>
<p>
Where is he now, for whom I carry in my heart<br/>
This love, this praise?

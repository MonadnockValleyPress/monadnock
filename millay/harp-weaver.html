<h1>The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
"Son," said my mother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was knee-high,<br/>
"You've need of clothes to cover you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a rag have I.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"There's nothing in the house<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a boy breeches,<br/>
Nor shears to cut a cloth with<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor thread to take stitches.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"There's nothing in the house<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a loaf-end of rye,<br/>
And a harp with a woman's head<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody will buy,"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she began to cry.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That was in the early fall.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When came the late fall,<br/>
"Son," she said, "the sight of you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes your mother's blood crawl,&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Little skinny shoulder-blades<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sticking through your clothes!<br/>
And where you'll get a jacket from<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God above knows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"It's lucky for me, lad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your daddy's in the ground,<br/>
And can't see the way I let<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His son go around!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she made a queer sound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That was in the late fall.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the winter came,<br/>
I'd not a pair of breeches<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor a shirt to my name.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I couldn't go to school,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or out of doors to play.<br/>
And all the other little boys<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed our way.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Son," said my mother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, climb into my lap,<br/>
And I'll chafe your little bones<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you take a nap."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And, oh, but we were silly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For half an hour or more,<br/>
Me with my long legs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragging on the floor,<br/>
</p>
<p>
A-rock-rock-rocking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a mother-goose rhyme!<br/>
Oh, but we were happy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For half an hour's time!<br/>
</p>
<p>
But there was I, a great boy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what would folks say<br/>
To hear my mother singing me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sleep all day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a daft way?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Men say the winter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was bad that year;<br/>
Fuel was scarce,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And food was dear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A wind with a wolf's head<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howled about our door,<br/>
And we burned up the chairs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sat upon the floor.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All that was left us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a chair we couldn't break,<br/>
And the harp with a woman's head<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody would take,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For song or pity's sake.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The night before Christmas<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cried with the cold,<br/>
I cried myself to sleep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a two-year-old.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And in the deep night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt my mother rise,<br/>
And stare down upon me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With love in her eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I saw my mother sitting<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one good chair,<br/>
A light falling on her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From I couldn't tell where,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Looking nineteen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a day older,<br/>
And the harp with a woman's head<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaned against her shoulder.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Her thin fingers, moving<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thin, tall strings,<br/>
Were weav-weav-weaving<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful things.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Many bright threads,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From where I couldn't see,<br/>
Were running through the harp-strings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapidly,<br/>
</p>
<p>
And gold threads whistling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through my mother's hand.<br/>
I saw the web grow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pattern expand.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She wove a child's jacket,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when it was done<br/>
She laid it on the floor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wove another one.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She wove a red cloak<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So regal to see,<br/>
"She's made it for a king's son,"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "and not for me."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I knew it was for me.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She wove a pair of breeches<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quicker than that!<br/>
She wove a pair of boots<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a little cocked hat.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She wove a pair of mittens,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wove a little blouse,<br/>
She wove all night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the still, cold house.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She sang as she worked,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the harp-strings spoke;<br/>
Her voice never faltered,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thread never broke.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I awoke,&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
There sat my mother<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the harp against her shoulder,<br/>
Looking nineteen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a day older,<br/>
</p>
<p>
A smile about her lips,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a light about her head,<br/>
And her hands in the harp-strings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frozen dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And piled up beside her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And toppling to the skies,<br/>
Were the clothes of a king's son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just my size.

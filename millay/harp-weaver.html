<h1>The Harp-Weaver and Other Poems</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay (1923)</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Part One</h3>

<h4>My Heart, Being Hungry</h4>

<p>My heart, being hungry, feeds on food<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat of heart despise.<br />
Beauty where beauty never stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweet where no sweet lies<br />
I gather to my querulous need,<br />
Having a growing heart to feed.
</p>
<p>
It may be, when my heart is dull,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having attained its girth,<br />
I shall not find so beautiful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meagre shapes of earth,<br />
Nor linger in the rain to mark<br />
The smell of tansy through the dark.<br />
</p>

<h4>Autumn Chant</h4>

<p>Now the autumn shudders<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rose's root.<br />
Far and wide the ladders<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lean among the fruit.<br />
</p><p>
Now the autumn clambers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the trellised frame,<br />
And the rose remembers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust from which it came.<br />
</p><p>
Brighter than the blossom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rose's bough<br />
Sits the wizened, orange,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitter berry now;<br />
</p><p>
Beauty never slumbers;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is in her name;<br />
But the rose remembers.
</p>

<h4>Nuit Blanche</h4>

<p>I am a shepherd of those sheep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That climb a wall by night,<br />
One after one, until I sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the black pane goes white.<br />
Because of which I cannot see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flock upon a hill,<br />
But doubts come tittering up to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should by day be still.<br />
And childish griefs I have outgrown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into my eyes are thrust,<br />
Till my dull tears go dropping down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like lead into the dust.</p>

<h4>Three Songs from the Lamp and the Bell</h4>

<h5>I</h5>

<p>Oh, little rose tree, bloom!<br />
Summer is nearly over.<br />
The dahlias bleed, and the phlox is seed.<br />
Nothing's left of the clover.<br />
And the path of the poppy no one knows.<br />
I would blossom if I were a rose.<br />
</p><p>
Summer, for all your guile,<br />
Will brown in a week to Autumn,<br />
And launched leaves throw a shadow below<br />
Over the brook's clear bottom,&mdash;<br />
And the chariest bud the year can boast<br />
Be brought to bloom by the chastening frost.</p>

<h5>II</h5>

<p>Beat me a crown of bluer metal;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fret it with stones of a foreign style:<br />
The heart grows weary after a little<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what it loved for a little while.<br />
</p><p>
Weave me a robe of richer fibre;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattern its web with a rare device.<br />
Give away to the child of a neighbor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gold gown I was glad in twice.<br />
</p><p>
But buy me a singer to sing one song&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song about nothing&mdash;song about sheep&mdash;<br />
Over and over, all day long;</p>

<h5>III</h5>

<p>Rain comes down<br />
And hushes the town.<br />
And where is the voice that I heard crying?<br />
</p><p>
Snow settles<br />
Over the nettles.<br />
Where is the voice that I heard crying?<br />
</p><p>
Sand at last<br />
On the drifting mast.<br />
And where is the voice that I heard crying?<br />
</p><p>
Earth now<br />
On the busy brow.<br />
And where is the voice that I heard crying?</p>

<h4>The Wood Road</h4>

<p>If I were to walk this way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand in hand with Grief,<br />
I should mark that maple-spray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming into leaf.<br />
I should note how the old burrs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rot upon the ground.<br />
Yes, though Grief should know me hers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the world goes round,<br />
It could not in truth be said<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was lost on me;<br />
A rock-maple showing red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burrs beneath a tree.</p>

<h4>Feast</h4>

<p>I drank at every vine.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last was like the first.<br />
I came upon no wine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wonderful as thirst.<br />
</p><p>
I gnawed at every root.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ate of every plant.<br />
I came upon no fruit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wonderful as want.<br />
</p><p>
Feed the grape and bean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the vintner and monger;<br />
I will lie down lean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my thirst and my hunger.</p>

<h4>Souvenir</h4>

<p>Just a rainy day or two<br />
In a windy tower,<br />
That was all I had of you&mdash;<br />
Saving half an hour.<br />
</p><p>
Marred by greeting passing groups<br />
In a cinder walk,<br />
Near some naked blackberry hoops<br />
Dim with purple chalk.<br />
</p><p>
I remember three or four<br />
Things you said in spite,<br />
And an ugly coat you wore,<br />
Plaided black and white.<br />
</p><p>
Just a rainy day or two<br />
And a bitter word.<br />
Why do I remember you<br />
As a singing bird?</p>

<h4>Scrub</h4>

<p>If I grow bitterly,<br />
Like a gnarled and stunted tree,<br />
Bearing harshly of my youth<br />
Puckered fruit that sears the mouth;<br />
If I make of my drawn boughs<br />
An inhospitable house,<br />
Out of which I never pry<br />
Towards the water and the sky,<br />
Under which I stand and hide<br />
And hear the day go by outside;<br />
It is that a wind too strong<br />
Bent my back when I was young,<br />
It is that I fear the rain<br />
Lest it blister me again.</p>

<h4>The Goose-Girl</h4>

<p>Spring rides no horses down the hill,<br />
But comes on foot, a goose-girl still.<br />
And all the loveliest things there be<br />
Come simply, so, it seems to me.<br />
If ever I said, in grief or pride,<br />
I tired of honest things, I lied;<br />
And should be cursed forevermore<br />
With Love in laces, like a whore,<br />
And neighbors cold, and friends unsteady,<br />
And Spring on horseback, like a lady!</p>

<h4>The Dragonfly</h4>

<p>I wound myself in a white cocoon of singing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long in the brook's uneven bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measuring out my soul in a mucous thread;<br />
Dimly now to the brook's green bottom clinging,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men behold me, a worm spun-out and dead,<br />
Walled in an iron house of silky singing.<br />
</p><p>
Nevertheless at length, O reedy shallows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as a plodding nose to the slimy stem,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a brazen wing with a spangled hem,<br />
Over the jewel-weed and the pink marshmallows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free of these and making a song of them,<br />
I shall arise, and a song of the reedy shallows!</p>

<h3>Part Two</h3>

<h4>Departure</h4>

<p>It's little I care what path I take,<br />
And where it leads it's little I care;<br />
But out of this house, lest my heart break,<br />
I must go, and off somewhere.<br />
</p><p>
It's little I know what's in my heart,<br />
What's in my mind it's little I know,<br />
But there's that in me must up and start,<br />
And it's little I care where my feet go.<br />
</p><p>
I wish I could walk for a day and a night,<br />
And find me at dawn in a desolate place<br />
With never the rut of a road in sight,<br />
Nor the roof of a house, nor the eyes of a face.<br />
</p><p>
I wish I could walk till my blood should spout,<br />
And drop me, never to stir again,<br />
On a shore that is wide, for the tide is out,<br />
And the weedy rocks are bare to the rain.<br />
</p><p>
But dump or dock, where the path I take<br />
Brings up, it's little enough I care;<br />
And it's little I'd mind the fuss they'll make,<br />
Huddled dead in a ditch somewhere.<br />
</p><p>
<em>"Is something the matter, dear," she said,</em><br />
<em>"That you sit at your work so silently?"</em><br />
<em>"No, mother, no, 'twas a knot in my thread.</em><br />
<em>There goes the kettle, I'll make the tea."</em></p>

<h4>The Return from Town</h4>

<p>As I sat down by Saddle Stream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bathe my dusty feet there,<br />
A boy was standing on the bridge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any girl would meet there.<br />
</p><p>
As I went over Woody Knob<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dipped into the hollow,<br />
A youth was coming up the hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any maid would follow.<br />
</p><p>
Then in I turned at my own gate,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing to be sad for&mdash;<br />
To such a man as any wife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would pass a pretty lad for.</p>

<h4>A Visit to the Asylum</h4>

<p>Once from a big, big building,<br />
When I was small, small,<br />
The queer folk in the windows<br />
Would smile at me and call.<br />
</p><p>
And in the hard wee gardens<br />
Such pleasant men would hoe:<br />
"Sir, may we touch the little girl's hair?"&mdash;<br />
It was so red, you know.<br />
</p><p>
They cut me colored asters<br />
With shears so sharp and neat,<br />
They brought me grapes and plums and pears<br />
And pretty cakes to eat.<br />
</p><p>
And out of all the windows,<br />
No matter where we went,<br />
The merriest eyes would follow me<br />
And make me compliment.<br />
</p><p>
There were a thousand windows,<br />
All latticed up and down.<br />
And up to all the windows,<br />
When we went back to town,<br />
</p><p>
The queer folk put their faces,<br />
As gentle as could be;<br />
"Come again, little girl!" they called, and I<br />
Called back, "You come see me!"</p>

<h4>The Spring and the Fall</h4>

<p>In the spring of the year, in the spring of the year,<br />
I walked the road beside my dear.<br />
The trees were black where the bark was wet.<br />
I see them yet, in the spring of the year.<br />
He broke me a bough of the blossoming peach<br />
That was out of the way and hard to reach.<br />
</p><p>
In the fall of the year, in the fall of the year,<br />
I walked the road beside my dear.<br />
The rooks went up with a raucous trill.<br />
I hear them still, in the fall of the year.<br />
He laughed at all I dared to praise,<br />
And broke my heart, in little ways.<br />
</p><p>
Year be springing or year be falling,<br />
The bark will drip and the birds be calling.<br />
There's much that's fine to see and hear<br />
In the spring of a year, in the fall of a year.<br />
'Tis not love's going hurts my days,<br />
But that it went in little ways.</p>

<h4>The Curse</h4>

<p>Oh, lay my ashes on the wind<br />
That blows across the sea.<br />
And I shall meet a fisherman<br />
Out of Capri,<br />
</p><p>
And he will say, seeing me,<br />
"What a strange thing!<br />
Like a fish's scale or a<br />
Butterfly's wing."<br />
</p><p>
Oh, lay my ashes on the wind<br />
That blows away the fog.<br />
And I shall meet a farmer boy<br />
Leaping through the bog,<br />
</p><p>
And he will say, seeing me,<br />
"What a strange thing!<br />
Like a peat-ash or a<br />
Butterfly's wing."<br />
</p><p>
And I shall blow to your house<br />
And, sucked against the pane,<br />
See you take your sewing up<br />
And lay it down again.<br />
</p><p>
And you will say, seeing me,<br />
"What a strange thing!<br />
Like a plum petal or a<br />
Butterfly's wing."<br />
</p><p>
And none at all will know me<br />
That knew me well before.<br />
But I will settle at the root<br />
That climbs about your door,<br />
</p><p>
And fishermen and farmers<br />
May see me and forget,<br />
But I'll be a bitter berry<br />
In your brewing yet.</p>

<h4>Keen</h4>

<p>Weep him dead and mourn as you may,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me, I sing as I must:<br />
Blessed be Death, that cuts in marble<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would have sunk to dust!<br />
</p><p>
Blessed be Death, that took my love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buried him in the sea,<br />
Where never a lie nor a bitter word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will out of his mouth at me.<br />
</p><p>
This I have to hold to my heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This to take by the hand:<br />
Sweet we were for a summer month<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sun on the dry white sand;<br />
</p><p>
Mild we were for a summer month<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the wind from over the weirs.<br />
And blessed be Death, that hushed with salt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh and slovenly years!<br />
</p><p>
Who builds her a house with love for timber<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Builds her a house of foam.<br />
And I'd rather be bride to a lad gone down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than widow to one safe home.</p>

<h4>The Betrothal</h4>

<p>Oh, come, my lad, or go, my lad,<br />
And love me if you like.<br />
I shall not hear the door shut<br />
Nor the knocker strike.<br />
</p><p>
Oh, bring me gifts or beg me gifts,<br />
And wed me if you will.<br />
I'd make a man a good wife,<br />
Sensible and still.<br />
</p><p>
And why should I be cold, my lad,<br />
And why should you repine,<br />
Because I love a dark head<br />
That never will be mine?<br />
</p><p>
I might as well be easing you<br />
As lie alone in bed<br />
And waste the night in wanting<br />
A cruel dark head.<br />
</p><p>
You might as well be calling yours<br />
What never will be his,<br />
And one of us be happy.<br />
There's few enough as is.</p>

<h4>Humoresque</h4>

<p>"Heaven bless the babe!" they said.<br />
"What queer books she must have read!"<br />
(Love, by whom I was beguiled,<br />
Grant I may not bear a child.)<br />
</p><p>
"Little does she guess to-day<br />
What the world may be!" they say.<br />
(Snow, drift deep and cover<br />
Till the spring my murdered lover.)</p>

<h4>The Pond</h4>

<p>In this pond of placid water,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half a hundred years ago,<br />
So they say, a farmer's daughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jilted by her farmer beau,<br />
</p><p>
Waded out among the rushes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattering the blue dragon-flies;<br />
That dried stick the ripple washes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marks the spot, I should surmise.<br />
</p><p>
Think, so near the public highway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well frequented even then!<br />
Can you not conceive the sly way,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing wheels or seeing men<br />
</p><p>
Passing on the road above,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a gesture feigned and silly,<br />
Ere she drowned herself for love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would reach to pluck a lily?</p>

<h4>The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver</h4>

<p>"Son," said my mother,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was knee-high,<br />
"You've need of clothes to cover you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a rag have I.<br />
</p><p>
"There's nothing in the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a boy breeches,<br />
Nor shears to cut a cloth with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor thread to take stitches.<br />
</p><p>
"There's nothing in the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a loaf-end of rye,<br />
And a harp with a woman's head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody will buy,"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she began to cry.<br />
</p><p>
That was in the early fall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When came the late fall,<br />
"Son," she said, "the sight of you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes your mother's blood crawl,&mdash;<br />
</p><p>
"Little skinny shoulder-blades<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sticking through your clothes!<br />
And where you'll get a jacket from<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God above knows.<br />
</p><p>
"It's lucky for me, lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your daddy's in the ground,<br />
And can't see the way I let<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His son go around!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she made a queer sound.<br />
</p><p>
That was in the late fall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the winter came,<br />
I'd not a pair of breeches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor a shirt to my name.<br />
</p><p>
I couldn't go to school,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or out of doors to play.<br />
And all the other little boys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed our way.<br />
</p><p>
"Son," said my mother,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, climb into my lap,<br />
And I'll chafe your little bones<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you take a nap."<br />
</p><p>
And, oh, but we were silly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For half an hour or more,<br />
Me with my long legs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragging on the floor,<br />
</p><p>
A-rock-rock-rocking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a mother-goose rhyme!<br />
Oh, but we were happy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For half an hour's time!<br />
</p><p>
But there was I, a great boy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what would folks say<br />
To hear my mother singing me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sleep all day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a daft way?<br />
</p><p>
Men say the winter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was bad that year;<br />
Fuel was scarce,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And food was dear.<br />
</p><p>
A wind with a wolf's head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howled about our door,<br />
And we burned up the chairs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sat upon the floor.<br />
</p><p>
All that was left us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a chair we couldn't break,<br />
And the harp with a woman's head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody would take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For song or pity's sake.<br />
</p><p>
The night before Christmas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cried with the cold,<br />
I cried myself to sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a two-year-old.<br />
</p><p>
And in the deep night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt my mother rise,<br />
And stare down upon me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With love in her eyes.<br />
</p><p>
I saw my mother sitting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one good chair,<br />
A light falling on her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From I couldn't tell where,<br />
</p><p>
Looking nineteen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a day older,<br />
And the harp with a woman's head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaned against her shoulder.<br />
</p><p>
Her thin fingers, moving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thin, tall strings,<br />
Were weav-weav-weaving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful things.<br />
</p><p>
Many bright threads,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From where I couldn't see,<br />
Were running through the harp-strings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapidly,<br />
</p><p>
And gold threads whistling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through my mother's hand.<br />
I saw the web grow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pattern expand.<br />
</p><p>
She wove a child's jacket,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when it was done<br />
She laid it on the floor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wove another one.<br />
</p><p>
She wove a red cloak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So regal to see,<br />
"She's made it for a king's son,"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "and not for me."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I knew it was for me.<br />
</p><p>
She wove a pair of breeches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quicker than that!<br />
She wove a pair of boots<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a little cocked hat.<br />
</p><p>
She wove a pair of mittens,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wove a little blouse,<br />
She wove all night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the still, cold house.<br />
</p><p>
She sang as she worked,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the harp-strings spoke;<br />
Her voice never faltered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thread never broke.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I awoke,&mdash;<br />
</p><p>
There sat my mother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the harp against her shoulder,<br />
Looking nineteen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a day older,<br />
</p><p>
A smile about her lips,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a light about her head,<br />
And her hands in the harp-strings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frozen dead.<br />
</p><p>
And piled up beside her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And toppling to the skies,<br />
Were the clothes of a king's son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just my size.</p>

<h3>Part Three</h3>

<h4>Never May the Fruit Be Plucked</h4>

<p>Never, never may the fruit be plucked from the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bough<br />
And gathered into barrels.<br />
He that would eat of love must eat it where it hangs.<br />
Though the branches bend like reeds,<br />
Though the ripe fruit splash in the grass or wrinkle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the tree,<br />
He that would eat of love may bear away with him<br />
Only what his belly can hold,<br />
Nothing in the apron,<br />
Nothing in the pockets.<br />
Never, never may the fruit be gathered from the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bough<br />
And harvested in barrels.<br />
The winter of love is a cellar of empty bins,<br />
In an orchard soft with rot.</p>

<h4>The Concert</h4>

<p>No, I will go alone.<br />
I will come back when it's over.<br />
Yes, of course I love you.<br />
No, it will not be long.<br />
Why may you not come with me?&mdash;<br />
You are too much my lover.<br />
You would put yourself<br />
Between me and song.<br />
</p><p>
If I go alone,<br />
Quiet and suavely clothed,<br />
My body will die in its chair,<br />
And over my head a flame,<br />
A mind that is twice my own,<br />
Will mark with icy mirth<br />
The wise advance and retreat<br />
Of armies without a country,<br />
Storming a nameless gate,<br />
Hurling terrible javelins down<br />
From the shouting walls of a singing town<br />
Where no women wait!<br />
</p><p>
Armies clean of love and hate,<br />
Marching lines of pitiless sound<br />
Climbing hills to the sun and hurling<br />
Golden spears to the ground!<br />
</p><p>
Up the lines a silver runner<br />
Bearing a banner whereon is scored<br />
The milk and steel of a bloodless wound<br />
Healed at length by the sword!<br />
</p><p>
You and I have nothing to do with music.<br />
We may not make of music a filigree frame,<br />
Within which you and I,<br />
Tenderly glad we came,<br />
Sit smiling, hand in hand.<br />
</p><p>
Come now, be content.<br />
I will come back to you, I swear I will;<br />
And you will know me still.<br />
I shall be only a little taller<br />
Than when I went.</p>

<h4>Hyacinth</h4>

<p>I am in love with him to whom a hyacinth is dearer<br />
Than I shall ever be dear.<br />
On nights when the field-mice are abroad he cannot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep:<br />
He hears their narrow teeth at the bulbs of his<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hyacinths.<br />
But the gnawing at my heart he does not hear.</p>

<h4>To One Who Might Have Borne a Message</h4>

<p>Had I known that you were going<br />
I would have given you messages for her,<br />
Now two years dead,<br />
Whom I shall always love.<br />
</p><p>
As it is, should she entreat you how it goes with me,<br />
You must reply, as well as with most, you fancy;<br />
That I love easily, and pass the time.<br />
And she will not know how all day long between<br />
My life and me her shadow intervenes,<br />
A young thin girl,<br />
Wearing a white skirt and a purple sweater<br />
And a narrow pale blue ribbon about her hair.<br />
</p><p>
I used to say to her, "I love you<br />
Because your face is such a pretty color,<br />
No other reason."<br />
But it was not true.<br />
</p><p>
Oh, had I only known that you were going,<br />
I could have given you messages for her!</p>

<h4>Siege</h4>

<p>This I do, being mad:<br />
Gather baubles about me,<br />
Sit in a circle of toys, and all the time<br />
Death beating the door in.<br />
</p><p>
<em>White jade and an orange pitcher,</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Hindu idol, Chinese god,&mdash;</em><br />
<em>Maybe next year, when I'm richer&mdash;</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Carved beads and a lotus pod....</em><br />
</p><p>
And all this time<br />
Death beating the door in.</p>

<h4>The Cairn</h4>

<p>When I think of the little children learning<br />
In all the schools of the world,<br />
Learning in Danish, learning in Japanese<br />
That two and two are four, and where the rivers of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world<br />
Rise, and the names of the mountains and the principal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cities,<br />
My heart breaks.<br />
Come up, children! Toss your little stones gaily<br />
On the great cairn of Knowledge!<br />
(Where lies what Euclid knew, a little gray stone,<br />
What Plato, what Pascal, what Galileo:<br />
Little gray stones, little gray stones on a cairn.)<br />
Tell me, what is the name of the highest mountain?<br />
Name me a crater of fire! a peak of snow!<br />
Name me the mountains on the moon!<br />
But the name of the mountain that you climb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all day,<br />
Ask not your teacher that.</p>

<h4>Spring Song</h4>

<p>I know why the yellow forsythia<br />
Holds its breath and will not bloom,<br />
And the robin thrusts his beak in his wing.<br />
</p><p>
Want me to tell you? Think you can bear it?<br />
Cover your eyes with your hand and hear it.<br />
You know how cold the days are still?<br />
And everybody saying how late the Spring is?<br />
Well&mdash;cover your eyes with your hand&mdash;the thing is,<br />
There isn't going to be any Spring.<br />
</p><p>
<em>No parking here! No parking here!<br />
They said to Spring: No parking here!</em><br />
</p><p>
Spring came on as she always does,<br />
Laid her hand on the yellow forsythia,&mdash;<br />
Little boys turned in their sleep and smiled,<br />
Dreaming of marbles, dreaming of agates;<br />
Little girls leapt from their beds to see<br />
Spring come by with her painted wagons,<br />
Colored wagons creaking with wonder&mdash;<br />
</p><p>
Laid her hand on the robin's throat;<br />
When up comes you-know-who, my dear,<br />
You-know-who in a fine blue coat,<br />
And says to Spring: No parking here!<br />
</p><p>
<em>No parking here! No parking here!<br />
Move on! Move on! No parking here!</em><br />
</p><p>
Come walk with me in the city gardens.<br />
(Better keep an eye out for you-know-who)<br />
Did ever you see such a sickly showing?&mdash;<br />
Middle of June, and nothing growing;<br />
The gardeners peer and scratch their heads<br />
And drop their sweat on the tulip-beds,<br />
But not a blade thrusts through.<br />
</p><p>
<em>Come, move on! Don't you know how to walk?<br />
No parking here! And no back-talk!</em><br />
</p><p>
Oh, well&mdash;hell, it's all for the best.<br />
She certainly made a lot of clutter,<br />
Dropping petals under the trees,<br />
Taking your mind off your bread and butter.<br />
</p><p>
Anyhow, it's nothing to me.<br />
I can remember, and so can you.<br />
(Though we'd better watch out for you-know-who,<br />
When we sit around remembering Spring).<br />
</p><p>
We shall hardly notice in a year or two.<br />
You can get accustomed to anything.</p>

<h4>Memory of Cape Cod</h4>

<p>The wind in the ash-tree sounds like surf on the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shore at Truro.<br />
I will shut my eyes . . . hush, be still with your<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silly bleating, sheep on Shillingstone Hill . . .<br />
</p><p>
<em>They said: Come along! They said: Leave your</em><br />
<em>pebbles on the sand and come along, it's long after</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>sunset!</em><br />
<em>The mosquitoes will be thick in the pine-woods along</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>by Long Nook, the wind's died down!</em><br />
<em>They said: Leave your pebbles on the sand, and your</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>shells, too, and come along, we'll find you another</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>beach like the beach at Truro.</em><br />
</p><p>
Let me listen to wind in the ash ... it sounds like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surf on the shore.</p>

<h3>Part Four</h3>

<h4>Sonnets</h4>

<h5>IV-I When You, That at This Moment</h5>

<p>When you, that at this moment are to me<br />
Dearer than words on paper, shall depart,<br />
And be no more the warder of my heart,<br />
Whereof again myself shall hold the key;<br />
And be no more&mdash;what now you seem to be&mdash;<br />
The sun, from which all excellences start<br />
In a round nimbus, nor a broken dart<br />
Of moonlight, even, splintered on the sea;<br />
I shall remember only of this hour&mdash;<br />
And weep somewhat, as now you see me weep&mdash;<br />
The pathos of your love, that, like a flower,<br />
Fearful of death yet amorous of sleep,<br />
Droops for a moment and beholds, dismayed,<br />
The wind whereon its petals shall be laid.</p>

<h5>IV-II That Love at Length Should Find</h5>

<p>That Love at length should find me out and bring<br />
This fierce and trivial brow unto the dust,<br />
Is, after all, I must confess, but just;<br />
There is a subtle beauty in this thing,<br />
A wry perfection; wherefore now let sing<br />
All voices how into my throat is thrust,<br />
Unwelcome as Death's own, Love's bitter crust,<br />
All criers proclaim it, and all steeples ring.<br />
This being done, there let the matter rest.<br />
What more remains is neither here nor there.<br />
That you requite me not is plain to see;<br />
Myself your slave herein have I confessed:<br />
Thus far, indeed, the world may mock at me;<br />
But if I suffer, it is my own affair.</p>

<h5>IV-III Love is not Blind</h5>

<p>Love is not blind. I see with single eye<br />
Your ugliness and other women's grace.<br />
I know the imperfection of your face,&mdash;<br />
The eyes too wide apart, the brow too high<br />
For beauty. Learned from earliest youth am I<br />
In loveliness, and cannot so erase<br />
Its letters from my mind, that I may trace<br />
You faultless, I must love until I die.<br />
More subtle is the sovereignty of love:<br />
So am I caught that when I say, "Not fair,"<br />
'Tis but as if I said, "Not here&mdash;not there&mdash;<br />
Not risen&mdash;not writing letters." Well I know<br />
What is this beauty men are babbling of;<br />
I wonder only why they prize it so.</p>

<h5>IV-IV I Know I Am but Summer</h5>

<p>I know I am but summer to your heart,<br />
And not the full four seasons of the year;<br />
And you must welcome from another part<br />
Such noble moods as are not mine, my dear.<br />
No gracious weight of golden fruits to sell<br />
Have I, nor any wise and wintry thing;<br />
And I have loved you all too long and well<br />
To carry still the high sweet breast of Spring.<br />
Wherefore I say: O love, as summer goes,<br />
I must be gone, steal forth with silent drums,<br />
That you may hail anew the bird and rose<br />
When I come back to you, as summer comes.<br />
Else will you seek, at some not distant time,<br />
Even your summer in another clime.</p>

<h5>IV-V I Pray You If You Love Me</h5>

<p>I pray you if you love me, bear my joy<br />
A little while, or let me weep your tears;<br />
I, too, have seen the quavering Fate destroy<br />
Your destiny's bright spinning&mdash;the dull shears<br />
Meeting not neatly, chewing at the thread,&mdash;<br />
Nor can you well be less aware how fine,<br />
How staunch as wire, and how unwarranted<br />
Endures the golden fortune that is mine.<br />
I pray you for this day at least, my dear,<br />
Fare by my side, that journey in the sun;<br />
Else must I turn me from the blossoming year<br />
And walk in grief the way that you have gone.<br />
Let us go forth together to the spring:</p>

<h5>IV-VI Pity Me Not</h5>

<p>Pity me not because the light of day<br />
At close of day no longer walks the sky;<br />
Pity me not for beauties passed away<br />
From field and thicket as the year goes by;<br />
Pity me not the waning of the moon,<br />
Nor that the ebbing tide goes out to sea,<br />
Nor that a man's desire is hushed so soon,<br />
And you no longer look with love on me.<br />
This have I known always: Love is no more<br />
Than the wide blossom which the wind assails,<br />
Than the great tide that treads the shifting shore.<br />
Strewing fresh wreckage gathered in the gales;<br />
Pity me that the heart is slow to learn</p>

<h5>IV-VII Sometimes When I Am Wearied</h5>

<p>Sometimes when I am wearied suddenly<br />
Of all the things that are the outward you,<br />
And my gaze wanders ere your tale is through<br />
To webs of my own weaving, or I see<br />
Abstractedly your hands about your knee<br />
And wonder why I love you as I do,<br />
Then I recall, "Yet <em>Sorrow</em> thus he drew";<br />
Then I consider, "<em>Pride</em> thus painted he."<br />
Oh, friend, forget not, when you fain would note<br />
In me a beauty that was never mine,<br />
How first you knew me in a book I wrote,<br />
How first you loved me for a written line:<br />
So are we bound till broken is the throat<br />
Of Song, and Art no more leads out the Nine.</p>

<h5>IV-VIII Oh, Oh, You Will Be Sorry</h5>

<p>Oh, oh, you will be sorry for that word!<br />
Give back my book and take my kiss instead.<br />
Was it my enemy or my friend I heard,<br />
"What a big book for such a little head!"<br />
Come, I will show you now my newest hat,<br />
And you may watch me purse my mouth and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prink!<br />
Oh, I shall love you still, and all of that.<br />
I never again shall tell you what I think.<br />
I shall be sweet and crafty, soft and sly;<br />
You will not catch me reading any more:<br />
I shall be called a wife to pattern by;<br />
And some day when you knock and push the door,<br />
Some sane day, not too bright and not too stormy,<br />
I shall be gone, and you may whistle for me.</p>

<h5>IV-IX Here Is A Wound</h5>

<p>Here is a wound that never will heal, I know,<br />
Being wrought not of a dearness and a death,<br />
But of a love turned ashes and the breath<br />
Gone out of beauty; never again will grow<br />
The grass on that scarred acre, though I sow<br />
Young seed there yearly and the sky bequeath<br />
Its friendly weathers down, far underneath<br />
Shall be such bitterness of an old woe.<br />
That April should be shattered by a gust,<br />
That August should be levelled by a rain,<br />
I can endure, and that the lifted dust<br />
Of man should settle to the earth again;<br />
But that a dream can die, will be a thrust<br />
Between my ribs forever of hot pain.</p>

<h5>IV-X I Shall Go Back Again</h5>

<p>I shall go back again to the bleak shore<br />
And build a little shanty on the sand,<br />
In such a way that the extremest band<br />
Of brittle seaweed will escape my door<br />
But by a yard or two; and nevermore<br />
Shall I return to take you by the hand;<br />
I shall be gone to what I understand,<br />
And happier than I ever was before.<br />
The love that stood a moment in your eyes,<br />
The words that lay a moment on your tongue,<br />
Are one with all that in a moment dies,<br />
A little under-said and over-sung.<br />
But I shall find the sullen rocks and skies<br />
Unchanged from what they were when I was<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young.</p>

<h5>IV-XI Say What You Will</h5>

<p>Say what you will, and scratch my heart to find<br />
The roots of last year's roses in my breast;<br />
I am as surely riper in my mind<br />
As if the fruit stood in the stalls confessed.<br />
Laugh at the unshed leaf, say what you will,<br />
Call me in all things what I was before,<br />
A flutterer in the wind, a woman still;<br />
I tell you I am what I was and more.<br />
My branches weigh me down, frost cleans the air,<br />
My sky is black with small birds bearing south;<br />
Say what you will, confuse me with fine care,<br />
Put by my word as but an April truth&mdash;<br />
Autumn is no less on me that a rose<br />
Hugs the brown bough and sighs before it goes.</p>

<h5>IV-XII What's This of Death</h5>

<p>What's this of death, from you who never will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;die?<br />
Think you the wrist that fashioned you in clay,<br />
The thumb that set the hollow just that way<br />
In your full throat and lidded the long eye<br />
So roundly from the forehead, will let lie<br />
Broken, forgotten, under foot some day<br />
Your unimpeachable body, and so slay<br />
The work he most had been remembered by?<br />
I tell you this: whatever of dust to dust<br />
Goes down, whatever of ashes may return<br />
To its essential self in its own season,<br />
Loveliness such as yours will not be lost,<br />
But, cast in bronze upon his very urn,<br />
Make known him Master, and for what good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reason.</p>

<h5>IV-XIII I See So Clearly</h5>

<p>I see so clearly now my similar years<br />
Repeat each other, shod in rusty black,<br />
Like one hack following another hack<br />
In meaningless procession, dry of tears,<br />
Driven empty, lest the noses sharp as shears<br />
Of gutter-urchins at a hearse's back<br />
Should sniff a man died friendless, and attack<br />
With silly scorn his deaf triumphant ears;<br />
I see so clearly how my life must run<br />
One year behind another year until<br />
At length these bones that leap into the sun<br />
Are lowered into the gravel, and lie still,<br />
I would at times the funeral were done<br />
And I abandoned on the ultimate hill.</p>

<h5>IV-XIV Your Face Is Like a Chamber</h5>

<p>Your face is like a chamber where a king<br />
Dies of his wounds, untended and alone,<br />
Stifling with courteous gesture the crude moan<br />
That speaks too loud of mortal perishing,<br />
Rising on elbow in the dark to sing<br />
Some rhyme now out of season but well known<br />
In days when banners in his face were blown<br />
And every woman had a rose to fling.<br />
I know that through your eyes which look on me<br />
Who stand regarding you with pitiful breath,<br />
You see beyond the moment's pause, you see<br />
The sunny sky, the skimming bird beneath,<br />
And, fronting on your windows hopelessly,<br />
Black in the noon, the broad estates of Death.</p>

<h5>IV-XV The Light Comes Back</h5>

<p>The light comes back with Columbine; she brings<br />
A touch of this, a little touch of that,<br />
Coloured confetti, and a favour hat,<br />
Patches, and powder, dolls that work by strings<br />
And moons that work by switches, all the things<br />
That please a sick man's fancy, and a flat<br />
Spry convalescent kiss, and a small pat<br />
Upon the pillow,&mdash;paper offerings.<br />
The light goes out with her; the shadows sprawl.<br />
Where she has left her fragrance like a shawl<br />
I lie alone and pluck the counterpane,<br />
Or on a dizzy elbow rise and hark&mdash;<br />
And down like dominoes along the dark<br />
Her little silly laughter spills again!</p>

<h5>IV-XVI Lord Archer, Death</h5>

<p>Lord Archer, Death, whom sent you in your<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stead?<br />
What faltering prentice fumbled at your bow,<br />
That now should wander with the insanguine dead<br />
In whom forever the bright blood must flow?<br />
Or is it rather that impairing Time<br />
Renders yourself so random, or so dim?<br />
Or are you sick of shadows and would climb<br />
A while to light, a while detaining him?<br />
For know, this was no mortal youth, to be<br />
Of you confounded, but a heavenly guest,<br />
Assuming earthly garb for love of me,<br />
And hell's demure attire for love of jest:<br />
Bringing me asphodel and a dark feather,<br />
He will return, and we shall laugh together!</p>

<h5>IV-XVII Loving You Less than Life</h5>

<p>Loving you less than life, a little less<br />
Than bitter-sweet upon a broken wall<br />
Or brush-wood smoke in autumn, I confess<br />
I cannot swear I love you not at all.<br />
For there is that about you in this light&mdash;<br />
A yellow darkness, sinister of rain&mdash;<br />
Which sturdily recalls my stubborn sight<br />
To dwell on you, and dwell on you again.<br />
And I am made aware of many a week<br />
I shall consume, remembering in what way<br />
Your brown hair grows about your brow and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheek,<br />
And what divine absurdities you say:<br />
Till all the world, and I, and surely you,<br />
Will know I love you, whether or not I do.</p>

<h5>IV-XVIII I, Being Born a Woman</h5>

<p>I, being born a woman and distressed<br />
By all the needs and notions of my kind,<br />
Am urged by your propinquity to find<br />
Your person fair, and feel a certain zest<br />
To bear your body's weight upon my breast:<br />
So subtly is the fume of life designed,<br />
To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,<br />
And leave me once again undone, possessed.<br />
Think not for this, however, the poor treason<br />
Of my stout blood against my staggering brain,<br />
I shall remember you with love, or season<br />
My scorn with pity,&mdash;let me make it plain:<br />
I find this frenzy insufficient reason<br />
For conversation when we meet again.</p>

<h5>IV-XIX What Lips My Lips Have Kissed</h5>

<p>What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why,<br />
I have forgotten, and what arms have lain<br />
Under my head till morning; but the rain<br />
Is full of ghosts to-night, that tap and sigh<br />
Upon the glass and listen for reply,<br />
And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain<br />
For unremembered lads that not again<br />
Will turn to me at midnight with a cry.<br />
Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree,<br />
Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one,<br />
Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:<br />
I cannot say what loves have come and gone,<br />
I only know that summer sang in me<br />
A little while, that in me sings no more.</p>

<h5>IV-XX Still Will I Harvest Beauty</h5>

<p>Still will I harvest beauty where it grows:<br />
In coloured fungus and the spotted fog<br />
Surprised on foods forgotten; in ditch and bog<br />
Filmed brilliant with irregular rainbows<br />
Of rust and oil, where half a city throws<br />
Its empty tins; and in some spongy log<br />
Whence headlong leaps the oozy emerald frog. . . .<br />
And a black pupil in the green scum shows.<br />
Her the inhabiter of divers places<br />
Surmising at all doors, I push them all.<br />
Oh, you that fearful of a creaking hinge<br />
Turn back forevermore with craven faces,<br />
I tell you Beauty bears an ultra fringe<br />
Unguessed of you upon her gossamer shawl!</p>

<h5>IV-XXI How Healthily Their Feet</h5>

<p>How healthily their feet upon the floor<br />
Strike down! These are no spirits, but a band<br />
Of children, surely, leaping hand in hand,<br />
Into the air in groups of three and four,<br />
Wearing their silken rags as if they wore<br />
Leaves only and light grasses, or a strand<br />
Of black elusive seaweed oozing sand,<br />
And running hard as if along a shore.<br />
I know how lost forever, and at length<br />
How still these lovely tossing limbs shall lie,<br />
And the bright laughter and the panting breath;<br />
And yet, before such beauty and such strength,<br />
Once more, as always when the dance is high,<br />
I am rebuked that I believe in death.</p>

<h5>IV-XXII Euclid Alone Has Looked</h5>

<p>Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.<br />
Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace,<br />
And lay them prone upon the earth and cease<br />
To ponder on themselves, the while they stare<br />
At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere<br />
In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese<br />
Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release<br />
From dusty bondage into luminous air.<br />
O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,<br />
When first the shaft into his vision shone<br />
Of light anatomized! Euclid alone<br />
Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they<br />
Who, though once only and then but far away,<br />
Have heard her massive sandal set on stone.</p>

<h3>Part Five</h3>

<h4>Sonnets from an Ungrafted Tree</h4>

<h5>V-I So She Came BacK</h5>

<p>So SHE came back into his house again<br />
And watched beside his bed until he died,<br />
Loving him not at all. The winter rain<br />
Splashed in the painted butter-tub outside,<br />
Where once her red geraniums had stood,<br />
Where still their rotted stalks were to be seen;<br />
The thin log snapped; and she went out for wood,<br />
Bareheaded, running the few steps between<br />
The house and shed; there, from the sodden eaves<br />
Blown back and forth on ragged ends of twine,<br />
Saw the dejected creeping-jinny vine,<br />
(And one, big-aproned, blithe, with stiff blue sleeves<br />
Rolled to the shoulder that warm day in spring,<br />
Who planted seeds, musing ahead to their far <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blossoming).</p>

<h5>V-II The Last White Sawdust</h5>

<p>The last white sawdust on the floor was grown<br />
Gray as the first, so long had he been ill;<br />
The axe was nodding in the block; fresh-blown<br />
And foreign came the rain across the sill,<br />
But on the roof so steadily it drummed<br />
She could not think a time it might not be&mdash;<br />
In hazy summer, when the hot air hummed<br />
With mowing, and locusts rising raspingly,<br />
When that small bird with iridescent wings<br />
And long incredible sudden silver tongue<br />
Had just flashed (and yet may be not!) among<br />
The dwarf nasturtiums&mdash;when no sagging springs<br />
Of shower were in the whole bright sky, somehow<br />
Upon this roof the rain would drum as it was drumming <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now.</p>

<h5>V-III She Filled Her Arms with Wood</h5>

<p>She filled her arms with wood, and set her chin<br />
Forward, to hold the highest stick in place,<br />
No less afraid than she had always been<br />
Of spiders up her arms and on her face,<br />
But too impatient for a careful search<br />
Or a less heavy loading, from the heap<br />
Selecting hastily small sticks of birch,<br />
For their curled bark, that instantly will leap<br />
Into a blaze, nor thinking to return<br />
Some day, distracted, as of old, to find<br />
Smooth, heavy, round, green logs with a wet, gray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rind<br />
Only, and knotty chunks that will not burn,<br />
(That day when dust is on the wood-box floor,<br />
And some old catalogue, and a brown, shriveled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apple core).</p>

<h5>V-IV The White Bark Writhed</h5>

<p>The white bark writhed and sputtered like a fish<br />
Upon the coals, exuding odorous smoke.<br />
She knelt and blew, in a surging desolate wish<br />
For comfort; and the sleeping ashes woke<br />
And scattered to the hearth, but no thin fire<br />
Broke suddenly, the wood was wet with rain.<br />
Then, softly stepping forth from her desire,<br />
(Being mindful of like passion hurled in vain<br />
Upon a similar task, in other days)<br />
She thrust her breath against the stubborn coal,<br />
Bringing to bear upon its hilt the whole<br />
Of her still body... there sprang a little blaze...<br />
A pack of hounds, the flame swept up the flue!&mdash;<br />
And the blue night stood flattened against the window,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staring through.</p>

<h5>V-V The Wagon Stopped before the House</h5>

<p>A wagon stopped before the house; she heard<br />
The heavy oilskins of the grocer's man<br />
Slapping against his legs. Of a sudden whirred<br />
Her heart like a frightened partridge, and she ran<br />
And slid the bolt, leaving his entrance free;<br />
Then in the cellar way till he was gone<br />
Hid, breathless, praying that he might not see<br />
The chair sway she had laid her hand upon<br />
In passing. Sour and damp from that dark vault<br />
Arose to her the well-remembered chill;<br />
She saw the narrow wooden stairway still<br />
Plunging into the earth, and the thin salt<br />
Crusting the crocks; until she knew him far,<br />
So stood, with listening eyes upon the empty doughnut<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jar.</p>

<h5>V-VI Then Cautiously She Pushed</h5>

<p>Then cautiously she pushed the cellar door<br />
And stepped into the kitchen&mdash;saw the track<br />
Of muddy rubber boots across the floor,<br />
The many paper parcels in a stack<br />
Upon the dresser; with accustomed care<br />
Removed the twine and put the wrappings by,<br />
Folded, and the bags flat, that with an air<br />
Of ease had been whipped open skillfully,<br />
To the gape of children. Treacherously dear<br />
And simple was the dull, familiar task.<br />
And so it was she came at length to ask:<br />
How came the soda there? The sugar here?<br />
Then the dream broke. Silent, she brought the mop,<br />
And forced the trade-slip on the nail that held his<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;razor strop.</p>

<h5>V-VII One Way There Was</h5>

<p>One way there was of muting in the mind<br />
A little while the ever-clamorous care;<br />
And there was rapture, of a decent kind,<br />
In making mean and ugly objects fair:<br />
Soft-sooted kettle-bottoms, that had been<br />
Time after time set in above the fire,<br />
Faucets, and candlesticks, corroded green,<br />
To mine again from quarry; to attire<br />
The shelves in paper petticoats, and tack<br />
New oilcloth in the ringed-and-rotten's place,<br />
Polish the stove till you could see your face,<br />
And after nightfall rear an aching back<br />
In a changed kitchen, bright as a new pin,<br />
An advertisement, far too fine to cook a supper in.</p>

<h5>V-VIII She Let Them Leave Their Jellies</h5>

<p>She let them leave their jellies at the door<br />
And go away, reluctant, down the walk.<br />
She heard them talking as they passed before<br />
The blind, but could not quite make out their talk<br />
For noise in the room&mdash;the sudden heavy fall<br />
And roll of a charred log, and the roused shower<br />
Of snapping sparks; then sharply from the wall<br />
The unforgivable crowing of the hour.<br />
One instant set ajar, her quiet ear<br />
Was stormed and forced by the full rout of day:<br />
The rasp of a saw, the fussy cluck and bray<br />
Of hens, the wheeze of a pump, she needs must hear;<br />
She inescapably must endure to feel<br />
Across her teeth the grinding of a backing wagon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wheel.</p>

<h5>V-IX Not Over-Kind nor Over-Quick</h5>

<p>Not over-kind nor over-quick in study<br />
Nor skilled in sports nor beautiful was he,<br />
Who had come into her life when anybody<br />
Would have been welcome, so in need was she.<br />
They had become acquainted in this way:<br />
He flashed a mirror in her eyes at school;<br />
By which he was distinguished; from that day<br />
They went about together, as a rule.<br />
She told, in secret and with whispering,<br />
How he had flashed a mirror in her eyes;<br />
And as she told, it struck her with surprise<br />
That this was not so wonderful a thing.<br />
But what's the odds?&mdash;It's pretty nice to know<br />
You've got a friend to keep you company everywhere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you go.</p>

<h5>V-X She Had Forgotten</h5>

<p>She had forgotten how the August night<br />
Was level as a lake beneath the moon,<br />
In which she swam a little, losing sight<br />
Of shore; and how the boy, that was at noon<br />
Simple enough, not different from the rest,<br />
Wore now a pleasant mystery as he went,<br />
Which seemed to her an honest enough test<br />
Whether she loved him, and she was content.<br />
So loud, so loud the million crickets' choir . . .<br />
So sweet the night, so long-drawn-out and late . . .<br />
And if the man were not her spirit's mate,<br />
Why was her body sluggish with desire?<br />
Stark on the open field the moonlight fell,<br />
But the oak tree's shadow was deep and black and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secret as a well.</p>

<h5>V-XI It Came into Her Mind</h5>

<p>It came into her mind, seeing how the snow<br />
Was gone, and the brown grass exposed again,<br />
And clothes-pins, and an apron&mdash;long ago,<br />
In some white storm that sifted through the pane<br />
And sent her forth reluctantly at last<br />
To gather in, before the line gave way,<br />
Garments, board-stiff, that galloped on the blast<br />
Clashing like angel armies in a fray,<br />
An apron long ago in such a night<br />
Blown down and buried in the deepening drift,<br />
To lie till April thawed it back to sight,<br />
Forgotten, quaint and novel as a gift&mdash;<br />
It struck her, as she pulled and pried and tore,<br />
That here was spring, and the whole year to be lived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through once more.</p>

<h5>V-XII Tenderly, in Those Times</h5>

<p>Tenderly, in those times, as though she fed<br />
An ailing child&mdash;with sturdy propping up<br />
Of its small, feverish body in the bed,<br />
And steadying of its hands about the cup&mdash;<br />
She gave her husband of her body's strength,<br />
Thinking of men, what helpless things they were,<br />
Until he turned and fell asleep at length,<br />
And stealthily stirred the night and spoke to her.<br />
Familiar, at such moments, like a friend,<br />
Whistled far off the long, mysterious train,<br />
And she could see in her mind's vision plain<br />
The magic World, where cities stood on end . . .<br />
Remote from where she lay&mdash;and yet&mdash;between,<br />
Save for something asleep beside her, only the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window screen.</p>

<h5>V-XIII From the Wan Dream</h5>

<p>From the wan dream that was her waking day,<br />
Wherein she journeyed, borne along the ground<br />
Without her own volition in some way,<br />
Or fleeing, motionless, with feet fast bound,<br />
Or running silent through a silent house<br />
Sharply remembered from an earlier dream,<br />
Upstairs, down other stairs, fearful to rouse,<br />
Regarding him, the wide and empty scream<br />
Of a strange sleeper on a malignant bed,<br />
And all the time not certain if it were<br />
Herself so doing or some one like to her,<br />
From this wan dream that was her daily bread,<br />
Sometimes, at night, incredulous, she would wake&mdash;<br />
A child, blowing bubbles that the chairs and carpet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did not break!</p>

<h5>V-XIV She Had A Horror</h5>

<p>She had a horror he would die at night.<br />
And sometimes when the light began to fade<br />
She could not keep from noticing how white<br />
The birches looked&mdash;and then she would be afraid,<br />
Even with a lamp, to go about the house<br />
And lock the windows; and as night wore on<br />
Toward morning, if a dog howled, or a mouse<br />
Squeaked in the floor, long after it was gone<br />
Her flesh would sit awry on her. By day<br />
She would forget somewhat, and it would seem<br />
A silly thing to go with just this dream<br />
And get a neighbor to come at night and stay.<br />
But it would strike her sometimes, making the tea:<br />
<em>She had kept that kettle boiling all night long, for</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>company.</em></p>

<h5>V-XV There Was Upon the Sill</h5>

<p>There was upon the sill a pencil mark,<br />
Vital with shadow when the sun stood still<br />
At noon, but now, because the day was dark,<br />
It was a pencil mark upon the sill.<br />
And the mute clock, maintaining ever the same<br />
Dead moment, blank and vacant of itself,<br />
Was a pink shepherdess, a picture frame,<br />
A shell marked Souvenir, there on the shelf.<br />
Whence it occurred to her that <em>he</em> might be,<br />
The mainspring being broken in his mind,<br />
A clock himself, if one were so inclined,<br />
That stood at twenty minutes after three&mdash;<br />
The reason being for this, it might be said,<br />
That things in death were neither clocks nor people,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only dead.</p>

<h5>V-XVI The Doctor Asked Her</h5>

<p>The doctor asked her what she wanted done<br />
With him, that could not lie there many days.<br />
And she was shocked to see how life goes on<br />
Even after death, in irritating ways;<br />
And mused how if he had not died at all<br />
'Twould have been easier&mdash;then there need not be<br />
The stiff disorder of a funeral<br />
Everywhere, and the hideous industry,<br />
And crowds of people calling her by name<br />
And questioning her, she'd never seen before,<br />
But only watching by his bed once more<br />
And sitting silent if a knocking came . . .<br />
She said at length, feeling the doctor's eyes,<br />
"I don't know what you do exactly when a person<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dies."</p>

<h5>V-XVII Gazing upon Him Now</h5>

<p>Gazing upon him now, severe and dead,<br />
It seemed a curious thing that she had lain<br />
Beside him many a night in that cold bed,<br />
And that had been which would not be again.<br />
From his desirous body the great heat<br />
Was gone at last, it seemed, and the taut nerves<br />
Loosened forever. Formally the sheet<br />
Set forth for her to-day those heavy curves<br />
And lengths familiar as the bedroom door.<br />
She was as one that enters, sly, and proud,<br />
To where her husband speaks before a crowd,<br />
And sees a man she never saw before&mdash;<br />
The man who eats his victuals at her side,<br />
Small, and absurd, and hers: for once, not hers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unclassified.</p>

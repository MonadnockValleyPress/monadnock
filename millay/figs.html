<h1>A Few Figs from Thistles</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay (1920)</h2>

<h3>First Fig</h3>
<p>
My candle burns at both ends;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not last the night;<br />
But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives a lovely light!
</p>

<h3>Second Fig</h3>
<p>
Safe upon the solid rock the ugly houses stand:<br />
Come and see my shining palace built upon the sand!
</p>

<h3>Recuerdo</h3>
<p>
We were very tired, we were very merry&#151;<br />
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.<br />
It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable&#151;<br />
But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,<br />
We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;<br />
And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon.
</p>
<p>
We were very tired, we were very merry&#151;<br />
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;<br />
And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,<br />
From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;<br />
And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,<br />
And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.
</p>
<p>
We were very tired, we were very merry,<br />
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.<br />
We hailed, "Good morrow, mother!" to a shawl-covered head,<br />
And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;<br />
And she wept, "God bless you!" for the apples and pears,<br />
And we gave her all our money but our subway fares.
</p>

<h3>Thursday</h3>
<p>
And if I loved you Wednesday,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what is that to you?<br />
I do not love you Thursday&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much is true.
</p>
<p>
And why you come complaining<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is more than I can see.<br />
I loved you Wednesday,&#151;yes&#151;but what<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that to me?
</p>

<h3>To the Not Impossible Him</h3>
<p>
How shall I know, unless I go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Cairo and Cathay,<br />
Whether or not this blessed spot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is blest in every way?
</p>
<p>
Now it may be, the flower for me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this beneath my nose;<br />
How shall I tell, unless I smell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Carthaginian rose?
</p>
<p>
The fabric of my faithful love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No power shall dim or ravel<br />
Whilst I stay here,&#151;but oh, my dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I should ever travel!
</p>

<h3>Macdougal Street</h3>
<p>
As I went walking up and down to take the evening air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Sweet to meet upon the street, why must I be so shy?)<br />
I saw him lay his hand upon her torn black hair;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;("Little dirty Latin child, let the lady by!")
</p>
<p>
The women squatting on the stoops were slovenly and fat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Lay me out in organdie, lay me out in lawn!)<br />
And everywhere I stepped there was a baby or a cat;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Lord God in Heaven, will it never be dawn?)
</p>
<p>
The fruit-carts and clam-carts were ribald as a fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Pink nets and wet shells trodden under heel)<br />
She had haggled from the fruit-man of his rotting ware;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I shall never get to sleep, the way I feel!)
</p>
<p>
He walked like a king through the filth and the clutter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Sweet to meet upon the street, why did you glance me by?)<br />
But he caught the quaint Italian quip she flung him from the gutter;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(What can there be to cry about that I should lie and cry?)
</p>
<p>
He laid his darling hand upon her little black head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I wish I were a ragged child with ear-rings in my ears!)<br />
And he said she was a baggage to have said what she had said;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Truly I shall be ill unless I stop these tears!)
</p>

<h3>The Singing-Woman from the Wood's Edge</h3>
<p>
What should I be but a prophet and a liar,<br />
Whose mother was a leprechaun, whose father was a friar?<br />
Teethed on a crucifix and cradled under water,<br />
What should I be but the fiend's god-daughter?
</p>
<p>
And who should be my playmates but the adder and the frog,<br />
That was got beneath a furze-bush and born in a bog?<br />
And what should be my singing, that was christened at an altar,<br />
But Aves and Credos and Psalms out of the Psalter?
</p>
<p>
You will see such webs on the wet grass, maybe,<br />
As a pixie-mother weaves for her baby,<br />
You will find such flame at the wave's weedy ebb<br />
As flashes in the meshes of a mer-mother's web,
</p>
<p>
But there comes to birth no common spawn<br />
From the love of a priest for a leprechaun,<br />
And you never have seen and you never will see<br />
Such things as the things that swaddled me!
</p>
<p>
After all's said and after all's done,<br />
What should I be but a harlot and a nun?
</p>
<p>
In through the bushes, on any foggy day,<br />
My Da would come a-swishing of the drops away,<br />
With a prayer for my death and a groan for my birth,<br />
A-mumbling of his beads for all that he was worth.
</p>
<p>
And there'd sit my Ma, with her knees beneath her chin,<br />
A-looking in his face and a-drinking of it in,<br />
And a-marking in the moss some funny little saying<br />
That would mean just the opposite of all that he was praying!
</p>
<p>
He taught me the holy-talk of Vesper and of Matin,<br />
He heard me my Greek and he heard me my Latin,<br />
He blessed me and crossed me to keep my soul from evil,<br />
And we watched him out of sight, and we conjured up the devil!
</p>
<p>
Oh, the things I haven't seen and the things I haven't known.<br />
What with hedges and ditches till after I was grown,<br />
And yanked both ways by my mother and my father,<br />
With a "Which would you better?" and a "Which would you rather?"
</p>
<p>
With him for a sire and her for a dam,<br />
What should I be but just what I am?
</p>

<h3>She Is Overheard Singing</h3>
<p>
Oh, Prue she has a patient man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Joan a gentle lover,<br />
And Agatha's Arth' is a hug-the-hearth,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my true love's a rover!
</p>
<p>
Mig, her man's as good as cheese<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And honest as a briar,<br />
Sue tells her love what he's thinking of,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my dear lad's a liar!
</p>
<p>
Oh, Sue and Prue and Agatha<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are thick with Mig and Joan!<br />
They bite their threads and shake their heads<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gnaw my name like a bone;
</p>
<p>
And Prue says, "Mine's a patient man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As never snaps me up,"<br />
And Agatha, "Arth' is a hug-the-hearth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could live content in a cup;"
</p>
<p>
Sue's man's mind is like good jell&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All one colour, and clear &#151;<br />
And Mig's no call to think at all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's to come next year,
</p>
<p>
While Joan makes boast of a gentle lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's troubled with that and this;&#151;<br />
But they all would give the life they live<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a look from the man I kiss!
</p>
<p>
Cold he slants his eyes about,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And few enough's his choice,&#151;<br />
Though he'd slip me clean for a nun, or a queen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a beggar with knots in her voice,&#151;
</p>
<p>
And Agatha will turn awake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While her good man sleeps sound,<br />
And Mig and Sue and Joan and Prue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will hear the clock strike round,
</p>
<p>
For Prue she has a patient man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As asks not when or why,<br />
And Mig and Sue have naught to do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But peep who's passing by,
</p>
<p>
Joan is paired with a putterer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bastes and tastes and salts,<br />
And Agatha's Arth' is a hug-the-hearth,&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my true love is false!
</p>

<h3>The Prisoner</h3>
<p>
All right,<br />
Go ahead!<br />
What's in a name?<br />
I guess I'll be locked into<br />
As much as I'm locked out of!
</p>

<h3>The Unexplorer</h3>
<p>
There was a road ran past our house<br />
Too lovely to explore.<br />
I asked my mother once&#151;she said<br />
That if you followed where it led<br />
It brought you to the milk-man's door.<br />
(That's why I have not traveled more.)
</p>

<h3>Grown-up</h3>
<p>
Was it for this I uttered prayers,<br />
And sobbed and cursed and kicked the stairs,<br />
That now, domestic as a plate,<br />
I should retire at half-past eight?
</p>

<h3>The Penitent</h3>
<p>
I had a little Sorrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born of a little Sin,<br />
I found a room all damp with gloom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shut us all within;<br />
And, "Little Sorrow, weep," said I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, Little Sin, pray God to die,<br />
And I upon the floor will lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think how bad I've been!"
</p>
<p>
Alas for pious planning&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It mattered not a whit!<br />
As far as gloom went in that room,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp might have been lit!<br />
My little Sorrow would not weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My little Sin would go to sleep&#151;<br />
To save my soul I could not keep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My graceless mind on it!
</p>
<p>
So up I got in anger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took a book I had,<br />
And put a ribbon on my hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To please a passing lad,<br />
And, "One thing there's no getting by&#151;<br />
I've been a wicked girl," said I;<br />
"But if I can't be sorry, why,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might as well be glad!"
</p>

<h3>Daphne</h3>
<p>
Why do you follow me?&#151;<br />
Any moment I can be<br />
Nothing but a laurel-tree.
</p>
<p>
Any moment of the chase<br />
I can leave you in my place<br />
A pink bough for your embrace.
</p>
<p>
Yet if over hill and hollow<br />
Still it is your will to follow,<br />
I am off;&#151;to heel, Apollo!
</p>

<h3>Portrait by a Neighbor</h3>
<p>
Before she has her floor swept<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or her dishes done,<br />
Any day you'll find her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-sunning in the sun!
</p>
<p>
It's long after midnight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her key's in the lock,<br />
And you never see her chimney smoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till past ten o'clock!
</p>
<p>
She digs in her garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a shovel and a spoon,<br />
She weeds her lazy lettuce<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the light of the moon,
</p>
<p>
She walks up the walk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a woman in a dream,<br />
She forgets she borrowed butter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pays you back cream!
</p>
<p>
Her lawn looks like a meadow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if she mows the place<br />
She leaves the clover standing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Queen Anne's lace!
</p>

<h3>Midnight Oil</h3>
<p>
Cut if you will, with Sleep's dull knife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each day to half its length, my friend,&#151;<br />
The years that Time takes off _my_ life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll take from off the other end!
</p>

<h3>The Merry Maid</h3>
<p>
Oh, I am grown so free from care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my heart broke!<br />
I set my throat against the air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laugh at simple folk!
</p>
<p>
There's little kind and little fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is worth its weight in smoke<br />
To me, that's grown so free from care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my heart broke!
</p>
<p>
Lass, if to sleep you would repair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As peaceful as you woke,<br />
Best not besiege your lover there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For just the words he spoke<br />
To me, that's grown so free from care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my heart broke!
</p>

<h3>To Kathleen</h3>
<p>
Still must the poet as of old,<br />
In barren attic bleak and cold,<br />
Starve, freeze, and fashion verses to<br />
Such things as flowers and song and you;
</p>
<p>
Still as of old his being give<br />
In Beauty's name, while she may live,<br />
Beauty that may not die as long<br />
As there are flowers and you and song.
</p>

<h3>To S. M., If he should lie a-dying</h3>
<p>
I am not willing you should go<br />
Into the earth, where Helen went;<br />
She is awake by now, I know.<br />
Where Cleopatra's anklets rust<br />
You will not lie with my consent;<br />
And Sappho is a roving dust;<br />
Cressid could love again; Dido,<br />
Rotted in state, is restless still:<br />
You leave me much against my will.
</p>

<h3>The Philosopher</h3>
<p>
And what are you that, wanting you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be kept awake<br />
As many nights as there are days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With weeping for your sake?
</p>
<p>
And what are you that, missing you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many days as crawl<br />
I should be listening to the wind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking at the wall?
</p>
<p>
I know a man that's a braver man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And twenty men as kind,<br />
And what are you, that you should be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one man in my mind?
</p>
<p>
Yet women's ways are witless ways,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any sage will tell,&#151;<br />
And what am I, that I should love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wisely and so well?
</p>

<h3>Four Sonnets</h3>

<h4>I</h4>
<p>
Love, though for this you riddle me with darts,<br />
And drag me at your chariot till I die,&#151;<br />
Oh, heavy prince! Oh, panderer of hearts!&#151;<br />
Yet hear me tell how in their throats they lie<br />
Who shout you mighty: thick about my hair<br />
Day in, day out, your ominous arrows purr<br />
Who still am free, unto no querulous care<br />
A fool, and in no temple worshiper!<br />
I, that have bared me to your quiver's fire,<br />
Lifted my face into its puny rain,<br />
Do wreathe you Impotent to Evoke Desire<br />
As you are Powerless to Elicit Pain!<br />
(Now will the god, for blasphemy so brave,<br />
Punish me, surely, with the shaft I crave!)
</p>

<h4>II</h4>
<p>
I think I should have loved you presently,<br />
And given in earnest words I flung in jest;<br />
And lifted honest eyes for you to see,<br />
And caught your hand against my cheek and breast;<br />
And all my pretty follies flung aside<br />
That won you to me, and beneath your gaze,<br />
Naked of reticence and shorn of pride,<br />
Spread like a chart my little wicked ways.<br />
I, that had been to you, had you remained,<br />
But one more waking from a recurrent dream,<br />
Cherish no less the certain stakes I gained,<br />
And walk your memory's halls, austere, supreme,<br />
A ghost in marble of a girl you knew<br />
Who would have loved you in a day or two.
</p>

<h4>III</h4>
<p>
Oh, think not I am faithful to a vow!<br />
Faithless am I save to love's self alone.<br />
Were you not lovely I would leave you now;<br />
After the feet of beauty fly my own.<br />
Were you not still my hunger's rarest food,<br />
And water ever to my wildest thirst,<br />
I would desert you&#151;think not but I would!&#151;<br />
And seek another as I sought you first.<br />
But you are mobile as the veering air,<br />
And all your charms more changeful than the tide,<br />
Wherefore to be inconstant is no care:<br />
I have but to continue at your side.<br />
So wanton, light and false, my love, are you,<br />
I am most faithless when I most am true.
</p>

<h4>IV</h4>
<p>
I shall forget you presently, my dear,<br />
So make the most of this, your little day,<br />
Your little month, your little half a year,<br />
Ere I forget, or die, or move away,<br />
And we are done forever; by and by<br />
I shall forget you, as I said, but now,<br />
If you entreat me with your loveliest lie<br />
I will protest you with my favorite vow.<br />
I would indeed that love were longer-lived,<br />
And oaths were not so brittle as they are,<br />
But so it is, and nature has contrived<br />
To struggle on without a break thus far,&#151;<br />
Whether or not we find what we are seeking<br />
Is idle, biologically speaking.

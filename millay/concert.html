<h1>The Concert</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
No, I will go alone.<br/>
I will come back when it's over.<br/>
Yes, of course I love you.<br/>
No, it will not be long.<br/>
Why may you not come with me?&mdash;<br/>
You are too much my lover.<br/>
You would put yourself<br/>
Between me and song.<br/>
</p>
<p>
If I go alone,<br/>
Quiet and suavely clothed,<br/>
My body will die in its chair,<br/>
And over my head a flame,<br/>
A mind that is twice my own,<br/>
Will mark with icy mirth<br/>
The wise advance and retreat<br/>
Of armies without a country,<br/>
Storming a nameless gate,<br/>
Hurling terrible javelins down<br/>
From the shouting walls of a singing town<br/>
Where no women wait!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Armies clean of love and hate,<br/>
Marching lines of pitiless sound<br/>
Climbing hills to the sun and hurling<br/>
Golden spears to the ground!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Up the lines a silver runner<br/>
Bearing a banner whereon is scored<br/>
The milk and steel of a bloodless wound<br/>
Healed at length by the sword!<br/>
</p>
<p>
You and I have nothing to do with music.<br/>
We may not make of music a filigree frame,<br/>
Within which you and I,<br/>
Tenderly glad we came,<br/>
Sit smiling, hand in hand.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Come now, be content.<br/>
I will come back to you, I swear I will;<br/>
And you will know me still.<br/>
I shall be only a little taller<br/>
Than when I went.

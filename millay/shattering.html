<h1>Three Songs of Shattering</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
The first rose on my rose-tree<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budded, bloomed, and shattered,<br/>
During sad days when to me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing mattered.
</p>
<p>
Grief of grief has drained me clean;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still it seems a pity<br/>
No one saw, &#151; it must have been<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very pretty.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
Let the little birds sing;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the little lambs play;<br/>
Spring is here; and so 'tis spring; &#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not in the old way!
</p>
<p>
I recall a place<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a plum-tree grew;<br/>
There you lifted up your face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blossoms covered you.
</p>
<p>
If the little birds sing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the little lambs play,<br/>
Spring is here; and so 'tis spring &#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not in the old way!
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere spring was going &#151; ah, spring is gone!<br/>
And there comes no summer to the like of you and me, &#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossom time is early, but no fruit sets on.
</p>
<p>
All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browned at the edges, turned in a day;<br/>
And I would with all my heart they trimmed a mound for me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weeds were tall on all the paths that led that way!

<h1>Sometimes When I Am Wearied</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Sometimes when I am wearied suddenly<br/>
Of all the things that are the outward you,<br/>
And my gaze wanders ere your tale is through<br/>
To webs of my own weaving, or I see<br/>
Abstractedly your hands about your knee<br/>
And wonder why I love you as I do,<br/>
Then I recall, "Yet <em>Sorrow</em> thus he drew";<br/>
Then I consider, "<em>Pride</em> thus painted he."<br/>
Oh, friend, forget not, when you fain would note<br/>
In me a beauty that was never mine,<br/>
How first you knew me in a book I wrote,<br/>
How first you loved me for a written line:<br/>
So are we bound till broken is the throat<br/>
Of Song, and Art no more leads out the Nine.

<h1>The Spring and the Fall</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
In the spring of the year, in the spring of the year,<br/>
I walked the road beside my dear.<br/>
The trees were black where the bark was wet.<br/>
I see them yet, in the spring of the year.<br/>
He broke me a bough of the blossoming peach<br/>
That was out of the way and hard to reach.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In the fall of the year, in the fall of the year,<br/>
I walked the road beside my dear.<br/>
The rooks went up with a raucous trill.<br/>
I hear them still, in the fall of the year.<br/>
He laughed at all I dared to praise,<br/>
And broke my heart, in little ways.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Year be springing or year be falling,<br/>
The bark will drip and the birds be calling.<br/>
There's much that's fine to see and hear<br/>
In the spring of a year, in the fall of a year.<br/>
'Tis not love's going hurts my days,<br/>
But that it went in little ways.

<h1>Spring</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
To what purpose, April, do you return again?<br/>
Beauty is not enough.<br/>
You can no longer quiet me with the redness<br/>
Of little leaves opening stickily.<br/>
I know what I know.<br/>
The sun is hot on my neck as I observe<br/>
The spikes of the crocus.<br/>
The smell of the earth is good.<br/>
It is apparent that there is no death.<br/>
But what does that signify?<br/>
Not only under ground are the brains of men<br/>
Eaten by maggots,<br/>
Life in itself<br/>
Is nothing,<br/>
An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.<br/>
It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,<br/>
April<br/>
Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.<br/>

<h1>Sonnet: "Time does not bring relief"</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Time does not bring relief; you all have lied<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who told me time would ease me of my pain!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I miss him in the weeping of the rain;<br/>
I want him at the shrinking of the tide;<br/>
The old snows melt from every mountain-side,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And last year's leaves are smoke in every lane;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But last year's bitter loving must remain<br/>
Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide!
</p>
<p>
There are a hundred places where I fear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go, &#151; so with his memory they brim!<br/>
And entering with relief some quiet place<br/>
Where never fell his foot or shone his face<br/>
I say, "There is no memory of him here!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so stand stricken, so remembering him!

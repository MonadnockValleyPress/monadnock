<h1>I See So Clearly</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I see so clearly now my similar years<br/>
Repeat each other, shod in rusty black,<br/>
Like one hack following another hack<br/>
In meaningless procession, dry of tears,<br/>
Driven empty, lest the noses sharp as shears<br/>
Of gutter-urchins at a hearse's back<br/>
Should sniff a man died friendless, and attack<br/>
With silly scorn his deaf triumphant ears;<br/>
I see so clearly how my life must run<br/>
One year behind another year until<br/>
At length these bones that leap into the sun<br/>
Are lowered into the gravel, and lie still,<br/>
I would at times the funeral were done<br/>
And I abandoned on the ultimate hill.

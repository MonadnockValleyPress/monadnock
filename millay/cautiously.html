<h1>Then Cautiously She Pushed</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Then cautiously she pushed the cellar door<br/>
And stepped into the kitchen&mdash;saw the track<br/>
Of muddy rubber boots across the floor,<br/>
The many paper parcels in a stack<br/>
Upon the dresser; with accustomed care<br/>
Removed the twine and put the wrappings by,<br/>
Folded, and the bags flat, that with an air<br/>
Of ease had been whipped open skillfully,<br/>
To the gape of children. Treacherously dear<br/>
And simple was the dull, familiar task.<br/>
And so it was she came at length to ask:<br/>
How came the soda there? The sugar here?<br/>
Then the dream broke. Silent, she brought the mop,<br/>
And forced the trade-slip on the nail that held his razor strop.

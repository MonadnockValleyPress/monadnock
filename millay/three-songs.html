<h1>Three Songs from the Lamp and the Bell</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Oh, little rose tree, bloom!<br/>
Summer is nearly over.<br/>
The dahlias bleed, and the phlox is seed.<br/>
Nothing's left of the clover.<br/>
And the path of the poppy no one knows.<br/>
I would blossom if I were a rose.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Summer, for all your guile,<br/>
Will brown in a week to Autumn,<br/>
And launched leaves throw a shadow below<br/>
Over the brook's clear bottom,&mdash;<br/>
And the chariest bud the year can boast<br/>
Be brought to bloom by the chastening frost.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
Beat me a crown of bluer metal;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fret it with stones of a foreign style:<br/>
The heart grows weary after a little<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what it loved for a little while.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Weave me a robe of richer fibre;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattern its web with a rare device.<br/>
Give away to the child of a neighbor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gold gown I was glad in twice.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But buy me a singer to sing one song&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song about nothing&mdash;song about sheep&mdash;<br/>
Over and over, all day long;
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
Rain comes down<br/>
And hushes the town.<br/>
And where is the voice that I heard crying?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Snow settles<br/>
Over the nettles.<br/>
Where is the voice that I heard crying?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sand at last<br/>
On the drifting mast.<br/>
And where is the voice that I heard crying?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Earth now<br/>
On the busy brow.<br/>
And where is the voice that I heard crying?

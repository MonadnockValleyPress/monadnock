<h1>So She Came Back</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
So she came back into his house again<br/>
And watched beside his bed until he died,<br/>
Loving him not at all. The winter rain<br/>
Splashed in the painted butter-tub outside,<br/>
Where once her red geraniums had stood,<br/>
Where still their rotted stalks were to be seen;<br/>
The thin log snapped; and she went out for wood,<br/>
Bareheaded, running the few steps between<br/>
The house and shed; there, from the sodden eaves<br/>
Blown back and forth on ragged ends of twine,<br/>
Saw the dejected creeping-jinny vine,<br/>
(And one, big-aproned, blithe, with stiff blue sleeves<br/>
Rolled to the shoulder that warm day in spring,<br/>
Who planted seeds, musing ahead to their far blossoming).

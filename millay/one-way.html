<h1>One Way There Was</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
One way there was of muting in the mind<br/>
A little while the ever-clamorous care;<br/>
And there was rapture, of a decent kind,<br/>
In making mean and ugly objects fair:<br/>
Soft-sooted kettle-bottoms, that had been<br/>
Time after time set in above the fire,<br/>
Faucets, and candlesticks, corroded green,<br/>
To mine again from quarry; to attire<br/>
The shelves in paper petticoats, and tack<br/>
New oilcloth in the ringed-and-rotten's place,<br/>
Polish the stove till you could see your face,<br/>
And after nightfall rear an aching back<br/>
In a changed kitchen, bright as a new pin,<br/>
An advertisement, far too fine to cook a supper in.

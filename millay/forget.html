<h1>Sonnet: "I shall forget you presently, my dear"</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I shall forget you presently, my dear,<br/>
So make the most of this, your little day,<br/>
Your little month, your little half a year,<br/>
Ere I forget, or die, or move away,<br/>
And we are done forever; by and by<br/>
I shall forget you, as I said, but now,<br/>
If you entreat me with your loveliest lie<br/>
I will protest you with my favorite vow.<br/>
I would indeed that love were longer-lived,<br/>
And oaths were not so brittle as they are,<br/>
But so it is, and nature has contrived<br/>
To struggle on without a break thus far,&#151;<br/>
Whether or not we find what we are seeking<br/>
Is idle, biologically speaking.

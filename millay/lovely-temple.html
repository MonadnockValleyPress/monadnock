<h1>Sonnet: "As to some lovely temple, tenantless"</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
As to some lovely temple, tenantless<br/>
Long since, that once was sweet with shivering brass,<br/>
Knowing well its altars ruined and the grass<br/>
Grown up between the stones, yet from excess<br/>
Of grief hard driven, or great loneliness,<br/>
The worshiper returns, and those who pass<br/>
Marvel him crying on a name that was,&#151;<br/>
So is it now with me in my distress.<br/>
Your body was a temple to Delight;<br/>
Cold are its ashes whence the breath is fled,<br/>
Yet here one time your spirit was wont to move;<br/>
Here might I hope to find you day or night,<br/>
And here I come to look for you, my love,<br/>
Even now, foolishly, knowing you are dead.

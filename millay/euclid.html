<h1>Euclid Alone Has Looked</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.<br/>
Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace,<br/>
And lay them prone upon the earth and cease<br/>
To ponder on themselves, the while they stare<br/>
At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere<br/>
In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese<br/>
Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release<br/>
From dusty bondage into luminous air.<br/>
O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,<br/>
When first the shaft into his vision shone<br/>
Of light anatomized! Euclid alone<br/>
Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they<br/>
Who, though once only and then but far away,<br/>
Have heard her massive sandal set on stone.

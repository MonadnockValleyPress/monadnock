<h1>Here Is a Wound</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Here is a wound that never will heal, I know,<br/>
Being wrought not of a dearness and a death,<br/>
But of a love turned ashes and the breath<br/>
Gone out of beauty; never again will grow<br/>
The grass on that scarred acre, though I sow<br/>
Young seed there yearly and the sky bequeath<br/>
Its friendly weathers down, far underneath<br/>
Shall be such bitterness of an old woe.<br/>
That April should be shattered by a gust,<br/>
That August should be levelled by a rain,<br/>
I can endure, and that the lifted dust<br/>
Of man should settle to the earth again;<br/>
But that a dream can die, will be a thrust<br/>
Between my ribs forever of hot pain.

<h1>Departure</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
It's little I care what path I take,<br/>
And where it leads it's little I care;<br/>
But out of this house, lest my heart break,<br/>
I must go, and off somewhere.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It's little I know what's in my heart,<br/>
What's in my mind it's little I know,<br/>
But there's that in me must up and start,<br/>
And it's little I care where my feet go.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I wish I could walk for a day and a night,<br/>
And find me at dawn in a desolate place<br/>
With never the rut of a road in sight,<br/>
Nor the roof of a house, nor the eyes of a face.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I wish I could walk till my blood should spout,<br/>
And drop me, never to stir again,<br/>
On a shore that is wide, for the tide is out,<br/>
And the weedy rocks are bare to the rain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But dump or dock, where the path I take<br/>
Brings up, it's little enough I care;<br/>
And it's little I'd mind the fuss they'll make,<br/>
Huddled dead in a ditch somewhere.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>"Is something the matter, dear," she said,</em><br/>
<em>"That you sit at your work so silently?"</em><br/>
<em>"No, mother, no, 'twas a knot in my thread.</em><br/>
<em>There goes the kettle, I'll make the tea."</em>

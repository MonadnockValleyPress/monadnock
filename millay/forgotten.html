<h1>She Had Forgotten</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
She had forgotten how the August night<br/>
Was level as a lake beneath the moon,<br/>
In which she swam a little, losing sight<br/>
Of shore; and how the boy, that was at noon<br/>
Simple enough, not different from the rest,<br/>
Wore now a pleasant mystery as he went,<br/>
Which seemed to her an honest enough test<br/>
Whether she loved him, and she was content.<br/>
So loud, so loud the million crickets' choir . . .<br/>
So sweet the night, so long-drawn-out and late . . .<br/>
And if the man were not her spirit's mate,<br/>
Why was her body sluggish with desire?<br/>
Stark on the open field the moonlight fell,<br/>
But the oak tree's shadow was deep and black and secret as a well.

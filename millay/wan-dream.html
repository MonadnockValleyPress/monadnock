<h1>From the Wan Dream</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
From the wan dream that was her waking day,<br/>
Wherein she journeyed, borne along the ground<br/>
Without her own volition in some way,<br/>
Or fleeing, motionless, with feet fast bound,<br/>
Or running silent through a silent house<br/>
Sharply remembered from an earlier dream,<br/>
Upstairs, down other stairs, fearful to rouse,<br/>
Regarding him, the wide and empty scream<br/>
Of a strange sleeper on a malignant bed,<br/>
And all the time not certain if it were<br/>
Herself so doing or some one like to her,<br/>
From this wan dream that was her daily bread,<br/>
Sometimes, at night, incredulous, she would wake&mdash;<br/>
A child, blowing bubbles that the chairs and carpet did not break!

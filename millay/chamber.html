<h1>Your Face Is Like a Chamber</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Your face is like a chamber where a king<br/>
Dies of his wounds, untended and alone,<br/>
Stifling with courteous gesture the crude moan<br/>
That speaks too loud of mortal perishing,<br/>
Rising on elbow in the dark to sing<br/>
Some rhyme now out of season but well known<br/>
In days when banners in his face were blown<br/>
And every woman had a rose to fling.<br/>
I know that through your eyes which look on me<br/>
Who stand regarding you with pitiful breath,<br/>
You see beyond the moment's pause, you see<br/>
The sunny sky, the skimming bird beneath,<br/>
And, fronting on your windows hopelessly,<br/>
Black in the noon, the broad estates of Death.

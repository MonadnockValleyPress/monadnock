<h1>How Healthily Their Feet</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
How healthily their feet upon the floor<br/>
Strike down! These are no spirits, but a band<br/>
Of children, surely, leaping hand in hand,<br/>
Into the air in groups of three and four,<br/>
Wearing their silken rags as if they wore<br/>
Leaves only and light grasses, or a strand<br/>
Of black elusive seaweed oozing sand,<br/>
And running hard as if along a shore.<br/>
I know how lost forever, and at length<br/>
How still these lovely tossing limbs shall lie,<br/>
And the bright laughter and the panting breath;<br/>
And yet, before such beauty and such strength,<br/>
Once more, as always when the dance is high,<br/>
I am rebuked that I believe in death.

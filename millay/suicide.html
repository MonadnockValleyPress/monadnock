<h1>The Suicide</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
"Curse thee, Life, I will live with thee no more!<br/>
Thou hast mocked me, starved me, beat my body sore!<br/>
And all for a pledge that was not pledged by me,<br/>
I have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly<br/>
That I might eat again, and met thy sneers<br/>
With deprecations, and thy blows with tears, &#151;<br/>
Aye, from thy glutted lash, glad, crawled away,<br/>
As if spent passion were a holiday!<br/>
And now I go.  Nor threat, nor easy vow<br/>
Of tardy kindness can avail thee now<br/>
With me, whence fear and faith alike are flown;<br/>
Lonely I came, and I depart alone,<br/>
And know not where nor unto whom I go;<br/>
But that thou canst not follow me I know."
</p>
<p>
Thus I to Life, and ceased; but through my brain<br/>
My thought ran still, until I spake again:
</p>
<p>
"Ah, but I go not as I came, &#151; no trace<br/>
Is mine to bear away of that old grace<br/>
I brought!  I have been heated in thy fires,<br/>
Bent by thy hands, fashioned to thy desires,<br/>
Thy mark is on me!  I am not the same<br/>
Nor ever more shall be, as when I came.<br/>
Ashes am I of all that once I seemed.<br/>
In me all's sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed<br/>
Is wakeful for alarm, &#151; oh, shame to thee,<br/>
For the ill change that thou hast wrought in me,<br/>
Who laugh no more nor lift my throat to sing!<br/>
Ah, Life, I would have been a pleasant thing<br/>
To have about the house when I was grown<br/>
If thou hadst left my little joys alone!<br/>
I asked of thee no favor save this one:<br/>
That thou wouldst leave me playing in the sun!<br/>
And this thou didst deny, calling my name<br/>
Insistently, until I rose and came.<br/>
I saw the sun no more. &#151; It were not well<br/>
So long on these unpleasant thoughts to dwell,<br/>
Need I arise to-morrow and renew<br/>
Again my hated tasks, but I am through<br/>
With all things save my thoughts and this one night,<br/>
So that in truth I seem already quite<br/>
Free and remote from thee, &#151; I feel no haste<br/>
And no reluctance to depart; I taste<br/>
Merely, with thoughtful mien, an unknown draught,<br/>
That in a little while I shall have quaffed."
</p>
<p>
Thus I to Life, and ceased, and slightly smiled,<br/>
Looking at nothing; and my thin dreams filed<br/>
Before me one by one till once again<br/>
I set new words unto an old refrain:
</p>
<p>
"Treasures thou hast that never have been mine!<br/>
Warm lights in many a secret chamber shine<br/>
Of thy gaunt house, and gusts of song have blown<br/>
Like blossoms out to me that sat alone!<br/>
And I have waited well for thee to show<br/>
If any share were mine, &#151; and now I go!<br/>
Nothing I leave, and if I naught attain<br/>
I shall but come into mine own again!"<br/>
Thus I to Life, and ceased, and spake no more,<br/>
But turning, straightway, sought a certain door<br/>
In the rear wall.  Heavy it was, and low<br/>
And dark, &#151; a way by which none e'er would go<br/>
That other exit had, and never knock<br/>
Was heard thereat, &#151; bearing a curious lock<br/>
Some chance had shown me fashioned faultily,<br/>
Whereof Life held content the useless key,<br/>
And great coarse hinges, thick and rough with rust,<br/>
Whose sudden voice across a silence must,<br/>
I knew, be harsh and horrible to hear, &#151;<br/>
A strange door, ugly like a dwarf. &#151; So near<br/>
I came I felt upon my feet the chill<br/>
Of acid wind creeping across the sill.<br/>
So stood longtime, till over me at last<br/>
Came weariness, and all things other passed<br/>
To make it room; the still night drifted deep<br/>
Like snow about me, and I longed for sleep.
</p>
<p>
But, suddenly, marking the morning hour,<br/>
Bayed the deep-throated bell within the tower!<br/>
Startled, I raised my head, &#151; and with a shout<br/>
Laid hold upon the latch, &#151; and was without.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*    *    *    *    *
</p>
<p>
Ah, long-forgotten, well-remembered road,<br/>
Leading me back unto my old abode,<br/>
My father's house!  There in the night I came,<br/>
And found them feasting, and all things the same<br/>
As they had been before.  A splendour hung<br/>
Upon the walls, and such sweet songs were sung<br/>
As, echoing out of very long ago,<br/>
Had called me from the house of Life, I know.<br/>
So fair their raiment shone I looked in shame<br/>
On the unlovely garb in which I came;<br/>
Then straightway at my hesitancy mocked:<br/>
"It is my father's house!" I said and knocked;<br/>
And the door opened.  To the shining crowd<br/>
Tattered and dark I entered, like a cloud,<br/>
Seeing no face but his; to him I crept,<br/>
And "Father!" I cried, and clasped his knees, and wept.<br/>
Ah, days of joy that followed!  All alone<br/>
I wandered through the house.  My own, my own,<br/>
My own to touch, my own to taste and smell,<br/>
All I had lacked so long and loved so well!<br/>
None shook me out of sleep, nor hushed my song,<br/>
Nor called me in from the sunlight all day long.
</p>
<p>
I know not when the wonder came to me<br/>
Of what my father's business might be,<br/>
And whither fared and on what errands bent<br/>
The tall and gracious messengers he sent.<br/>
Yet one day with no song from dawn till night<br/>
Wondering, I sat, and watched them out of sight.<br/>
And the next day I called; and on the third<br/>
Asked them if I might go, &#151; but no one heard.<br/>
Then, sick with longing, I arose at last<br/>
And went unto my father, &#151; in that vast<br/>
Chamber wherein he for so many years<br/>
Has sat, surrounded by his charts and spheres.<br/>
"Father," I said, "Father, I cannot play<br/>
The harp that thou didst give me, and all day<br/>
I sit in idleness, while to and fro<br/>
About me thy serene, grave servants go;<br/>
And I am weary of my lonely ease.<br/>
Better a perilous journey overseas<br/>
Away from thee, than this, the life I lead,<br/>
To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed<br/>
That grows to naught, &#151; I love thee more than they<br/>
Who serve thee most; yet serve thee in no way.<br/>
Father, I beg of thee a little task<br/>
To dignify my days, &#151; 'tis all I ask<br/>
Forever, but forever, this denied,<br/>
I perish."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Child," my father's voice replied,<br/>
"All things thy fancy hath desired of me<br/>
Thou hast received.  I have prepared for thee<br/>
Within my house a spacious chamber, where<br/>
Are delicate things to handle and to wear,<br/>
And all these things are thine.  Dost thou love song?<br/>
My minstrels shall attend thee all day long.<br/>
Or sigh for flowers?  My fairest gardens stand<br/>
Open as fields to thee on every hand.<br/>
And all thy days this word shall hold the same:<br/>
No pleasure shalt thou lack that thou shalt name.<br/>
But as for tasks &#151;" he smiled, and shook his head;<br/>
"Thou hadst thy task, and laidst it by", he said.

<h1>The White Bark Writhed</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
The white bark writhed and sputtered like a fish<br/>
Upon the coals, exuding odorous smoke.<br/>
She knelt and blew, in a surging desolate wish<br/>
For comfort; and the sleeping ashes woke<br/>
And scattered to the hearth, but no thin fire<br/>
Broke suddenly, the wood was wet with rain.<br/>
Then, softly stepping forth from her desire,<br/>
(Being mindful of like passion hurled in vain<br/>
Upon a similar task, in other days)<br/>
She thrust her breath against the stubborn coal,<br/>
Bringing to bear upon its hilt the whole<br/>
Of her still body... there sprang a little blaze...<br/>
A pack of hounds, the flame swept up the flue!&mdash;<br/>
And the blue night stood flattened against the window, staring through.

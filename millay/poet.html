<h1>To a Poet that Died Young</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Minstrel, what have you to do<br/>
With this man that, after you,<br/>
Sharing not your happy fate,<br/>
Sat as England's Laureate?<br/>
Vainly, in these iron days,<br/>
Strives the poet in your praise,<br/>
Minstrel, by whose singing side<br/>
Beauty walked, until you died.
</p>
<p>
Still, though none should hark again,<br/>
Drones the blue-fly in the pane,<br/>
Thickly crusts the blackest moss,<br/>
Blows the rose its musk across,<br/>
Floats the boat that is forgot<br/>
None the less to Camelot.
</p>
<p>
Many a bard's untimely death<br/>
Lends unto his verses breath;<br/>
Here's a song was never sung:<br/>
Growing old is dying young.<br/>
Minstrel, what is this to you:<br/>
That a man you never knew,<br/>
When your grave was far and green,<br/>
Sat and gossipped with a queen?
</p>
<p>
Thalia knows how rare a thing<br/>
Is it, to grow old and sing;<br/>
When a brown and tepid tide<br/>
Closes in on every side.<br/>
Who shall say if Shelley's gold<br/>
Had withstood it to grow old?
</p>

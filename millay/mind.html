<h1>It Came into Her Mind</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
It came into her mind, seeing how the snow<br/>
Was gone, and the brown grass exposed again,<br/>
And clothes-pins, and an apron&mdash;long ago,<br/>
In some white storm that sifted through the pane<br/>
And sent her forth reluctantly at last<br/>
To gather in, before the line gave way,<br/>
Garments, board-stiff, that galloped on the blast<br/>
Clashing like angel armies in a fray,<br/>
An apron long ago in such a night<br/>
Blown down and buried in the deepening drift,<br/>
To lie till April thawed it back to sight,<br/>
Forgotten, quaint and novel as a gift&mdash;<br/>
It struck her, as she pulled and pried and tore,<br/>
That here was spring, and the whole year to be lived through once more.

<h1>Keen</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Weep him dead and mourn as you may,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me, I sing as I must:<br/>
Blessed be Death, that cuts in marble<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would have sunk to dust!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Blessed be Death, that took my love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buried him in the sea,<br/>
Where never a lie nor a bitter word<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will out of his mouth at me.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This I have to hold to my heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This to take by the hand:<br/>
Sweet we were for a summer month<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sun on the dry white sand;<br/>
</p>
<p>
Mild we were for a summer month<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the wind from over the weirs.<br/>
And blessed be Death, that hushed with salt<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh and slovenly years!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Who builds her a house with love for timber<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Builds her a house of foam.<br/>
And I'd rather be bride to a lad gone down<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than widow to one safe home.

<h1>Not Over-Kind nor Over-Quick</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Not over-kind nor over-quick in study<br/>
Nor skilled in sports nor beautiful was he,<br/>
Who had come into her life when anybody<br/>
Would have been welcome, so in need was she.<br/>
They had become acquainted in this way:<br/>
He flashed a mirror in her eyes at school;<br/>
By which he was distinguished; from that day<br/>
They went about together, as a rule.<br/>
She told, in secret and with whispering,<br/>
How he had flashed a mirror in her eyes;<br/>
And as she told, it struck her with surprise<br/>
That this was not so wonderful a thing.<br/>
But what's the odds?&mdash;It's pretty nice to know<br/>
You've got a friend to keep you company everywhere you go.

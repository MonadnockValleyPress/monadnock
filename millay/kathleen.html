<h1>To Kathleen</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Still must the poet as of old,<br/>
In barren attic bleak and cold,<br/>
Starve, freeze, and fashion verses to<br/>
Such things as flowers and song and you;
</p>
<p>
Still as of old his being give<br/>
In Beauty's name, while she may live,<br/>
Beauty that may not die as long<br/>
As there are flowers and you and song.
</p>

<h1>I Shall Go Back Again</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I shall go back again to the bleak shore<br/>
And build a little shanty on the sand,<br/>
In such a way that the extremest band<br/>
Of brittle seaweed will escape my door<br/>
But by a yard or two; and nevermore<br/>
Shall I return to take you by the hand;<br/>
I shall be gone to what I understand,<br/>
And happier than I ever was before.<br/>
The love that stood a moment in your eyes,<br/>
The words that lay a moment on your tongue,<br/>
Are one with all that in a moment dies,<br/>
A little under-said and over-sung.<br/>
But I shall find the sullen rocks and skies<br/>
Unchanged from what they were when I was young.

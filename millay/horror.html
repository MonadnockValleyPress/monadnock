<h1>She Had A Horror</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
She had a horror he would die at night.<br/>
And sometimes when the light began to fade<br/>
She could not keep from noticing how white<br/>
The birches looked&mdash;and then she would be afraid,<br/>
Even with a lamp, to go about the house<br/>
And lock the windows; and as night wore on<br/>
Toward morning, if a dog howled, or a mouse<br/>
Squeaked in the floor, long after it was gone<br/>
Her flesh would sit awry on her. By day<br/>
She would forget somewhat, and it would seem<br/>
A silly thing to go with just this dream<br/>
And get a neighbor to come at night and stay.<br/>
But it would strike her sometimes, making the tea:<br/>
<em>She had kept that kettle boiling all night long, for company.</em>

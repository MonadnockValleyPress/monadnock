<h1>Interim</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
The room is full of you! &#151; As I came in<br/>
And closed the door behind me, all at once<br/>
A something in the air, intangible,<br/>
Yet stiff with meaning, struck my senses sick! &#151;
</p>
<p>
Sharp, unfamiliar odors have destroyed<br/>
Each other room's dear personality.<br/>
The heavy scent of damp, funereal flowers, &#151;<br/>
The very essence, hush-distilled, of Death &#151;<br/>
Has strangled that habitual breath of home<br/>
Whose expiration leaves all houses dead;<br/>
And wheresoe'er I look is hideous change.<br/>
Save here.  Here 'twas as if a weed-choked gate<br/>
Had opened at my touch, and I had stepped<br/>
Into some long-forgot, enchanted, strange,<br/>
Sweet garden of a thousand years ago<br/>
And suddenly thought, "I have been here before!"
</p>
<p>
You are not here.  I know that you are gone,<br/>
And will not ever enter here again.<br/>
And yet it seems to me, if I should speak,<br/>
Your silent step must wake across the hall;<br/>
If I should turn my head, that your sweet eyes<br/>
Would kiss me from the door. &#151; So short a time<br/>
To teach my life its transposition to<br/>
This difficult and unaccustomed key! &#151;<br/>
The room is as you left it; your last touch &#151;<br/>
A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself<br/>
As saintly &#151; hallows now each simple thing;<br/>
Hallows and glorifies, and glows between<br/>
The dust's grey fingers like a shielded light.
</p>
<p>
There is your book, just as you laid it down,<br/>
Face to the table, &#151; I cannot believe<br/>
That you are gone! &#151; Just then it seemed to me<br/>
You must be here.  I almost laughed to think<br/>
How like reality the dream had been;<br/>
Yet knew before I laughed, and so was still.<br/>
That book, outspread, just as you laid it down!<br/>
Perhaps you thought, "I wonder what comes next,<br/>
And whether this or this will be the end";<br/>
So rose, and left it, thinking to return.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps that chair, when you arose and passed<br/>
Out of the room, rocked silently a while<br/>
Ere it again was still. When you were gone<br/>
Forever from the room, perhaps that chair,<br/>
Stirred by your movement, rocked a little while,<br/>
Silently, to and fro. . .
</p>
<p>
And here are the last words your fingers wrote,<br/>
Scrawled in broad characters across a page<br/>
In this brown book I gave you. Here your hand,<br/>
Guiding your rapid pen, moved up and down.<br/>
Here with a looping knot you crossed a "t",<br/>
And here another like it, just beyond<br/>
These two eccentric "e's".  You were so small,<br/>
And wrote so brave a hand!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How strange it seems<br/>
That of all words these are the words you chose!<br/>
And yet a simple choice; you did not know<br/>
You would not write again.  If you had known &#151;<br/>
But then, it does not matter, &#151; and indeed<br/>
If you had known there was so little time<br/>
You would have dropped your pen and come to me<br/>
And this page would be empty, and some phrase<br/>
Other than this would hold my wonder now.<br/>
Yet, since you could not know, and it befell<br/>
That these are the last words your fingers wrote,<br/>
There is a dignity some might not see<br/>
In this, "I picked the first sweet-pea to-day."<br/>
To-day!  Was there an opening bud beside it<br/>
You left until to-morrow? &#151; O my love,<br/>
The things that withered, &#151; and you came not back!<br/>
That day you filled this circle of my arms<br/>
That now is empty.  (O my empty life!)<br/>
That day &#151; that day you picked the first sweet-pea, &#151;<br/>
And brought it in to show me!  I recall<br/>
With terrible distinctness how the smell<br/>
Of your cool gardens drifted in with you.<br/>
I know, you held it up for me to see<br/>
And flushed because I looked not at the flower,<br/>
But at your face; and when behind my look<br/>
You saw such unmistakable intent<br/>
You laughed and brushed your flower against my lips.<br/>
(You were the fairest thing God ever made,<br/>
I think.)  And then your hands above my heart<br/>
Drew down its stem into a fastening,<br/>
And while your head was bent I kissed your hair.<br/>
I wonder if you knew.  (Beloved hands!<br/>
Somehow I cannot seem to see them still.<br/>
Somehow I cannot seem to see the dust<br/>
In your bright hair.)  What is the need of Heaven<br/>
When earth can be so sweet? &#151; If only God<br/>
Had let us love, &#151; and show the world the way!<br/>
Strange cancellings must ink th' eternal books<br/>
When love-crossed-out will bring the answer right!<br/>
That first sweet-pea!  I wonder where it is.<br/>
It seems to me I laid it down somewhere,<br/>
And yet, &#151; I am not sure. I am not sure,<br/>
Even, if it was white or pink; for then<br/>
'Twas much like any other flower to me,<br/>
Save that it was the first.  I did not know,<br/>
Then, that it was the last.  If I had known &#151;<br/>
But then, it does not matter.  Strange how few,<br/>
After all's said and done, the things that are<br/>
Of moment.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Few indeed!  When I can make<br/>
Of ten small words a rope to hang the world!<br/>
"I had you and I have you now no more."<br/>
There, there it dangles, &#151; where's the little truth<br/>
That can for long keep footing under that<br/>
When its slack syllables tighten to a thought?<br/>
Here, let me write it down!  I wish to see<br/>
Just how a thing like that will look on paper!
</p>
<p>
<em>"I had you and I have you now no more."</em>
</p>
<p>
O little words, how can you run so straight<br/>
Across the page, beneath the weight you bear?<br/>
How can you fall apart, whom such a theme<br/>
Has bound together, and hereafter aid<br/>
In trivial expression, that have been<br/>
So hideously dignified? &#151; Would God<br/>
That tearing you apart would tear the thread<br/>
I strung you on!  Would God &#151; O God, my mind<br/>
Stretches asunder on this merciless rack<br/>
Of imagery!  O, let me sleep a while!<br/>
Would I could sleep, and wake to find me back<br/>
In that sweet summer afternoon with you.<br/>
Summer?  'Tis summer still by the calendar!<br/>
How easily could God, if He so willed,<br/>
Set back the world a little turn or two!<br/>
Correct its griefs, and bring its joys again!
</p>
<p>
We were so wholly one I had not thought<br/>
That we could die apart.  I had not thought<br/>
That I could move, &#151; and you be stiff and still!<br/>
That I could speak, &#151; and you perforce be dumb!<br/>
I think our heart-strings were, like warp and woof<br/>
In some firm fabric, woven in and out;<br/>
Your golden filaments in fair design<br/>
Across my duller fibre.  And to-day<br/>
The shining strip is rent; the exquisite<br/>
Fine pattern is destroyed; part of your heart<br/>
Aches in my breast; part of my heart lies chilled<br/>
In the damp earth with you.  I have been torn<br/>
In two, and suffer for the rest of me.<br/>
What is my life to me?  And what am I<br/>
To life, &#151; a ship whose star has guttered out?<br/>
A Fear that in the deep night starts awake<br/>
Perpetually, to find its senses strained<br/>
Against the taut strings of the quivering air,<br/>
Awaiting the return of some dread chord?
</p>
<p>
Dark, Dark, is all I find for metaphor;<br/>
All else were contrast, &#151; save that contrast's wall<br/>
Is down, and all opposed things flow together<br/>
Into a vast monotony, where night<br/>
And day, and frost and thaw, and death and life,<br/>
Are synonyms.  What now &#151; what now to me<br/>
Are all the jabbering birds and foolish flowers<br/>
That clutter up the world?  You were my song!<br/>
Now, let discord scream!  You were my flower!<br/>
Now let the world grow weeds!  For I shall not<br/>
Plant things above your grave &#151; (the common balm<br/>
Of the conventional woe for its own wound!)<br/>
Amid sensations rendered negative<br/>
By your elimination stands to-day,<br/>
Certain, unmixed, the element of grief;<br/>
I sorrow; and I shall not mock my truth<br/>
With travesties of suffering, nor seek<br/>
To effigy its incorporeal bulk<br/>
In little wry-faced images of woe.
</p>
<p>
I cannot call you back; and I desire<br/>
No utterance of my immaterial voice.<br/>
I cannot even turn my face this way<br/>
Or that, and say, "My face is turned to you";<br/>
I know not where you are, I do not know<br/>
If Heaven hold you or if earth transmute,<br/>
Body and soul, you into earth again;<br/>
But this I know: &#151; not for one second's space<br/>
Shall I insult my sight with visionings<br/>
Such as the credulous crowd so eager-eyed<br/>
Beholds, self-conjured, in the empty air.<br/>
Let the world wail!  Let drip its easy tears!<br/>
My sorrow shall be dumb!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#151; What do I say?<br/>
God! God! &#151; God pity me!  Am I gone mad<br/>
That I should spit upon a rosary?<br/>
Am I become so shrunken?  Would to God<br/>
I too might feel that frenzied faith whose touch<br/>
Makes temporal the most enduring grief;<br/>
Though it must walk a while, as is its wont,<br/>
With wild lamenting!  Would I too might weep<br/>
Where weeps the world and hangs its piteous wreaths<br/>
For its new dead!  Not Truth, but Faith, it is<br/>
That keeps the world alive.  If all at once<br/>
Faith were to slacken, &#151; that unconscious faith<br/>
Which must, I know, yet be the corner-stone<br/>
Of all believing, &#151; birds now flying fearless<br/>
Across would drop in terror to the earth;<br/>
Fishes would drown; and the all-governing reins<br/>
Would tangle in the frantic hands of God<br/>
And the worlds gallop headlong to destruction!
</p>
<p>
O God, I see it now, and my sick brain<br/>
Staggers and swoons!  How often over me<br/>
Flashes this breathlessness of sudden sight<br/>
In which I see the universe unrolled<br/>
Before me like a scroll and read thereon<br/>
Chaos and Doom, where helpless planets whirl<br/>
Dizzily round and round and round and round,<br/>
Like tops across a table, gathering speed<br/>
With every spin, to waver on the edge<br/>
One instant &#151; looking over &#151; and the next<br/>
To shudder and lurch forward out of sight &#151;<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*    *    *    *    *
</p>
<p>
Ah, I am worn out &#151; I am wearied out &#151;<br/>
It is too much &#151; I am but flesh and blood,<br/>
And I must sleep.  Though you were dead again,<br/>
I am but flesh and blood and I must sleep.

<h1>Sonnet: "If I should learn, in some quite casual way"</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
If I should learn, in some quite casual way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you were gone, not to return again &#151;<br/>
Read from the back-page of a paper, say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held by a neighbor in a subway train,<br/>
How at the corner of this avenue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such a street (so are the papers filled)<br/>
A hurrying man &#151; who happened to be you &#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon to-day had happened to be killed,<br/>
I should not cry aloud &#151; I could not cry<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloud, or wring my hands in such a place &#151;<br/>
I should but watch the station lights rush by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a more careful interest on my face,<br/>
Or raise my eyes and read with greater care<br/>
Where to store furs and how to treat the hair.

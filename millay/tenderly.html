<h1>Tenderly, in Those Times</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Tenderly, in those times, as though she fed<br/>
An ailing child&mdash;with sturdy propping up<br/>
Of its small, feverish body in the bed,<br/>
And steadying of its hands about the cup&mdash;<br/>
She gave her husband of her body's strength,<br/>
Thinking of men, what helpless things they were,<br/>
Until he turned and fell asleep at length,<br/>
And stealthily stirred the night and spoke to her.<br/>
Familiar, at such moments, like a friend,<br/>
Whistled far off the long, mysterious train,<br/>
And she could see in her mind's vision plain<br/>
The magic World, where cities stood on end . . .<br/>
Remote from where she lay&mdash;and yet&mdash;between,<br/>
Save for something asleep beside her, only the window screen.

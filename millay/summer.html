<h1>I Know I Am but Summer</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I know I am but summer to your heart,<br/>
And not the full four seasons of the year;<br/>
And you must welcome from another part<br/>
Such noble moods as are not mine, my dear.<br/>
No gracious weight of golden fruits to sell<br/>
Have I, nor any wise and wintry thing;<br/>
And I have loved you all too long and well<br/>
To carry still the high sweet breast of Spring.<br/>
Wherefore I say: O love, as summer goes,<br/>
I must be gone, steal forth with silent drums,<br/>
That you may hail anew the bird and rose<br/>
When I come back to you, as summer comes.<br/>
Else will you seek, at some not distant time,<br/>
Even your summer in another clime.

<h1>Sonnet: "Not with libations, but with shouts and laughter"</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Not with libations, but with shouts and laughter<br/>
We drenched the altars of Love's sacred grove,<br/>
Shaking to earth green fruits, impatient after<br/>
The launching of the colored moths of Love.<br/>
Love's proper myrtle and his mother's zone<br/>
We bound about our irreligious brows,<br/>
And fettered him with garlands of our own,<br/>
And spread a banquet in his frugal house.<br/>
Not yet the god has spoken; but I fear<br/>
Though we should break our bodies in his flame,<br/>
And pour our blood upon his altar, here<br/>
Henceforward is a grove without a name,<br/>
A pasture to the shaggy goats of Pan,<br/>
Whence flee forever a woman and a man.

<h1>Hyacinth</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I am in love with him to whom a hyacinth is dearer<br/>
Than I shall ever be dear.<br/>
On nights when the field-mice are abroad he cannot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep:<br/>
He hears their narrow teeth at the bulbs of his<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hyacinths.<br/>
But the gnawing at my heart he does not hear.
</p>
<h1>To One Who Might Have Borne a Message</h1>
<p>
Had I known that you were going<br/>
I would have given you messages for her,<br/>
Now two years dead,<br/>
Whom I shall always love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As it is, should she entreat you how it goes with me,<br/>
You must reply, as well as with most, you fancy;<br/>
That I love easily, and pass the time.<br/>
And she will not know how all day long between<br/>
My life and me her shadow intervenes,<br/>
A young thin girl,<br/>
Wearing a white skirt and a purple sweater<br/>
And a narrow pale blue ribbon about her hair.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I used to say to her, "I love you<br/>
Because your face is such a pretty color,<br/>
No other reason."<br/>
But it was not true.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh, had I only known that you were going,<br/>
I could have given you messages for her!

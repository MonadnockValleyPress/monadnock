<h1>Dirge Without Music</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.<br/>
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:<br/>
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned<br/>
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.
</p>
<p>
Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.<br/>
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.<br/>
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,<br/>
A formula, a phrase remains,&mdash;but the best is lost.
</p>
<p>
The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,&mdash;<br/>
They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled<br/>
Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.<br/>
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.
</p>
<p>
Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave<br/>
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;<br/>
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.<br/>
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.

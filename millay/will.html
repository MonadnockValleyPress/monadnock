<h1>Say What You Will</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Say what you will, and scratch my heart to find<br/>
The roots of last year's roses in my breast;<br/>
I am as surely riper in my mind<br/>
As if the fruit stood in the stalls confessed.<br/>
Laugh at the unshed leaf, say what you will,<br/>
Call me in all things what I was before,<br/>
A flutterer in the wind, a woman still;<br/>
I tell you I am what I was and more.<br/>
My branches weigh me down, frost cleans the air,<br/>
My sky is black with small birds bearing south;<br/>
Say what you will, confuse me with fine care,<br/>
Put by my word as but an April truth&mdash;<br/>
Autumn is no less on me that a rose<br/>
Hugs the brown bough and sighs before it goes.

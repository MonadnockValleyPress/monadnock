<h1>Ashes of Life</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eat I must, and sleep I will, &#151; and would that night were here!<br/>
But ah! &#151; to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that it were day again! &#151; with twilight near!
</p>
<p>
Love has gone and left me and I don't know what to do;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This or that or what you will is all the same to me;<br/>
But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through, &#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's little use in anything as far as I can see.
</p>
<p>
Love has gone and left me, &#151; and the neighbors knock and borrow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse, &#151;<br/>
And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's this little street and this little house.
</p>

<h1>To a Young Girl</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
Shall I despise you that your colourless tears<br/>
Made rainbows in your lashes, and you forgot to weep?<br/>
Would we were half so wise, that eke a grief out<br/>
By sitting in the dark, until we fall asleep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I only fear lest, being by nature sunny,<br/>
By and by you will weep no more at all,<br/>
And fall asleep in the light, having lost with the tears<br/>
The colour in the lashes that comes as tears fall.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I would not have you darken your lids with weeping<br/>
Beautiful eyes, but I would have you weep enough<br/>
To wet the fingers of the hand held over the eye-lids<br/>
And stain a little the light frock's delicate stuff.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For there came to mind, as I watched you winking the tears down,<br/>
Laughing faces, blown from the west and the east,<br/>
Faces lovely and proud that I have prized and cherished,<br/>
Nor were the loveliest among them those that had wept the least.<br/>
</p>

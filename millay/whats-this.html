<h1>What's This of Death</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
What's this of death, from you who never will die?<br/>
Think you the wrist that fashioned you in clay,<br/>
The thumb that set the hollow just that way<br/>
In your full throat and lidded the long eye<br/>
So roundly from the forehead, will let lie<br/>
Broken, forgotten, under foot some day<br/>
Your unimpeachable body, and so slay<br/>
The work he most had been remembered by?<br/>
I tell you this: whatever of dust to dust<br/>
Goes down, whatever of ashes may return<br/>
To its essential self in its own season,<br/>
Loveliness such as yours will not be lost,<br/>
But, cast in bronze upon his very urn,<br/>
Make known him Master, and for what good reason.

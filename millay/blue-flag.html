<h1>The Blue-Flag in the Bog</h1>
<h2>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h2>
<p>
God had called us, and we came;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our loved Earth to ashes left;<br/>
Heaven was a neighbor's house,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open to us, bereft.
</p>
<p>
Gay the lights of Heaven showed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'twas God who walked ahead;<br/>
Yet I wept along the road,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanting my own house instead.
</p>
<p>
Wept unseen, unheeded cried,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All you things my eyes have kissed,<br/>
Fare you well!  We meet no more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely, lovely tattered mist!
</p>
<p>
Weary wings that rise and fall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long above the fire!"&#151;<br/>
Red with heat was every wall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough with heat was every wire&#151;
</p>
<p>
"Fare you well, you little winds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the flying embers chase!<br/>
Fare you well, you shuddering day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your hands before your face!
</p>
<p>
And, ah, blackened by strange blight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to a false sun unfurled,<br/>
Now forevermore goodbye,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gardens in the world!
</p>
<p>
On the windless hills of Heaven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I have no wish to see,<br/>
White, eternal lilies stand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a lake of ebony.
</p>
<p>
But the Earth forevermore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a place where nothing grows,&#151;<br/>
Dawn will come, and no bud break;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evening, and no blossom close.
</p>
<p>
Spring will come, and wander slow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over an indifferent land,<br/>
Stand beside an empty creek,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold a dead seed in her hand."
</p>
<p>
God had called us, and we came,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the blessed road I trod<br/>
Was a bitter road to me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at heart I questioned God.
</p>
<p>
"Though in Heaven," I said, "be all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the heart would most desire,<br/>
Held Earth naught save souls of sinners<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worth the saving from a fire?
</p>
<p>
Withered grass,&#151;the wasted growing!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aimless ache of laden boughs!"<br/>
Little things God had forgotten<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called me, from my burning house.
</p>
<p>
"Though in Heaven," I said, "be all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the eye could ask to see,<br/>
All the things I ever knew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are this blaze in back of me."
</p>
<p>
"Though in Heaven," I said, "be all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the ear could think to lack,<br/>
All the things I ever knew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are this roaring at my back."
</p>
<p>
It was God who walked ahead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a shepherd to the fold;<br/>
In his footsteps fared the weak,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the weary and the old,
</p>
<p>
Glad enough of gladness over,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready for the peace to be,&#151;<br/>
But a thing God had forgotten<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the growing bones of me.
</p>
<p>
And I drew a bit apart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I lagged a bit behind,<br/>
And I thought on Peace Eternal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest He look into my mind:
</p>
<p>
And I gazed upon the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I thought of Heavenly Rest,&#151;<br/>
And I slipped away like water<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the fingers of the blest!
</p>
<p>
All their eyes were fixed on Glory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a glance brushed over me;<br/>
"Alleluia!  Alleluia!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the road,&#151;and I was free.
</p>
<p>
And my heart rose like a freshet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it swept me on before,<br/>
Giddy as a whirling stick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I felt the earth once more.
</p>
<p>
All the earth was charred and black,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire had swept from pole to pole;<br/>
And the bottom of the sea<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was as brittle as a bowl;
</p>
<p>
And the timbered mountain-top<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was as naked as a skull,&#151;<br/>
Nothing left, nothing left,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Earth so beautiful!
</p>
<p>
"Earth," I said, "how can I leave you?"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are all I have," I said;<br/>
"What is left to take my mind up,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living always, and you dead?"
</p>
<p>
"Speak!" I said, "Oh, tell me something!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a sign that I can see!<br/>
For a keepsake!  To keep always!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick!&#151;before God misses me!"
</p>
<p>
And I listened for a voice;&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my heart was all I heard;<br/>
Not a screech-owl, not a loon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a tree-toad said a word.
</p>
<p>
And I waited for a sign;&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coals and cinders, nothing more;<br/>
And a little cloud of smoke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating on a valley floor.
</p>
<p>
And I peered into the smoke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it rotted, like a fog:&#151;<br/>
There, encompassed round by fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood a blue-flag in a bog!
</p>
<p>
Little flames came wading out,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straining, straining towards its stem,<br/>
But it was so blue and tall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it scorned to think of them!
</p>
<p>
Red and thirsty were their tongues,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the tongues of wolves must be,<br/>
But it was so blue and tall&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see!
</p>
<p>
All my heart became a tear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my soul became a tower,<br/>
Never loved I anything<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I loved that tall blue flower!
</p>
<p>
It was all the little boats<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had ever sailed the sea,<br/>
It was all the little books<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had gone to school with me;
</p>
<p>
On its roots like iron claws<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rearing up so blue and tall,&#151;<br/>
It was all the gallant Earth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its back against a wall!
</p>
<p>
In a breath, ere I had breathed,&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I laughed, I cried, to see!&#151;<br/>
I was kneeling at its side,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it leaned its head on me!
</p>
<p>
Crumbling stones and sliding sand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the road to Heaven now;<br/>
Icy at my straining knees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drags the awful under-tow;
</p>
<p>
Soon but stepping-stones of dust<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the road to Heaven be,&#151;<br/>
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach a hand and rescue me!
</p>
<p>
"There&#151;there, my blue-flag flower;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush&#151;hush&#151;go to sleep;<br/>
That is only God you hear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counting up His folded sheep!
</p>
<p>
Lullabye&#151;lullabye&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is only God that calls,<br/>
Missing me, seeking me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the road to nothing falls!
</p>
<p>
He will set His mighty feet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firmly on the sliding sand;<br/>
Like a little frightened bird<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will creep into His hand;
</p>
<p>
I will tell Him all my grief,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell Him all my sin;<br/>
He will give me half His robe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a cloak to wrap you in.
</p>
<p>
Lullabye&#151;lullabye&#151;"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocks the burnt-out planet free!&#151;<br/>
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach a hand and rescue me!
</p>
<p>
Ah, the voice of love at last!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo, at last the face of light!<br/>
And the whole of His white robe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a cloak against the night!
</p>
<p>
And upon my heart asleep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the things I ever knew!&#151;<br/>
"Holds Heaven not some cranny, Lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a flower so tall and blue?"
</p>
<p>
All's well and all's well!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gay the lights of Heaven show!<br/>
In some moist and Heavenly place<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will set it out to grow.

<h1>Concord Hymn</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<p>
By the rude bridge that arched the flood,<br/>
Their flag to Aprilâ€™s breeze unfurled,<br/>
Here once the embattled farmers stood<br/>
And fired the shot heard round the world.
</p>
<p>
The foe long since in silence slept;<br/>
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;<br/>
And Time the ruined bridge has swept<br/>
Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.
</p>
<p>
On this green bank, by this soft stream,<br/>
We set today a votive stone;<br/>
That memory may their deed redeem,<br/>
When, like our sires, our sons are gone.
</p>
<p>
Spirit, that made those heroes dare<br/>
To die, and leave their children free,<br/>
Bid Time and Nature gently spare<br/>
The shaft we raise to them and thee.
</p>

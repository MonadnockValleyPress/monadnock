<h1>The Snow-Storm</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<p>
Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,<br/>
Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,<br/>
Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air<br/>
Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven,<br/>
And veils the farm-house at the garden's end.<br/>
The sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet<br/>
Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit<br/>
Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed<br/>
In a tumultuous privacy of storm.
</p>
<p>
Come see the north wind's masonry.<br/>
Out of an unseen quarry<br/>
Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer<br/>
Curves his white bastions with projected roof<br/>
Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.<br/>
Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work<br/>
So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he<br/>
For number or proportion. Mockingly,<br/>
On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;<br/>
A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn;<br/>
Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall,<br/>
Maugre the farmer's sighs; and at the gate<br/>
A tapering turret overtops the work.<br/>
And when his hours are numbered, and the world<br/>
Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,<br/>
Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art<br/>
To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone,<br/>
Built in an age, the mad wind's night-work,<br/>
The frolic architecture of the snow.

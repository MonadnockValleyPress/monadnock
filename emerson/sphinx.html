<h1>The Sphinx</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<p>
The Sphinx is drowsy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her wings are furled:<br/>
Her ear is heavy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She broods on the world.<br/>
"Who'll tell me my secret,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ages have kept?&mdash;<br/>
I awaited the seer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While they slumbered and slept:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"The fate of the man-child,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of man;<br/>
Known fruit of the unknown;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Daedalian plan;<br/>
Out of sleeping a waking,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of waking a sleep;<br/>
Life death overtaking;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep underneath deep?
</p>
<p>
"Erect as a sunbeam,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upspringeth the palm;<br/>
The elephant browses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Undaunted and calm;<br/>
In beautiful motion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrush plies his wings;<br/>
Kind leaves of his covert,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your silence he sings.
</p>
<p>
"The waves, unashamèd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In difference sweet,<br/>
Play glad with the breezes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Old playfellows meet;<br/>
The journeying atoms,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Primordial wholes,<br/>
Firmly draw, firmly drive,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By their animate poles.
</p>
<p>
"Sea, earth, air, sound, silence.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plant, quadruped, bird,<br/>
By one music enchanted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One deity stirred,&mdash;<br/>
Each the other adorning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Accompany still;<br/>
Night veileth the morning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The vapor the hill.
</p>
<p>
"The babe by its mother<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies bathèd in joy;<br/>
Glide its hours uncounted,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is its toy;<br/>
Shines the peace of all being,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without cloud, in its eyes;<br/>
And the sum of the world<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In soft miniature lies.
</p>
<p>
"But man crouches and blushes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Absconds and conceals;<br/>
He creepeth and peepeth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He palters and steals;<br/>
Infirm, melancholy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous glancing around,<br/>
An oaf, an accomplice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He poisons the ground.
</p>
<p>
"Out spoke the great mother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beholding his fear;&mdash;<br/>
At the sound of her accents<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold shuddered the sphere:&mdash;<br/>
'Who has drugged my boy's cup?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has mixed my boy's bread?<br/>
Who, with sadness and madness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has turned my child's head?'"
</p>
<p>
I heard a poet answer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloud and cheerfully,<br/>
'Say on, sweet Sphinx! thy dirges<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are pleasant songs to me.<br/>
Deep love lieth under<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These pictures of time;<br/>
They fade in the light of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their meaning sublime.
</p>
<p>
"The fiend that man harries<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is love of the Best;<br/>
Yawns the pit of the Dragon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lit by rays from the Blest.<br/>
The Lethe of Nature<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't trance him again,<br/>
Whose soul sees the perfect,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which his eyes seek in vain.
</p>
<p>
"To vision profounder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Man's spirit must dive;<br/>
His aye-rolling orb<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At no goal will arrive;<br/>
The heavens that now draw him<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With sweetness untold,<br/>
Once found,&mdash;for new heavens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He spurneth the old.
</p>
<p>
"Pride ruined the angels,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shame them restores;<br/>
Lurks the joy that is sweetest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In stings of remorse.<br/>
Have I a lover<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is noble and free?&mdash;<br/>
I would he were nobler<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than to love me.
</p>
<p>
"Eterne alternation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now follows, now flies;<br/>
And under pain, pleasure,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under pleasure, pain lies.<br/>
Love works at the centre,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart-heaving alway;<br/>
Forth speed the strong pulses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the borders of day.
</p>
<p>
"Dull Sphinx, Jove keep thy five wits;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy sight is growing blear;<br/>
Rue, myrrh and cummin for the Sphinx,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her muddy eyes to clear!"<br/>
The old Sphinx bit her thick lip,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, "Who taught thee me to name?<br/>
I am thy spirit, yoke-fellow;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thine eye I am eyebeam.
</p>
<p>
"Thou art the unanswered question;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Couldst see thy proper eye,<br/>
Alway it asketh, asketh;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And each answer is a lie.<br/>
So take thy quest through nature,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It through thousand natures ply;<br/>
Ask on, thou clothed eternity;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is the false reply."
</p>
<p>
Uprose the merry Sphinx,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And crouched no more in stone;<br/>
She melted into purple cloud,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She silvered in the moon;<br/>
She spired into a yellow flame;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She flowered in blossoms red;<br/>
She flowed into a foaming wave:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood Monadnoc's head.
</p>
<p>
Thorough a thousand voices<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoke the universal dame;<br/>
"Who telleth one of my meanings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is master of all I am."

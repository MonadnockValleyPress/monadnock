<h1>The World-Soul</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<p>
Thanks to the morning light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the foaming sea,<br/>
To the uplands of New Hampshire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the green-haired forest free;<br/>
Thanks to each man of courage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the maids of holy mind,<br/>
To the boy with his games undaunted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who never looks behind.
</p>
<p>
Cities of proud hotels,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses of rich and great,<br/>
Vice nestles in your chambers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath your roofs of slate.<br/>
It cannot conquer folly,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time-and-space-conquering steam,&mdash;<br/>
And the light-outspeeding telegraph<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bears nothing on its beam.
</p>
<p>
The politics are base;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The letters do not cheer;<br/>
And 'tis far in the deeps of history,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice that speaketh clear.<br/>
Trade and the streets ensnare us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bodies are weak and worn;<br/>
We plot and corrupt each other,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we despoil the unborn.
</p>
<p>
Yet there in the parlor sits<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some figure of noble guise,&mdash;<br/>
Our angel, in a stranger's form,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or woman's pleading eyes;<br/>
Or only a flashing sunbeam<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In at the window-pane;<br/>
Or Music pours on mortals<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its beautiful disdain.
</p>
<p>
The inevitable morning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Finds them who in cellars be;<br/>
And be sure the all-loving Nature<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will smile in a factory.<br/>
Yon ridge of purple landscape,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yon sky between the walls,<br/>
Hold all the hidden wonders<br/>
In scanty intervals.
</p>
<p>
Alas! the Sprite that haunts us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deceives our rash desire;<br/>
It whispers of the glorious gods,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaves us in the mire.<br/>
We cannot learn the cipher<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That's writ upon our cell;<br/>
Stars taunt us by a mystery<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which we could never spell.
</p>
<p>
If but one hero knew it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world would blush in flame;<br/>
The sage, till he hit the secret,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would hang his head for shame.<br/>
Our brothers have not read it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one has found the key;<br/>
And henceforth we are comforted,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We are but such as they.
</p>
<p>
Still, still the secret presses;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearing clouds draw down;<br/>
The crimson morning flames into<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fopperies of the town.<br/>
Within, without the idle earth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars weave eternal rings;<br/>
The sun himself shines heartily,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shares the joy he brings.
</p>
<p>
And what if Trade sow cities<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like shells along the shore,<br/>
And thatch with towns the prairie broad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With railways ironed o'er?&mdash;<br/>
They are but sailing foam-bells<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along Thought's causing stream,<br/>
And take their shape and sun-color<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From him that sends the dream.
</p>
<p>
For Destiny never swerves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yields to men the helm;<br/>
He shoots his thought, by hidden nerves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the solid realm.<br/>
The patient Daemon sits,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With roses and a shroud;<br/>
He has his way, and deals his gifts,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But ours is not allowed.
</p>
<p>
He is no churl nor trifler,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his viceroy is none,&mdash;<br/>
Love-without-weakness,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Genius sire and son.<br/>
And his will is not thwarted;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The seeds of land and sea<br/>
Are the atoms of his body bright,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his behest obey.
</p>
<p>
He serveth the servant,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The brave he loves amain;<br/>
He kills the cripple and the sick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight begins again;<br/>
For gods delight in gods,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrust the weak aside;<br/>
To him who scorns their charities<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their arms fly open wide.
</p>
<p>
When the old world is sterile<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ages are effete,<br/>
He will from wrecks and sediment<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairer world complete.<br/>
He forbids to despair;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His cheeks mantle with mirth;<br/>
And the unimagined good of men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is yeaning at the birth.
</p>
<p>
Spring still makes spring in the mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When sixty years are told;<br/>
Love wakes anew this throbbing heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we are never old;<br/>
Over the winter glaciers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the summer glow,<br/>
And through the wild-piled snow-drift<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm rosebuds below.

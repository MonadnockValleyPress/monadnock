<h1>Monadnoc</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<p>
Thousand minstrels woke within me,<br />
"Our music's in the hills;"&#151;<br />
Gayest pictures rose to win me,<br />
Leopard-colored rills.<br />
Up!&#151;If thou knew'st who calls<br />
To twilight parks of beech and pine,<br />
High over the river intervals,<br />
Above the ploughman's highest line,<br />
Over the owner's farthest walls!<br />
Up! where the airy citadel<br />
O'erlooks the purging landscape's swell!<br />
Let not unto the stones the Day<br />
Her lily and rose, her sea and land display.<br />
Read the celestial sign!<br />
Lo! the South answers to the north;<br />
Bookworm break this sloth urbane;<br />
A greater spirit bids thee forth,<br />
Than the gray dreams which thee detain.<br />
Mark how the climbing Oreads<br />
Beckon thee to their arcades!<br />
Youth, for a moment free as they,<br />
Teach thy feet to feel the ground,<br />
Ere yet arrive the wintry day<br />
When Time thy feet has bound.<br />
Accept the bounty of thy birth;<br />
Taste the lordship of the earth."
</p>
<p>
I heard, and I obeyed,&#151;<br />
Assured that he who made the claim,<br />
Well-known, but loving not a name,<br />
Was not to be gainsaid.
</p>
<p>
Ere yet the summoning voice was still,<br />
I turned to Cheshire's haughty hill.<br />
From the fixed cone the cloud-rack flowed,<br />
Like ample banner flung abroad<br />
Round about, a hundred miles,<br />
With invitations to the sea, and to the bordering isles.
</p>
<p>
In his own loom's garment dressed,<br />
By his own bounty blessed,<br />
Fast abides this constant giver,<br />
Pouring many a cheerful river;<br />
To far eyes, an aerial isle,<br />
Unploughed, which finer spirits pile,<br />
Which morn and crimson evening paint<br />
For bard, for lover, and for saint;<br />
The country's core,<br />
Inspirer, prophet evermore;<br />
Pillar which God aloft had set<br />
So that men might it not forget,<br />
It should be their life's ornament,<br />
And mix itself with each event;<br />
Their calendar and dial,<br />
Barometer and chemic phial,<br />
Garden of berries, perch of birds,<br />
Pasture of pool-haunting herds,<br />
Graced by each change of sum untold,<br />
Earth-baking heat, stone-cleaving cold.
</p>
<p>
The Titan heeds his own affairs,<br />
Wide rents and high alliance shares;<br />
Mysteries of color daily laid<br />
By the great sun in light and shade,<br />
And sweet varieties of chance,<br />
And the mystic seasons' dance;<br />
And thief-like step of liberal hours<br />
Thawing the snow-drift into flowers.<br />
O, wondrous craft of plant and stone<br />
By eldest science done and shown!
</p>
<p>
"Happy," I said, "whose home is here,<br />
Fair fortunes to the mountaineer!<br />
Boon Nature to his poorest shed<br />
Has royal pleasure-grounds outspread."<br />
Intent, I searched the region round,<br />
And in low hut my monarch found.<br />
He was no eagle and no earl;&#151;<br />
Alas! my foundling was a churl,<br />
With heart of cat and eyes of bug,<br />
Dull victim of his pipe and mug.<br />
Woe is me for my hopes' downfall!<br />
Lord! is yon squalid peasant all<br />
That this proud nursery could breed<br />
For God's vicegerency and stead?<br />
Time out of mind, this forge of ores,<br />
Quarry of spars in mountain pores;<br />
Old cradle, hunting ground, and bier<br />
Of wolf and otter, bear and deer;<br />
Well-built abode of many a race;<br />
Tower of observance searching space;<br />
Factory of river and of rain;<br />
Link in the alps' globe-girding chain;<br />
By million changes skilled to tell<br />
What in the Eternal standeth well,<br />
And what obedient Nature can;&#151;<br />
Is this colossal talisman<br />
Kindly to creature, blood, and kind,<br />
And speechless to the master's mind?<br />
I thought to find the patriots<br />
In whom the stock of freedom roots:<br />
To myself I oft recount<br />
Tales of many a famous mount,&#151;<br />
Wales, Scotland, Uri, Hungary's dells;<br />
Roys, and Scanderbegs, and Tells.<br />
Here shall nature condense her powers,<br />
Her music, and her meteors,<br />
And, lifting man to the blue deep<br />
Where stars their perfect courses keep,<br />
Like wise perceptor lure his eye<br />
To sound the science of the sky,<br />
And carry learning to its height<br />
Of untried power and sane delight:<br />
The Indian cheer, the frosty skies,<br />
Breed purer wits, inventive eyes,&#151;<br />
Eyes that frame cities where none be,<br />
And hands that stablish what these see;<br />
And, by the moral of his place,<br />
Hint summits of heroic grace;<br />
Man in these crags a fastness find<br />
To fight pollution of the mind;<br />
In the wide thaw and ooze of wrong,<br />
Adhere like this foundation strong,<br />
The insanity of towns to stem<br />
With simpleness for stratagem.<br />
But if brave old mould is broke,<br />
And end in churls the mountain folk,<br />
In tavern cheer and tavern joke,&#151;<br />
Sink, O mountain, in the swamp!<br />
Hide in thy skies, O sovereign lamp!<br />
Perish like leaves, the highland breed!<br />
No sire survive, no son succeed!
</p>
<p>
Soft! let not the offended muse<br />
Toil's hard hap with scorn accuse.<br />
Many hamlets sought I then,<br />
Many farms of mountain men;<br />
Found I not a minstrel seed,<br />
But men of bone, and good at need.<br />
Rallying round a parish steeple<br />
Nestle warm the highland people,<br />
Course and boisterous, yet mild,<br />
Strong as giant, slow as child,<br />
Smoking in a squalid room,<br />
Where yet the westland breezes come.<br />
Close hid in those rough guises lurk<br />
Western magicians &#151; here they work.<br />
Sweat and season are their arts,<br />
Their talismans are ploughs and carts;<br />
And well the youngest can command<br />
Honey from the frozen land;<br />
With sweet hay the wild swamp adorn,<br />
Change the running sand to corn;<br />
For wolves and foxes, lowing herds,<br />
And for cold mosses, cream and curds;<br />
Weave wood to canisters and mats;<br />
Drain sweet maple-juice in vats.<br />
No bird is safe that cuts the air<br />
From their rifle or their snare;<br />
No fish, in river or in lake,<br />
But their long hands it thence will take;<br />
And the country's iron face,<br />
Like wax, their fashioning skill betrays,<br />
To fill the hollows, sink the hills,<br />
Bridge gulfs, drain swamps, build dams and mills,<br />
And fit the bleak and howling place<br />
For gardens of a finer race.<br />
The World-soul knows his own affair,<br />
Forelooking, when his hands prepare<br />
For the next ages, men of mould,<br />
Well embodied, well ensouled,<br />
He cools the present's fiery glow,<br />
Sets the life-pulse strong but slow:<br />
Bitter winds and fasts austere<br />
His quarantines and grottos, where<br />
He slowly cures decrepit flesh,<br />
And brings it infantile and fresh.<br />
These exercises are the toys<br />
And games with which he breathes his boys:<br />
They bide their time, and well can prove,<br />
If need were, their line from Jove;<br />
Of the same stuff, and so allayed,<br />
As that whereof the sun is made,<br />
And of that fibre, quick and strong,<br />
Whose throbs are love, whose thrills are song.
</p>
<p>
Now in sordid weeds they sleep,<br />
Their secret now in dulness keep;<br />
Yet, will you learn our ancient speech,<br />
These the masters who can teach.<br />
Fourscore or a hundred words<br />
All their vocal muse affords;<br />
These they turn in other fashion<br />
Than the writer or the parson.<br />
I can spare the college-bell,<br />
And the learned lecture, well;<br />
Spare the clergy and libraries,<br />
Institutes and dictionaries,<br />
For the hardy English root<br />
Thrives here, unvalued, underfoot.<br />
Rude poets of the tavern hearth,<br />
Squandering your unquoted mirth,<br />
Which keeps the ground, and never soars,<br />
While Jake retorts, and Reuben roars;<br />
Tough and screaming, as birch-bark,<br />
Goes like a bullet to its mark,<br />
While the solid curse and jeer<br />
Never balk the waiting ear.<br />
To student ears the keen relished jokes<br />
On truck, and stock, and farming-folks,&#151;<br />
Nought the mountain yields thereof<br />
But savage health and sinews tough.
</p>
<p>
On the summit as I stood,<br />
O'er the wide floor of plain and flood,<br />
Seemed to me, the towering hill<br />
Was not altogether still,<br />
But a quiet sense conveyed;<br />
If I err not, thus it said:&#151;
</p>
<p>
"Many feet in summer seek,<br />
Betimes, my far-appearing peak;<br />
In the dreaded winter time,<br />
None save dappling shadows climb,<br />
Under clouds, my lonely head,<br />
Old as the sun, old almost as the shade.<br />
And comest thou<br />
To see strange forests and new snow,<br />
And tread uplifted land?<br />
And leavest thou thy lowland race,<br />
Here amid clouds to stand?<br />
And would'st be my companion,<br />
Where I gaze,<br />
And shall gaze,<br />
When forests fall, and man is gone,<br />
Over tribes and over times,<br />
As the burning Lyre,<br />
Nearing me,<br />
With its stars of northern fire,<br />
In many a thousand years?
</p>
<p>
"Ah! welcome, if thou bring<br />
My secret in my brain;<br />
To mountain-top may Muse's wing<br />
With good allowance strain.<br />
Gentle pilgrim, if though know<br />
The gamut old of Pan,<br />
And how the hills began,<br />
The frank blessings of the hill<br />
Fall on thee, as fall they will.<br />
'Tis the law of bush and stone,<br />
Each can only take his own.
</p>
<p>
"Let him heed who can and will;<br />
Enchantment fixed me here<br />
To stand the hurts of time, until<br />
In mightier chant I disappear.<br />
If thou trowest<br />
How the chemic eddies play,<br />
Pole to pole, and what they say;<br />
And that these gray crags<br />
Not on crags are hung,<br />
But beads are of a rosary<br />
On prayer and music strung;<br />
And, credulous, through the granite seeming,<br />
Seest the smile of Reason beaming; &#151; <br />
Can thy style-discerning eye<br />
The hidden-working Builder spy,<br />
Who builds, yet makes no chips, no din,<br />
With hammer soft as snowflake's flight;&#151;<br />
Knowest thou this?<br />
O pilgrim, wandering not amiss!<br />
Already my rocks lie light,<br />
And soon my cone will spin.
</p>
<p>
"For the world was built in order,<br />
And the atoms march in tune;<br />
Rhyme the pipe, and Time the warder,<br />
Cannot forget the sun, the moon.<br />
Orb and atom forth they prance,<br />
When they hear from far the rune;<br />
None so backward in the troop,<br />
When the music and the dance<br />
Reach his place and circumstance,<br />
But knows the sun-creating sound,<br />
And, though a pyramid, will bound.
</p>
<p>
"Monadnoc is a mountain strong,<br />
Tall and good my kind among;<br />
But well I know, no mountain can<br />
Measure with a perfect man.<br />
For it is on temples writ,<br />
Adamant is soft to wit:<br />
And when the greater comes again<br />
With my secret in his brain,<br />
I shall pass, as glides my shadow<br />
Daily over hill and meadow.
</p>
<p>
"Through all time,<br />
I heard the approaching feet<br />
Along the flinty pathway beat<br />
Of him that cometh, and shall come;<br />
Of him who shall as lightly bear<br />
My daily load of woods and streams,<br />
As doth this round sky-cleaving boat<br />
Which never strains its rocky beams;<br />
Whose timbers, as they silent float,<br />
Alps and Caucasus uprear,<br />
And the long Alleghanies here,<br />
And all town-sprinkled lands that be,<br />
Sailing through stars with all their history.
</p>
<p>
"Every morn I lift my head,<br />
Gaze o'er New England underspread,<br />
South from Saint Lawrence to the Sound,<br />
From Katskill east to the sea-bound.<br />
Anchored fast for many an age,<br />
I await the bard and sage,<br />
Who, in large thoughts, like fair pearl-seed,<br />
Shall string Monadnoc like a bead.<br />
Comes that cheerful troubadour,<br />
This mound shall throb his face before,<br />
As when, with inward fires and pain,<br />
It rose a bubble from the plain.<br />
When he cometh, I shall shed,<br />
From this wellspring in my head,<br />
Fountain drop of spicier worth<br />
Than all the vintage of the earth.<br />
There's fruit upon my barren soil<br />
Costlier far than wine or oil.<br />
There's a berry blue and gold,&#151;<br />
Autumn-ripe, its juices hold<br />
Sparta's stoutness, Bethlehem's heart,<br />
Asia's rancor, Athens' art,<br />
Slowsure Britain's secular might,<br />
And the German's inward sight.<br />
I will give my son to eat<br />
Best of Pan's immortal meat,<br />
Bread to eat, and juice to drink;<br />
So the thoughts that he shall think<br />
Shall not be forms of stars, but stars,<br />
Nor pictures pale, but Jove and Mars.<br />
He comes, but not of that race bred<br />
Who daily climb my specular head.<br />
Oft as morning wreathes my scarf,<br />
Fled the last plumule of the Dark,<br />
Pants up hither the spruce clerk<br />
From South Cove and City Wharf.<br />
I take him up my ragged sides,<br />
Half-repentant, scant of breath,&#151;<br />
Bead-eyes my granite chaos show,<br />
And my midsummer snow;<br />
Open the daunting map beneath,&#151;<br />
All his county, sea and land,<br />
Dwarf to measure of his hand;<br />
His day's ride is a furlong space,<br />
His city tops a glimmering haze.<br />
I plant his eye on the sky-hoop bounding:<br />
"See there the grim gray rounding<br />
Of the bullet of the earth<br />
Whereon ye sail,<br />
Tumbling steep<br />
In the uncontinented deep."<br />
He looks on that, and he turns pale.<br />
"'Tis even so; this treacherous kite,<br />
Farm-furrowed, town-incrusted sphere,<br />
Thoughtless of its anxious freight,<br />
Plunges eyeless on forever;<br />
And he, poor parasite,<br />
Cooped in a ship he cannot steer,<br />
Who is the captain he knows not,<br />
Port or pilot trows not,&#151;<br />
Risk or ruin he must share.<br />
I scowl on him with my cloud,<br />
With my north wind chill his blood;<br />
I lame him, clattering down the rocks;<br />
And to live he is in fear.<br />
Then, at last, I let him down<br />
Once more into his dapper town,<br />
To chatter, frightened, to his clan,<br />
And forget me, if he can."
</p>
<p>
As in the old poetic fame<br />
The gods are blind and lame,<br />
And the simular despite<br />
Betrays the more abounding might,<br />
So call not waste that barren cone<br />
Above the floral zone,<br />
Where forests starve:<br />
It is pure use;<br />
What sheaves like those which here we glean and bind<br />
Of a celestial Ceres and the Muse?
</p>
<p>
Ages are thy days,<br />
Thou grand expressor of the present tense,<br />
And type of permanence!<br />
Firm ensign of the fatal Being,<br />
Amid these coward shapes of joy and grief,<br />
That will not bide the seeing!
</p>
<p>
Hither we bring<br />
Our insect miseries to the rocks;<br />
And the whole flight with pestering wing<br />
Vanish, and end their murmuring,&#151;<br />
Vanish beside these dedicated blocks,<br />
Which; who can tell what mason laid?<br />
Spoils of a front none need restore,<br />
Replacing frieze and architrave;<br />
Yet flowers each stone rosette and metope brave;<br />
Still is the haughty pile erect<br />
Of the old building Intellect.
</p>
<p>
Complement of human kind,<br />
Having us at vantage still,<br />
Our sumptuous indigence,<br />
O barren mound, thy plenties fill!<br />
We fool and prate;<br />
Thou art silent and sedate.<br />
To million kinds and times one sense<br />
The constant mountain both dispense;<br />
Shedding on all its snows and leaves,<br />
One joy it joys, one grief it grieves.<br />
Thou seest, O watchman tall,<br />
Our towns and races grow and fall,<br />
And imagest the stable good<br />
For which we all our lifetime grope,<br />
In shifting form the formless mind,<br />
And though the substance us elude,<br />
We in thee the shadow find.<br />
Thou, in our astronomy<br />
An opaker star,<br />
Seen haply from afar,<br />
Above the horizon's hoop,<br />
A moment, by the railway troop,<br />
As o'er some bolder height they speed,&#151;<br />
By circumspect ambition,<br />
By errant gain,<br />
By feasters, and the frivolous,&#151;<br />
Recallest us,<br />
And makest sane.<br />
Mute orator! well skilled to plead,<br />
And send conviction without phrase,<br />
Thou dost supply<br />
The shortness of our days,<br />
And promise, on thy Founder's truth,<br />
Long morrow to this mortal youth.

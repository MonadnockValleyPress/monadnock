<h1>Walden</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<p>
In my garden three ways meet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice the spot is blest;<br/>
Hermit-thrush comes there to build,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrier-doves to nest.
</p>
<p>
There broad-armed oaks, the copses' maze,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold sea-wind detain;<br/>
Here sultry Summer overstays<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When Autumn chills the plain.
</p>
<p>
Self-sown my stately garden grows;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The winds and wind-blown seed,<br/>
Cold April rain and colder snows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My hedges plant and feed.
</p>
<p>
From mountains far and valleys near<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvests sown to-day<br/>
Thrive in all weathers without fear,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild planters, plant away!
</p>
<p>
In cities high the careful crowds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of woe-worn mortals darkling go,<br/>
But in these sunny solitudes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My quiet roses blow.
</p>
<p>
Methought the sky looked scornful down<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On all was base in man,<br/>
And airy tongues did taunt the town,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Achieve our peace who can!'
</p>
<p>
What need I holier dew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Walden's haunted wave,<br/>
Distilled from heaven's alembic blue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Steeped in each forest cave?
</p>
<p>
[If Thought unlock her mysteries,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If Friendship on me smile,<br/>
I walk in marble galleries,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I talk with kings the while.]
</p>
<p>
How drearily in College hall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Doctor stretched the hours,<br/>
But in each pause we heard the call<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of robins out of doors.
</p>
<p>
The air is wise, the wind thinks well,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all through which it blows,<br/>
If plants or brain, if egg or shell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or bird or biped knows;
</p>
<p>
And oft at home 'mid tasks I heed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I heed how wears the day;<br/>
We must not halt while fiercely speed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The spans of life away.
</p>
<p>
What boots it here of Thebes or Rome<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lands of Eastern day?<br/>
In forests I am still at home<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there I cannot stray.

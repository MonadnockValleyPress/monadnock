<h1>Waldeinsamkeit</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<p>
I do not count the hours I spend<br/>
In wandering by the sea;<br/>
The forest is my loyal friend,<br/>
Like God it useth me.
</p>
<p>
In plains that room for shadows make<br/>
Of skirting hills to lie,<br/>
Bound in by streams which give and take<br/>
Their colors from the sky;
</p>
<p>
Or on the mountain-crest sublime,<br/>
Or down the oaken glade,<br/>
O what have I to do with time?<br/>
For this the day was made.
</p>
<p>
Cities of mortals woe-begone<br/>
Fantastic care derides,<br/>
But in the serious landscape lone<br/>
Stern benefit abides.
</p>
<p>
Sheen will tarnish, honey cloy,<br/>
And merry is only a mask of sad,<br/>
But, sober on a fund of joy,<br/>
The woods at heart are glad.
</p>
<p>
There the great Planter plants<br/>
Of fruitful worlds the grain,<br/>
And with a million spells enchants<br/>
The souls that walk in pain.
</p>
<p>
Still on the seeds of all he made<br/>
The rose of beauty burns;<br/>
Through times that wear and forms that fade,<br/>
Immortal youth returns.
</p>
<p>
The black ducks mounting from the lake,<br/>
The pigeon in the pines,<br/>
The bittern's boom, a desert make<br/>
Which no false art refines.
</p>
<p>
Down in yon watery nook,<br/>
Where bearded mists divide,<br/>
The gray old gods whom Chaos knew,<br/>
The sires of Nature, hide.
</p>
<p>
Aloft, in secret veins of air,<br/>
Blows the sweet breath of song,<br/>
O, few to scale those uplands dare,<br/>
Though they to all belong!
</p>
<p>
See thou bring not to field or stone<br/>
The fancies found in books;<br/>
Leave authors' eyes, and fetch your own,<br/>
To brave the landscape's looks.
</p>
<p>
Oblivion here thy wisdom is,<br/>
Thy thrift, the sleep of cares;<br/>
For a proud idleness like this<br/>
Crowns all thy mean affairs.
</p>

<h1>My Garden</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<p>
If I could put my woods in song<br/>
And tell what's there enjoyed,<br/>
All men would to my gardens throng,<br/>
And leave the cities void.
</p>
<p>
In my plot no tulips blow,&mdash;<br/>
Snow-loving pines and oaks instead;<br/>
And rank the savage maples grow<br/>
From Spring's faint flush to Autumn red.
</p>
<p>
My garden is a forest ledge<br/>
Which older forests bound;<br/>
The banks slope down to the blue lake-edge,<br/>
Then plunge to depths profound.
</p>
<p>
Here once the Deluge ploughed,<br/>
Laid the terraces, one by one;<br/>
Ebbing later whence it flowed,<br/>
They bleach and dry in the sun.
</p>
<p>
The sowers made haste to depart,&mdash;<br/>
The wind and the birds which sowed it;<br/>
Not for fame, nor by rules of art,<br/>
Planted these, and tempests flowed it.
</p>
<p>
Waters that wash my garden-side<br/>
Play not in Nature's lawful web,<br/>
They heed not moon or solar tide,&mdash;<br/>
Five years elapse from flood to ebb.
</p>
<p>
Hither hasted, in old time, Jove,<br/>
And every god,&mdash;none did refuse;<br/>
And be sure at last came Love,<br/>
And after Love, the Muse.
</p>
<p>
Keen ears can catch a syllable,<br/>
As if one spake to another,<br/>
In the hemlocks tall, untamable,<br/>
And what the whispering grasses smother.
</p>
<p>
Aeolian harps in the pine<br/>
Ring with the song of the Fates;<br/>
Infant Bacchus in the vine,&mdash;<br/>
Far distant yet his chorus waits.
</p>
<p>
Canst thou copy in verse one chime<br/>
Of the wood-bell's peal and cry,<br/>
Write in a book the morning's prime,<br/>
Or match with words that tender sky?
</p>
<p>
Wonderful verse of the gods,<br/>
Of one import, of varied tone;<br/>
They chant the bliss of their abodes<br/>
To man imprisoned in his own.
</p>
<p>
Ever the words of the gods resound;<br/>
But the porches of man's ear<br/>
Seldom in this low life's round<br/>
Are unsealed that he may hear.
</p>
<p>
Wandering voices in the air<br/>
And murmurs in the wold<br/>
Speak what I cannot declare,<br/>
Yet cannot all withhold.
</p>
<p>
When the shadow fell on the lake,<br/>
The whirlwind in ripples wrote<br/>
Air-bells of fortune that shine and break,<br/>
And omens above thought.
</p>
<p>
But the meanings cleave to the lake,<br/>
Cannot be carried in book or urn;<br/>
Go thy ways now, come later back,<br/>
On waves and hedges still they burn.
</p>
<p>
These the fates of men forecast,<br/>
Of better men than live to-day;<br/>
If who can read them comes at last<br/>
He will spell in the sculpture, 'Stay.'

<h1>Astraea</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<p>
Each the herald is who wrote<br/>
His rank, and quartered his own coat.<br/>
There is no king nor sovereign state<br/>
That can fix a hero's rate;<br/>
Each to all is venerable,<br/>
Cap-a-pie invulnerable,<br/>
Until he write, where all eyes rest,<br/>
Slave or master on his breast.<br/>
I saw men go up and down,<br/>
In the country and the town,<br/>
With this tablet on their neck,<br/>
'Judgment and a judge we seek.'<br/>
Not to monarchs they repair,<br/>
Nor to learned jurist's chair;<br/>
But they hurry to their peers,<br/>
To their kinsfolk and their dears;<br/>
Louder than with speech they pray,&mdash;<br/>
'What am I? companion, say.'<br/>
And the friend not hesitates<br/>
To assign just place and mates;<br/>
Answers not in word or letter,<br/>
Yet is understood the better;<br/>
Each to each a looking-glass,<br/>
Reflects his figure that doth pass.<br/>
Every wayfarer he meets<br/>
What himself declared repeats,<br/>
What himself confessed records,<br/>
Sentences him in his words;<br/>
The form is his own corporal form,<br/>
And his thought the penal worm.<br/>
Yet shine forever virgin minds,<br/>
Loved by stars and purest winds,<br/>
Which, o'er passion throned sedate,<br/>
Have not hazarded their state;<br/>
Disconcert the searching spy,<br/>
Rendering to a curious eye<br/>
The durance of a granite ledge.<br/>
To those who gaze from the sea's edge<br/>
It is there for benefit;<br/>
It is there for purging light;<br/>
There for purifying storms;<br/>
And its depths reflect all forms;<br/>
It cannot parley with the mean,&mdash;<br/>
Pure by impure is not seen.<br/>
For there's no sequestered grot,<br/>
Lone mountain tarn, or isle forgot,<br/>
But Justice, journeying in the sphere,<br/>
Daily stoops to harbor there.

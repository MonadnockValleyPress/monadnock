<h1>Two Rivers</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<p>
Thy summer voice, Musketaquit,<br/>
Repeats the music of the rain;<br/>
But sweeter rivers pulsing flit<br/>
Through thee, as thou through Concord Plain.
</p>
<p>
Thou in thy narrow banks art pent:<br/>
The stream I love unbounded goes<br/>
Through flood and sea and firmament;<br/>
Through light, through life, it forward flows.
</p>
<p>
I see the inundation sweet,<br/>
I hear the spending of the stream<br/>
Through years, through men, through Nature fleet,<br/>
Through love and thought, through power and dream.
</p>
<p>
Musketaquit, a goblin strong,<br/>
Of shard and flint makes jewels gay;<br/>
They lose their grief who hear his song,<br/>
And where he winds is the day of day.
</p>
<p>
So forth and brighter fares my stream,&mdash;<br/>
Who drink it shall not thirst again;<br/>
No darkness stains its equal gleam.<br/>
And ages drop in it like rain.
</p>

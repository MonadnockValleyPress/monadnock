<h1>Woodnotes I</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<h3>1</h3>
<p>
When the pine tosses its cones<br/>
To the song of its waterfall tones,<br/>
Who speeds to the woodland walks?<br/>
To birds and trees who talks?<br/>
Caesar of his leafy Rome,<br/>
There the poet is at home.<br/>
He goes to the river-side,&mdash;<br/>
Not hook nor line hath he;<br/>
He stands in the meadows wide,&mdash;<br/>
Nor gun nor scythe to see.<br/>
Sure some god his eye enchants:<br/>
What he knows nobody wants.<br/>
In the wood he travels glad,<br/>
Without better fortune had,<br/>
Melancholy without bad.<br/>
Knowledge this man prizes best<br/>
Seems fantastic to the rest:<br/>
Pondering shadows, colors, clouds,<br/>
Grass-buds and caterpillar-shrouds,<br/>
Boughs on which the wild bees settle,<br/>
Tints that spot the violet's petal,<br/>
Why Nature loves the number five,<br/>
And why the star-form she repeats:<br/>
Lover of all things alive,<br/>
Wonderer at all he meets,<br/>
Wonderer chiefly at himself,<br/>
Who can tell him what he is?<br/>
Or how meet in human elf<br/>
Coming and past eternities?

<p>
And such I knew, a forest seer,<br/>
A minstrel of the natural year,<br/>
Foreteller of the vernal ides,<br/>
Wise harbinger of spheres and tides,<br/>
A lover true, who knew by heart<br/>
Each joy the mountain dales impart;<br/>
It seemed that Nature could not raise<br/>
A plant in any secret place,<br/>
In quaking bog, on snowy hill,<br/>
Beneath the grass that shades the rill,<br/>
Under the snow, between the rocks,<br/>
In damp fields known to bird and fox.<br/>
But he would come in the very hour<br/>
It opened in its virgin bower,<br/>
As if a sunbeam showed the place,<br/>
And tell its long-descended race.<br/>
It seemed as if the breezes brought him,<br/>
It seemed as if the sparrows taught him;<br/>
As if by secret sight he knew<br/>
Where, in far fields, the orchis grew.<br/>
Many haps fall in the field<br/>
Seldom seen by wishful eyes,<br/>
But all her shows did Nature yield,<br/>
To please and win this pilgrim wise.<br/>
He saw the partridge drum in the woods;<br/>
He heard the woodcock's evening hymn;<br/>
He found the tawny thrushes' broods;<br/>
And the shy hawk did wait for him;<br/>
What others did at distance hear,<br/>
And guessed within the thicket's gloom,<br/>
Was shown to this philosopher,<br/>
And at his bidding seemed to come.

<p>
In unploughed Maine he sought the lumberers' gang<br/>
Where from a hundred lakes young rivers sprang;<br/>
He trode the unplanted forest floor, whereon<br/>
The all-seeing sun for ages hath not shone;<br/>
Where feeds the moose, and walks the surly bear,<br/>
And up the tall mast runs the woodpecker.<br/>
He saw beneath dim aisles, in odorous beds,<br/>
The slight Linnaea hang its twin-born heads,<br/>
And blessed the monument of the man of flowers,<br/>
Which breathes his sweet fame through the northern bowers.<br/>
He heard, when in the grove, at intervals,<br/>
With sudden roar the aged pine-tree falls,&mdash;<br/>
One crash, the death-hymn of the perfect tree,<br/>
Declares the close of its green century.<br/>
Low lies the plant to whose creation went<br/>
Sweet influence from every element;<br/>
Whose living towers the years conspired to build,<br/>
Whose giddy top the morning loved to gild.<br/>
Through these green tents, by eldest Nature dressed,<br/>
He roamed, content alike with man and beast.<br/>
Where darkness found him he lay glad at night;<br/>
There the red morning touched him with its light.<br/>
Three moons his great heart him a hermit made,<br/>
So long he roved at will the boundless shade.<br/>
The timid it concerns to ask their way,<br/>
And fear what foe in caves and swamps can stray,<br/>
To make no step until the event is known,<br/>
And ills to come as evils past bemoan.<br/>
Not so the wise; no coward watch he keeps<br/>
To spy what danger on his pathway creeps;<br/>
Go where he will, the wise man is at home,<br/>
His hearth the earth,&mdash;his hall the azure dome;<br/>
Where his clear spirit leads him, there's his road<br/>
By God's own light illumined and foreshowed.

<p>
'T was one of the charm√®d days<br/>
When the genius of God doth flow;<br/>
The wind may alter twenty ways,<br/>
A tempest cannot blow;<br/>
It may blow north, it still is warm;<br/>
Or south, it still is clear;<br/>
Or east, it smells like a clover-farm;<br/>
Or west, no thunder fear.<br/>
The musing peasant, lowly great,<br/>
Beside the forest water sate;<br/>
The rope-like pine-roots crosswise grown<br/>
Composed the network of his throne;<br/>
The wide lake, edged with sand and grass,<br/>
Was burnished to a floor of glass,<br/>
Painted with shadows green and proud<br/>
Of the tree and of the cloud.<br/>
He was the heart of all the scene;<br/>
On him the sun looked more serene;<br/>
To hill and cloud his face was known,&mdash;<br/>
It seemed the likeness of their own;<br/>
They knew by secret sympathy<br/>
The public child of earth and sky.<br/>
'You ask,' he said, 'what guide<br/>
Me through trackless thickets led,<br/>
Through thick-stemmed woodlands rough and wide.<br/>
I found the water's bed.<br/>
The watercourses were my guide;<br/>
I travelled grateful by their side,<br/>
Or through their channel dry;<br/>
They led me through the thicket damp,<br/>
Through brake and fern, the beavers' camp,<br/>
Through beds of granite cut my road,<br/>
And their resistless friendship showed.<br/>
The falling waters led me,<br/>
The foodful waters fed me,<br/>
And brought me to the lowest land,<br/>
Unerring to the ocean sand.<br/>
The moss upon the forest bark<br/>
Was pole-star when the night was dark;<br/>
The purple berries in the wood<br/>
Supplied me necessary food;<br/>
For Nature ever faithful is<br/>
To such as trust her faithfulness.<br/>
When the forest shall mislead me,<br/>
When the night and morning lie,<br/>
When sea and land refuse to feed me,<br/>
'T will be time enough to die;<br/>
Then will yet my mother yield<br/>
A pillow in her greenest field,<br/>
Nor the June flowers scorn to cover<br/>
The clay of their departed lover.'

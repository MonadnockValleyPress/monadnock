<h1>The Humble-Bee</h1>
<h2>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</h2>
<p>
Burly, dozing humble-bee,<br/>
Where thou art is clime for me.<br/>
Let them sail for Porto Rique,<br/>
Far-off heats through seas to seek;<br/>
I will follow thee alone,<br/>
Thou animated torrid-zone!<br/>
Zigzag steerer, desert cheerer,<br/>
Let me chase thy waving lines;<br/>
Keep me nearer, me thy hearer,<br/>
Singing over shrubs and vines.
</p>
<p>
Insect lover of the sun,<br/>
Joy of thy dominion!<br/>
Sailor of the atmosphere;<br/>
Swimmer through the waves of air;<br/>
Voyager of light and noon;<br/>
Epicurean of June;<br/>
Wait, I prithee, till I come<br/>
Within earshot of thy hum,&mdash;<br/>
All without is martyrdom.
</p>
<p>
When the south wind, in May days,<br/>
With a net of shining haze<br/>
Silvers the horizon wall,<br/>
And with softness touching all,<br/>
Tints the human countenance<br/>
With a color of romance,<br/>
And infusing subtle heats,<br/>
Turns the sod to violets,<br/>
Thou, in sunny solitudes,<br/>
Rover of the underwoods,<br/>
The green silence dost displace<br/>
With thy mellow, breezy bass.
</p>
<p>
Hot midsummer's petted crone,<br/>
Sweet to me thy drowsy tone<br/>
Tells of countless sunny hours,<br/>
Long days, and solid banks of flowers;<br/>
Of gulfs of sweetness without bound<br/>
In Indian wildernesses found;<br/>
Of Syrian peace, immortal leisure,<br/>
Firmest cheer, and bird-like pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Aught unsavory or unclean<br/>
Hath my insect never seen;<br/>
But violets and bilberry bells,<br/>
Maple-sap and daffodels,<br/>
Grass with green flag half-mast high,<br/>
Succory to match the sky,<br/>
Columbine with horn of honey,<br/>
Scented fern, and agrimony,<br/>
Clover, catchfly, adder's-tongue<br/>
And brier-roses, dwelt among;<br/>
All beside was unknown waste,<br/>
All was picture as he passed.
</p>
<p>
Wiser far than human seer,<br/>
Yellow-breeched philosopher!<br/>
Seeing only what is fair,<br/>
Sipping only what is sweet,<br/>
Thou dost mock at fate and care,<br/>
Leave the chaff, and take the wheat.<br/>
When the fierce northwestern blast<br/>
Cools sea and land so far and fast,<br/>
Thou already slumberest deep;<br/>
Woe and want thou canst outsleep;<br/>
Want and woe, which torture us,<br/>
Thy sleep makes ridiculous.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 50th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Stella, the fulnes of my thoughts of thee<br/>
Cannot be stayed within my panting brest:<br/>
But they do swell and struggle forth of me,<br/>
Till that in words thy figure be exprest;<br/>
And yet as soone as they so formed be,<br/>
According to my Lord Loves owne behest,<br/>
With sad eyes I their weake proportion see<br/>
To portract what within this world is best.<br/>
So that I cannot chuse but write my minde,<br/>
And cannot chuse but put out what I write,<br/>
While those poore babes their death in birth doe find;<br/>
And now my penne these lynes had dashed quite,<br/>
But that they stop his furie from the same:<br/>
Because their fore-front beares sweet Stellas name.

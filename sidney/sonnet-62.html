<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 62nd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Late tyr’d with woe, even ready for to pine<br/>
With rage of love, I call my Love unkinde.<br/>
Shee in whose eyes, love though unfelt doth shine,<br/>
Sweetely saide, I true love in her should finde.<br/>
I joyed, but straight thus watred was my wine:<br/>
That love she did, but with a love not blinde.<br/>
Which would not let me, whome she lov’d decline.<br/>
From Nobler course, fit for my birth and minde.<br/>
And therefore her loves Authoritie;<br/>
Wild me those Tempests of vaine love to flee:<br/>
And Anchor fast my selfe on vertues shore.<br/>
Alas if this the onely mettall be,<br/>
Of love newe coyn’d to help my beggery:<br/>
Deere, love me not, that you may love me more.

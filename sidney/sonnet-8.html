<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 8th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Love borne in Greece, of late fled from his native place,<br/>
Forst by a tedious proofe, that Turkish hardned hart<br/>
Were no fit marke, to pearce with his fine pointed dart:<br/>
And pleasd with our lost peace, staide here his fleeting race.<br/>
But finding these North climes, too coldlie him imbrace,<br/>
Not usde to frosen clippes, he strave to finde some part<br/>
Where with most ease and warmth, he might imploy his art.<br/>
At length he preach’d himselfe in Stellas joyfull face,<br/>
Whose faire skinne, beamie eyes, like morning Sunne on snow:<br/>
Deceiv’d the quaking boy, who thought from so pure light,<br/>
Effects of livelie heate must needes in nature growe.<br/>
But shee most faire, most colde; made him thence take his flight<br/>
To my close hart; where while some fire brands he did lay,<br/>
He burnt unwares his wings, and cannot fly away.

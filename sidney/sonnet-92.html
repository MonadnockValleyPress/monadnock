<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 92nd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Be your words made (good sir) of Indean ware,<br/>
That you allowe them mee by so small rate,<br/>
Or do you cutted Spartanes imitate,<br/>
Or do you meane my tender eares to spare?<br/>
That to my questions you so totall are?<br/>
When I demaund of Ph≈ìnix Stellas state,<br/>
You say (forsooth) you left her well of late<br/>
O God, thinke you that satisfies my care?<br/>
I would know whether shee did sit or walke.<br/>
How cloathd: how waited on: sighd shee or smilde:<br/>
Whereof: with whome: how often did shee talke:<br/>
With what pastimes, times jorneys shee beguild?<br/>
If her lips daine to sweeten my poore name?<br/>
Saie all: and all well said: still say the same.

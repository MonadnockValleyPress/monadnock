<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 101st Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Stella is sicke, and in that sick-bed lyes<br/>
Sweetenes, that breathes and pants as oft as shee:<br/>
And Grace sicke too, such fine conclusions tries,<br/>
That sicknes brings it selfe best grac’d to bee.<br/>
Beautie is sicke, but sicke in such faire guise,<br/>
That in that palenes Beauties white we see,<br/>
And Joy which is unsever’d from those eyes.<br/>
Stella now learnes, (strange case) to weepe with me,<br/>
Love moves thy paine and like a faithful page,<br/>
As thy looks sturre, runs up and downe to make<br/>
All folkes prest at thy wil thy paine to swage,<br/>
Nature with care seeks for his darlings sake,<br/>
Knowing worlds passe, ere she enough can finde<br/>
Of such heaven stuffe to cloath so heavenly minde.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 45th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Stella oft sees the verie face of woes<br/>
Painted in my beclowded stormie face:<br/>
But cannot skill to pittie my disgrace;<br/>
No though thereof the cause her selfe shee knowes.<br/>
Yet hearing late a fable which did show,<br/>
Of Lovers never knowne, (a grievous case)<br/>
Pittie thereof got in her breast such place,<br/>
As from her eyes, a Spring of teares did flow.<br/>
Alas, if Fancie drawne by ymag’d things,<br/>
Though false, yet with free scope more grace doth breede<br/>
Then Servants wreck, where new doubts honor brings,<br/>
Than thinke my Deere, that in me you doe reede<br/>
Of Lovers ruine some thrise sad Tragædie:<br/>
I am not I, pittie the tale of me.

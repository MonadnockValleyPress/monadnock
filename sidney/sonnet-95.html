<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 95th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Yet sighes, deare sighes, in deede true friends you are,<br/>
That do not leave your least friend at the wurst:<br/>
But as you with my brest I oft have nurst:<br/>
So gratefull now you wait upon my care.<br/>
Faint coward Joy, no longer tarrie dare,<br/>
Seeing hope yeeld when this woe strake him first,<br/>
Delight exclaims he is for my fault curst,<br/>
Although my mate in Armes himselfe he sware,<br/>
Nay Sorrow comes with such mayne rage as hee,<br/>
Kills his owne children, Teares, finding that they<br/>
By Love were made apt to comfort with mee,<br/>
Onely true sighes, you do not go away:<br/>
Thank may you have for such thankfull part:<br/>
Thank worthiest yet, when you shall breake my heart.

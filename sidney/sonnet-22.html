<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 22nd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
In highest way of heaven the Sunne did ride,<br/>
Progressing then from fayre Twynns golden place,<br/>
Having no maske of Clowdes before his face,<br/>
But shining forth of heat in his chiefe pride,<br/>
When some faire Ladies by hard promise tyde,<br/>
On horsebacke met him in his furious race,<br/>
Yet each preparâ€™de with Fannes well shading grace,<br/>
From that foes wounds their tender skinnes to hide.<br/>
Stella alone, with face unarmed marcht,<br/>
Either to doe like him, which open shone:<br/>
Or carelesse of the welth, because her owne.<br/>
Yet were the hid and meaner beauties parcht,<br/>
Her dainties bare went free; the cause was this,<br/>
The Sunne which others burnt, did her but kisse.

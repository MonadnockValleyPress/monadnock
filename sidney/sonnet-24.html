<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 24th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Rich fooles there there be, whose base and filthie hart,<br/>
Lyes hatching still the goods wherein they flow:<br/>
And damning their owne selves to Tantalâ€™s smart,<br/>
Welth breeding want, more rich, more wretched grow.<br/>
Yet to those fooles, heaven doth such wit impart,<br/>
As what their hands doe hold, their heads doe know.<br/>
And knowing love, and loving lay apart,<br/>
As scattered things, farre from all dangers show.<br/>
But that rich foole, who by blind Fortunes lot,<br/>
The richest gem of love and life enjoyes,<br/>
And can with foule abuse such beauties blot:<br/>
Let him deprived of sweet, but unfelt joyes<br/>
Exilde for aye, from those high treasures which<br/>
He knowes not grow, in onely follie rich.

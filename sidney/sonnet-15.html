<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 15th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
You that do search for every purling spring,<br/>
Which from the rybs of old Parnassus flowes,<br/>
And every flower (not sweete perhaps) which growes<br/>
Neere there about, into your Poesie wring.<br/>
Ye that do Dictionaries method bring<br/>
Into your rymes, running in ratling rowes,<br/>
You that poore Petrarchs long deceased woes<br/>
With new borne sighes, &amp; devised wit do sing;<br/>
You take wrong wayes, those far-set helps be such,<br/>
As doe bewray a want of inward tutch,<br/>
And sure at length stolne goods doe come to light.<br/>
But if both for your love and skill you name,<br/>
You seeke to nurse at fullest brest of Fame,<br/>
Stella behold and then begin tâ€™endite.

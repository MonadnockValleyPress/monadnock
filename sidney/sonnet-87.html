<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 87th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
When I was forst from Stella ever deare,<br/>
Stella, foode of my thoughts, hart of my hart:<br/>
Stella, whose eyes make all my temples cleare,<br/>
By Yron lawes, of duetie to depart,<br/>
Alas I found that shee with mee did smart:<br/>
I sawe that teares did in her eyes appeare:<br/>
I sawe that sighes her sweetest lips did part:<br/>
And her sad words my sadded sense did heare.<br/>
For mee, I weepe to see Pearles scattered so:<br/>
I sighd her sighes, and wailed for her woe:<br/>
Yet swamme in joy such love in her was seene.<br/>
Thus while the effect most bitter was to mee,<br/>
And nothing than that cause more sweet could be,<br/>
I had beene vext, if vext I had not beene.

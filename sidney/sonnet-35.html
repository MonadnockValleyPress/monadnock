<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 35th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
What may words say? or what may words not say,<br/>
Where truth it selfe must speake like flattery?<br/>
Within what bounds can one his lyking stay,<br/>
Where Nature doth with infinite agree?<br/>
What Nestors counsell can my flames allay,<br/>
Since Reasons selfe doth blow the coles to me?<br/>
And ah, what hope that hope should once see day,<br/>
Where Cupid is sworne page to Chastitie;<br/>
Honour is honoured that thou dost possesse<br/>
Him as thy slave, and now long needie Fame<br/>
Doth even grow rich, meaning my Stellas name;<br/>
Wit learnes in thee perfection to expresse,<br/>
Not thou by praise, but praise in thee is raised,<br/>
It is a praise, to praise where thou art praised.

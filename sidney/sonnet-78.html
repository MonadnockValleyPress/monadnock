<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 78th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Oh how the pleasant ayres of true love bee<br/>
Inflicted by those vapours, which arise<br/>
From out that noysome gulfe: which gaping lies<br/>
Betweene the jawes of hellish Jelousey.<br/>
A Monster, others harmes, selfe misery.<br/>
Beauties plague, Vertues scurge, succour of lyes:<br/>
Who his owne joy to his owne heart applyes,<br/>
And onely cherish doth with injuries:<br/>
Who since he hath by natures speciall grace,<br/>
So pearsing pawes as spoyle when they embrace,<br/>
So nimble feete as stirre though still on thornes,<br/>
So manie eyes aye seeking their owne woe.<br/>
So ample eares, that never good newes knowe,<br/>
Is it not ill that such a divell wants hornes?

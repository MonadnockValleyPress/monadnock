<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 12th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Cupid because thou shin’st in Stellas eyes,<br/>
That from her lookes thy day-nets now scapes free:<br/>
That those lips swelde so full of thee they be.<br/>
That her sweet breath makes all thy flames t’arise,<br/>
That in her brest thy pap well sugred lyes,<br/>
That her grace gracious makes thy wrongs, that shee,<br/>
What word so ere shee speakes, perswades for thee:<br/>
That her cleere voice, lifts thy fame to the skyes.<br/>
Thou countest Stella thine, like those whose powres<br/>
Having got up a breach; (by fighting well)<br/>
Cry victorie, this faire day all is ours:<br/>
Oh no, her heart is such a Cytadell.<br/>
So fortified with wit, stor’d with disdaine:<br/>
That to winne it, is all the skill and paine.

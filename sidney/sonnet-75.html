<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 75th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Of all the Kings that ever heere did raigne,<br/>
Edward namde fourth, as first in praise I name:<br/>
Not for his faire outside, nor well linde braine,<br/>
Although lesse guift, imp feathers oft no fame.<br/>
Nor that he could young wise, wise valliant frame<br/>
His Syres revenge, joynde with a kingdomes gaine:<br/>
And gaind by Mars, could yet mad Mars so tame,<br/>
That ballance waide what sword did late obtaine.<br/>
Nor that he made the Flower de lys so fraide,<br/>
Though strongly hedgd of bloody Lyons pawes:<br/>
That wittie Lewes to him a tribuite paide;<br/>
Nor this nor that, nor any such small cause,<br/>
But onely, for this worthy King durst prove,<br/>
To loose his Crowne, rather then fayle his Love.

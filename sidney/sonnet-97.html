<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 97th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Dian that faine would cheare her friend the Night,<br/>
Doth shewe her oft at full her fairest face,<br/>
Bringing with her those starrie Nymphs, whose chace<br/>
From heavenly standing hurts eche mortall wight.<br/>
But ah poore Night in love with Ph≈ìbus light,<br/>
And endlesly dispairing of his grace,<br/>
Herselfe to shewe no other joy hath place,<br/>
Sylent and sad in moorning weeds doth dight:<br/>
Even so (alas) and Ladie Dians peere,<br/>
With choise delight and rarest company,<br/>
Would faine drive clouds from out my heavie cheere:<br/>
But woe is me, though joy her selfe were shee,<br/>
Shee could not shewe my blind braine waies of joy<br/>
While I dispaire my Sunnes light to enjoy.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 83rd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Good brother Philip I have forborne you long,<br/>
I was content you should in favour creepe,<br/>
While craftely you seemed your Cut to keepe,<br/>
As though that faire soft hand did you great wrong:<br/>
I beare with envy, yet I heare your song,<br/>
When in hir necke you did love ditties peepe,<br/>
Nay, (more foole I) oft suffred you to sleepe,<br/>
In lillies nest where Loves selfe lies a long,<br/>
What? doth high place ambitious thoughts augment?<br/>
Is saucines reward of curtesie?<br/>
Cannot such grace your silly selfe content,<br/>
But you must needes with those lips billing be?<br/>
And through those lips drinke Nectar from that tung,<br/>
Leave that Syr Phipp lest off your necke be wrung.

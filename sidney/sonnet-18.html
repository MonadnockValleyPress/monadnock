<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 18th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
With what strange checkes I in my selfe am shent,<br/>
When into Reasons Audit I doe goe:<br/>
And by just counts my selfe a Bankerowt know<br/>
Of all those goods which heaven to me hath lent,<br/>
Unable quite, to pay even Natures rent,<br/>
Which unto it by birth-right I doe owe:<br/>
And which is worse, no good excuse can showe,<br/>
But that my wealth I have most idely spent,<br/>
My youth doth waste, my knowledge brings forth toyes,<br/>
My wit doth strive, those passions to defende<br/>
Which for reward, spoyle it with vaine annoyes;<br/>
I see my course, to lose my selfe doth bende.<br/>
I see and yet no greater sorrowe take<br/>
Than that I looke no more for Stellas sake.

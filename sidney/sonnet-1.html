<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 1st Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Loving in trueth, and fayne my love in verse to show,<br/>
That the deere Shee, might take some pleasure of my paine:<br/>
Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,<br/>
Knowledge might pittie winne, and pittie grace obtaine.<br/>
I sought fit wordes to paint the blackest face of woe,<br/>
Studying inventions fine, her wittes to entertaine,<br/>
Oft turning others leaves, to see if thence would flowe,<br/>
Some fresh and fruitfull showre, upon my Sunne-burnt braine.<br/>
But wordes came halting out, wanting inventions stay,<br/>
Invention Natures childe, fledde Stepdame studies blowes:<br/>
And others feete, still seemâ€™de but strangers in my way,<br/>
Thus great with Childe to speake, and helplesse in my throwes,<br/>
Byting my trewand penne, beating my selfe for spite:<br/>
Foole saide my Muse to mee, looke in thy heart and write.

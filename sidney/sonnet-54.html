<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 54th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Because I breathe not love to every one,<br/>
Nor doe not use sette Colours for to weare:<br/>
Nor nourish speciall locks with vowed haire,<br/>
Nor give each speech a full point of a grone,<br/>
The Courtly Nymphes acquainted with the mone<br/>
Of them, which in their lips Loves Standard beare:<br/>
What he, (say they of me) now I dare sweare,<br/>
He cannot love: no, no, let him alone.<br/>
And thinke so still, so Stella know my minde.<br/>
Professe in deede, I do not Cupidâ€™s art.<br/>
But you faire Maides, at length this true shall find,<br/>
That his right badge, is but worne in the hart.<br/>
Dumbe Swans, not chattering Pyes doe Lovers prove,<br/>
They love in deed, who quake to say they love.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 76th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Shee comes, and straight therewith her shining twins do move<br/>
Their raies to me: who in her tedious absence lay<br/>
Benighted in cold woe; but now appeares my shining day,<br/>
The only light of joy, the only warmth of Love,<br/>
Shee comes with light and warmth, which like Aurora prove;<br/>
Of gentle force, so that my eyes dare gladly play<br/>
With such a rosy Morne: whose beames most freshly gay<br/>
Scorch not; but onely doe darke chilling spirits remove.<br/>
But loe, while I do speake it groweth noone with mee,<br/>
Her flamy glittering lights increase with time and place:<br/>
My heart cryes ah it burnes, mine eyes now dazled be:<br/>
No winde, no shade can coole: what helpe then in my case?<br/>
But with short breath, long lookes, staide feete, and walking hed,<br/>
Pray that my Sunne goe downe with me her beames to bed.

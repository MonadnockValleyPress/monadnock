<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 99th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
When farre spent night perswades each mortall eie<br/>
To whome nor Art nor Nature granted light:<br/>
To lay his then marke wanting shaftes of sight;<br/>
Closâ€™d whith their quivers in Sleeps armorie;<br/>
With windowes ope then most my heart doth lye<br/>
Viewing the shape of darknes and delight,<br/>
And takes that sad hue, with which inward might<br/>
Of his mazde powres he keeps just harmony:<br/>
But when birds chirpe aire, and sweet aire which is<br/>
Mornes messenger with rose enameld skyes<br/>
Calls each wight to salute the heaven of blisse;<br/>
Intombd of lids then buried are mine eyes,<br/>
Forst by their Lord who is ashamd to find<br/>
Such light in sence with such a darkned mind.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 16th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
In nature apt to like, when I did see<br/>
Beauties which were of many Carrects fine,<br/>
My boyling spirits did thether soone encline,<br/>
And Love I thought that I was full of thee;<br/>
But finding not those restles flames in mee<br/>
Which others said did make their soules to pyne,<br/>
I thought those babes of some pins hurt did whine:<br/>
By my love judging what loves paines might be.<br/>
But while I thus with this young Lyon plaid,<br/>
Myne eyes (shall I say curst or blest) beheld<br/>
Stella: now shee is namâ€™de, neede more be sayd?<br/>
In her sight I a lesson new have speld.<br/>
I now have learnd love right, and learnd even so,<br/>
As who by being poysond doth poyson know.

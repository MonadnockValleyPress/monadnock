<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 57th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Woe having made with many sighs his owne<br/>
Each sense of mine; each gift, each power of minde<br/>
Growne now his slaves, he forst them out to finde<br/>
The throwest words, fit for woes selfe to grone<br/>
Hoping that when they might finde Stella alone,<br/>
Before she could prepare to be unkind,<br/>
Her soule (armed with such a daintie rinde,)<br/>
Should soone be hurt with sharpnes of the mone.<br/>
She heard my plaints, and did not onely heare.<br/>
But them, so sweet is she, most sweetly sing,<br/>
With that faire brest, making Woes darknes cleere,<br/>
A prittie case I hoped her to bring,<br/>
To feele my griefe, and she with face and voice,<br/>
So sweetes my paines, that my paines me rejoyce.

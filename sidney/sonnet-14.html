<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 14th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Alas, have I not paine enough my friend,<br/>
Uppon whose breast, a fiercer gripe doth tyre,<br/>
Than did on him, who first stole downe the fyre;<br/>
While Love on me, doth all his quiver spend,<br/>
But with your rubarbe wordes you must contend,<br/>
To greeve me worse in saying, that desier<br/>
Doth plunge my well formâ€™d soule, even in the mier<br/>
Of sinfull thoughtes, which doe in ruine ende.<br/>
If that be sinne which doth the manners frame,<br/>
Well stayed with trueth, in worde and faith of deede,<br/>
Readie of wit, and fearing nought but shame;<br/>
If it be sin which in fixt hart dooth breede,<br/>
A loathing of all lose unchastitie;<br/>
Then love is sin, and let me sinfull bee.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 17th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
His mother deere Cupid offended late,<br/>
Because that Mars grew slacker in her love,<br/>
With pricking shot he did not throughly move<br/>
To keepe the pace of their first loving state:<br/>
The boy refusde, for feare of Marses hate;<br/>
Who threatned stripes, if he his wrath did prove:<br/>
But she in chafe him from her lap did shove,<br/>
Brake bowe, brake shafts, where Cupid weeping sate,<br/>
Till that his Grandam Nature pittying it,<br/>
Of Stellas browes made him two better bowes:<br/>
And in her eyes of arrowes infinit.<br/>
O how for joye he leapes, Ã´ how he crowes;<br/>
And straight therewith, like wagges new got to play:<br/>
Falls to shrewde turnes, and I was in his way.

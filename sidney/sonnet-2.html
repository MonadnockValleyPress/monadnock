<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 2nd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Not at first sight, nor with a dribbing shot,<br/>
Love gave the wound, which while I breath will bleede:<br/>
But knowne, worth did in mine of time proceede,<br/>
Till by degrees it had full conquest got.<br/>
I sawe and lik’d, I lik’d but loved not,<br/>
I lov’d, but did not straight what Love decreede:<br/>
At length to Loves decrees, I forst agreede:<br/>
Yet with repining at so partiall lot.<br/>
Now even that foot-steppe of lost libertie<br/>
Is gone, and now like slave borne Muscovite:<br/>
I call it praise to suffer tyrannie,<br/>
And now imploy the remnant of my wit<br/>
To make my selfe believe that all is well,<br/>
While with a feeling skill I paint my hell.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 53rd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
In Martiall sportes I had my cunning tryde,<br/>
And yet to breake more Staves I did mee adresse<br/>
While that the peopl’s showtes: I must confesse,<br/>
Youth, luck, and praise, even filld my vaines with pride;<br/>
When Cupid having me his slave descride,<br/>
In Mars his liverie, prauncing in the presse.<br/>
What now sir foole said he (I would no lesse)<br/>
Looke heere I say; I lookt, and Stella spide:<br/>
Who hard by through a window sent forth light;<br/>
My hart then quake, then daz’led were my eyes.<br/>
One hand forgot to rule, th’ other to fight,<br/>
No Trumpet sound I heard, nor freendly cries;<br/>
My foe came on, and beate the ayre for mee,<br/>
Till that her blush, taught me my shame to see.

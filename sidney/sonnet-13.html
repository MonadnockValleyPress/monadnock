<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 13th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Phœbus was Judge, betweene Jove, Mars, &amp; love,<br/>
Of those three Gods whose armes the fairest were:<br/>
Joves golden shield, did Eagle Sables beare:<br/>
Whose talents held young Ganimede above.<br/>
But in verde fielde, Mars bare a golden Speare,<br/>
Which through a bleeding heart, his point did shove:<br/>
Each had his Crest, Mars carried Venus glove.<br/>
Jove on his Helme the Thunderbolt did reare.<br/>
Cupid then smiles, for on his crest there lyes<br/>
Stellas faire haire, her face he makes his shielde:<br/>
Where Roses gueules, are borne in silver fielde.<br/>
Phœbus drewe wide the Curtaine of the skyes<br/>
To blase the last, and swore devoutly then:<br/>
The first thus macht, were scarcely Gentlemen.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 34th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Come let me write, and to what end? to ease<br/>
A burthened hart, (how can words ease, which are<br/>
The glasses of thy daily vexing care?)<br/>
Oft cruell fights well pictured forth doe please,<br/>
Art not asham’d to publish thy disease?<br/>
Nay, that may breede my fame, it is so rare,<br/>
But will not wise men thinke thy words fonde ware?<br/>
Then be they close, and they shall none displease,<br/>
What idler thing than speake and not be heard?<br/>
What harder thing than smart and not to speake?<br/>
Peace foolish wit, with wit my wit is marde;<br/>
Thus write I while I doubt to write, and wreake<br/>
My harmes in ynkes poore losse, perhaps some finde<br/>
Stellas great power, that so confus’d my minde.

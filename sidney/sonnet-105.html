<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 105th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Unhappie sight and hath shee vanisht by,<br/>
So neere, in so good time so free a place,<br/>
Dead glasse dost thou thine object so imbrase,<br/>
As what my hart still sees thou canst not spie,<br/>
I sweare by hir Love and my lacke, that I<br/>
Was not in fault that bent my dazling race<br/>
Onely unto the heaven of Stellaâ€™s face,<br/>
Counting but dust that in her way did lie:<br/>
But cease mine eyes, your teares doe witnes well,<br/>
That you guiltles therefore your necklace mist,<br/>
Curst be the Page from whome the bad torch fell,<br/>
Curst be the night which did your will resist,<br/>
Curst be the Cochman that did drive so fast,<br/>
With no lesse curse then absence makes me tast.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 31st Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
With how sad steps ô Moone thou clim’st the skyes,<br/>
How silently, and with how meane a face,<br/>
What may it be, that even in heavenly place,<br/>
That busie Archer his sharpe Arrowes tryes?<br/>
Sure if that long with love acquainted eyes<br/>
Can judge of love, thou feelst of Lovers case,<br/>
I reade within thy lookes thy languisht grace.<br/>
To mee that feele the like, my state discries.<br/>
Then even of fellowship ô Moone tell me,<br/>
Is constant love deemde there but want of wit?<br/>
Are beauties there, as proude as here there be?<br/>
Doe they above, love to be lov’d, and yet<br/>
Those Lovers scorne, whom that love doth possesse?<br/>
Doe they call vertue there ungratefulnesse?

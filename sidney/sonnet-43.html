<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 43rd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Faire eyes, sweet lips, deere hart, that foolish I<br/>
Could hope by Cupids helpe, on you to pray:<br/>
Since to himselfe he doth your gifts apply,<br/>
As his maine force, chiefe sport, and easefull stay.<br/>
For when he will see who dare him gainsay,<br/>
Then with those eyes he lookes, loe by and by,<br/>
Each soule doth at Loves feete his weapons lay,<br/>
Glad if for her he give them leave to die.<br/>
When he will play, then in her lips he is,<br/>
Where blushing red, that Loves selfe them do love,<br/>
With either lip he doth the other kisse<br/>
But when he will for quiets sake remove<br/>
From all the world, her hart is then his roome:<br/>
Where well he knowes, no man to him can come.

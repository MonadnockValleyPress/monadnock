<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 10th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Reason, in faith thou art well serv’d, that still<br/>
Would’st brabling be, with sence and love in me:<br/>
I rather with thee climbe the Muses hill,<br/>
Or reach the fruite of Natures chiefest tree:<br/>
Or seeke heavens course, or heavens inside to see:<br/>
Why should’st thou toyle, our thornie soyle to till?<br/>
Leave sence and those that sences objects be,<br/>
Deale thou with powers, of thoughts leave love to will.<br/>
But thou wouldst needes fight both with Love and sence,<br/>
With sworde of witte, giving woundes of dispraise:<br/>
Till down-right blowes did foyle thy cunning fence,<br/>
So soone as they strake thee with Stellas rayes.<br/>
Reason, thou knewest, and offered straight to prove;<br/>
By reason good, good reason her to love.

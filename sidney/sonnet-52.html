<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 52nd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
A Strife is growne betweene Vertue and Love,<br/>
While each pretends, that Stella must be his;<br/>
Her eyes, her lips, her all, saith Love doe this,<br/>
Since they doe weare his badge, most firmely prove;<br/>
But Vertue thus, that title doth disprove.<br/>
That Stella, (Ã´ deere name) that Stella is,<br/>
That vertuous Soule, sure heyre of heavenly Blisse:<br/>
Not this faire outside, which our hart doth move;<br/>
And therefore, though her beauty and her grace,<br/>
Be Loves indeede, in Stellas selfe he may<br/>
By no pretence claime any manner place.<br/>
Well Love, since this Demurre our sute doth staie.<br/>
Let Vertue have that Stellas selfe, yet thus,<br/>
That Vertue but that body graunt to us.

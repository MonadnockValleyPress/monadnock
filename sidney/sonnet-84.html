<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 84th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
High way since you my chiefe Pernassus be,<br/>
And that my Muse to some eares not unmeete,<br/>
Tempers her words to trampling horses feete,<br/>
More often than to a Chamber melodie,<br/>
Now blessed you beare onwards blessed me,<br/>
To her where I my heart safeliest shall meete,<br/>
My Muse and I must you of duetie greete,<br/>
With thanks and wishes wishing thankfully;<br/>
Be you still carefull kept by publike heede,<br/>
By no encrochment wrongd, nor time forgot,<br/>
Nor blam’d for bloud, nor sham’d for sinfull deede,<br/>
And that you know I envie you no lot,<br/>
Of highest wish, I wish you so much blisse,<br/>
Hundreds of yeares you Stellas feete may kisse.

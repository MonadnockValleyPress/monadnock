<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 102nd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Where be those Roses, which so sweetned earst our eyes?<br/>
Where be those red cheekes, which fair increase did frame<br/>
No hight of honor in the kindly badge of shame,<br/>
Who hath the crimson weeds stoln from the morning skies?<br/>
How doth the coullor fade of those vermillion eyes,<br/>
Which Nature selfe did make and selfe engrave the same?<br/>
I would know by what right this palenes overcame<br/>
That hue, whose force my heart in so great thraldom ties?<br/>
Gallens adopted sonnes, who by a beaten way<br/>
Their judgements hackney on, the fault of sicknes lay:<br/>
But feeling proofe makes me say, they mistake it sure,<br/>
It is but love that makes this paper perfect white,<br/>
To write therein more fresh the storie of Delight,<br/>
Whiles Beauties reddest incke Venus for him doth stir.

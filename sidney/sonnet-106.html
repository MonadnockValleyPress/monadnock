<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 106th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
O absent presence Stella is not here,<br/>
False flattering hope that with so faire a face,<br/>
Bare me in hand that in this Orphane place,<br/>
Stella I saw, my Stella should appeare,<br/>
What saist thou now, where is that dainty cleare<br/>
Thou wouldst mine eyes should helpe their famisht case:<br/>
But how art thou? now that selfe felt disgrace<br/>
Doth make me most to wish thy comfort neere,<br/>
But heere I doe shore of faire Ladies meete,<br/>
Who may with charme of conversation sweete<br/>
Make in my heavie mould new thoughts to grow:<br/>
Sure they prevaile as much with me, as he<br/>
That bad his frind but then new maimde to be<br/>
Merrie with him, and so forget his woe.

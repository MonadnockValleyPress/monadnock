<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 73rd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Love still a Boy, and oft a wanton is,<br/>
Schoolde only by his Mothers tender eye:<br/>
What wonder then if he his lesson misse,<br/>
When for so soft a rod deare play he trye.<br/>
And yet my starre, because a sugred kisse,<br/>
In sport I sucke, while she a sleepe did lye:<br/>
Doth lowre, naye chide, nay threat for onely this:<br/>
Sweet it was saucy love, not humble I.<br/>
But no scuse serves, she makes her wrath appeare,<br/>
In Beauties throne, see now who dares come neere<br/>
Those scarlet Judges, threatning blooddie paine.<br/>
O heavenly Foole, thy most kisse worthy face<br/>
Anger invests with such a lovely grace,<br/>
That Angers selfe I needes must kisse againe.

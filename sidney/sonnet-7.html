<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 7th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
When nature made her chiefe worke, Stellaâ€™s eyes,<br/>
In collour blacke, why wrapt she beames so bright?<br/>
Would she in beamy blacke like Painter wise,<br/>
Frame daintiest lustre mixte of shades of light?<br/>
Or did she els that sober hewe devise,<br/>
In object best, to strength and knitt our sighte<br/>
Least if no vaile these brave gleames did disguise,<br/>
They Sun-like should more dazell than delight.<br/>
Or would she her miraculous power shewe,<br/>
That whereas blacke seemes Beauties contrarie,<br/>
Shee even in blacke doth make all Beauties flower<br/>
Both so and thus; she minding Love should bee<br/>
Plaste ever there, gave him this mourning weede:<br/>
To honour all their deathes, which for her bleede.

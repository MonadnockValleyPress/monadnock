<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 77th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Those lookes, whose beames be joy, whose motion is delight,<br/>
That face whose lecture shewes what perfect Beautie is:<br/>
That presence which doth give darke hearts a living light,<br/>
That grace, which Venus weepes that shee her selfe doth misse.<br/>
That hand, which without touch, holdes more than Atlas might,<br/>
Those lips, which makes deathes pay a meane prise for a kisse:<br/>
That skin, whose past-praise hue scornes this poore tearme of whit,<br/>
Those words which doe sublime the quintessence of blisse.<br/>
That voice which makes the soule plant himselfe in the eares,<br/>
That conversation sweet, where such high comforts be:<br/>
As construâ€™d in true speech; the name of heaven it beares:<br/>
Makes me in my best thoughts and quiet judgements see,<br/>
That in no more but these I might be fully blest:<br/>
Yet ah, my maiden Muse doth blush to tell the best.

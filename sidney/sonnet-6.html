<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 6th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Some Lovers speake, when they their Muses entertaine<br/>
Of hopes begot, by feare, of wot not what desires,<br/>
Of force of heavenly beames, infusing hellish paine;<br/>
Of lyving deathes, deere woundes, faire Stormes, and friesing fyres.<br/>
Some one his songs in Jove and Joves straunge tales attyres,<br/>
Bordered with Bulles and Swannes, poudered with golden raine:<br/>
Another humbler witte to shepheards pipe retyres,<br/>
Yet hiding royall blood, full oft in Rurall vaine.<br/>
To some a sweetest plaint a sweetest stile affordes,<br/>
Whiles teares poure out his inke, and sighes breathe<br/>
His paper pale despaire, and paine his penne doth move.<br/>
I can speake what I feele, and feele as much as they,<br/>
But thinke that all the mappe of my state I display,<br/>
When trembling voice brings foorth, that I do Stella love.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 37th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
My mouth doth water, and my breast doth swell,<br/>
My tongue doth itch, my thoughts in labour be:<br/>
Listen then, lordings, with good ear to me,<br/>
For of my life I must a riddle tell.<br/>
Toward Auroras Court a nymph doth dwell,<br/>
Rich in all beauties which mans eye can see;<br/>
Beauties so farre from reach of words that we<br/>
Abase her praise saying she doth excell;<br/>
Rich in the treasure of deserv'd renowne,<br/>
Rich in the riches of a royall heart,<br/>
Rich in those gifts which give th'eternall crowne;<br/>
Who, though most rich in these and ev'ry part<br/>
Which make the patents of true worldy blisse,<br/>
Hath no misfortune but that Rich she is.

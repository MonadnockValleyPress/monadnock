<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 29th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Like some weake Lords Neighbord by mightie kings,<br/>
To keepe themselves and their chiefe Cities free,<br/>
Doe easily yeelde, that all their coast may be<br/>
Readie to serve their Campe of needfull things:<br/>
So Stellas hart finding what power Love brings,<br/>
To keepe it selfe in life and libertie,<br/>
Doth willing graunt that in the Frontire he<br/>
Use all to help his other conquerings.<br/>
And thus her hart escapes, but thus her eyes<br/>
Serve him with shot, her lips his Heralds are,<br/>
Her brests his Tents, legges his tryumphall Chare,<br/>
Herselfe his foode, her skin his Armour brave.<br/>
And I but for because my prospect lyes:<br/>
Upon that coast, am given up for slave.

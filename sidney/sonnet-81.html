<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 81st Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
O Kisse which doth those ruddie gemmes impart,<br/>
Or Gemmes or fruits of new found Parradise,<br/>
Breathing all blisse and sweetnes to the hart,<br/>
Teaching dumbe lips a nobler exercise.<br/>
O kisse which soules even soules together ties<br/>
By links of Love, and onely natures Art,<br/>
How faine would I paint thee to all mens eies,<br/>
Or of thy gifts at least shade out some part?<br/>
But shee forbids, with blushing words shee saies,<br/>
Shee builds her fame on higher seated praise:<br/>
But my heart burnes, I cannot silent be,<br/>
Then since deare life, you faine would have me peace.<br/>
And I (mad with delight) want wit to cease,<br/>
Stop you my mouth with still still kissing me.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 65th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Love, by sure proofe I may call thee unkinde,<br/>
That gives no better cares to my just cryes:<br/>
Thou whom to me, such my good turnes shouldst binde,<br/>
As I may well recount, but none can prise.<br/>
For when nak’d boy, hou couldst no harbour finde<br/>
In this olde world, (growne now so to be wise)<br/>
I lodg’de thee in my heart: and being blinde<br/>
By nature borne, I gave to thee my eyes.<br/>
Mine eyes, my light, my life, my hart alas,<br/>
If so great services may scorned be:<br/>
Yet let this thought thy Tygrish courage passe,<br/>
That I perhaps am somewhat kin to thee:<br/>
Since in thine armes, if learn’d fame truth hath spred,<br/>
Thou bearst the Arrowe, I the Arrowhed.

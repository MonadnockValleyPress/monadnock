<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 38th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
This night while sleepe begins, with heavie wings<br/>
To close mine eyes, and the unbitted thought<br/>
Doth fall to stray, and my chiefe powers are brought<br/>
To leave the scepter of all subject things,<br/>
The first that straight my fancies errour brings<br/>
Unto my minde, is Stellas Image, wrought<br/>
By Loves owne selfe, but with so curious draught,<br/>
That she me thinkes not onely shines but sings:<br/>
I start, looke, harke, but what inclosâ€™d up sence<br/>
Was helde in open sence it flyes away,<br/>
Leaving me nought but wayling eloquence.<br/>
I seeing Better sights in sighes decay,<br/>
Conclude a new, and woed Sleepe againe,<br/>
But him her hoast that unkind guest had slaine.

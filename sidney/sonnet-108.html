<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 108th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
When sorrow (using my owne Siers might)<br/>
Melts downe his lead into my boyling brest,<br/>
Through that darke Furnace of my heart opprest,<br/>
There shines a joy from thee my onely light:<br/>
But soone as thought of thee breeds my delight,<br/>
And my young soule once flutters to her nest,<br/>
Most dead dispaire my daily unbidden guest<br/>
Clips strait my wings, strait wraps me in his night,<br/>
And makes me then bow downe my head and say,<br/>
Ah what doth Phœbus gold that wretch availe,<br/>
Whom Iron darts doth keepe from use of daie,<br/>
So strangely (alas) thy workes on me prevaile,<br/>
That in my woes for thee, thou art my joy;<br/>
And in my joyes for thee, my onel’ anoy.

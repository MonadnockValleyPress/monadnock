<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 94th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Greefe find the words, for thou hast made my braine<br/>
So darke with mistie vapours which arise<br/>
From out thy heavie mould, that inbent eyes<br/>
Can scarce discerne the shape of mine owne paine:<br/>
Do thou then (for thou canst) do thou complaine<br/>
For my poore soule which now that sicknes tries,<br/>
Which even to sense, sense of it selfe denies.<br/>
Though harbengers of death lodge there his traine,<br/>
Or if the love of plaint yet mind forbeares,<br/>
As of a Caitife worthie so to dye;<br/>
Yet waye thy selfe and wayle in causefull teares:<br/>
That though in wretchednes thy life doth lie,<br/>
Yet growest more wretched than thy nature beares:<br/>
By being plast in such a wretch as I.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 107th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Stella since thou so right a Princesse art<br/>
Of all the Powers which life bestowe on me,<br/>
That ere by them ought undertaken be,<br/>
They first resort unto that soveraigne part;<br/>
Sweete for a time give respite to my heart,<br/>
Which pants as though it still should leape to thee:<br/>
And on my thought give the Lieuetenancie<br/>
To this great cause, which needes both wit and Art,<br/>
And as a Queene who from her presence sends<br/>
Whom shee emploies, dismisse from thee my wit,<br/>
Still to have wrought that thy owne will attends,<br/>
For servants shame of Maisters blame doth fit.<br/>
O let not Fooles in me thy works approve,<br/>
And scorning say, see what it is to love.

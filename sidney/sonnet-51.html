<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 51st Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Pardon mine eares, both I and they doe pray,<br/>
So may your tongue full flauntingly proceede,<br/>
To them that doe such entertainments neede;<br/>
So may you still have somewhat new to say.<br/>
On sillie me, doe not you burthen lay<br/>
Of all the grave conceipts your braine doth breede,<br/>
But find some Hercules, to beard (in steede<br/>
Of Atlas tyrde) your wisedomes heavenly sway.<br/>
For me while you discourse of courtly tydes,<br/>
Of cunningst Fishers in most troubled streames,<br/>
Of straying waves when valiant errour guides:<br/>
Meane while my hart confers with Stellas beames,<br/>
And is even woe that so sweet Comedie,<br/>
By such unfuted speech, should hindered be.

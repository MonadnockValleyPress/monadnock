<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 41st Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Having this days, my horse, my hand, my Launce<br/>
Guided so well, that I obtaind the prize,<br/>
Both by the judgment of the English eyes,<br/>
And of some sent from that sweet enmie Fraunce,<br/>
Horsmen my skill in horsmanship advaunce,<br/>
Towne folke my strength: a daintier Judge applies<br/>
His praise to flight, which from good use doth rise:<br/>
Some luckie wits, impute it but to chaunce:<br/>
Others, because from both sides I doe take<br/>
My blood, from them that doe excell in this,<br/>
Thinke Nature me a man at Armes did make.<br/>
How farre they shoot awry; the true cause is,<br/>
Stella lookt on, and from her heavenly face,<br/>
Sent forth the beames, which made so faire a race.

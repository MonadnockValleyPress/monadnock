<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 25th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
The wisest scholler of the wight most wise,<br/>
By Phœbus doome, with sugred sentence sayes:<br/>
That vertue if it once meete with our eyes,<br/>
Strange flames of love it in our soules would rayse.<br/>
But for that man with paine this truth discries,<br/>
While he each thing in sences ballance wayes,<br/>
And so, nor will nor can behold those skyes,<br/>
Which inward Summe to heroicke mindes displaies.<br/>
Vertue of late with vertuous care to stir<br/>
Love of himselfe, takes Stellas shape, that hee<br/>
To mortall eyes might sweetly shine in her.<br/>
It is most true, for since I her did see,<br/>
Vertues great beautie in her face I prove,<br/>
And finde th’ effect, for I doe burne in love.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 49th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
I on my horse, and Love on me doth trie<br/>
Our horsmanship, while by strange worke I prove,<br/>
A horsman to my horse, a horse to Love;<br/>
And now mans wrongs in me poore beast discry.<br/>
The raines wherewith my ryder doth me tie<br/>
Are reverent thoughts, which bit of reverence move,<br/>
Curbde in with feare, but with gilt bosse above<br/>
Of hope, which makes it seeme faire to the eye:<br/>
The wande is will, thou fancie saddle art,<br/>
Girt fast by memorie; and while I spurre<br/>
My horse, he spurres with sharpe desires my hart,<br/>
He sits me fast how ever I doe sturre,<br/>
And now hath made me to his hand so right,<br/>
That in the manage, my selfe do take delight.

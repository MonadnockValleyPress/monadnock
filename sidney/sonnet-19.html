<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 19th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
On Cupids bowe, how are my hart strings bent?<br/>
That see my wracke, and yet imbrace the same:<br/>
When most I glorie, then I feele most shame;<br/>
I willing run, yet while I runne repent;<br/>
My best wittes still their owne disgrace invent,<br/>
My verie ynke, turnes straight to Stellaâ€™s name:<br/>
And yet my words (as them my penne doth frame)<br/>
Against themselves that they are vainely spent.<br/>
For though she passe all things, yet what is all<br/>
That unto me, who fare like him that both<br/>
Lookes to the skyes and in a ditch doth fall,<br/>
O let me prop my mind yet in his grouth<br/>
And not in nature, for best fruits unfit;<br/>
Scholler saith Love bend hitherward your wit.

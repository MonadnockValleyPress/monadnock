<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 20th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Fly, flye my friends, I have my deathes wound, flye;<br/>
See there that boy, that murthering boy I say,<br/>
Who like a thiefe hid in a bush doth lye,<br/>
Tyll blooddy bullet get him wrongfull pray.<br/>
So, tyrant he no fitter place could spy,<br/>
Nor so farre levell in so secrete stay:<br/>
As that sweete blacke which veiles thy heavenly eye.<br/>
There himselfe with his shot he close doth laye.<br/>
Poore passenger, passe now thereby I did,<br/>
And staid pleasd with prospect of the place,<br/>
While that black hue from me the bad guest hid,<br/>
But straight I saw motions of lightnings grace,<br/>
And there descried the glisterings of his dart:<br/>
But ere I could flie thence, it pearst my hart.

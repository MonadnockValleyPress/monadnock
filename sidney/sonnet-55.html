<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 55th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Fie schoole of Patience, fie, your Lesson is<br/>
Far far too long, to learne it without booke:<br/>
What, a whole weeke, without one peece of looke?<br/>
And thinke I should not your large precepts misse,<br/>
When I might reade those Letters faire of blisse,<br/>
Which in her face teach vertue, I could brooke,<br/>
Somewhat thy leaden counsels which I tooke:<br/>
As of a freend that meant not much amisse:<br/>
But now alas, that I doe want her sight,<br/>
What doost thou thinke that I can ever take,<br/>
In thy colde stuffe, a phlegmatick delight?<br/>
No Patience, if thou wilt my good, then make<br/>
Her come, and heare with patience my desires<br/>
And then with patience bid me beare my fire.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 103rd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
O happie Thames that didst my Stella beare,<br/>
I saw thee with full many a smiling line<br/>
Upon thy cheereful face loves Livery weare:<br/>
While those faire Plannets on thy streames did shine,<br/>
The boat for joy could not to dance forbeare,<br/>
While wanton winds with beautie so divine<br/>
Ravisht, staid not, til in her golden haire<br/>
They did themselves (Ã´ sweetest prison) twine.<br/>
But faine those friendly winds there would their stay<br/>
Have made, but forst by Nature still to flie,<br/>
First did with puffing kisse those Lockes display:<br/>
She so discovered, blusht. From window I<br/>
With sight thereof cride out; Ah faire disgrace,<br/>
Let honours selfe to thee graunt highest place.

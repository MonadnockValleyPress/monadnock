<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 27th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Because I oft in darke abstracted guise,<br/>
Seeme most alone in greatest company,<br/>
With dearth of words, and aunswers quite awry,<br/>
To them that would make speech of speech arise;<br/>
They deeme, and of their doome the rumor flies,<br/>
That poyson foule of bubling pride doth lie<br/>
So in my swelling brest, that onely I<br/>
Faune on my selfe, all others doe dispise:<br/>
Yet pride (I thinke) doth not my soule possesse,<br/>
(Which lookes too oft in this unflattering glasse)<br/>
But one worse fault, ambition I confesse,<br/>
That makes me oft my best freends over-passe,<br/>
Unseene unheard, while thought to highest place<br/>
Bends all his powers, even unto Stellas grace.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 9th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Queene Vertues Court, which some call Stellas face,<br/>
Preparâ€™d by Natures cheefest furniture:<br/>
Hath his front built of Alabaster pure.<br/>
Gold is the covering of that statelie place.<br/>
The doore, by which sometimes comes forth her grace<br/>
Red Porphire is, which locke of Pearle makes sure:<br/>
Whose Porches rich, with name of chekes indure,<br/>
Marble mixt red and white, doe enterlace.<br/>
The Windowes now, through which this heavenly guest<br/>
Lookes ore the world, and can finde nothing such,<br/>
Which dare claime from those lights the name of best,<br/>
Of touch they are, that without touch doe touch,<br/>
Which Cupids selfe, from beauties mine did drawe:<br/>
Of touch they are, and poore I am their strawe.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 26th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Though duskie wits dare scorne Astrologie,<br/>
And fooles can thinke those lampes of purest light,<br/>
Whose number, waies, greatnes, eternitie,<br/>
Promising wondrous wonders to invite,<br/>
To have for no cause birth-right in the skyes.<br/>
But for to spangle the blacke weedes of Night,<br/>
Or for some Braule which in that Chamber hie,<br/>
They should still daunce to please a gazers sight.<br/>
For mee I doe Nature unydle know,<br/>
And know great causes, great effects procure,<br/>
And know those bodies high, raigne on the low.<br/>
And if these rules did fayle, proofe makes me sure,<br/>
Who oft foresee my after following case,<br/>
By onely those two starres in Stellaâ€™s face.

<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 5th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
It is most true, that eyes are found to serve<br/>
The inward light: and that the heavenly part<br/>
Ought to be King, from whose rules who doth swerve,<br/>
Rebels to nature, strive for their owne smart.<br/>
It is most true, what wee call Cupids dart,<br/>
An Image is, which for ourselves we carve:<br/>
And fooles adore, in Temple of our hart,<br/>
Till that good God make church and Church-men starve.<br/>
True that true beautie vertue is in deede,<br/>
Whereof this beautie can but be a shade:<br/>
Which Elements with mortall mixture breede,<br/>
True that on earth we are but Pilgrimes made,<br/>
And should in soule, up to our Country move:<br/>
True and most true, that I must Stella love.

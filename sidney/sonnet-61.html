<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 61th Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
Oft with true sighes, oft with uncalled teares,<br/>
Now with slow words, now with dumbe eloquence,<br/>
I Stellas eyes assailde, invade her eares,<br/>
But this at last is her sweete breathâ€™d defence,<br/>
That who indeede a sound affection beares,<br/>
So captives to his Saint both soule and sence,<br/>
That wholie Hers, all selfnes he forbeares.<br/>
Thence his desire he learnes, his lives course thence,<br/>
Now since this chast love, hates this love in mee;<br/>
With chastned minde I needes must shew, that shee<br/>
Shall quickly me from what she hates remove.<br/>
O Doctor Cupid, thou for me reply:<br/>
Driven els to graunt by Angell Sophistry,<br/>
That I love not, without I leave to love.

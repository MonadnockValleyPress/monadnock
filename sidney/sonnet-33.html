<h1>Astrophil and Stella: 33rd Sonnet</h1>
<h2>by Philip Sidney</h2>
<p>
I might, unhappy word, (woe me) I might,<br/>
And then would not, nor could not see my blisse:<br/>
Till now, wrapt in a most infernall Night,<br/>
I finde, how heavenly day (wretch) did I misse;<br/>
Hart rent thy selfe, thou doost thy selfe but right.<br/>
No lovely Paris made thy Helen his,<br/>
No force, no fraude, robd thee of thy delight,<br/>
Nor fortune of thy fortune Author is;<br/>
But to my selfe, my selfe did give the blow,<br/>
While too much wit forsooth so trubled me,<br/>
That I respects for both our sakes must show,<br/>
And yet could not by rysing morne fore-see,<br/>
How faire a day was neere, (Ã´ punisht eyes)<br/>
That I had beene more foolish, or more wise.

<h1>Three Friends of Mine</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
When I remember them, those friends of mine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are no longer here, the noble three,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who half my life were more than friends to me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And whose discourse was like a generous wine,<br/>
I most of all remember the divine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Something, that shone in them, and made us see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The archetypal man, and what might be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The amplitude of Nature's first design.<br/>
In vain I stretch my hands to clasp their hands;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot find them.  Nothing now is left<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But a majestic memory.  They meanwhile<br/>
Wander together in Elysian lands,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance remembering me, who am bereft<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their dear presence, and, remembering, smile.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
In Attica thy birthplace should have been,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the Ionian Isles, or where the seas<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Encircle in their arms the Cyclades,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So wholly Greek wast thou in thy serene<br/>
And childlike joy of life, O Philhellene!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Around thee would have swarmed the Attic bees;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Homer had been thy friend, or Socrates,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Plato welcomed thee to his demesne.<br/>
For thee old legends breathed historic breath;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou sawest Poseidon in the purple sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the sunset Jason's fleece of gold!<br/>
O, what hadst thou to do with cruel Death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wast so full of life, or Death with thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou shouldst die before thou hadst grown old!
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
I stand again on the familiar shore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the waves of the distracted sea<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Piteously calling and lamenting thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And waiting restless at thy cottage door.<br/>
The rocks, the sea-weed on the ocean floor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The willows in the meadow, and the free<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild winds of the Atlantic welcome me;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then why shouldst thou be dead, and come no more?<br/>
Ah, why shouldst thou be dead, when common men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are busy with their trivial affairs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Having and holding?  Why, when thou hadst read<br/>
Nature's mysterious manuscript, and then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wast ready to reveal the truth it bears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why art thou silent!  Why shouldst thou be dead?
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
River, that stealest with such silent pace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the City of the Dead, where lies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend who bore thy name, and whom these eyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall see no more in his accustomed place,<br/>
Linger and fold him in thy soft embrace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And say good night, for now the western skies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are red with sunset, and gray mists arise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like damps that gather on a dead man's face.<br/>
Good night! good night! as we so oft have said<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath this roof at midnight in the days<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That are no more, and shall no more return.<br/>
Thou hast but taken thy lamp and gone to bed;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I stay a little longer, as one stays<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To cover up the embers that still burn.
</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>
The doors are all wide open; at the gate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The blossomed lilacs counterfeit a blaze,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seem to warm the air; a dreamy haze<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hangs o'er the Brighton meadows like a fate,<br/>
And on their margin, with sea-tides elate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The flooded Charles, as in the happier days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Writes the last letter of his name, and stays<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His restless steps, as if compelled to wait.<br/>
I also wait; but they will come no more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those friends of mine, whose presence satisfied<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The thirst and hunger of my heart.  Ah me!<br/>
They have forgotten the pathway to my door!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Something is gone from nature since they died,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And summer is not summer, nor can be.

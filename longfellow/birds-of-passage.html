<h1>Birds of Passage</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
Black shadows fall<br/>
From the lindens tall,<br/>
That lift aloft their massive wall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the southern sky;
</p>
<p>
And from the realms<br/>
Of the shadowy elms<br/>
A tide-like darkness overwhelms<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fields that round us lie.
</p>
<p>
But the night is fair,<br/>
And everywhere<br/>
A warm, soft vapor fills the air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And distant sounds seem near,
</p>
<p>
And above, in the light<br/>
Of the star-lit night,<br/>
Swift birds of passage wing their flight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dewy atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
I hear the beat<br/>
Of their pinions fleet,<br/>
As from the land of snow and sleet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They seek a southern lea.
</p>
<p>
I hear the cry<br/>
Of their voices high<br/>
Falling dreamily through the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But their forms I cannot see.
</p>
<p>
O, say not so!<br/>
Those sounds that flow<br/>
In murmurs of delight and woe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come not from wings of birds.
</p>
<p>
They are the throngs<br/>
Of the poet's songs,<br/>
Murmurs of pleasures, and pains, and wrongs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of wing√®d words.
</p>
<p>
This is the cry<br/>
Of souls, that high<br/>
On toiling, beating pinions, fly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking a warmer clime.
</p>
<p>
From their distant flight<br/>
Through realms of light<br/>
It falls into our world of night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the murmuring sound of rhyme.

<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>IX. Hiawatha and the Pearl-Feather</h2>
<p>
On the shores of Gitche Gumee,<br/>
Of the shining Big-Sea-Water,<br/>
Stood Nokomis, the old woman,<br/>
Pointing with her finger westward,<br/>
O'er the water pointing westward,<br/>
To the purple clouds of sunset.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fiercely the red sun descending<br/>
Burned his way along the heavens,<br/>
Set the sky on fire behind him,<br/>
As war-parties, when retreating,<br/>
Burn the prairies on their war-trail;<br/>
And the moon, the Night-sun, eastward,<br/>
Suddenly starting from his ambush,<br/>
Followed fast those bloody footprints,<br/>
Followed in that fiery war-trail,<br/>
With its glare upon his features.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And Nokomis, the old woman,<br/>
Pointing with her finger westward,<br/>
Spake these words to Hiawatha:<br/>
"Yonder dwells the great Pearl-Feather,<br/>
Megissogwon, the Magician,<br/>
Manito of Wealth and Wampum,<br/>
Guarded by his fiery serpents,<br/>
Guarded by the black pitch-water.<br/>
You can see his fiery serpents,<br/>
The Kenabeek, the great serpents,<br/>
Coiling, playing in the water;<br/>
You can see the black pitch-water<br/>
Stretching far away beyond them,<br/>
To the purple clouds of sunset!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"He it was who slew my father,<br/>
By his wicked wiles and cunning,<br/>
When he from the moon descended,<br/>
When he came on earth to seek me.<br/>
He, the mightiest of Magicians,<br/>
Sends the fever from the marshes,<br/>
Sends the pestilential vapors,<br/>
Sends the poisonous exhalations,<br/>
Sends the white fog from the fen-lands,<br/>
Sends disease and death among us!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Take your bow, O Hiawatha,<br/>
Take your arrows, jasper-headed,<br/>
Take your war-club, Puggawaugun,<br/>
And your mittens, Minjekahwun,<br/>
And your birch-canoe for sailing,<br/>
And the oil of Mishe-Nahma,<br/>
So to smear its sides, that swiftly<br/>
You may pass the black pitch-water;<br/>
Slay this merciless magician,<br/>
Save the people from the fever<br/>
That he breathes across the fen-lands,<br/>
And avenge my father's murder!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Straightway then my Hiawatha<br/>
Armed himself with all his war-gear,<br/>
Launched his birch-canoe for sailing;<br/>
With his palm its sides he patted,<br/>
Said with glee, "Cheemaun, my darling,<br/>
O my Birch-canoe! leap forward,<br/>
Where you see the fiery serpents,<br/>
Where you see the black pitch-water!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Forward leaped Cheemaun exulting,<br/>
And the noble Hiawatha<br/>
Sang his war-song wild and woful,<br/>
And above him the war-eagle,<br/>
The Keneu, the great war-eagle,<br/>
Master of all fowls with feathers,<br/>
Screamed and hurtled through the heavens.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Soon he reached the fiery serpents,<br/>
The Kenabeek, the great serpents,<br/>
Lying huge upon the water,<br/>
Sparkling, rippling in the water,<br/>
Lying coiled across the passage,<br/>
With their blazing crests uplifted,<br/>
Breathing fiery fogs and vapors,<br/>
So that none could pass beyond them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But the fearless Hiawatha<br/>
Cried aloud, and spake in this wise,<br/>
"Let me pass my way, Kenabeek,<br/>
Let me go upon my journey!"<br/>
And they answered, hissing fiercely,<br/>
With their fiery breath made answer:<br/>
"Back, go back! O Shaugodaya!<br/>
Back to old Nokomis, Faint-heart!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the angry Hiawatha<br/>
Raised his mighty bow of ash-tree,<br/>
Seized his arrows, jasper-headed,<br/>
Shot them fast among the serpents;<br/>
Every twanging of the bow-string<br/>
Was a war-cry and a death-cry,<br/>
Every whizzing of an arrow<br/>
Was a death-song of Kenabeek.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Weltering in the bloody water,<br/>
Dead lay all the fiery serpents,<br/>
And among them Hiawatha<br/>
Harmless sailed, and cried exulting:<br/>
"Onward, O Cheemaun, my darling!<br/>
Onward to the black pitch-water!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he took the oil of Nahma,<br/>
And the bows and sides anointed,<br/>
Smeared them well with oil, that swiftly<br/>
He might pass the black pitch-water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All night long he sailed upon it,<br/>
Sailed upon that sluggish water,<br/>
Covered with its mould of ages,<br/>
Black with rotting water-rushes,<br/>
Rank with flags and leaves of lilies,<br/>
Stagnant, lifeless, dreary, dismal,<br/>
Lighted by the shimmering moonlight,<br/>
And by will-o'-the-wisps illumined,<br/>
Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled,<br/>
In their weary night-encampments.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All the air was white with moonlight,<br/>
All the water black with shadow,<br/>
And around him the Suggema,<br/>
The mosquito, sang his war-song,<br/>
And the fire-flies, Wah-wah-taysee,<br/>
Waved their torches to mislead him;<br/>
And the bull-frog, the Dahinda,<br/>
Thrust his head into the moonlight,<br/>
Fixed his yellow eyes upon him,<br/>
Sobbed and sank beneath the surface;<br/>
And anon a thousand whistles,<br/>
Answered over all the fen-lands,<br/>
And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,<br/>
Far off on the reedy margin,<br/>
Heralded the hero's coming.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Westward thus fared Hiawatha,<br/>
Toward the realm of Megissogwon,<br/>
Toward the land of the Pearl-Feather,<br/>
Till the level moon stared at him<br/>
In his face stared pale and haggard,<br/>
Till the sun was hot behind him,<br/>
Till it burned upon his shoulders,<br/>
And before him on the upland<br/>
He could see the Shining Wigwam<br/>
Of the Manito of Wampum,<br/>
Of the mightiest of Magicians.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then once more Cheemaun he patted,<br/>
To his birch-canoe said, "Onward!"<br/>
And it stirred in all its fibres,<br/>
And with one great bound of triumph<br/>
Leaped across the water-lilies,<br/>
Leaped through tangled flags and rushes,<br/>
And upon the beach beyond them<br/>
Dry-shod landed Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Straight he took his bow of ash-tree,<br/>
On the sand one end he rested,<br/>
With his knee he pressed the middle,<br/>
Stretched the faithful bow-string tighter,<br/>
Took an arrow, jasperheaded,<br/>
Shot it at the Shining Wigwam,<br/>
Sent it singing as a herald,<br/>
As a bearer of his message,<br/>
Of his challenge loud and lofty:<br/>
"Come forth from your lodge, Pearl-Feather!<br/>
Hiawatha waits your coming!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Straightway from the Shining Wigwam<br/>
Came the mighty Megissogwon,<br/>
Tall of stature, broad of shoulder,<br/>
Dark and terrible in aspect,<br/>
Clad from head to foot in wampum,<br/>
Armed with all his warlike weapons,<br/>
Painted like the sky of morning,<br/>
Streaked with crimson, blue, and yellow,<br/>
Crested with great eagle-feathers,<br/>
Streaming upward, streaming outward.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Well I know you, Hiawatha!"<br/>
Cried he in a voice of thunder,<br/>
In a tone of loud derision.<br/>
"Hasten back, O Shaugodaya!<br/>
Hasten back among the women,<br/>
Back to old Nokomis, Faint-heart!<br/>
I will slay you as you stand there,<br/>
As of old I slew her father!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
But my Hiawatha answered,<br/>
Nothing daunted, fearing nothing:<br/>
"Big words do not smite like war-clubs,<br/>
Boastful breath is not a bow-string,<br/>
Taunts are not so sharp as arrows,<br/>
Deeds are better things than words are,<br/>
Actions mightier than boastings!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then began the greatest battle<br/>
That the sun had ever looked on,<br/>
That the war-birds ever witnessed.<br/>
All a Summer's day it lasted,<br/>
From the sunrise to the sunset;<br/>
For the shafts of Hiawatha<br/>
Harmless hit the shirt of wampum,<br/>
Harmless fell the blows he dealt it<br/>
With his mittens, Minjekahwun,<br/>
Harmless fell the heavy war-club;<br/>
It could dash the rocks asunder,<br/>
But it could not break the meshes<br/>
Of that magic shirt of wampum.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Till at sunset Hiawatha,<br/>
Leaning on his bow of ash-tree,<br/>
Wounded, weary, and desponding,<br/>
With his mighty war-club broken,<br/>
With his mittens torn and tattered,<br/>
And three useless arrows only,<br/>
Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree,<br/>
From whose branches trailed the mosses,<br/>
And whose trunk was coated over<br/>
With the Dead-man's Moccasin-leather,<br/>
With the fungus white and yellow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly from the boughs above him<br/>
Sang the Mama, the woodpecker:<br/>
"Aim your arrows, Hiawatha,<br/>
At the head of Megissogwon,<br/>
Strike the tuft of hair upon it,<br/>
At their roots the long black tresses;<br/>
There alone can he be wounded!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Winged with feathers, tipped with jasper,<br/>
Swift flew Hiawatha's arrow,<br/>
Just as Megissogwon, stooping,<br/>
Raised a heavy stone to throw it.<br/>
Full upon the crown it struck him,<br/>
At the roots of his long tresses,<br/>
And he reeled and staggered forward,<br/>
Plunging like a wounded bison,<br/>
Yes, like Pezhekee, the bison,<br/>
When the snow is on the prairie.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swifter flew the second arrow,<br/>
In the pathway of the other,<br/>
Piercing deeper than the other,<br/>
Wounding sorer than the other;<br/>
And the knees of Megissogwon<br/>
Shook like windy reeds beneath him,<br/>
Bent and trembled like the rushes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But the third and latest arrow<br/>
Swiftest flew, and wounded sorest,<br/>
And the mighty Megissogwon<br/>
Saw the fiery eyes of Pauguk,<br/>
Saw the eyes of Death glare at him,<br/>
Heard his voice call in the darkness;<br/>
At the feet of Hiawatha<br/>
Lifeless lay the great Pearl-Feather,<br/>
Lay the mightiest of Magicians.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the grateful Hiawatha<br/>
Called the Mama, the woodpecker,<br/>
From his perch among the branches<br/>
Of the melancholy pine-tree,<br/>
And, in honor of his service,<br/>
Stained with blood the tuft of feathers<br/>
On the little head of Mama;<br/>
Even to this day he wears it,<br/>
Wears the tuft of crimson feathers,<br/>
As a symbol of his service.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he stripped the shirt of wampum<br/>
From the back of Megissogwon,<br/>
As a trophy of the battle,<br/>
As a signal of his conquest.<br/>
On the shore he left the body,<br/>
Half on land and half in water,<br/>
In the sand his feet were buried,<br/>
And his face was in the water.<br/>
And above him, wheeled and clamored<br/>
The Keneu, the great war-eagle,<br/>
Sailing round in narrower circles,<br/>
Hovering nearer, nearer, nearer.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the wigwam Hiawatha<br/>
Bore the wealth of Megissogwon,<br/>
All his wealth of skins and wampum,<br/>
Furs of bison and of beaver,<br/>
Furs of sable and of ermine,<br/>
Wampum belts and strings and pouches,<br/>
Quivers wrought with beads of wampum,<br/>
Filled with arrows, silver-headed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Homeward then he sailed exulting,<br/>
Homeward through the black pitch-water,<br/>
Homeward through the weltering serpents,<br/>
With the trophies of the battle,<br/>
With a shout and song of triumph.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the shore stood old Nokomis,<br/>
On the shore stood Chibiabos,<br/>
And the very strong man, Kwasind,<br/>
Waiting for the hero's coming,<br/>
Listening to his songs of triumph.<br/>
And the people of the village<br/>
Welcomed him with songs and dances,<br/>
Made a joyous feast, and shouted:<br/>
"Honor be to Hiawatha!<br/>
He has slain the great Pearl-Feather,<br/>
Slain the mightiest of Magicians,<br/>
Him, who sent the fiery fever,<br/>
Sent the white fog from the fen-lands,<br/>
Sent disease and death among us!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ever dear to Hiawatha<br/>
Was the memory of Mama!<br/>
And in token of his friendship,<br/>
As a mark of his remembrance,<br/>
He adorned and decked his pipe-stem<br/>
With the crimson tuft of feathers,<br/>
With the blood-red crest of Mama.<br/>
But the wealth of Megissogwon,<br/>
All the trophies of the battle,<br/>
He divided with his people,<br/>
Shared it equally among them.<br/>

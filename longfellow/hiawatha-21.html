<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XXI. The White Man's Foot</h2>
<p>
In his lodge beside a river,<br/>
Close beside a frozen river,<br/>
Sat an old man, sad and lonely.<br/>
White his hair was as a snow-drift;<br/>
Dull and low his fire was burning,<br/>
And the old man shook and trembled,<br/>
Folded in his Waubewyon,<br/>
In his tattered white-skin-wrapper,<br/>
Hearing nothing but the tempest<br/>
As it roared along the forest,<br/>
Seeing nothing but the snow-storm,<br/>
As it whirled and hissed and drifted.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All the coals were white with ashes,<br/>
And the fire was slowly dying,<br/>
As a young man, walking lightly,<br/>
At the open doorway entered.<br/>
Red with blood of youth his cheeks were,<br/>
Soft his eyes, as stars in Spring-time,<br/>
Bound his forehead was with grasses;<br/>
Bound and plumed with scented grasses,<br/>
On his lips a smile of beauty,<br/>
Filling all the lodge with sunshine,<br/>
In his hand a bunch of blossoms<br/>
Filling all the lodge with sweetness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ah, my son!" exclaimed the old man,<br/>
"Happy are my eyes to see you.<br/>
Sit here on the mat beside me,<br/>
Sit here by the dying embers,<br/>
Let us pass the night together,<br/>
Tell me of your strange adventures,<br/>
Of the lands where you have travelled;<br/>
I will tell you of my prowess,<br/>
Of my many deeds of wonder."<br/>
</p>
<p>
From his pouch he drew his peace-pipe,<br/>
Very old and strangely fashioned;<br/>
Made of red stone was the pipe-head,<br/>
And the stem a reed with feathers;<br/>
Filled the pipe with bark of willow,<br/>
Placed a burning coal upon it,<br/>
Gave it to his guest, the stranger,<br/>
And began to speak in this wise:<br/>
"When I blow my breath about me,<br/>
When I breathe upon the landscape,<br/>
Motionless are all the rivers,<br/>
Hard as stone becomes the water!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the young man answered, smiling:<br/>
"When I blow my breath about me,<br/>
When I breathe upon the landscape,<br/>
Flowers spring up o'er all the meadows,<br/>
Singing, onward rush the rivers!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"When I shake my hoary tresses,"<br/>
Said the old man darkly frowning,<br/>
"All the land with snow is covered;<br/>
All the leaves from all the branches<br/>
Fall and fade and die and wither,<br/>
For I breathe, and lo! they are not.<br/>
From the waters and the marshes,<br/>
Rise the wild goose and the heron,<br/>
Fly away to distant regions,<br/>
For I speak, and lo! they are not.<br/>
And where'er my footsteps wander,<br/>
All the wild beasts of the forest<br/>
Hide themselves in holes and caverns,<br/>
And the earth becomes as flintstone!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"When I shake my flowing ringlets,"<br/>
Said the young man, softly laughing,<br/>
"Showers of rain fall warm and welcome,<br/>
Plants lift up their heads rejoicing,<br/>
Back unto their lakes and marshes<br/>
Come the wild goose and the heron,<br/>
Homeward shoots the arrowy swallow,<br/>
Sing the bluebird and the robin,<br/>
And where'er my footsteps wander,<br/>
All the meadows wave with blossoms,<br/>
All the woodlands ring with music,<br/>
All the trees are dark with foliage!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
While they spake, the night departed:<br/>
From the distant realms of Wabun,<br/>
From his shining lodge of silver,<br/>
Like a warrior robed and painted,<br/>
Came the sun, and said, "Behold me<br/>
Gheezis, the great sun, behold me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the old man's tongue was speechless<br/>
And the air grew warm and pleasant,<br/>
And upon the wigwam sweetly<br/>
Sang the bluebird and the robin,<br/>
And the stream began to murmur,<br/>
And a scent of growing grasses<br/>
Through the lodge was gently wafted.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And Segwun, the youthful stranger,<br/>
More distinctly in the daylight<br/>
Saw the icy face before him;<br/>
It was Peboan, the Winter!<br/>
</p>
<p>
From his eyes the tears were flowing,<br/>
As from melting lakes the streamlets,<br/>
And his body shrunk and dwindled<br/>
As the shouting sun ascended,<br/>
Till into the air it faded,<br/>
Till into the ground it vanished,<br/>
And the young man saw before him,<br/>
On the hearth-stone of the wigwam,<br/>
Where the fire had smoked and smouldered,<br/>
Saw the earliest flower of Spring-time,<br/>
Saw the Beauty of the Spring-time,<br/>
Saw the Miskodeed in blossom.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus it was that in the North-land<br/>
After that unheard-of coldness,<br/>
That intolerable Winter,<br/>
Came the Spring with all its splendor,<br/>
All its birds and all its blossoms,<br/>
All its flowers and leaves and grasses.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sailing on the wind to northward,<br/>
Flying in great flocks, like arrows,<br/>
Like huge arrows shot through heaven,<br/>
Passed the swan, the Mahnahbezee,<br/>
Speaking almost as a man speaks;<br/>
And in long lines waving, bending<br/>
Like a bow-string snapped asunder,<br/>
Came the white goose, Waw-be-wawa;<br/>
And in pairs, or singly flying,<br/>
Mahng the loon, with clangorous pinions,<br/>
The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,<br/>
And the grouse, the Mushkodasa.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In the thickets and the meadows<br/>
Piped the bluebird, the Owaissa,<br/>
On the summit of the lodges<br/>
Sang the robin, the Opechee,<br/>
In the covert of the pine-trees<br/>
Cooed the pigeon, the Omemee;<br/>
And the sorrowing Hiawatha,<br/>
Speechless in his infinite sorrow,<br/>
Heard their voices calling to him,<br/>
Went forth from his gloomy doorway,<br/>
Stood and gazed into the heaven,<br/>
Gazed upon the earth and waters.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From his wanderings far to eastward,<br/>
From the regions of the morning,<br/>
From the shining land of Wabun,<br/>
Homeward now returned Iagoo,<br/>
The great traveller, the great boaster,<br/>
Full of new and strange adventures,<br/>
Marvels many and many wonders.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the people of the village<br/>
Listened to him as he told them<br/>
Of his marvellous adventures,<br/>
Laughing answered him in this wise:<br/>
"Ugh! it is indeed Iagoo!<br/>
No one else beholds such wonders!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He had seen, he said, a water<br/>
Bigger than the Big-Sea-Water,<br/>
Broader than the Gitche Gumee,<br/>
Bitter so that none could drink it!<br/>
At each other looked the warriors,<br/>
Looked the women at each other,<br/>
Smiled, and said, "It cannot be so!"<br/>
Kaw!" they said, "it cannot be so!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
O'er it, said he, o'er this water<br/>
Came a great canoe with pinions,<br/>
A canoe with wings came flying,<br/>
Bigger than a grove of pine-trees,<br/>
Taller than the tallest tree-tops!<br/>
And the old men and the women<br/>
Looked and tittered at each other;<br/>
"Kaw!" they said, "we don't believe it!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
From its mouth, he said, to greet him,<br/>
Came Waywassimo, the lightning,<br/>
Came the thunder, Annemeekee!<br/>
And the warriors and the women<br/>
Laughed aloud at poor Iagoo;<br/>
"Kaw!" they said, "what tales you tell us!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
In it, said he, came a people,<br/>
In the great canoe with pinions<br/>
Came, he said, a hundred warriors;<br/>
Painted white were all their faces<br/>
And with hair their chins were covered!<br/>
And the warriors and the women<br/>
Laughed and shouted in derision,<br/>
Like the ravens on the tree-tops,<br/>
Like the crows upon the hemlocks.<br/>
"Kaw!" they said, "what lies you tell us!<br/>
Do not think that we believe them!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Only Hiawatha laughed not,<br/>
But he gravely spake and answered<br/>
To their jeering and their jesting:<br/>
"True is all Iagoo tells us;<br/>
I have seen it in a vision,<br/>
Seen the great canoe with pinions,<br/>
Seen the people with white faces,<br/>
Seen the coming of this bearded<br/>
People of the wooden vessel<br/>
From the regions of the morning,<br/>
From the shining land of Wabun.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Gitche Manito, the Mighty,<br/>
The Great Spirit, the Creator,<br/>
Sends them hither on his errand.<br/>
Sends them to us with his message.<br/>
Wheresoe'er they move, before them<br/>
Swarms the stinging fly, the Ahmo,<br/>
Swarms the bee, the honey-maker;<br/>
Wheresoe'er they tread, beneath them<br/>
Springs a flower unknown among us,<br/>
Springs the White-man's Foot in blossom.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Let us welcome, then, the strangers,<br/>
Hail them as our friends and brothers,<br/>
And the heart's right hand of friendship<br/>
Give them when they come to see us.<br/>
Gitche Manito, the Mighty,<br/>
Said this to me in my vision.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I beheld, too, in that vision<br/>
All the secrets of the future,<br/>
Of the distant days that shall be.<br/>
I beheld the westward marches<br/>
Of the unknown, crowded nations.<br/>
All the land was full of people,<br/>
Restless, struggling, toiling, striving,<br/>
Speaking many tongues, yet feeling<br/>
But one heart-beat in their bosoms.<br/>
In the woodlands rang their axes,<br/>
Smoked their towns in all the valleys,<br/>
Over all the lakes and rivers<br/>
Rushed their great canoes of thunder.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then a darker, drearier vision<br/>
Passed before me, vague and cloud-like;<br/>
I beheld our nation scattered,<br/>
All forgetful of my counsels,<br/>
Weakened, warring with each other:<br/>
Saw the remnants of our people<br/>
Sweeping westward, wild and woful,<br/>
Like the cloud-rack of a tempest,<br/>
Like the withered leaves of Autumn!"<br/>

<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>II. The Four Winds</h2>
<p>
"Honor be to Mudjekeewis!"<br/>
Cried the warriors, cried the old men,<br/>
When he came in triumph homeward<br/>
With the sacred Belt of Wampum,<br/>
From the regions of the North-Wind,<br/>
From the kingdom of Wabasso,<br/>
From the land of the White Rabbit.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He had stolen the Belt of Wampum<br/>
From the neck of Mishe-Mokwa,<br/>
From the Great Bear of the mountains,<br/>
From the terror of the nations,<br/>
As he lay asleep and cumbrous<br/>
On the summit of the mountains,<br/>
Like a rock with mosses on it,<br/>
Spotted brown and gray with mosses.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Silently he stole upon him<br/>
Till the red nails of the monster<br/>
Almost touched him, almost scared him,<br/>
Till the hot breath of his nostrils<br/>
Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis,<br/>
As he drew the Belt of Wampum<br/>
Over the round ears, that heard not,<br/>
Over the small eyes, that saw not,<br/>
Over the long nose and nostrils,<br/>
The black muffle of the nostrils,<br/>
Out of which the heavy breathing<br/>
Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he swung aloft his war-club,<br/>
Shouted loud and long his war-cry,<br/>
Smote the mighty Mishe-Mokwa<br/>
In the middle of the forehead,<br/>
Right between the eyes he smote him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With the heavy blow bewildered,<br/>
Rose the Great Bear of the mountains;<br/>
But his knees beneath him trembled,<br/>
And he whimpered like a woman,<br/>
As he reeled and staggered forward,<br/>
As he sat upon his haunches;<br/>
And the mighty Mudjekeewis,<br/>
Standing fearlessly before him,<br/>
Taunted him in loud derision,<br/>
Spake disdainfully in this wise:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hark you, Bear! you are a coward;<br/>
And no Brave, as you pretended;<br/>
Else you would not cry and whimper<br/>
Like a miserable woman!<br/>
Bear! you know our tribes are hostile,<br/>
Long have been at war together;<br/>
Now you find that we are strongest,<br/>
You go sneaking in the forest,<br/>
You go hiding in the mountains!<br/>
Had you conquered me in battle<br/>
Not a groan would I have uttered;<br/>
But you, Bear! sit here and whimper,<br/>
And disgrace your tribe by crying,<br/>
Like a wretched Shaugodaya,<br/>
Like a cowardly old woman!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then again he raised his war-club,<br/>
Smote again the Mishe-Mokwa<br/>
In the middle of his forehead,<br/>
Broke his skull, as ice is broken<br/>
When one goes to fish in Winter.<br/>
Thus was slain the Mishe-Mokwa,<br/>
He the Great Bear of the mountains,<br/>
He the terror of the nations.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Honor be to Mudjekeewis!"<br/>
With a shout exclaimed the people,<br/>
"Honor be to Mudjekeewis!<br/>
Henceforth he shall be the West-Wind,<br/>
And hereafter and forever<br/>
Shall he hold supreme dominion<br/>
Over all the winds of heaven.<br/>
Call him no more Mudjekeewis,<br/>
Call him Kabeyun, the West-Wind!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus was Mudjekeewis chosen<br/>
Father of the Winds of Heaven.<br/>
For himself he kept the West-Wind,<br/>
Gave the others to his children;<br/>
Unto Wabun gave the East-Wind,<br/>
Gave the South to Shawondasee,<br/>
And the North-Wind, wild and cruel,<br/>
To the fierce Kabibonokka.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Young and beautiful was Wabun;<br/>
He it was who brought the morning,<br/>
He it was whose silver arrows<br/>
Chased the dark o'er hill and valley;<br/>
He it was whose cheeks were painted<br/>
With the brightest streaks of crimson,<br/>
And whose voice awoke the village,<br/>
Called the deer, and called the hunter.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Lonely in the sky was Wabun;<br/>
Though the birds sang gayly to him,<br/>
Though the wild-flowers of the meadow<br/>
Filled the air with odors for him;<br/>
Though the forests and the rivers<br/>
Sang and shouted at his coming,<br/>
Still his heart was sad within him,<br/>
For he was alone in heaven.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But one morning, gazing earthward,<br/>
While the village still was sleeping,<br/>
And the fog lay on the river,<br/>
Like a ghost, that goes at sunrise,<br/>
He beheld a maiden walking<br/>
All alone upon a meadow,<br/>
Gathering water-flags and rushes<br/>
By a river in the meadow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Every morning, gazing earthward,<br/>
Still the first thing he beheld there<br/>
Was her blue eyes looking at him,<br/>
Two blue lakes among the rushes.<br/>
And he loved the lonely maiden,<br/>
Who thus waited for his coming;<br/>
For they both were solitary,<br/>
She on earth and he in heaven.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he wooed her with caresses,<br/>
Wooed her with his smile of sunshine,<br/>
With his flattering words he wooed her,<br/>
With his sighing and his singing,<br/>
Gentlest whispers in the branches,<br/>
Softest music, sweetest odors,<br/>
Till he drew her to his bosom,<br/>
Folded in his robes of crimson,<br/>
Till into a star he changed her,<br/>
Trembling still upon his bosom;<br/>
And forever in the heavens<br/>
They are seen together walking,<br/>
Wabun and the Wabun-Annung,<br/>
Wabun and the Star of Morning.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But the fierce Kabibonokka<br/>
Had his dwelling among icebergs,<br/>
In the everlasting snow-drifts,<br/>
In the kingdom of Wabasso,<br/>
In the land of the White Rabbit.<br/>
He it was whose hand in Autumn<br/>
Painted all the trees with scarlet,<br/>
Stained the leaves with red and yellow;<br/>
He it was who sent the snow-flake,<br/>
Sifting, hissing through the forest,<br/>
Froze the ponds, the lakes, the rivers,<br/>
Drove the loon and sea-gull southward,<br/>
Drove the cormorant and curlew<br/>
To their nests of sedge and sea-tang<br/>
In the realms of Shawondasee.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once the fierce Kabibonokka<br/>
Issued from his lodge of snow-drifts<br/>
From his home among the icebergs,<br/>
And his hair, with snow besprinkled,<br/>
Streamed behind him like a river,<br/>
Like a black and wintry river,<br/>
As he howled and hurried southward,<br/>
Over frozen lakes and moorlands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There among the reeds and rushes<br/>
Found he Shingebis, the diver,<br/>
Trailing strings of fish behind him,<br/>
O'er the frozen fens and moorlands,<br/>
Lingering still among the moorlands,<br/>
Though his tribe had long departed<br/>
To the land of Shawondasee.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Cried the fierce Kabibonokka,<br/>
"Who is this that dares to brave me?<br/>
Dares to stay in my dominions,<br/>
When the Wawa has departed,<br/>
When the wild-goose has gone southward,<br/>
And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,<br/>
Long ago departed southward?<br/>
I will go into his wigwam,<br/>
I will put his smouldering fire out!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And at night Kabibonokka,<br/>
To the lodge came wild and wailing,<br/>
Heaped the snow in drifts about it,<br/>
Shouted down into the smoke-flue,<br/>
Shook the lodge-poles in his fury,<br/>
Flapped the curtain of the door-way.<br/>
Shingebis, the diver, feared not,<br/>
Shingebis, the diver, cared not;<br/>
Four great logs had he for firewood,<br/>
One for each moon of the winter,<br/>
And for food the fishes served him.<br/>
By his blazing fire he sat there,<br/>
Warm and merry, eating, laughing,<br/>
Singing, "O Kabibonokka,<br/>
You are but my fellow-mortal!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Kabibonokka entered,<br/>
And though Shingebis, the diver,<br/>
Felt his presence by the coldness,<br/>
Felt his icy breath upon him,<br/>
Still he did not cease his singing,<br/>
Still he did not leave his laughing,<br/>
Only turned the log a little,<br/>
Only made the fire burn brighter,<br/>
Made the sparks fly up the smoke-flue.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From Kabibonokka's forehead,<br/>
From his snow-besprinkled tresses,<br/>
Drops of sweat fell fast and heavy,<br/>
Making dints upon the ashes,<br/>
As along the eaves of lodges,<br/>
As from drooping boughs of hemlock,<br/>
Drips the melting snow in spring-time,<br/>
Making hollows in the snow-drifts.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Till at last he rose defeated,<br/>
Could not bear the heat and laughter,<br/>
Could not bear the merry singing,<br/>
But rushed headlong through the door-way,<br/>
Stamped upon the crusted snow-drifts,<br/>
Stamped upon the lakes and rivers,<br/>
Made the snow upon them harder,<br/>
Made the ice upon them thicker,<br/>
Challenged Shingebis, the diver,<br/>
To come forth and wrestle with him,<br/>
To come forth and wrestle naked<br/>
On the frozen fens and moorlands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Forth went Shingebis, the diver,<br/>
Wrestled all night with the North-Wind,<br/>
Wrestled naked on the moorlands<br/>
With the fierce Kabibonokka,<br/>
Till his panting breath grew fainter,<br/>
Till his frozen grasp grew feebler,<br/>
Till he reeled and staggered backward,<br/>
And retreated, baffled, beaten,<br/>
To the kingdom of Wabasso,<br/>
To the land of the White Rabbit,<br/>
Hearing still the gusty laughter,<br/>
Hearing Shingebis, the diver,<br/>
Singing, "O Kabibonokka,<br/>
You are but my fellow-mortal!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Shawondasee, fat and lazy,<br/>
Had his dwelling far to southward,<br/>
In the drowsy, dreamy sunshine,<br/>
In the never-ending Summer.<br/>
He it was who sent the wood-birds,<br/>
Sent the robin, the Opechee,<br/>
Sent the bluebird, the Owaissa,<br/>
Sent the Shawshaw, sent the swallow,<br/>
Sent the wild-goose, Wawa, northward,<br/>
Sent the melons and tobacco,<br/>
And the grapes in purple clusters.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From his pipe the smoke ascending<br/>
Filled the sky with haze and vapor,<br/>
Filled the air with dreamy softness,<br/>
Gave a twinkle to the water,<br/>
Touched the rugged hills with smoothness,<br/>
Brought the tender Indian Summer<br/>
To the melancholy north-land,<br/>
In the dreary Moon of Snow-shoes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Listless, careless Shawondasee!<br/>
In his life he had one shadow,<br/>
In his heart one sorrow had he.<br/>
Once, as he was gazing northward,<br/>
Far away upon a prairie<br/>
He beheld a maiden standing,<br/>
Saw a tall and slender maiden<br/>
All alone upon a prairie;<br/>
Brightest green were all her garments,<br/>
And her hair was like the sunshine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Day by day he gazed upon her,<br/>
Day by day he sighed with passion,<br/>
Day by day his heart within him<br/>
Grew more hot with love and longing<br/>
For the maid with yellow tresses.<br/>
But he was too fat and lazy<br/>
To bestir himself and woo her.<br/>
Yes, too indolent and easy<br/>
To pursue her and persuade her;<br/>
So he only gazed upon her,<br/>
Only sat and sighed with passion<br/>
For the maiden of the prairie.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Till one morning, looking northward,<br/>
He beheld her yellow tresses<br/>
Changed and covered o'er with whiteness,<br/>
Covered as with whitest snow-flakes.<br/>
"Ah! my brother from the North-land,<br/>
From the kingdom of Wabasso,<br/>
From the land of the White Rabbit!<br/>
You have stolen the maiden from me,<br/>
You have laid your hand upon her,<br/>
You have wooed and won my maiden,<br/>
With your stories of the North-land!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus the wretched Shawondasee<br/>
Breathed into the air his sorrow;<br/>
And the South-Wind o'er the prairie<br/>
Wandered warm with sighs of passion,<br/>
With the sighs of Shawondasee,<br/>
Till the air seemed full of snow-flakes,<br/>
Full of thistle-down the prairie,<br/>
And the maid with hair like sunshine<br/>
Vanished from his sight forever;<br/>
Never more did Shawondasee<br/>
See the maid with yellow tresses!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Poor, deluded Shawondasee!<br/>
'T was no woman that you gazed at,<br/>
'T was no maiden that you sighed for,<br/>
'T was the prairie dandelion<br/>
That through all the dreamy Summer<br/>
You had gazed at with such longing,<br/>
You had sighed for with such passion,<br/>
And had puffed away forever,<br/>
Blown into the air with sighing.<br/>
Ah! deluded Shawondasee!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus the Four Winds were divided<br/>
Thus the sons of Mudjekeewis<br/>
Had their stations in the heavens,<br/>
At the corners of the heavens;<br/>
For himself the West-Wind only<br/>
Kept the mighty Mudjekeewis.<br/>

<h1>The Meeting</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
After so long an absence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At last we meet again:<br/>
Does the meeting give us pleasure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or does it give us pain?
</p>
<p>
The tree of life has been shaken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And but few of us linger now,<br/>
Like the Prophet's two or three berries<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the top of the uppermost bough.
</p>
<p>
We cordially greet each other<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old, familiar tone;<br/>
And we think, though we do not say it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How old and gray he is grown!
</p>
<p>
We speak of a Merry Christmas<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a Happy New Year<br/>
But each in his heart is thinking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those that are not here.
</p>
<p>
We speak of friends and their fortunes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And of what they did and said,<br/>
Till the dead alone seem living,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the living alone seem dead.
</p>
<p>
And at last we hardly distinguish<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the ghosts and the guests;<br/>
And a mist and shadow of sadness<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Steals over our merriest jests.

<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XVI. Pau-Puk-Keewis</h2>
<p>
You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
He, the handsome Yenadizze,<br/>
Whom the people called the Storm-Fool,<br/>
Vexed the village with disturbance;<br/>
You shall hear of all his mischief,<br/>
And his flight from Hiawatha,<br/>
And his wondrous transmigrations,<br/>
And the end of his adventures.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the shores of Gitche Gumee,<br/>
On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo,<br/>
By the shining Big-Sea-Water<br/>
Stood the lodge of Pau-Puk-Keewis.<br/>
It was he who in his frenzy<br/>
Whirled these drifting sands together,<br/>
On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo,<br/>
When, among the guests assembled,<br/>
He so merrily and madly<br/>
Danced at Hiawatha's wedding,<br/>
Danced the Beggar's Dance to please them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now, in search of new adventures,<br/>
From his lodge went Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Came with speed into the village,<br/>
Found the young men all assembled<br/>
In the lodge of old Iagoo,<br/>
Listening to his monstrous stories,<br/>
To his wonderful adventures.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He was telling them the story<br/>
Of Ojeeg, the Summer-Maker,<br/>
How he made a hole in heaven,<br/>
How he climbed up into heaven,<br/>
And let out the summer-weather,<br/>
The perpetual, pleasant Summer;<br/>
How the Otter first essayed it;<br/>
How the Beaver, Lynx, and Badger<br/>
Tried in turn the great achievement,<br/>
From the summit of the mountain<br/>
Smote their fists against the heavens,<br/>
Smote against the sky their foreheads,<br/>
Cracked the sky, but could not break it;<br/>
How the Wolverine, uprising,<br/>
Made him ready for the encounter,<br/>
Bent his knees down, like a squirrel,<br/>
Drew his arms back, like a cricket.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Once he leaped," said old Iagoo,<br/>
"Once he leaped, and lo! above him<br/>
Bent the sky, as ice in rivers<br/>
When the waters rise beneath it;<br/>
Twice he leaped, and lo! above him<br/>
Cracked the sky, as ice in rivers<br/>
When the freshet is at highest!<br/>
Thrice he leaped, and lo! above him<br/>
Broke the shattered sky asunder,<br/>
And he disappeared within it,<br/>
And Ojeeg, the Fisher Weasel,<br/>
With a bound went in behind him!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hark you!" shouted Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
As he entered at the doorway;<br/>
"I am tired of all this talking,<br/>
Tired of old Iagoo's stories,<br/>
Tired of Hiawatha's wisdom.<br/>
Here is something to amuse you,<br/>
Better than this endless talking."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then from out his pouch of wolf-skin<br/>
Forth he drew, with solemn manner,<br/>
All the game of Bowl and Counters,<br/>
Pugasaing, with thirteen pieces.<br/>
White on one side were they painted,<br/>
And vermilion on the other;<br/>
Two Kenabeeks or great serpents,<br/>
Two Ininewug or wedge-men,<br/>
One great war-club, Pugamaugun,<br/>
And one slender fish, the Keego,<br/>
Four round pieces, Ozawabeeks,<br/>
And three Sheshebwug or ducklings.<br/>
All were made of bone and painted,<br/>
All except the Ozawabeeks;<br/>
These were brass, on one side burnished,<br/>
And were black upon the other.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In a wooden bowl he placed them,<br/>
Shook and jostled them together,<br/>
Threw them on the ground before him,<br/>
Thus exclaiming and explaining:<br/>
"Red side up are all the pieces,<br/>
And one great Kenabeek standing<br/>
On the bright side of a brass piece,<br/>
On a burnished Ozawabeek;<br/>
Thirteen tens and eight are counted."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then again he shook the pieces,<br/>
Shook and jostled them together,<br/>
Threw them on the ground before him,<br/>
Still exclaiming and explaining:<br/>
"White are both the great Kenabeeks,<br/>
White the Ininewug, the wedge-men,<br/>
Red are all the other pieces;<br/>
Five tens and an eight are counted."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus he taught the game of hazard,<br/>
Thus displayed it and explained it,<br/>
Running through its various chances,<br/>
Various changes, various meanings:<br/>
Twenty curious eyes stared at him,<br/>
Full of eagerness stared at him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Many games," said old Iagoo,<br/>
"Many games of skill and hazard<br/>
Have I seen in different nations,<br/>
Have I played in different countries.<br/>
He who plays with old Iagoo<br/>
Must have very nimble fingers;<br/>
Though you think yourself so skilful,<br/>
I can beat you, Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
I can even give you lessons<br/>
In your game of Bowl and Counters!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
So they sat and played together,<br/>
All the old men and the young men,<br/>
Played for dresses, weapons, wampum,<br/>
Played till midnight, played till morning,<br/>
Played until the Yenadizze,<br/>
Till the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Of their treasures had despoiled them,<br/>
Of the best of all their dresses,<br/>
Shirts of deer-skin, robes of ermine,<br/>
Belts of wampum, crests of feathers,<br/>
Warlike weapons, pipes and pouches.<br/>
Twenty eyes glared wildly at him,<br/>
Like the eyes of wolves glared at him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Said the lucky Pau-Puk-Keewis:<br/>
"In my wigwam I am lonely,<br/>
In my wanderings and adventures<br/>
I have need of a companion,<br/>
Fain would have a Meshinauwa,<br/>
An attendant and pipe-bearer.<br/>
I will venture all these winnings,<br/>
All these garments heaped about me,<br/>
All this wampum, all these feathers,<br/>
On a single throw will venture<br/>
All against the young man yonder!"<br/>
'T was a youth of sixteen summers,<br/>
'T was a nephew of Iagoo;<br/>
Face-in-a-Mist, the people called him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As the fire burns in a pipe-head<br/>
Dusky red beneath the ashes,<br/>
So beneath his shaggy eyebrows<br/>
Glowed the eyes of old Iagoo.<br/>
"Ugh!" he answered very fiercely;<br/>
"Ugh!" they answered all and each one.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Seized the wooden bowl the old man,<br/>
Closely in his bony fingers<br/>
Clutched the fatal bowl, Onagon,<br/>
Shook it fiercely and with fury,<br/>
Made the pieces ring together<br/>
As he threw them down before him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Red were both the great Kenabeeks,<br/>
Red the Ininewug, the wedge-men,<br/>
Red the Sheshebwug, the ducklings,<br/>
Black the four brass Ozawabeeks,<br/>
White alone the fish, the Keego;<br/>
Only five the pieces counted!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the smiling Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Shook the bowl and threw the pieces;<br/>
Lightly in the air he tossed them,<br/>
And they fell about him scattered;<br/>
Dark and bright the Ozawabeeks,<br/>
Red and white the other pieces,<br/>
And upright among the others<br/>
One Ininewug was standing,<br/>
Even as crafty Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Stood alone among the players,<br/>
Saying, "Five tens! mine the game is,"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Twenty eyes glared at him fiercely,<br/>
Like the eyes of wolves glared at him,<br/>
As he turned and left the wigwam,<br/>
Followed by his Meshinauwa,<br/>
By the nephew of Iagoo,<br/>
By the tall and graceful stripling,<br/>
Bearing in his arms the winnings,<br/>
Shirts of deer-skin, robes of ermine,<br/>
Belts of wampum, pipes and weapons.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Carry them," said Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Pointing with his fan of feathers,<br/>
"To my wigwam far to eastward,<br/>
On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hot and red with smoke and gambling<br/>
Were the eyes of Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
As he came forth to the freshness<br/>
Of the pleasant Summer morning.<br/>
All the birds were singing gayly,<br/>
All the streamlets flowing swiftly,<br/>
And the heart of Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Sang with pleasure as the birds sing,<br/>
Beat with triumph like the streamlets,<br/>
As he wandered through the village,<br/>
In the early gray of morning,<br/>
With his fan of turkey-feathers,<br/>
With his plumes and tufts of swan's down,<br/>
Till he reached the farthest wigwam,<br/>
Reached the lodge of Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Silent was it and deserted;<br/>
No one met him at the doorway,<br/>
No one came to bid him welcome;<br/>
But the birds were singing round it,<br/>
In and out and round the doorway,<br/>
Hopping, singing, fluttering, feeding,<br/>
And aloft upon the ridge-pole<br/>
Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,<br/>
Sat with fiery eyes, and, screaming,<br/>
Flapped his wings at Pau-Puk-Keewis.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"All are gone! the lodge is empty!"<br/>
Thus it was spake Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
In his heart resolving mischief<br/>
"Gone is wary Hiawatha,<br/>
Gone the silly Laughing Water,<br/>
Gone Nokomis, the old woman,<br/>
And the lodge is left unguarded!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
By the neck he seized the raven,<br/>
Whirled it round him like a rattle,<br/>
Like a medicine-pouch he shook it,<br/>
Strangled Kahgahgee, the raven,<br/>
From the ridge-pole of the wigwam<br/>
Left its lifeless body hanging,<br/>
As an insult to its master,<br/>
As a taunt to Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With a stealthy step he entered,<br/>
Round the lodge in wild disorder<br/>
Threw the household things about him,<br/>
Piled together in confusion<br/>
Bowls of wood and earthen kettles,<br/>
Robes of buffalo and beaver,<br/>
Skins of otter, lynx, and ermine,<br/>
As an insult to Nokomis,<br/>
As a taunt to Minnehaha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then departed Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Whistling, singing through the forest,<br/>
Whistling gayly to the squirrels,<br/>
Who from hollow boughs above him<br/>
Dropped their acorn-shells upon him,<br/>
Singing gayly to the wood birds,<br/>
Who from out the leafy darkness<br/>
Answered with a song as merry.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he climbed the rocky headlands,<br/>
Looking o'er the Gitche Gumee,<br/>
Perched himself upon their summit,<br/>
Waiting full of mirth and mischief<br/>
The return of Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Stretched upon his back he lay there;<br/>
Far below him splashed the waters,<br/>
Plashed and washed the dreamy waters;<br/>
Far above him swam the heavens,<br/>
Swam the dizzy, dreamy heavens;<br/>
Round him hovered, fluttered, rustled<br/>
Hiawatha's mountain chickens,<br/>
Flock-wise swept and wheeled about him,<br/>
Almost brushed him with their pinions.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he killed them as he lay there,<br/>
Slaughtered them by tens and twenties,<br/>
Threw their bodies down the headland,<br/>
Threw them on the beach below him,<br/>
Till at length Kayoshk, the sea-gull,<br/>
Perched upon a crag above them,<br/>
Shouted: "It is Pau-Puk-Keewis!<br/>
He is slaying us by hundreds!<br/>
Send a message to our brother,<br/>
Tidings send to Hiawatha!"<br/>

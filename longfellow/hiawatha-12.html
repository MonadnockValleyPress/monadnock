<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XII. The Son of the Evening Star</h2>
<p>
Can it be the sun descending<br/>
O'er the level plain of water?<br/>
Or the Red Swan floating, flying,<br/>
Wounded by the magic arrow,<br/>
Staining all the waves with crimson,<br/>
With the crimson of its life-blood,<br/>
Filling all the air with splendor,<br/>
With the splendor of its plumage?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yes; it is the sun descending,<br/>
Sinking down into the water;<br/>
All the sky is stained with purple,<br/>
All the water flushed with crimson!<br/>
No; it is the Red Swan floating,<br/>
Diving down beneath the water;<br/>
To the sky its wings are lifted,<br/>
With its blood the waves are reddened!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Over it the Star of Evening<br/>
Melts and trembles through the purple,<br/>
Hangs suspended in the twilight.<br/>
No; it is a bead of wampum<br/>
On the robes of the Great Spirit<br/>
As he passes through the twilight,<br/>
Walks in silence through the heavens.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This with joy beheld Iagoo<br/>
And he said in haste: "Behold it!<br/>
See the sacred Star of Evening!<br/>
You shall hear a tale of wonder,<br/>
Hear the story of Osseo,<br/>
Son of the Evening Star, Osseo!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Once, in days no more remembered,<br/>
Ages nearer the beginning,<br/>
When the heavens were closer to us,<br/>
And the Gods were more familiar,<br/>
In the North-land lived a hunter,<br/>
With ten young and comely daughters,<br/>
Tall and lithe as wands of willow;<br/>
Only Oweenee, the youngest,<br/>
She the wilful and the wayward,<br/>
She the silent, dreamy maiden,<br/>
Was the fairest of the sisters.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"All these women married warriors,<br/>
Married brave and haughty husbands;<br/>
Only Oweenee, the youngest,<br/>
Laughed and flouted all her lovers,<br/>
All her young and handsome suitors,<br/>
And then married old Osseo,<br/>
Old Osseo, poor and ugly,<br/>
Broken with age and weak with coughing,<br/>
Always coughing like a squirrel.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ah, but beautiful within him<br/>
Was the spirit of Osseo,<br/>
From the Evening Star descended,<br/>
Star of Evening, Star of Woman,<br/>
Star of tenderness and passion!<br/>
All its fire was in his bosom,<br/>
All its beauty in his spirit,<br/>
All its mystery in his being,<br/>
All its splendor in his language!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And her lovers, the rejected,<br/>
Handsome men with belts of wampum,<br/>
Handsome men with paint and feathers.<br/>
Pointed at her in derision,<br/>
Followed her with jest and laughter.<br/>
But she said: ‘I care not for you,<br/>
Care not for your belts of wampum,<br/>
Care not for your paint and feathers,<br/>
Care not for your jests and laughter;<br/>
I am happy with Osseo!'<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Once to some great feast invited,<br/>
Through the damp and dusk of evening,<br/>
Walked together the ten sisters,<br/>
Walked together with their husbands;<br/>
Slowly followed old Osseo,<br/>
With fair Oweenee beside him;<br/>
All the others chatted gayly,<br/>
These two only walked in silence.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"At the western sky Osseo<br/>
Gazed intent, as if imploring,<br/>
Often stopped and gazed imploring<br/>
At the trembling Star of Evening,<br/>
At the tender Star of Woman;<br/>
And they heard him murmur softly,<br/>
‘Ah, showain nemeshin, Nosa!<br/>
Pity, pity me, my father!'<br/>
</p>
<p>
"‘Listen!' said the eldest sister,<br/>
‘He is praying to his father!<br/>
What a pity that the old man<br/>
Does not stumble in the pathway,<br/>
Does not break his neck by falling!'<br/>
And they laughed till all the forest<br/>
Rang with their unseemly laughter.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"On their pathway through the woodlands<br/>
Lay an oak, by storms uprooted,<br/>
Lay the great trunk of an oak-tree,<br/>
Buried half in leaves and mosses,<br/>
Mouldering, crumbling, huge and hollow.<br/>
And Osseo, when he saw it,<br/>
Gave a shout, a cry of anguish,<br/>
Leaped into its yawning cavern,<br/>
At one end went in an old man,<br/>
Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly;<br/>
From the other came a young man,<br/>
Tall and straight and strong and handsome.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thus Osseo was transfigured,<br/>
Thus restored to youth and beauty;<br/>
But, alas for good Osseo,<br/>
And for Oweenee, the faithful!<br/>
Strangely, too, was she transfigured.<br/>
Changed into a weak old woman,<br/>
With a staff she tottered onward,<br/>
Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly!<br/>
And the sisters and their husbands<br/>
Laughed until the echoing forest<br/>
Rang with their unseemly laughter.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"But Osseo turned not from her,<br/>
Walked with slower step beside her,<br/>
Took her hand, as brown and withered<br/>
As an oak-leaf is in Winter,<br/>
Called her sweetheart, Nenemoosha,<br/>
Soothed her with soft words of kindness,<br/>
Till they reached the lodge of feasting,<br/>
Till they sat down in the wigwam,<br/>
Sacred to the Star of Evening,<br/>
To the tender Star of Woman.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Wrapt in visions, lost in dreaming,<br/>
At the banquet sat Osseo;<br/>
All were merry, all were happy,<br/>
All were joyous but Osseo.<br/>
Neither food nor drink he tasted,<br/>
Neither did he speak nor listen;<br/>
But as one bewildered sat he,<br/>
Looking dreamily and sadly,<br/>
First at Oweenee, then upward<br/>
At the gleaming sky above them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then a voice was heard, a whisper,<br/>
Coming from the starry distance,<br/>
Coming from the empty vastness,<br/>
Low, and musical, and tender;<br/>
And the voice said: ‘O Osseo!<br/>
O my son, my best beloved!<br/>
Broken are the spells that bound you,<br/>
All the charms of the magicians,<br/>
All the magic powers of evil;<br/>
Come to me; ascend, Osseo!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"‘Taste the food that stands before you:<br/>
It is blessed and enchanted,<br/>
It has magic virtues in it,<br/>
It will change you to a spirit.<br/>
All your bowls and all your kettles<br/>
Shall be wood and clay no longer;<br/>
But the bowls be changed to wampum,<br/>
And the kettles shall be silver;<br/>
They shall shine like shells of scarlet,<br/>
Like the fire shall gleam and glimmer.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"‘And the women shall no longer<br/>
Bear the dreary doom of labor,<br/>
But be changed to birds, and glisten<br/>
With the beauty of the starlight,<br/>
Painted with the dusky splendors<br/>
Of the skies and clouds of evening!'<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What Osseo heard as whispers,<br/>
What as words he comprehended,<br/>
Was but music to the others,<br/>
Music as of birds afar off,<br/>
Of the whippoorwill afar off,<br/>
Of the lonely Wawonaissa<br/>
Singing in the darksome forest.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then the lodge began to tremble,<br/>
Straight began to shake and tremble,<br/>
And they felt it rising, rising,<br/>
Slowly through the air ascending,<br/>
From the darkness of the tree-tops<br/>
Forth into the dewy starlight,<br/>
Till it passed the topmost branches;<br/>
And behold! the wooden dishes<br/>
All were changed to shells of scarlet!<br/>
And behold! the earthen kettles<br/>
All were changed to bowls of silver!<br/>
And the roof-poles of the wigwam<br/>
Were as glittering rods of silver,<br/>
And the roof of bark upon them<br/>
As the shining shards of beetles.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then Osseo gazed around him,<br/>
And he saw the nine fair sisters,<br/>
All the sisters and their husbands,<br/>
Changed to birds of various plumage.<br/>
Some were jays and some were magpies,<br/>
Others thrushes, others blackbirds;<br/>
And they hopped, and sang, and twittered,<br/>
Perked and fluttered all their feathers,<br/>
Strutted in their shining plumage,<br/>
And their tails like fans unfolded.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Only Oweenee, the youngest,<br/>
Was not changed, but sat in silence,<br/>
Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly,<br/>
Looking sadly at the others;<br/>
Till Osseo, gazing upward,<br/>
Gave another cry of anguish,<br/>
Such a cry as he had uttered<br/>
By the oak-tree in the forest.<br/>
"Then returned her youth and beauty,<br/>
And her soiled and tattered garments<br/>
Were transformed to robes of ermine,<br/>
And her staff became a feather,<br/>
Yes, a shining silver feather!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And again the wigwam trembled,<br/>
Swayed and rushed through airy currents,<br/>
Through transparent cloud and vapor,<br/>
And amid celestial splendors<br/>
On the Evening Star alighted,<br/>
As a snow-flake falls on snow-flake,<br/>
As a leaf drops on a river,<br/>
As the thistledown on water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Forth with cheerful words of welcome<br/>
Came the father of Osseo,<br/>
He with radiant locks of silver,<br/>
He with eyes serene and tender.<br/>
And he said: ‘My son, Osseo,<br/>
Hang the cage of birds you bring there,<br/>
Hang the cage with rods of silver,<br/>
And the birds with glistening feathers,<br/>
At the doorway of my wigwam.'<br/>
</p>
<p>
"At the door he hung the bird-cage,<br/>
And they entered in and gladly<br/>
Listened to Osseo's father,<br/>
Ruler of the Star of Evening,<br/>
As he said: ‘O my Osseo!<br/>
I have had compassion on you,<br/>
Given you back your youth and beauty,<br/>
Into birds of various plumage<br/>
Changed your sisters and their husbands;<br/>
Changed them thus because they mocked you<br/>
In the figure of the old man,<br/>
In that aspect sad and wrinkled,<br/>
Could not see your heart of passion,<br/>
Could not see your youth immortal;<br/>
Only Oweenee, the faithful,<br/>
Saw your naked heart and loved you.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"‘In the lodge that glimmers yonder,<br/>
In the little star that twinkles<br/>
Through the vapors, on the left hand,<br/>
Lives the envious Evil Spirit,<br/>
The Wabeno, the magician,<br/>
Who transformed you to an old man.<br/>
Take heed lest his beams fall on you,<br/>
For the rays he darts around him<br/>
Are the power of his enchantment,<br/>
Are the arrows that he uses.'<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Many years, in peace and quiet,<br/>
On the peaceful Star of Evening<br/>
Dwelt Osseo with his father;<br/>
Many years, in song and flutter,<br/>
At the doorway of the wigwam,<br/>
Hung the cage with rods of silver,<br/>
And fair Oweenee, the faithful,<br/>
Bore a son unto Osseo,<br/>
With the beauty of his mother,<br/>
With the courage of his father.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And the boy grew up and prospered,<br/>
And Osseo, to delight him,<br/>
Made him little bows and arrows,<br/>
Opened the great cage of silver,<br/>
And let loose his aunts and uncles,<br/>
All those birds with glossy feathers,<br/>
For his little son to shoot at.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Round and round they wheeled and darted,<br/>
Filled the Evening Star with music,<br/>
With their songs of joy and freedom<br/>
Filled the Evening Star with splendor,<br/>
With the fluttering of their plumage;<br/>
Till the boy, the little hunter,<br/>
Bent his bow and shot an arrow,<br/>
Shot a swift and fatal arrow,<br/>
And a bird, with shining feathers,<br/>
At his feet fell wounded sorely.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"But, O wondrous transformation!<br/>
'T was no bird he saw before him,<br/>
'T was a beautiful young woman,<br/>
With the arrow in her bosom!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"When her blood fell on the planet,<br/>
On the sacred Star of Evening,<br/>
Broken was the spell of magic,<br/>
Powerless was the strange enchantment,<br/>
And the youth, the fearless bowman,<br/>
Suddenly felt himself descending,<br/>
Held by unseen hands, but sinking<br/>
Downward through the empty spaces,<br/>
Downward through the clouds and vapors,<br/>
Till he rested on an island,<br/>
On an island, green and grassy,<br/>
Yonder in the Big-Sea-Water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"After him he saw descending<br/>
All the birds with shining feathers,<br/>
Fluttering, falling, wafted downward,<br/>
Like the painted leaves of Autumn;<br/>
And the lodge with poles of silver,<br/>
With its roof like wings of beetles,<br/>
Like the shining shards of beetles,<br/>
By the winds of heaven uplifted,<br/>
Slowly sank upon the island,<br/>
Bringing back the good Osseo,<br/>
Bringing Oweenee, the faithful.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then the birds, again transfigured,<br/>
Reassumed the shape of mortals,<br/>
Took their shape, but not their stature;<br/>
They remained as Little People,<br/>
Like the pygmies, the Puk-Wudjies,<br/>
And on pleasant nights of Summer,<br/>
When the Evening Star was shining,<br/>
Hand in hand they danced together<br/>
On the island's craggy headlands,<br/>
On the sand-beach low and level.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Still their glittering lodge is seen there,<br/>
On the tranquil Summer evenings,<br/>
And upon the shore the fisher<br/>
Sometimes hears their happy voices,<br/>
Sees them dancing in the starlight !"<br/>
</p>
<p>
When the story was completed,<br/>
When the wondrous tale was ended,<br/>
Looking round upon his listeners,<br/>
Solemnly Iagoo added:<br/>
"There are great men, I have known such,<br/>
Whom their people understand not,<br/>
Whom they even make a jest of,<br/>
Scoff and jeer at in derision.<br/>
From the story of Osseo<br/>
Let us learn the fate of jesters!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
All the wedding guests delighted<br/>
Listened to the marvellous story,<br/>
Listened laughing and applauding,<br/>
And they whispered to each other:<br/>
"Does he mean himself, I wonder?<br/>
And are we the aunts and uncles?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then again sang Chibiabos,<br/>
Sang a song of love and longing,<br/>
In those accents sweet and tender,<br/>
In those tones of pensive sadness,<br/>
Sang a maiden's lamentation<br/>
For her lover, her Algonquin.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"When I think of my beloved,<br/>
Ah me! think of my beloved,<br/>
When my heart is thinking of him,<br/>
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ah me! when I parted from him,<br/>
Round my neck he hung the wampum,<br/>
As a pledge, the snow-white wampum,<br/>
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"‘I will go with you,' he whispered,<br/>
‘Ah me! to your native country;<br/>
Let me go with you,' he whispered,<br/>
‘O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!'<br/>
‘Far away, away,' I answered,<br/>
‘Very far away,' I answered,<br/>
‘Ah me! is my native country,<br/>
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!'<br/>
</p>
<p>
"When I looked back to behold him,<br/>
Where we parted, to behold him,<br/>
After me he still was gazing,<br/>
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"By the tree he still was standing,<br/>
By the fallen tree was standing,<br/>
That had dropped into the water,<br/>
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!<br/>
"When I think of my beloved,<br/>
Ah me! think of my beloved,<br/>
When my heart is thinking of him,<br/>
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!"<br/>
Such was Hiawatha's Wedding,<br/>
Such the dance of Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Such the story of Iagoo,<br/>
Such the songs of Chibiabos;<br/>
Thus the wedding banquet ended,<br/>
And the wedding guests departed,<br/>
Leaving Hiawatha happy<br/>
With the night and Minnehaha.<br/>

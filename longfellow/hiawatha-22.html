<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XXII. Hiawatha's Departure</h2>
<p>
By the shore of Gitche Gumee,<br/>
By the shining Big-Sea-Water,<br/>
At the doorway of his wigwam,<br/>
In the pleasant Summer morning,<br/>
Hiawatha stood and waited.<br/>
All the air was full of freshness,<br/>
All the earth was bright and joyous,<br/>
And before him, through the sunshine,<br/>
Westward toward the neighboring forest<br/>
Passed in golden swarms the Ahmo,<br/>
Passed the bees, the honey-makers,<br/>
Burning, singing in the sunshine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Bright above him shone the heavens,<br/>
Level spread the lake before him;<br/>
From its bosom leaped the sturgeon,<br/>
Sparkling, flashing in the sunshine;<br/>
On its margin the great forest<br/>
Stood reflected in the water,<br/>
Every tree-top had its shadow,<br/>
Motionless beneath the water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the brow of Hiawatha<br/>
Gone was every trace of sorrow,<br/>
As the fog from off the water,<br/>
As the mist from off the meadow.<br/>
With a smile of joy and triumph,<br/>
With a look of exultation,<br/>
As of one who in a vision<br/>
Sees what is to be, but is not,<br/>
Stood and waited Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Toward the sun his hands were lifted,<br/>
Both the palms spread out against it,<br/>
And between the parted fingers<br/>
Fell the sunshine on his features,<br/>
Flecked with light his naked shoulders,<br/>
As it falls and flecks an oak-tree<br/>
Through the rifted leaves and branches.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O'er the water floating, flying,<br/>
Something in the hazy distance,<br/>
Something in the mists of morning,<br/>
Loomed and lifted from the water,<br/>
Now seemed floating, now seemed flying,<br/>
Coming nearer, nearer, nearer.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Was it Shingebis the diver?<br/>
Or the pelican, the Shada?<br/>
Or the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah?<br/>
Or the white goose, Waw-be-wawa,<br/>
With the water dripping, flashing,<br/>
From its glossy neck and feathers?<br/>
</p>
<p>
It was neither goose nor diver,<br/>
Neither pelican nor heron,<br/>
O'er the water floating, flying,<br/>
Through the shining mist of morning,<br/>
But a birch canoe with paddles,<br/>
Rising, sinking on the water,<br/>
Dripping, flashing in the sunshine;<br/>
And within it came a people<br/>
From the distant land of Wabun,<br/>
From the farthest realms of morning<br/>
Came the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet,<br/>
He the Priest of Prayer, the Pale-face,<br/>
With his guides and his companions.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the noble Hiawatha,<br/>
With his hands aloft extended,<br/>
Held aloft in sign of welcome,<br/>
Waited, full of exultation,<br/>
Till the birch canoe with paddles<br/>
Grated on the shining pebbles,<br/>
Stranded on the sandy margin,<br/>
Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,<br/>
With the cross upon his bosom,<br/>
Landed on the sandy margin.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the joyous Hiawatha<br/>
Cried aloud and spake in this wise:<br/>
"Beautiful is the sun, O strangers,<br/>
When you come so far to see us!<br/>
All our town in peace awaits you,<br/>
All our doors stand open for you;<br/>
You shall enter all our wigwams,<br/>
For the heart's right hand we give you.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Never bloomed the earth so gayly,<br/>
Never shone the sun so brightly,<br/>
As to-day they shine and blossom<br/>
When you come so far to see us!<br/>
Never was our lake so tranquil,<br/>
Nor so free from rocks, and sand-bars;<br/>
For your birch canoe in passing<br/>
Has removed both rock and sand-bar.<br/>
Never before had our tobacco<br/>
Such a sweet and pleasant flavor,<br/>
Never the broad leaves of our cornfields<br/>
Were so beautiful to look on,<br/>
As they seem to us this morning,<br/>
When you come so far to see us!'<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the Black-Robe chief made answer,<br/>
Stammered in his speech a little,<br/>
Speaking words yet unfamiliar:<br/>
"Peace be with you, Hiawatha,<br/>
Peace be with you and your people,<br/>
Peace of prayer, and peace of pardon,<br/>
Peace of Christ, and joy of Mary!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the generous Hiawatha<br/>
Led the strangers to his wigwam,<br/>
Seated them on skins of bison,<br/>
Seated them on skins of ermine,<br/>
And the careful old Nokomis<br/>
Brought them food in bowls of basswood,<br/>
Water brought in birchen dippers,<br/>
And the calumet, the peace-pipe,<br/>
Filled and lighted for their smoking.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All the old men of the village,<br/>
All the warriors of the nation,<br/>
All the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,<br/>
The magicians, the Wabenos,<br/>
And the Medicine-men, the Medas,<br/>
Came to bid the strangers welcome;<br/>
"It is well", they said, "O brothers,<br/>
That you come so far to see us!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
In a circle round the doorway,<br/>
With their pipes they sat in silence,<br/>
Waiting to behold the strangers,<br/>
Waiting to receive their message;<br/>
Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,<br/>
From the wigwam came to greet them,<br/>
Stammering in his speech a little,<br/>
Speaking words yet unfamiliar;<br/>
"It is well," they said, "O brother,<br/>
That you come so far to see us!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet,<br/>
Told his message to the people,<br/>
Told the purport of his mission,<br/>
Told them of the Virgin Mary,<br/>
And her blessed Son, the Saviour,<br/>
How in distant lands and ages<br/>
He had lived on earth as we do;<br/>
How he fasted, prayed, and labored;<br/>
How the Jews, the tribe accursed,<br/>
Mocked him, scourged him, crucified him;<br/>
How he rose from where they laid him,<br/>
Walked again with his disciples,<br/>
And ascended into heaven.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the chiefs made answer, saying:<br/>
"We have listened to your message,<br/>
We have heard your words of wisdom,<br/>
We will think on what you tell us.<br/>
It is well for us, O brothers,<br/>
That you come so far to see us!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then they rose up and departed<br/>
Each one homeward to his wigwam,<br/>
To the young men and the women<br/>
Told the story of the strangers<br/>
Whom the Master of Life had sent them<br/>
From the shining land of Wabun.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Heavy with the heat and silence<br/>
Grew the afternoon of Summer;<br/>
With a drowsy sound the forest<br/>
Whispered round the sultry wigwam,<br/>
With a sound of sleep the water<br/>
Rippled on the beach below it;<br/>
From the cornfields shrill and ceaseless<br/>
Sang the grasshopper, Pah-puk-keena;<br/>
And the guests of Hiawatha,<br/>
Weary with the heat of Summer,<br/>
Slumbered in the sultry wigwam.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Slowly o'er the simmering landscape<br/>
Fell the evening's dusk and coolness,<br/>
And the long and level sunbeams<br/>
Shot their spears into the forest,<br/>
Breaking through its shields of shadow,<br/>
Rushed into each secret ambush,<br/>
Searched each thicket, dingle, hollow;<br/>
Still the guests of Hiawatha<br/>
Slumbered in the silent wigwam.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From his place rose Hiawatha,<br/>
Bade farewell to old Nokomis,<br/>
Spake in whispers, spake in this wise,<br/>
Did not wake the guests, that slumbered.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I am going, O Nokomis,<br/>
On a long and distant journey,<br/>
To the portals of the Sunset.<br/>
To the regions of the home-wind,<br/>
Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin.<br/>
But these guests I leave behind me,<br/>
In your watch and ward I leave them;<br/>
See that never harm comes near them,<br/>
See that never fear molests them,<br/>
Never danger nor suspicion,<br/>
Never want of food or shelter,<br/>
In the lodge of Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Forth into the village went he,<br/>
Bade farewell to all the warriors,<br/>
Bade farewell to all the young men,<br/>
Spake persuading, spake in this wise:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I am going, O my people,<br/>
On a long and distant journey;<br/>
Many moons and many winters<br/>
Will have come, and will have vanished,<br/>
Ere I come again to see you.<br/>
But my guests I leave behind me;<br/>
Listen to their words of wisdom,<br/>
Listen to the truth they tell you,<br/>
For the Master of Life has sent them<br/>
From the land of light and morning!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the shore stood Hiawatha,<br/>
Turned and waved his hand at parting;<br/>
On the clear and luminous water<br/>
Launched his birch canoe for sailing,<br/>
From the pebbles of the margin<br/>
Shoved it forth into the water;<br/>
Whispered to it, "Westward! westward!"<br/>
And with speed it darted forward.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the evening sun descending<br/>
Set the clouds on fire with redness,<br/>
Burned the broad sky, like a prairie,<br/>
Left upon the level water<br/>
One long track and trail of splendor,<br/>
Down whose stream, as down a river,<br/>
Westward, westward Hiawatha<br/>
Sailed into the fiery sunset,<br/>
Sailed into the purple vapors,<br/>
Sailed into the dusk of evening.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the people from the margin<br/>
Watched him floating, rising, sinking,<br/>
Till the birch canoe seemed lifted<br/>
High into that sea of splendor,<br/>
Till it sank into the vapors<br/>
Like the new moon slowly, slowly<br/>
Sinking in the purple distance.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And they said, "Farewell forever!"<br/>
Said, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"<br/>
And the forests, dark and lonely,<br/>
Moved through all their depths of darkness,<br/>
Sighed, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"<br/>
And the waves upon the margin<br/>
Rising, rippling on the pebbles,<br/>
Sobbed, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"<br/>
And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,<br/>
From her haunts among the fen-lands,<br/>
Screamed, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus departed Hiawatha,<br/>
Hiawatha the Beloved,<br/>
In the glory of the sunset,<br/>
In the purple mists of evening,<br/>
To the regions of the home-wind,<br/>
Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,<br/>
To the Islands of the Blessed,<br/>
To the Kingdom of Ponemah,<br/>
To the Land of the Hereafter!<br/>
</p>
<p>THE END</p>

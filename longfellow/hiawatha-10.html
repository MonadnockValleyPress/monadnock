<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>X. Hiawatha's Wooing</h2>
<p>
"As unto the bow the cord is,<br/>
So unto the man is woman;<br/>
Though she bends him, she obeys him,<br/>
Though she draws him, yet she follows;<br/>
Useless each without the other!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus the youthful Hiawatha<br/>
Said within himself and pondered,<br/>
Much perplexed by various feelings,<br/>
Listless, longing, hoping, fearing,<br/>
Dreaming still of Minnehaha,<br/>
Of the lovely Laughing Water,<br/>
In the land of the Dacotahs.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Wed a maiden of your people,"<br/>
Warning said the old Nokomis;<br/>
"Go not eastward, go not westward,<br/>
For a stranger, whom we know not!<br/>
Like a fire upon the hearth-stone<br/>
Is a neighbor's homely daughter,<br/>
Like the starlight or the moonlight<br/>
Is the handsomest of strangers!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus dissuading spake Nokomis,<br/>
And my Hiawatha answered<br/>
Only this: "Dear old Nokomis,<br/>
Very pleasant is the firelight,<br/>
But I like the starlight better,<br/>
Better do I like the moonlight!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Gravely then said old Nokomis:<br/>
"Bring not here an idle maiden,<br/>
Bring not here a useless woman,<br/>
Hands unskilful, feet unwilling;<br/>
Bring a wife with nimble fingers,<br/>
Heart and hand that move together,<br/>
Feet that run on willing errands!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Smiling answered Hiawatha:<br/>
"In the land of the Dacotahs<br/>
Lives the Arrow-maker's daughter,<br/>
Minnehaha, Laughing Water,<br/>
Handsomest of all the women.<br/>
I will bring her to your wigwam,<br/>
She shall run upon your errands,<br/>
Be your starlight, moonlight, firelight,<br/>
Be the sunlight of my people!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Still dissuading said Nokomis:<br/>
"Bring not to my lodge a stranger<br/>
From the land of the Dacotahs!<br/>
Very fierce are the Dacotahs,<br/>
Often is there war between us,<br/>
There are feuds yet unforgotten,<br/>
Wounds that ache and still may open!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Laughing answered Hiawatha:<br/>
"For that reason, if no other,<br/>
Would I wed the fair Dacotah,<br/>
That our tribes might be united,<br/>
That old feuds might be forgotten,<br/>
And old wounds be healed forever!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus departed Hiawatha<br/>
To the land of the Dacotahs,<br/>
To the land of handsome women;<br/>
Striding over moor and meadow,<br/>
Through interminable forests,<br/>
Through uninterrupted silence.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With his moccasins of magic,<br/>
At each stride a mile he measured;<br/>
Yet the way seemed long before him,<br/>
And his heart outran his footsteps;<br/>
And he journeyed without resting,<br/>
Till he heard the cataract's laughter,<br/>
Heard the Falls of Minnehaha<br/>
Calling to him through the silence.<br/>
"Pleasant is the sound!" he murmured,<br/>
"Pleasant is the voice that calls me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the outskirts of the forests,<br/>
'Twixt the shadow and the sunshine,<br/>
Herds of fallow deer were feeding,<br/>
But they saw not Hiawatha;<br/>
To his bow he whispered, "Fail not!"<br/>
To his arrow whispered, "Swerve not!"<br/>
Sent it singing on its errand,<br/>
To the red heart of the roebuck;<br/>
Threw the deer across his shoulder,<br/>
And sped forward without pausing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
At the doorway of his wigwam<br/>
Sat the ancient Arrow-maker,<br/>
In the land of the Dacotahs,<br/>
Making arrow-heads of jasper,<br/>
Arrow-heads of chalcedony.<br/>
At his side, in all her beauty,<br/>
Sat the lovely Minnehaha,<br/>
Sat his daughter, Laughing Water,<br/>
Plaiting mats of flags and rushes<br/>
Of the past the old man's thoughts were,<br/>
And the maiden's of the future.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He was thinking, as he sat there,<br/>
Of the days when with such arrows<br/>
He had struck the deer and bison,<br/>
On the Muskoday, the meadow;<br/>
Shot the wild goose, flying southward<br/>
On the wing, the clamorous Wawa;<br/>
Thinking of the great war-parties,<br/>
How they came to buy his arrows,<br/>
Could not fight without his arrows.<br/>
Ah, no more such noble warriors<br/>
Could be found on earth as they were!<br/>
Now the men were all like women,<br/>
Only used their tongues for weapons!<br/>
</p>
<p>
She was thinking of a hunter,<br/>
From another tribe and country,<br/>
Young and tall and very handsome,<br/>
Who one morning, in the Spring-time,<br/>
Came to buy her father's arrows,<br/>
Sat and rested in the wigwam,<br/>
Lingered long about the doorway,<br/>
Looking back as he departed.<br/>
She had heard her father praise him,<br/>
Praise his courage and his wisdom;<br/>
Would he come again for arrows<br/>
To the Falls of Minnehaha?<br/>
On the mat her hands lay idle,<br/>
And her eyes were very dreamy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through their thoughts they heard a footstep,<br/>
Heard a rustling in the branches,<br/>
And with glowing cheek and forehead,<br/>
With the deer upon his shoulders,<br/>
Suddenly from out the woodlands<br/>
Hiawatha stood before them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Straight the ancient Arrow-maker<br/>
Looked up gravely from his labor,<br/>
Laid aside the unfinished arrow,<br/>
Bade him enter at the doorway,<br/>
Saying, as he rose to meet him,<br/>
"Hiawatha, you are welcome!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
At the feet of Laughing Water<br/>
Hiawatha laid his burden,<br/>
Threw the red deer from his shoulders;<br/>
And the maiden looked up at him,<br/>
Looked up from her mat of rushes,<br/>
Said with gentle look and accent,<br/>
"You are welcome, Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Very spacious was the wigwam,<br/>
Made of deer-skins dressed and whitened,<br/>
With the Gods of the Dacotahs<br/>
Drawn and painted on its curtains,<br/>
And so tall the doorway, hardly<br/>
Hiawatha stooped to enter,<br/>
Hardly touched his eagle-feathers<br/>
As he entered at the doorway.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then uprose the Laughing Water,<br/>
From the ground fair Minnehaha,<br/>
Laid aside her mat unfinished,<br/>
Brought forth food and set before them,<br/>
Water brought them from the brooklet,<br/>
Gave them food in earthen vessels,<br/>
Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood,<br/>
Listened while the guest was speaking,<br/>
Listened while her father answered,<br/>
But not once her lips she opened,<br/>
Not a single word she uttered.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yes, as in a dream she listened<br/>
To the words of Hiawatha,<br/>
As he talked of old Nokomis,<br/>
Who had nursed him in his childhood,<br/>
As he told of his companions,<br/>
Chibiabos, the musician,<br/>
And the very strong man, Kwasind,<br/>
And of happiness and plenty<br/>
In the land of the Ojibways,<br/>
In the pleasant land and peaceful.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"After many years of warfare,<br/>
Many years of strife and bloodshed,<br/>
There is peace between the Ojibways<br/>
And the tribe of the Dacotahs."<br/>
Thus continued Hiawatha,<br/>
And then added, speaking slowly,<br/>
"That this peace may last forever,<br/>
And our hands be clasped more closely,<br/>
And our hearts be more united,<br/>
Give me as my wife this maiden,<br/>
Minnehaha, Laughing Water,<br/>
Loveliest of Dacotah women!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the ancient Arrow-maker<br/>
Paused a moment ere he answered,<br/>
Smoked a little while in silence,<br/>
Looked at Hiawatha proudly,<br/>
Fondly looked at Laughing Water,<br/>
And made answer very gravely:<br/>
"Yes, if Minnehaha wishes;<br/>
Let your heart speak, Minnehaha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the lovely Laughing Water<br/>
Seemed more lovely as she stood there,<br/>
Neither willing nor reluctant,<br/>
As she went to Hiawatha,<br/>
Softly took the seat beside him,<br/>
While she said, and blushed to say it,<br/>
"I will follow you, my husband!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
This was Hiawatha's wooing!<br/>
Thus it was he won the daughter<br/>
Of the ancient Arrow-maker,<br/>
In the land of the Dacotahs!<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the wigwam he departed,<br/>
Leading with him Laughing Water;<br/>
Hand in hand they went together,<br/>
Through the woodland and the meadow,<br/>
Left the old man standing lonely<br/>
At the doorway of his wigwam,<br/>
Heard the Falls of Minnehaha<br/>
Calling to them from the distance,<br/>
Crying to them from afar off,<br/>
"Fare thee well, O Minnehaha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the ancient Arrow-maker<br/>
Turned again unto his labor,<br/>
Sat down by his sunny doorway,<br/>
Murmuring to himself, and saying:<br/>
"Thus it is our daughters leave us,<br/>
Those we love, and those who love us!<br/>
Just when they have learned to help us,<br/>
When we are old and lean upon them,<br/>
Comes a youth with flaunting feathers,<br/>
With his flute of reeds, a stranger<br/>
Wanders piping through the village,<br/>
Beckons to the fairest maiden,<br/>
And she follows where he leads her,<br/>
Leaving all things for the stranger!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pleasant was the journey homeward,<br/>
Through interminable forests,<br/>
Over meadow, over mountain,<br/>
Over river, hill, and hollow.<br/>
Short it seemed to Hiawatha,<br/>
Though they journeyed very slowly,<br/>
Though his pace he checked and slackened<br/>
To the steps of Laughing Water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Over wide and rushing rivers<br/>
In his arms he bore the maiden;<br/>
Light he thought her as a feather,<br/>
As the plume upon his head-gear;<br/>
Cleared the tangled pathway for her,<br/>
Bent aside the swaying branches,<br/>
Made at night a lodge of branches,<br/>
And a bed with boughs of hemlock,<br/>
And a fire before the doorway<br/>
With the dry cones of the pine-tree.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All the travelling winds went with them,<br/>
O'er the meadows, through the forest;<br/>
All the stars of night looked at them,<br/>
Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber;<br/>
From his ambush in the oak-tree<br/>
Peeped the squirrel, Adjidaumo,<br/>
Watched with eager eyes the lovers;<br/>
And the rabbit, the Wabasso,<br/>
Scampered from the path before them,<br/>
Peering, peeping from his burrow,<br/>
Sat erect upon his haunches,<br/>
Watched with curious eyes the lovers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pleasant was the journey homeward!<br/>
All the birds sang loud and sweetly<br/>
Songs of happiness and heart's-ease;<br/>
Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,<br/>
"Happy are you, Hiawatha,<br/>
Having such a wife to love you!"<br/>
Sang the robin, the Opechee,<br/>
"Happy are you, Laughing Water,<br/>
Having such a noble husband!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the sky the sun benignant<br/>
Looked upon them through the branches,<br/>
Saying to them, "O my children,<br/>
Love is sunshine, hate is shadow,<br/>
Life is checkered shade and sunshine,<br/>
Rule by love, O Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the sky the moon looked at them,<br/>
Filled the lodge with mystic splendors,<br/>
Whispered to them, "O my children,<br/>
Day is restless, night is quiet,<br/>
Man imperious, woman feeble;<br/>
Half is mine, although I follow;<br/>
Rule by patience, Laughing Water!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus it was they journeyed homeward;<br/>
Thus it was that Hiawatha<br/>
To the lodge of old Nokomis<br/>
Brought the moonlight, starlight, firelight,<br/>
Brought the sunshine of his people,<br/>
Minnehaha, Laughing Water,<br/>
Handsomest of all the women<br/>
In the land of the Dacotahs,<br/>
In the land of handsome women.<br/>

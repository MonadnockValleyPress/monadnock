<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XV. Hiawatha's Lamentation</h2>
<p>
In those days the Evil Spirits,<br/>
All the Manitos of mischief,<br/>
Fearing Hiawatha's wisdom,<br/>
And his love for Chibiabos,<br/>
Jealous of their faithful friendship,<br/>
And their noble words and actions,<br/>
Made at length a league against them,<br/>
To molest them and destroy them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hiawatha, wise and wary,<br/>
Often said to Chibiabos,<br/>
"O my brother! do not leave me,<br/>
Lest the Evil Spirits harm you!"<br/>
Chibiabos, young and heedless,<br/>
Laughing shook his coal-black tresses,<br/>
Answered ever sweet and childlike,<br/>
"Do not fear for me, O brother!<br/>
Harm and evil come not near me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once when Peboan, the Winter,<br/>
Roofed with ice the Big-Sea-Water,<br/>
When the snow-flakes, whirling downward,<br/>
Hissed among the withered oak-leaves,<br/>
Changed the pine-trees into wigwams,<br/>
Covered all the earth with silence,<br/>
Armed with arrows, shod with snow-shoes,<br/>
Heeding not his brother's warning,<br/>
Fearing not the Evil Spirits,<br/>
Forth to hunt the deer with antlers<br/>
All alone went Chibiabos.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Right across the Big-Sea-Water<br/>
Sprang with speed the deer before him.<br/>
With the wind and snow he followed,<br/>
O'er the treacherous ice he followed,<br/>
Wild with all the fierce commotion<br/>
And the rapture of the hunting.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But beneath, the Evil Spirits<br/>
Lay in ambush, waiting for him,<br/>
Broke the treacherous ice beneath him,<br/>
Dragged him downward to the bottom,<br/>
Buried in the sand his body.<br/>
Unktahee, the god of water,<br/>
He the god of the Dacotahs,<br/>
Drowned him in the deep abysses<br/>
Of the lake of Gitche Gumee.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the headlands Hiawatha<br/>
Sent forth such a wail of anguish,<br/>
Such a fearful lamentation,<br/>
That the bison paused to listen,<br/>
And the wolves howled from the prairies,<br/>
And the thunder in the distance<br/>
Starting answered "Baim-wawa!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then his face with black he painted,<br/>
With his robe his head he covered,<br/>
In his wigwam sat lamenting,<br/>
Seven long weeks he sat lamenting,<br/>
Uttering still this moan of sorrow:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"He is dead, the sweet musician!<br/>
He the sweetest of all singers!<br/>
He has gone from us forever,<br/>
He has moved a little nearer<br/>
To the Master of all music,<br/>
To the Master of all singing!<br/>
O my brother, Chibiabos!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the melancholy fir-trees<br/>
Waved their dark green fans above him,<br/>
Waved their purple cones above him,<br/>
Sighing with him to console him,<br/>
Mingling with his lamentation<br/>
Their complaining, their lamenting.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Came the Spring, and all the forest<br/>
Looked in vain for Chibiabos;<br/>
Sighed the rivulet, Sebowisha,<br/>
Sighed the rushes in the meadow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the tree-tops sang the bluebird,<br/>
Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,<br/>
"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!<br/>
He is dead, the sweet musician!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the wigwam sang the robin,<br/>
Sang the robin, the Opechee,<br/>
"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!<br/>
He is dead, the sweetest singer!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And at night through all the forest<br/>
Went the whippoorwill complaining,<br/>
Wailing went the Wawonaissa,<br/>
"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!<br/>
He is dead, the sweet musician!<br/>
He the sweetest of all singers!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the Medicine-men, the Medas,<br/>
The magicians, the Wabenos,<br/>
And the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,<br/>
Came to visit Hiawatha;<br/>
Built a Sacred Lodge beside him,<br/>
To appease him, to console him,<br/>
Walked in silent, grave procession,<br/>
Bearing each a pouch of healing,<br/>
Skin of beaver, lynx, or otter,<br/>
Filled with magic roots and simples,<br/>
Filled with very potent medicines.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When he heard their steps approaching,<br/>
Hiawatha ceased lamenting,<br/>
Called no more on Chibiabos;<br/>
Naught he questioned, naught he answered,<br/>
But his mournful head uncovered,<br/>
From his face the mourning colors<br/>
Washed he slowly and in silence,<br/>
Slowly and in silence followed<br/>
Onward to the Sacred Wigwam.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There a magic drink they gave him,<br/>
Made of Nahma-wusk, the spearmint,<br/>
And Wabeno-wusk, the yarrow,<br/>
Roots of power, and herbs of healing;<br/>
Beat their drums, and shook their rattles;<br/>
Chanted singly and in chorus,<br/>
Mystic songs like these, they chanted.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I myself, myself! behold me!<br/>
'T is the great Gray Eagle talking;<br/>
Come, ye white crows, come and hear him!<br/>
The loud-speaking thunder helps me;<br/>
All the unseen spirits help me;<br/>
I can hear their voices calling,<br/>
All around the sky I hear them!<br/>
I can blow you strong, my brother,<br/>
I can heal you, Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,<br/>
"Wayha-way!" the mystic chorus.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Friends of mine are all the serpents!<br/>
Hear me shake my skin of hen-hawk!<br/>
Mahng, the white loon, I can kill him;<br/>
I can shoot your heart and kill it!<br/>
I can blow you strong, my brother,<br/>
I can heal you, Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,<br/>
"Wayhaway!" the mystic chorus.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I myself, myself! the prophet!<br/>
When I speak the wigwam trembles,<br/>
Shakes the Sacred Lodge with terror,<br/>
Hands unseen begin to shake it!<br/>
When I walk, the sky I tread on<br/>
Bends and makes a noise beneath me!<br/>
I can blow you strong, my brother!<br/>
Rise and speak, O Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,<br/>
"Way-ha-way!" the mystic chorus.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then they shook their medicine-pouches<br/>
O'er the head of Hiawatha,<br/>
Danced their medicine-dance around him;<br/>
And upstarting wild and haggard,<br/>
Like a man from dreams awakened,<br/>
He was healed of all his madness.<br/>
As the clouds are swept from heaven,<br/>
Straightway from his brain departed<br/>
All his moody melancholy;<br/>
As the ice is swept from rivers,<br/>
Straightway from his heart departed<br/>
All his sorrow and affliction.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then they summoned Chibiabos<br/>
From his grave beneath the waters,<br/>
From the sands of Gitche Gumee<br/>
Summoned Hiawatha's brother.<br/>
And so mighty was the magic<br/>
Of that cry and invocation,<br/>
That he heard it as he lay there<br/>
Underneath the Big-Sea-Water;<br/>
From the sand he rose and listened,<br/>
Heard the music and the singing,<br/>
Came, obedient to the summons,<br/>
To the doorway of the wigwam,<br/>
But to enter they forbade him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through a chink a coal they gave him,<br/>
Through the door a burning fire-brand;<br/>
Ruler in the Land of Spirits,<br/>
Ruler o'er the dead, they made him,<br/>
Telling him a fire to kindle<br/>
For all those that died thereafter,<br/>
Camp-fires for their night encampments<br/>
On their solitary journey<br/>
To the kingdom of Ponemah,<br/>
To the land of the Hereafter.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the village of his childhood,<br/>
From the homes of those who knew him,<br/>
Passing silent through the forest,<br/>
Like a smoke-wreath wafted sideways,<br/>
Slowly vanished Chibiabos!<br/>
Where he passed, the branches moved not,<br/>
Where he trod, the grasses bent not,<br/>
And the fallen leaves of last year<br/>
Made no sound beneath his footstep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Four whole days he journeyed onward<br/>
Down the pathway of the dead men;<br/>
On the dead-man's strawberry feasted,<br/>
Crossed the melancholy river,<br/>
On the swinging log he crossed it,<br/>
Came unto the Lake of Silver,<br/>
In the Stone Canoe was carried<br/>
To the Islands of the Blessed,<br/>
To the land of ghosts and shadows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On that journey, moving slowly,<br/>
Many weary spirits saw he,<br/>
Panting under heavy burdens,<br/>
Laden with war-clubs, bows and arrows,<br/>
Robes of fur, and pots and kettles,<br/>
And with food that friends had given<br/>
For that solitary journey.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ay! why do the living," said they,<br/>
"Lay such heavy burdens on us!<br/>
Better were it to go naked,<br/>
Better were it to go fasting,<br/>
Than to bear such heavy burdens<br/>
On our long and weary journey!"<br/>
Forth then issued Hiawatha,<br/>
Wandered eastward, wandered westward,<br/>
Teaching men the use of simples<br/>
And the antidotes for poisons,<br/>
And the cure of all diseases.<br/>
Thus was first made known to mortals<br/>
All the mystery of Medamin,<br/>
All the sacred art of healing.<br/>

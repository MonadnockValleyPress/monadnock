<h1>Evangeline</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Part the Second</h2>
<h2>Section III</h2>
<p>
Near to the bank of the river, o'ershadowed by oaks from whose branches<br/>
Garlands of Spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted,<br/>
Such as the Druids cut down with golden hatchets at Yule-tide,<br/>
Stood, secluded and still, the house of the herdsman. A garden<br/>
Girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms,<br/>
Filling the air with fragrance. The house itself was of timbers<br/>
Hewn from the cypress-tree, and carefully fitted together.<br/>
Large and low was the roof; and on slender columns supported,<br/>
Rose-wreathed, vine-encircled, a broad and spacious veranda,<br/>
Haunt of the humming-bird and the bee, extended around it.<br/>
At each end of the house, amid the flowers of the garden,<br/>
Stationed the dove-cots were, as love's perpetual symbol,<br/>
Scenes of endless wooing, and endless contentions of rivals.<br/>
Silence reigned o'er the place. The line of shadow and sunshine<br/>
Ran near the tops of the trees; but the house itself was in shadow,<br/>
And from its chimney-top, ascending and slowly expanding<br/>
Into the evening air, a thin blue column of smoke rose.<br/>
In the rear of the house, from the garden gate, ran a pathway<br/>
Through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,<br/>
Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending.<br/>
Full in his track of light, like ships with shadowy canvas<br/>
Hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,<br/>
Stood a cluster of trees, with tangled cordage of grapevines.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,<br/>
Mounted upon his horse, with Spanish saddle and stirrups,<br/>
Sat a herdsman, arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin.<br/>
Broad and brown was the face that from under the Spanish sombrero<br/>
Gazed on the peaceful scene, with the lordly look of its master.<br/>
Round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing<br/>
Quietly in the meadows, and breathing the vapory freshness<br/>
That uprose from the river, and spread itself over the landscape.<br/>
Slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side, and expanding<br/>
Fully his broad, deep chest, he blew a blast, that resounded<br/>
Wildly and sweet and far, through the still damp air of the evening.<br/>
Suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle<br/>
Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean.<br/>
Silent a moment they gazed, then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie,<br/>
And the whole mass became a cloud, a shade in the distance.<br/>
Then, as the herdsman turned to the house, through the gate of the garden<br/>
Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him.<br/>
Suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement, and forward<br/>
Pushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder;<br/>
When they beheld his face, they recognized Basil the blacksmith.<br/>
Hearty his welcome was, as he led his guests to the garden.<br/>
There in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer<br/>
Gave they vent to their hearts, and renewed their friendly embraces,<br/>
Laughing and weeping by turns, or sitting silent and thoughtful.<br/>
Thoughtful, for Gabriel came not; and now dark doubts and misgivings<br/>
Stole o'er the maiden's heart; and Basil, somewhat embarrassed,<br/>
Broke the silence and said, "If you came by the Atchafalaya,<br/>
How have you nowhere encountered my Gabriel's boat on the bayous?"<br/>
Over Evangeline's face at the words of Basil a shade passed.<br/>
Tears came into her eyes, and she said, with a tremulous accent,<br/>
"Gone? is Gabriel gone?" and, concealing her face on his shoulder,<br/>
All her o'erburdened heart gave way, and she wept and lamented.<br/>
Then the good Basil said,&mdash;and his voice grew blithe as he said it,&mdash;<br/>
"Be of good cheer, my child; it is only today he departed.<br/>
Foolish boy! he has left me alone with my herds and my horses.<br/>
Moody and restless grown, and tried and troubled, his spirit<br/>
Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence.<br/>
Thinking ever of thee, uncertain and sorrowful ever,<br/>
Ever silent, or speaking only of thee and his troubles,<br/>
He at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,<br/>
Tedious even to me, that at length I bethought me, and sent him<br/>
Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with the Spaniards.<br/>
Thence he will follow the Indian trails to the Ozark Mountains,<br/>
Hunting for furs in the forests, on rivers trapping the beaver.<br/>
Therefore be of good cheer; we will follow the fugitive lover;<br/>
He is not far on his way, and the Fates and the streams are against him.<br/>
Up and away tomorrow, and through the red dew of the morning,<br/>
We will follow him fast, and bring him back to his prison."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then glad voices were heard, and up from the banks of the river,<br/>
Borne aloft on his comrades' arms, came Michael the fiddler.<br/>
Long under Basil's roof had he lived, like a god on Olympus,<br/>
Having no other care than dispensing music to mortals.<br/>
Far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle.<br/>
"Long live Michael," they cried, "our brave Acadian minstrel!"<br/>
As they bore him aloft in triumphal procession; and straightway<br/>
Father Felician advanced with Evangeline, greeting the old man<br/>
Kindly and oft, and recalling the past, while Basil, enraptured,<br/>
Hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips,<br/>
Laughing loud and long, and embracing mothers and daughters.<br/>
Much they marvelled to see the wealth of the ci-devant blacksmith,<br/>
All his domains and his herds, and his patriarchal demeanor;<br/>
Much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,<br/>
And of the prairies, whose numberless herds were his who would take them;<br/>
Each one thought in his heart, that he, too, would go and do likewise.<br/>
Thus they ascended the steps, and, crossing the breezy veranda,<br/>
Entered the hall of the house, where already the supper of Basil<br/>
Waited his late return; and they rested and feasted together.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended.<br/>
All was silent without, and, illuming the landscape with silver,<br/>
Fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars; but within doors,<br/>
Brighter than these, shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight.<br/>
Then from his station aloft, at the head of the table, the herdsman<br/>
Poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion.<br/>
Lighting his pipe, that was filled with sweet Natchitoches tobacco,<br/>
Thus he spake to his guests, who listened, and smiled as they listened:&mdash;<br/>
"Welcome once more, my friends, who long have been friendless and homeless,<br/>
Welcome once more to a home, that is better perchance than the old one!<br/>
Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers;<br/>
Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer;<br/>
Smoothly the plowshare runs through the soil, as a keel through the water.<br/>
All the year round the orange-groves are in blossom; and grass grows<br/>
More in a single night than a whole Canadian summer.<br/>
Here, too, numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies;<br/>
Here, too, lands may be had for the asking, and forests of timber<br/>
With a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses.<br/>
After your houses are built, and your fields are yellow with harvests,<br/>
No King George of England shall drive you away from your homesteads,<br/>
Burning your dwellings and barns, and stealing your farms and your cattle."<br/>
Speaking these words, he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,<br/>
While his huge, brown hand came thundering down on the table,<br/>
So that the guests all started; and Father Felician, astounded,<br/>
Suddenly paused, with a pinch of snuff half-way to his nostrils.<br/>
But the brave Basil resumed, and his words were milder and gayer:&mdash;<br/>
"Only beware of the fever, my friends, beware of the fever!<br/>
For it is not like that of our cold Acadian climate,<br/>
Cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell!"<br/>
Then there were voices heard at the door, and footsteps approaching<br/>
Sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda.<br/>
It was the neighboring Creoles and small Acadian planters,<br/>
Who had been summoned all to the house of Basil the herdsman.<br/>
Merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors:<br/>
Friend clasped friend in his arms; and they who before were as strangers,<br/>
Meeting in exile, became straightway as friends to each other,<br/>
Drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together.<br/>
But in the neighboring hall a strain of music, proceeding<br/>
From the accordant strings of Michael's melodious fiddle,<br/>
Broke up all further speech. Away, like children delighted,<br/>
All things forgotten beside, they gave themselves to the maddening<br/>
Whirl of the dizzy dance as it swept and swayed to the music,<br/>
Dreamlike, with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, apart, at the head of the hall, the priest and the herdsman<br/>
Sat, conversing together of past and present and future;<br/>
While Evangeline stood like one entranced, for within her<br/>
Olden memories rose, and loud in the midst of the music<br/>
Heard she the sound of the sea, and an irrepressible sadness<br/>
Came o'er her heart, and unseen she stole forth into the garden.<br/>
Beautiful was the night. Behind the black wall of the forest,<br/>
Tipping its summit with silver, arose the moon. On the river<br/>
Fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,<br/>
Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit.<br/>
Nearer and round about her, the manifold flowers of the garden<br/>
Poured out their souls in odors, that were their prayers and confessions<br/>
Unto the night, as it went its way, like a silent Carthusian.<br/>
Fuller of fragrance than they, and as heavy with shadows and night-dews,<br/>
Hung the heart of the maiden. The calm and the magical moonlight<br/>
Seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longings,<br/>
As, through the garden gate, and beneath the shade of the oak-trees,<br/>
Passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie.<br/>
Silent it lay, with a silvery haze upon it, and fire-flies<br/>
Gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers.<br/>
Over her head the stars, the thoughts of God in the heavens,<br/>
Shone on the eyes of man, who had ceased to marvel and worship,<br/>
Save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,<br/>
As if a hand had appeared and written upon them, "Upharsin."<br/>
And the soul of the maiden, between the stars and the fire-flies,<br/>
Wandered alone, and she cried, "O Gabriel! O my beloved!<br/>
Art thou so near unto me, and yet I cannot behold thee?<br/>
Art thou so near unto me, and yet thy voice does not reach me?<br/>
Ah! how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie!<br/>
Ah! how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me!<br/>
Ah! how often beneath this oak, returning from labor,<br/>
Thou hast lain down to rest, and to dream of me in thy slumbers!<br/>
When shall these eyes behold, these arms be folded about thee?"<br/>
Loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded<br/>
Like a flute in the woods; and anon, through the neighboring thickets, 1055<br/>
Farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence.<br/>
"Patience!" whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness;<br/>
And, from the moonlit meadow, a sigh responded, "To-morrow!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Bright rose the sun next day; and all the flowers of the garden<br/>
Bathed his shining feet with their tears, and anointed his tresses<br/>
With the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal.<br/>
"Farewell!" said the priest, as he stood at the shadowy threshold;<br/>
"See that you bring us the Prodigal Son from his fasting and famine,<br/>
And, too, the Foolish Virgin, who slept when the bridegroom was coming."<br/>
"Farewell!" answered the maiden, and, smiling, with Basil descended    1065<br/>
Down to the river's brink, where the boatmen already were waiting.<br/>
Thus beginning their journey with morning, and sunshine, and gladness,<br/>
Swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,<br/>
Blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert.<br/>
Not that day, nor the next, nor yet the day that succeeded,<br/>
Found they trace of his course, in lake or forest or river,<br/>
Nor, after many days, had they found him; but vague and uncertain<br/>
Rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country;<br/>
Till, at the little inn of the Spanish town of Adayes,<br/>
Weary and worn, they alighted, and learned from the garrulous landlord 1075<br/>
That on the day before, with horses and guides and companions,<br/>
Gabriel left the village, and took the road of the prairies.<br/>

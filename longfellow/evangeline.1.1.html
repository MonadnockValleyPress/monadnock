<h1>Evangeline</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Part the First</h2>
<h2>Section I</h2>
<p>
In the Acadian land, on the shores of the Basin of Minas,<br/>
Distant, secluded, still, the little village of Grand-Pre<br/>
Lay in the fruitful valley. Vast meadows stretched to the eastward,<br/>
Giving the village its name and pasture to flocks without number.<br/>
Dikes, that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,<br/>
Shut out the turbulent tides; but at stated seasons the flood-gates<br/>
Opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows.<br/>
West and south there were fields of flax, and orchards and cornfields<br/>
Spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain; and away to the northward<br/>
Blomidon rose, and the forests old, and aloft on the mountains<br/>
Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from the mighty Atlantic<br/>
Looked on the happy valley, but ne'er from their station descended.<br/>
There, in the midst of its farms, reposed the Acadian village.<br/>
Strongly built were the houses, with frames of oak and of hemlock,<br/>
Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries.<br/>
Thatched were the roofs, with dormer-windows; and gables projecting<br/>
Over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway.<br/>
There in the tranquil evenings of summer, when brightly the sunset<br/>
Lighted the village street, and gilded the vanes on the chimneys,<br/>
Matrons and maidens sat in snow-white caps and in kirtles<br/>
Scarlet and blue and green, with distaffs spinning the golden<br/>
Flax for the gossiping looms, whose noisy shuttles within doors<br/>
Mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens.<br/>
Solemnly down the street came the parish priest, and the children<br/>
Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them.<br/>
Reverend walked he among them; and up rose matrons and maidens,<br/>
Hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome.<br/>
Then came the laborers home from the field, and serenely the sun sank<br/>
Down to his rest, and twilight prevailed. Anon from the belfry<br/>
Softly the Angelus sounded, and over the roofs of the village<br/>
Columns of pale blue smoke, like clouds of incense ascending,<br/>
Rose from a hundred hearths, the homes of peace and contentment.<br/>
Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers,&mdash;<br/>
Dwelt in the love of God and of man. Alike were they free from<br/>
Fear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of republics.<br/>
Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows;<br/>
But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners;<br/>
There the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abundance.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Somewhat apart from the village, and nearer the Basin of Minas,<br/>
Benedict Bellefontaine, the wealthiest farmer of Grand-Pre,<br/>
Dwelt on his goodly acres; and with him, directing his household,<br/>
Gentle Evangeline lived, his child, and the pride of the village.<br/>
Stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters;<br/>
Hearty and hale was he, an oak that is covered with snow-flakes;<br/>
White as the snow were his locks, and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves.<br/>
Fair was she to behold, that maiden of seventeen summers;<br/>
Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside,<br/>
Black, yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses!<br/>
Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows.<br/>
When in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide<br/>
Flagons of home-brewed ale, ah! fair in sooth was the maiden.<br/>
Fairer was she, when on Sunday morn, while the bell from its turret<br/>
Sprinkled with holy sounds the air, as the priest with his hyssop<br/>
Sprinkles the congregation, and scatters blessings upon them<br/>
Down the long street she passed, with her chaplet of beads and her missal,<br/>
Wearing her Norman cap and her kirtle of blue, and the ear-rings<br/>
Brought in the olden time from France, and since, as an heirloom,<br/>
Handed down from mother to child, through long generations.<br/>
But a celestial brightness&mdash;a more ethereal beauty&mdash;<br/>
Shone on her face and encircled her form, when, after confession,<br/>
Homeward serenely she walked with God's benediction upon her.<br/>
When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Firmly builded with rafters of oak, the house of the farmer<br/>
Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea; and a shady<br/>
Sycamore grew by the door, with a woodbine wreathing around it.<br/>
Rudely carved was the porch, with seats beneath; and a footpath<br/>
Led through an orchard wide, and disappeared in the meadow.<br/>
Under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,<br/>
Such as the traveler sees in regions remote by the roadside,<br/>
Built o'er a box for the poor, or the blessed image of Mary.<br/>
Farther down, on the slope of the hill, was the well with its moss-grown 90<br/>
Bucket, fastened with iron, and near it a trough for the horses.<br/>
Shielding the house from storms, on the north, were the barns and the farmyard;<br/>
There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique plows and harrows;<br/>
There were the folds for the sheep, and there in his feathered seraglio,<br/>
Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the cock, with the selfsame<br/>
Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter.<br/>
Bursting with hay were the barns, themselves a village. In each one<br/>
Far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch; and a staircase,<br/>
Under the sheltering eaves, led up to the odorous cornloft.<br/>
There too the dove-cot stood, with its meek and innocent inmates<br/>
Murmuring ever of love; while above in the variant breezes<br/>
Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus, at peace with God and the world, the farmer of Grand-Pre<br/>
Lived on his sunny farm, and Evangeline governed his household.<br/>
Many a youth, as he knelt in the church and opened his missal,<br/>
Fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion;<br/>
Happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment!<br/>
Many a suitor came to her door, by the darkness befriended,<br/>
And, as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps,<br/>
Knew not which beat the louder, his heart or the knocker of iron;<br/>
Or, at the joyous feast of the Patron Saint of the village,<br/>
Bolder grew, and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered<br/>
Hurried words of love, that seemed a part of the music.<br/>
But among all who came young Gabriel only was welcome;<br/>
Gabriel Lajeunesse, the son of Basil the blacksmith,<br/>
Who was a mighty man in the village, and honored of all men;<br/>
For since the birth of time, throughout all ages and nations,<br/>
Has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people.<br/>
Basil was Benedict's friend. Their children from earliest childhood<br/>
Grew up together as brother and sister; and Father Felician,<br/>
Priest and pedagogue both in the village, had taught them their letters<br/>
Out of the selfsame book, with the hymns of the church and the plain-song.<br/>
But when the hymn was sung, and the daily lesson completed,<br/>
Swiftly they hurried away to the forge of Basil the blacksmith.<br/>
There at the door they stood, with wondering eyes to behold him<br/>
Take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,<br/>
Nailing the shoe in its place; while near him the tire of the cart-wheel<br/>
Lay like a fiery snake, coiled round in a circle of cinders.<br/>
Oft on autumnal eves, when without in the gathering darkness<br/>
Bursting with light seemed the smithy, through every cranny and crevice,<br/>
Warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows,<br/>
And as its panting ceased, and the sparks expired in the ashes,<br/>
Merrily laughed, and said they were nuns going into the chapel.<br/>
Oft on sledges in winter, as swift as the swoop of the eagle,<br/>
Down the hillside bounding, they glided away o'er the meadow.<br/>
Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters,<br/>
Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone, which the swallow<br/>
Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings;<br/>
Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow!<br/>
Thus passed a few swift years, and they no longer were children.<br/>
He was a valiant youth, and his face, like the face of the morning,<br/>
Gladdened the earth with its light, and ripened thought into action.<br/>
She was a woman now, with the heart and hopes of a woman.<br/>
"Sunshine of St. Eulalie" was she called; for that was the sunshine<br/>
Which, as the farmers believed, would load their orchards with apples;<br/>
She too would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance,<br/>
Filling it full of love and ruddy faces of children.<br/>

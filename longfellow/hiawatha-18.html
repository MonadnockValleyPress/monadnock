<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XVIII. The Death of Kwasind</h2>
<p>
Far and wide among the nations<br/>
Spread the name and fame of Kwasind;<br/>
No man dared to strive with Kwasind,<br/>
No man could compete with Kwasind.<br/>
But the mischievous Puk-Wudjies,<br/>
They the envious Little People,<br/>
They the fairies and the pygmies,<br/>
Plotted and conspired against him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"If this hateful Kwasind," said they,<br/>
"If this great, outrageous fellow<br/>
Goes on thus a little longer,<br/>
Tearing everything he touches,<br/>
Rending everything to pieces,<br/>
Filling all the world with wonder,<br/>
What becomes of the Puk-Wudjies?<br/>
Who will care for the Puk-Wudjies?<br/>
He will tread us down like mushrooms,<br/>
Drive us all into the water,<br/>
Give our bodies to be eaten<br/>
By the wicked Nee-ba-naw-baigs,<br/>
By the Spirits of the water!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
So the angry Little People<br/>
All conspired against the Strong Man,<br/>
All conspired to murder Kwasind,<br/>
Yes, to rid the world of Kwasind,<br/>
The audacious, overbearing,<br/>
Heartless, haughty, dangerous Kwasind!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now this wondrous strength of Kwasind<br/>
In his crown alone was seated;<br/>
In his crown too was his weakness;<br/>
There alone could he be wounded,<br/>
Nowhere else could weapon pierce him,<br/>
Nowhere else could weapon harm him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Even there the only weapon<br/>
That could wound him, that could slay him,<br/>
Was the seed-cone of the pine-tree,<br/>
Was the blue cone of the fir-tree.<br/>
This was Kwasind's fatal secret,<br/>
Known to no man among mortals;<br/>
But the cunning Little People,<br/>
The Puk-Wudjies, knew the secret,<br/>
Knew the only way to kill him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So they gathered cones together,<br/>
Gathered seed-cones of the pine-tree,<br/>
Gathered blue cones of the fir-tree,<br/>
In the woods by Taquamenaw,<br/>
Brought them to the river's margin,<br/>
Heaped them in great piles together,<br/>
Where the red rocks from the margin<br/>
Jutting overhang the river.<br/>
There they lay in wait for Kwasind,<br/>
The malicious Little People.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'T was an afternoon in Summer;<br/>
Very hot and still the air was,<br/>
Very smooth the gliding river,<br/>
Motionless the sleeping shadows:<br/>
Insects glistened in the sunshine,<br/>
Insects skated on the water,<br/>
Filled the drowsy air with buzzing,<br/>
With a far resounding war-cry.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Down the river came the Strong Man,<br/>
In his birch canoe came Kwasind,<br/>
Floating slowly down the current<br/>
Of the sluggish Taquamenaw,<br/>
Very languid with the weather,<br/>
Very sleepy with the silence.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the overhanging branches,<br/>
From the tassels of the birch-trees,<br/>
Soft the Spirit of Sleep descended;<br/>
By his airy hosts surrounded,<br/>
His invisible attendants,<br/>
Came the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin;<br/>
Like a burnished Dush-kwo-ne-she,<br/>
Like a dragon-fly, he hovered<br/>
O'er the drowsy head of Kwasind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To his ear there came a murmur<br/>
As of waves upon a sea-shore,<br/>
As of far-off tumbling waters,<br/>
As of winds among the pine-trees;<br/>
And he felt upon his forehead<br/>
Blows of little airy war-clubs,<br/>
Wielded by the slumbrous legions<br/>
Of the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin,<br/>
As of some one breathing on him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
At the first blow of their war-clubs,<br/>
Fell a drowsiness on Kwasind;<br/>
At the second blow they smote him,<br/>
Motionless his paddle rested;<br/>
At the third, before his vision<br/>
Reeled the landscape Into darkness,<br/>
Very sound asleep was Kwasind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So he floated down the river,<br/>
Like a blind man seated upright,<br/>
Floated down the Taquamenaw,<br/>
Underneath the trembling birch-trees,<br/>
Underneath the wooded headlands,<br/>
Underneath the war encampment<br/>
Of the pygmies, the Puk-Wudjies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There they stood, all armed and waiting,<br/>
Hurled the pine-cones down upon him,<br/>
Struck him on his brawny shoulders,<br/>
On his crown defenceless struck him.<br/>
"Death to Kwasind!" was the sudden<br/>
War-cry of the Little People.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he sideways swayed and tumbled,<br/>
Sideways fell into the river,<br/>
Plunged beneath the sluggish water<br/>
Headlong, as an otter plunges;<br/>
And the birch canoe, abandoned,<br/>
Drifted empty down the river,<br/>
Bottom upward swerved and drifted:<br/>
Nothing more was seen of Kwasind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But the memory of the Strong Man<br/>
Lingered long among the people,<br/>
And whenever through the forest<br/>
Raged and roared the wintry tempest,<br/>
And the branches, tossed and troubled,<br/>
Creaked and groaned and split asunder,<br/>
"Kwasind!" cried they; "that is Kwasind!<br/>
He is gathering in his fire-wood!"<br/>

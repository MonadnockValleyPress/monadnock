<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>V. Hiawatha's Fasting</h2>
<p>
You shall hear how Hiawatha<br/>
Prayed and fasted in the forest,<br/>
Not for greater skill in hunting,<br/>
Not for greater craft in fishing,<br/>
Not for triumphs in the battle,<br/>
And renown among the warriors,<br/>
But for profit of the people,<br/>
For advantage of the nations.<br/>
</p>
<p>
First he built a lodge for fasting,<br/>
Built a wigwam in the forest,<br/>
By the shining Big-Sea-Water,<br/>
In the blithe and pleasant Spring-time,<br/>
In the Moon of Leaves he built it,<br/>
And, with dreams and visions many,<br/>
Seven whole days and nights he fasted.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the first day of his fasting<br/>
Through the leafy woods he wandered;<br/>
Saw the deer start from the thicket,<br/>
Saw the rabbit in his burrow,<br/>
Heard the pheasant, Bena, drumming,<br/>
Heard the squirrel, Adjidaumo,<br/>
Rattling in his hoard of acorns,<br/>
Saw the pigeon, the Omeme,<br/>
Building nests among the pinetrees,<br/>
And in flocks the wild-goose, Wawa,<br/>
Flying to the fen-lands northward,<br/>
Whirring, wailing far above him.<br/>
"Master of Life!" he cried, desponding,<br/>
"Must our lives depend on these things?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the next day of his fasting<br/>
By the river's brink he wandered,<br/>
Through the Muskoday, the meadow,<br/>
Saw the wild rice, Mahnomonee,<br/>
Saw the blueberry, Meenahga,<br/>
And the strawberry, Odahmin,<br/>
And the gooseberry, Shahbomin,<br/>
And the grape-vine, the Bemahgut,<br/>
Trailing o'er the alder-branches,<br/>
Filling all the air with fragrance!<br/>
"Master of Life!" he cried, desponding,<br/>
"Must our lives depend on these things?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the third day of his fasting<br/>
By the lake he sat and pondered,<br/>
By the still, transparent water;<br/>
Saw the sturgeon, Nahma, leaping,<br/>
Scattering drops like beads of wampum,<br/>
Saw the yellow perch, the Sahwa,<br/>
Like a sunbeam in the water,<br/>
Saw the pike, the Maskenozha,<br/>
And the herring, Okahahwis,<br/>
And the Shawgashee, the crawfish!<br/>
"Master of Life!" he cried, desponding,<br/>
"Must our lives depend on these things?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the fourth day of his fasting<br/>
In his lodge he lay exhausted;<br/>
From his couch of leaves and branches<br/>
Gazing with half-open eyelids,<br/>
Full of shadowy dreams and visions,<br/>
On the dizzy, swimming landscape,<br/>
On the gleaming of the water,<br/>
On the splendor of the sunset.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he saw a youth approaching,<br/>
Dressed in garments green and yellow,<br/>
Coming through the purple twilight,<br/>
Through the splendor of the sunset;<br/>
Plumes of green bent o'er his forehead,<br/>
And his hair was soft and golden.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Standing at the open doorway,<br/>
Long he looked at Hiawatha,<br/>
Looked with pity and compassion<br/>
On his wasted form and features,<br/>
And, in accents like the sighing<br/>
Of the South-Wind in the tree-tops,<br/>
Said he, "O my Hiawatha!<br/>
All your prayers are heard in heaven,<br/>
For you pray not like the others;<br/>
Not for greater skill in hunting,<br/>
Not for greater craft in fishing,<br/>
Not for triumph in the battle,<br/>
Nor renown among the warriors,<br/>
But for profit of the people,<br/>
For advantage of the nations.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"From the Master of Life descending,<br/>
I, the friend of man, Mondamin,<br/>
Come to warn you and instruct you,<br/>
How by struggle and by labor<br/>
You shall gain what you have prayed for.<br/>
Rise up from your bed of branches,<br/>
Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Faint with famine, Hiawatha<br/>
Started from his bed of branches,<br/>
From the twilight of his wigwam<br/>
Forth into the flush of sunset<br/>
Came, and wrestled with Mondamin;<br/>
At his touch he felt new courage<br/>
Throbbing in his brain and bosom,<br/>
Felt new life and hope and vigor<br/>
Run through every nerve and fibre.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So they wrestled there together<br/>
In the glory of the sunset,<br/>
And the more they strove and struggled,<br/>
Stronger still grew Hiawatha;<br/>
Till the darkness fell around them,<br/>
And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,<br/>
From her nest among the pine-trees,<br/>
Gave a cry of lamentation,<br/>
Gave a scream of pain and famine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"'T is enough!" then said Mondamin,<br/>
Smiling upon Hiawatha,<br/>
"But tomorrow, when the sun sets,<br/>
I will come again to try you."<br/>
And he vanished, and was seen not;<br/>
Whether sinking as the rain sinks,<br/>
Whether rising as the mists rise,<br/>
Hiawatha saw not, knew not,<br/>
Only saw that he had vanished,<br/>
Leaving him alone and fainting,<br/>
With the misty lake below him,<br/>
And the reeling stars above him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the morrow and the next day,<br/>
When the sun through heaven descending,<br/>
Like a red and burning cinder<br/>
From the hearth of the Great Spirit,<br/>
Fell into the western waters,<br/>
Came Mondamin for the trial,<br/>
For the strife with Hiawatha;<br/>
Came as silent as the dew comes,<br/>
From the empty air appearing,<br/>
Into empty air returning,<br/>
Taking shape when earth it touches,<br/>
But invisible to all men<br/>
In its coming and its going.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thrice they wrestled there together<br/>
In the glory of the sunset,<br/>
Till the darkness fell around them,<br/>
Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,<br/>
From her nest among the pine-trees,<br/>
Uttered her loud cry of famine,<br/>
And Mondamin paused to listen.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Tall and beautiful he stood there,<br/>
In his garments green and yellow;<br/>
To and fro his plumes above him,<br/>
Waved and nodded with his breathing,<br/>
And the sweat of the encounter<br/>
Stood like drops of dew upon him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he cried, "O Hiawatha!<br/>
Bravely have you wrestled with me,<br/>
Thrice have wrestled stoutly with me,<br/>
And the Master of Life, who sees us,<br/>
He will give to you the triumph!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he smiled, and said: "To-morrow<br/>
Is the last day of your conflict,<br/>
Is the last day of your fasting.<br/>
You will conquer and o'ercome me;<br/>
Make a bed for me to lie in,<br/>
Where the rain may fall upon me,<br/>
Where the sun may come and warm me;<br/>
Strip these garments, green and yellow,<br/>
Strip this nodding plumage from me,<br/>
Lay me in the earth, and make it<br/>
Soft and loose and light above me.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Let no hand disturb my slumber,<br/>
Let no weed nor worm molest me,<br/>
Let not Kahgahgee, the raven,<br/>
Come to haunt me and molest me,<br/>
Only come yourself to watch me,<br/>
Till I wake, and start, and quicken,<br/>
Till I leap into the sunshine"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And thus saying, he departed;<br/>
Peacefully slept Hiawatha,<br/>
But he heard the Wawonaissa,<br/>
Heard the whippoorwill complaining,<br/>
Perched upon his lonely wigwam;<br/>
Heard the rushing Sebowisha,<br/>
Heard the rivulet rippling near him,<br/>
Talking to the darksome forest;<br/>
Heard the sighing of the branches,<br/>
As they lifted and subsided<br/>
At the passing of the night-wind,<br/>
Heard them, as one hears in slumber<br/>
Far-off murmurs, dreamy whispers:<br/>
Peacefully slept Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the morrow came Nokomis,<br/>
On the seventh day of his fasting,<br/>
Came with food for Hiawatha,<br/>
Came imploring and bewailing,<br/>
Lest his hunger should o'ercome him,<br/>
Lest his fasting should be fatal.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But he tasted not, and touched not,<br/>
Only said to her, "Nokomis,<br/>
Wait until the sun is setting,<br/>
Till the darkness falls around us,<br/>
Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,<br/>
Crying from the desolate marshes,<br/>
Tells us that the day is ended."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Homeward weeping went Nokomis,<br/>
Sorrowing for her Hiawatha,<br/>
Fearing lest his strength should fail him,<br/>
Lest his fasting should be fatal.<br/>
He meanwhile sat weary waiting<br/>
For the coming of Mondamin,<br/>
Till the shadows, pointing eastward,<br/>
Lengthened over field and forest,<br/>
Till the sun dropped from the heaven,<br/>
Floating on the waters westward,<br/>
As a red leaf in the Autumn<br/>
Falls and floats upon the water,<br/>
Falls and sinks into its bosom.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And behold! the young Mondamin,<br/>
With his soft and shining tresses,<br/>
With his garments green and yellow,<br/>
With his long and glossy plumage,<br/>
Stood and beckoned at the doorway.<br/>
And as one in slumber walking,<br/>
Pale and haggard, but undaunted,<br/>
From the wigwam Hiawatha<br/>
Came and wrestled with Mondamin.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Round about him spun the landscape,<br/>
Sky and forest reeled together,<br/>
And his strong heart leaped within him,<br/>
As the sturgeon leaps and struggles<br/>
In a net to break its meshes.<br/>
Like a ring of fire around him<br/>
Blazed and flared the red horizon,<br/>
And a hundred suns seemed looking<br/>
At the combat of the wrestlers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly upon the greensward<br/>
All alone stood Hiawatha,<br/>
Panting with his wild exertion,<br/>
Palpitating with the struggle;<br/>
And before him breathless, lifeless,<br/>
Lay the youth, with hair dishevelled,<br/>
Plumage torn, and garments tattered,<br/>
Dead he lay there in the sunset.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And victorious Hiawatha<br/>
Made the grave as he commanded,<br/>
Stripped the garments from Mondamin,<br/>
Stripped his tattered plumage from him,<br/>
Laid him in the earth, and made it<br/>
Soft and loose and light above him;<br/>
And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,<br/>
From the melancholy moorlands,<br/>
Gave a cry of lamentation,<br/>
Gave a cry of pain and anguish!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Homeward then went Hiawatha<br/>
To the lodge of old Nokomis,<br/>
And the seven days of his fasting<br/>
Were accomplished and completed.<br/>
But the place was not forgotten<br/>
Where he wrestled with Mondamin;<br/>
Nor forgotten nor neglected<br/>
Was the grave where lay Mondamin,<br/>
Sleeping in the rain and sunshine,<br/>
Where his scattered plumes and garments<br/>
Faded in the rain and sunshine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Day by day did Hiawatha<br/>
Go to wait and watch beside it;<br/>
Kept the dark mould soft above it,<br/>
Kept it clean from weeds and insects,<br/>
Drove away, with scoffs and shoutings,<br/>
Kahgahgee, the king of ravens.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Till at length a small green feather<br/>
From the earth shot slowly upward,<br/>
Then another and another,<br/>
And before the Summer ended<br/>
Stood the maize in all its beauty,<br/>
With its shining robes about it,<br/>
And its long, soft, yellow tresses;<br/>
And in rapture Hiawatha<br/>
Cried aloud, "It is Mondamin!<br/>
Yes, the friend of man, Mondamin!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he called to old Nokomis<br/>
And Iagoo, the great boaster,<br/>
Showed them where the maize was growing,<br/>
Told them of his wondrous vision,<br/>
Of his wrestling and his triumph,<br/>
Of this new gift to the nations,<br/>
Which should be their food forever.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And still later, when the Autumn<br/>
Changed the long, green leaves to yellow,<br/>
And the soft and juicy kernels<br/>
Grew like wampum hard and yellow,<br/>
Then the ripened ears he gathered,<br/>
Stripped the withered husks from off them,<br/>
As he once had stripped the wrestler,<br/>
Gave the first Feast of Mondamin,<br/>
And made known unto the people<br/>
This new gift of the Great Spirit.<br/>

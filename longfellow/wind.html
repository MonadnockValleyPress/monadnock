<h1>The Wind over the Chimney</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
See, the fire is sinking low,<br/>
Dusky red the embers glow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While above them still I cower,<br/>
While a moment more I linger,<br/>
Though the clock, with lifted finger,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Points beyond the midnight hour.
</p>
<p>
Sings the blackened log a tune<br/>
Learned in some forgotten June<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From a school-boy at his play,<br/>
When they both were young together,<br/>
Heart of youth and summer weather<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Making all their holiday.
</p>
<p>
And the night-wind rising, hark!<br/>
How above there in the dark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midnight and the snow,<br/>
Ever wilder, fiercer, grander,<br/>
Like the trumpets of Iskander,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the noisy chimneys blow!
</p>
<p>
Every quivering tongue of flame<br/>
Seems to murmur some great name,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems to say to me, "Aspire!"<br/>
But the night-wind answers, "Hollow<br/>
Are the visions that you follow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into darkness sinks your fire!"
</p>
<p>
Then the flicker of the blaze<br/>
Gleams on volumes of old days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Written by masters of the art,<br/>
Loud through whose majestic pages<br/>
Rolls the melody of ages,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Throb the harp-strings of the heart.
</p>
<p>
And again the tongues of flame<br/>
Start exulting and exclaim:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are prophets, bards, and seers;<br/>
In the horoscope of nations,<br/>
Like ascendant constellations,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They control the coming years."
</p>
<p>
But the night-wind cries: "Despair!<br/>
Those who walk with feet of air<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave no long-enduring marks;<br/>
At God's forges incandescent<br/>
Mighty hammers beat incessant,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These are but the flying sparks.
</p>
<p>
"Dust are all the hands that wrought;<br/>
Books are sepulchres of thought;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead laurels of the dead<br/>
Rustle for a moment only,<br/>
Like the withered leaves in lonely<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Churchyards at some passing tread."
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the flame sinks down;<br/>
Sink the rumors of renown;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And alone the night-wind drear<br/>
Clamors louder, wilder, vaguer,&mdash;<br/>
"'T is the brand of Meleager<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dying on the hearth-stone here!"
</p>
<p>
And I answer,&mdash;"Though it be,<br/>
Why should that discomfort me?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No endeavor is in vain;<br/>
Its reward is in the doing,<br/>
And the rapture of pursuing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the prize the vanquished gain."

<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XIV. Picture-Writing</h2>
<p>
In those days said Hiawatha,<br/>
"Lo! how all things fade and perish!<br/>
From the memory of the old men<br/>
Pass away the great traditions,<br/>
The achievements of the warriors,<br/>
The adventures of the hunters,<br/>
All the wisdom of the Medas,<br/>
All the craft of the Wabenos,<br/>
All the marvellous dreams and visions<br/>
Of the Jossakeeds, the Prophets!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Great men die and are forgotten,<br/>
Wise men speak; their words of wisdom<br/>
Perish in the ears that hear them,<br/>
Do not reach the generations<br/>
That, as yet unborn, are waiting<br/>
In the great, mysterious darkness<br/>
Of the speechless days that shall be!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"On the grave-posts of our fathers<br/>
Are no signs, no figures painted;<br/>
Who are in those graves we know not,<br/>
Only know they are our fathers.<br/>
Of what kith they are and kindred,<br/>
From what old, ancestral Totem,<br/>
Be it Eagle, Bear, or Beaver,<br/>
They descended, this we know not,<br/>
Only know they are our fathers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Face to face we speak together,<br/>
But we cannot speak when absent,<br/>
Cannot send our voices from us<br/>
To the friends that dwell afar off;<br/>
Cannot send a secret message,<br/>
But the bearer learns our secret,<br/>
May pervert it, may betray it,<br/>
May reveal it unto others."<br/>
Thus said Hiawatha, walking<br/>
In the solitary forest,<br/>
Pondering, musing in the forest,<br/>
On the welfare of his people.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From his pouch he took his colors,<br/>
Took his paints of different colors,<br/>
On the smooth bark of a birch-tree<br/>
Painted many shapes and figures,<br/>
Wonderful and mystic figures,<br/>
And each figure had a meaning,<br/>
Each some word or thought suggested.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Gitche Manito the Mighty,<br/>
He, the Master of Life, was painted<br/>
As an egg, with points projecting<br/>
To the four winds of the heavens.<br/>
Everywhere is the Great Spirit,<br/>
Was the meaning of this symbol.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Mitche Manito the Mighty,<br/>
He the dreadful Spirit of Evil,<br/>
As a serpent was depicted,<br/>
As Kenabeek, the great serpent.<br/>
Very crafty, very cunning,<br/>
Is the creeping Spirit of Evil,<br/>
Was the meaning of this symbol.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Life and Death he drew as circles,<br/>
Life was white, but Death was darkened;<br/>
Sun and moon and stars he painted,<br/>
Man and beast, and fish and reptile,<br/>
Forests, mountains, lakes, and rivers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For the earth he drew a straight line,<br/>
For the sky a bow above it;<br/>
White the space between for daytime,<br/>
Filled with little stars for night-time;<br/>
On the left a point for sunrise,<br/>
On the right a point for sunset,<br/>
On the top a point for noontide,<br/>
And for rain and cloudy weather<br/>
Waving lines descending from it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Footprints pointing towards a wigwam<br/>
Were a sign of invitation,<br/>
Were a sign of guests assembling;<br/>
Bloody hands with palms uplifted<br/>
Were a symbol of destruction,<br/>
Were a hostile sign and symbol.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All these things did Hiawatha<br/>
Show unto his wondering people,<br/>
And interpreted their meaning,<br/>
And he said: "Behold, your grave-posts<br/>
Have no mark, no sign, nor symbol,<br/>
Go and paint them all with figures;<br/>
Each one with its household symbol,<br/>
With its own ancestral Totem;<br/>
So that those who follow after<br/>
May distinguish them and know them."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And they painted on the grave-posts<br/>
On the graves yet unforgotten,<br/>
Each his own ancestral Totem,<br/>
Each the symbol of his household;<br/>
Figures of the Bear and Reindeer,<br/>
Of the Turtle, Crane, and Beaver,<br/>
Each inverted as a token<br/>
That the owner was departed,<br/>
That the chief who bore the symbol<br/>
Lay beneath in dust and ashes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,<br/>
The Wabenos, the Magicians,<br/>
And the Medicine-men, the Medas,<br/>
Painted upon bark and deer-skin<br/>
Figures for the songs they chanted,<br/>
For each song a separate symbol,<br/>
Figures mystical and awful,<br/>
Figures strange and brightly colored;<br/>
And each figure had its meaning,<br/>
Each some magic song suggested.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Great Spirit, the Creator,<br/>
Flashing light through all the heaven;<br/>
The Great Serpent, the Kenabeek,<br/>
With his bloody crest erected,<br/>
Creeping, looking into heaven;<br/>
In the sky the sun, that listens,<br/>
And the moon eclipsed and dying;<br/>
Owl and eagle, crane and hen-hawk,<br/>
And the cormorant, bird of magic;<br/>
Headless men, that walk the heavens,<br/>
Bodies lying pierced with arrows,<br/>
Bloody hands of death uplifted,<br/>
Flags on graves, and great war-captains<br/>
Grasping both the earth and heaven!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Such as these the shapes they painted<br/>
On the birch-bark and the deer-skin;<br/>
Songs of war and songs of hunting,<br/>
Songs of medicine and of magic,<br/>
All were written in these figures,<br/>
For each figure had its meaning,<br/>
Each its separate song recorded.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor forgotten was the Love-Song,<br/>
The most subtle of all medicines,<br/>
The most potent spell of magic,<br/>
Dangerous more than war or hunting!<br/>
Thus the Love-Song was recorded,<br/>
Symbol and interpretation.<br/>
</p>
<p>
First a human figure standing,<br/>
Painted in the brightest scarlet;<br/>
'T is the lover, the musician,<br/>
And the meaning is, "My painting<br/>
Makes me powerful over others."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the figure seated, singing,<br/>
Playing on a drum of magic,<br/>
And the interpretation, "Listen!<br/>
'T is my voice you hear, my singing!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the same red figure seated<br/>
In the shelter of a wigwam,<br/>
And the meaning of the symbol,<br/>
"I will come and sit beside you<br/>
In the mystery of my passion!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then two figures, man and woman,<br/>
Standing hand in hand together<br/>
With their hands so clasped together<br/>
That they seemed in one united,<br/>
And the words thus represented<br/>
Are, "I see your heart within you,<br/>
And your cheeks are red with blushes!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next the maiden on an island,<br/>
In the centre of an Island;<br/>
And the song this shape suggested<br/>
Was, "Though you were at a distance,<br/>
Were upon some far-off island,<br/>
Such the spell I cast upon you,<br/>
Such the magic power of passion,<br/>
I could straightway draw you to me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the figure of the maiden<br/>
Sleeping, and the lover near her,<br/>
Whispering to her in her slumbers,<br/>
Saying, "Though you were far from me<br/>
In the land of Sleep and Silence,<br/>
Still the voice of love would reach you!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the last of all the figures<br/>
Was a heart within a circle,<br/>
Drawn within a magic circle;<br/>
And the image had this meaning:<br/>
"Naked lies your heart before me,<br/>
To your naked heart I whisper!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus it was that Hiawatha,<br/>
In his wisdom, taught the people<br/>
All the mysteries of painting,<br/>
All the art of Picture-Writing,<br/>
On the smooth bark of the birch-tree,<br/>
On the white skin of the reindeer,<br/>
On the grave-posts of the village.<br/>

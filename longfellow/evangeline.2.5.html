<h1>Evangeline</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Part the Second</h2>
<h2>Section V</h2>
<p>
In that delightful land which is washed by the Delaware's waters,<br/>
Guarding in sylvan shades the name of Penn the apostle,<br/>
Stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded.<br/>
There all the air is balm, and the peach is the emblem of beauty.<br/>
And the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest,<br/>
As if they fain would appease the Dryads whose haunts they molested.<br/>
There from the troubled sea had Evangeline landed, an exile,<br/>
Finding among the children of Penn a home and a country.<br/>
There old Rene Leblanc had died; and when he departed,<br/>
Saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants.<br/>
Something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city,<br/>
Something that spake to her heart, and made her no longer a stranger;<br/>
And her ear was pleased with the Thee and Thou of the Quakers,<br/>
For it recalled the past, the old Acadian country,<br/>
Where all men were equal, and all were brothers and sisters.<br/>
So, when the fruitless search, the disappointed endeavor,<br/>
Ended, to recommence no more upon earth, uncomplainingly,<br/>
Thither, as leaves to the light, were turned her thoughts and her footsteps.<br/>
As from a mountain's top the rainy mists of the morning<br/>
Roll away, and afar we behold the landscape below us,<br/>
Sun-illumined, with shining rivers and cities and hamlets,<br/>
So fell the mists from her mind, and she saw the world far below her,<br/>
Dark no longer, but all illumined with love; and the pathway<br/>
Which she had climbed so far, lying smooth and fair in the distance.<br/>
Gabriel was not forgotten. Within her heart was his image,<br/>
Clothed in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him,<br/>
Only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence.<br/>
Into her thoughts of him time entered not, for it was not.<br/>
Over him years had no power; he was not changed, but transfigured;<br/>
He had become to her heart as one who is dead, and not absent;<br/>
Patience and abnegation of self, and devotion to others,<br/>
This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her.<br/>
So was her love diffused, but, like to some odorous spices,<br/>
Suffered no waste nor loss, though filling the air with aroma.<br/>
Other hope had she none, nor wish in life, but to follow,<br/>
Meekly with reverent steps, the sacred feet of her Saviour.<br/>
Thus many years she lived as a Sister of Mercy; frequenting<br/>
Lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,<br/>
Where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight,<br/>
Where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected.<br/>
Night after night when the world was asleep, as the watchman repeated<br/>
Loud, through the gusty streets, that all was well in the city,<br/>
High at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper.<br/>
Day after day, in the gray of the dawn, as slow through the suburbs<br/>
Plodded the German farmer, with flowers and fruits for the market,<br/>
Met he that meek, pale face, returning home from its watchings.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,<br/>
Presaged by wondrous signs, and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,<br/>
Darkening the sun in their flight, with naught in their craws but an acorn.<br/>
And, as the tides of the sea arise in the month of September,<br/>
Flooding some silver stream, till it spreads to a lake in the meadow,<br/>
So death flooded life, and, o'erflowing its natural margin,<br/>
Spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence.<br/>
Wealth had no power to bribe, nor beauty to charm, the oppressor;<br/>
But all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger;&mdash;<br/>
Only, alas! the poor, who had neither friends nor attendants,<br/>
Crept away to die in the almshouse, home of the homeless.<br/>
Then in the suburbs it stood, in the midst of meadows and woodlands;&mdash;<br/>
Now the city surrounds it; but still, with its gateway and wicket<br/>
Meek, in the midst of splendor, its humble walls seem to echo<br/>
Softly the words of the Lord:&mdash;"The poor ye always have with you."<br/>
Thither, by night and by day, came the Sister of Mercy. The dying<br/>
Looked up into her face, and thought, indeed, to behold there<br/>
Gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor,<br/>
Such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles,<br/>
Or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance.<br/>
Unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial,<br/>
Into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus, on a Sabbath morn, through the streets, deserted and silent,<br/>
Wending her quiet way, she entered the door of the almshouse.<br/>
Sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden,<br/>
And she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them,<br/>
That the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty.<br/>
Then, as she mounted the stairs to the corridors, cooled by the east wind,<br/>
Distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of Christ Church,<br/>
While, intermingled with these, across the meadows were wafted<br/>
Sounds of psalms, that were sung by the Swedes in their church at Wicaco.<br/>
Soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit;<br/>
Something within her said, "At length thy trials are ended;"<br/>
And, with light in her looks, she entered the chambers of sickness.<br/>
Noiselessly moved about the assiduous, careful attendants,<br/>
Moistening the feverish lip, and the aching brow, and in silence<br/>
Closing the sightless eyes of the dead, and concealing their faces,<br/>
Where on their pallets they lay, like drifts of snow by the roadside.<br/>
Many a languid head, upraised as Evangeline entered,<br/>
Turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed, for her presence<br/>
Fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison.<br/>
And, as she looked around, she saw how Death the consoler,<br/>
Laying his hand upon many a heart, had healed it forever.<br/>
Many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time;<br/>
Vacant their places were, or filled already by strangers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, as if arrested, by fear or a feeling of wonder,<br/>
Still she stood, with her colorless lips apart, while a shudder<br/>
Ran through her frame, and, forgotten, the flowerets dropped from her fingers,<br/>
And from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning.<br/>
Then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish,<br/>
That the dying heard it, and started up from their pillows.<br/>
On the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man.<br/>
Long, and thin, and gray were the locks that shaded his temples;<br/>
But, as he lay in the morning light, his face for a moment<br/>
Seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood;<br/>
So are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying.<br/>
Hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,<br/>
As if life, like the Hebrew, with blood had besprinkled its portals,<br/>
That the Angel of Death might see the sign, and pass over.<br/>
Motionless, senseless, dying, he lay, and his spirit exhausted<br/>
Seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,<br/>
Darkness of slumber and death, forever sinking and sinking.<br/>
Then through those realms of shade, in multiplied reverberations,<br/>
Heard he that cry of pain, and through the hush that succeeded<br/>
Whispered a gentle voice, in accents tender and saint-like,<br/>
"Gabriel! O my beloved!" and died away into silence.<br/>
Then he beheld, in a dream, once more the home of his childhood;<br/>
Green Acadian meadows, with sylvan rivers among them,<br/>
Village, and mountain, and woodlands; and, walking under their shadow,<br/>
As in the days of her youth, Evangeline rose in his vision.<br/>
Tears came into his eyes; and as slowly he lifted his eyelids,<br/>
Vanished the vision away, but Evangeline knelt by his bedside.<br/>
Vainly he strove to whisper her name, for the accents unuttered<br/>
Died on his lips, and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken.<br/>
Vainly he strove to rise; and Evangeline, kneeling beside him,<br/>
Kissed his dying lips, and laid his head on her bosom.<br/>
Sweet was the light of his eyes; but it suddenly sank into darkness,<br/>
As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All was ended now, the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow,<br/>
All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied longing,<br/>
All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of patience!<br/>
And, as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,<br/>
Meekly she bowed her own, and murmured, "Father, I thank thee!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Still stands the forest primeval; but far away from its shadow,<br/>
Side by side, in their nameless graves, the lovers are sleeping.<br/>
Under the humble walls of the little Catholic churchyard,<br/>
In the heart of the city, they lie, unknown and unnoticed.<br/>
Daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them,<br/>
Thousands of throbbing hearts, where theirs are at rest and forever,<br/>
Thousands of aching brains, where theirs no longer are busy,<br/>
Thousands of toiling hands, where theirs have ceased from their labors,<br/>
Thousands of weary feet, where theirs have completed their journey!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Still stands the forest primeval; but under the shade of its branches<br/>
Dwells another race, with other customs and language.<br/>
Only along the shore of the mournful and misty Atlantic<br/>
Linger a few Acadian peasants, whose fathers from exile<br/>
Wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom.<br/>
In the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy;<br/>
Maidens still wear their Norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,<br/>
And by the evening fire repeat Evangeline's story,<br/>
While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced, neighboring ocean<br/>
Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.<br/>
</p>
<p>THE END</p>

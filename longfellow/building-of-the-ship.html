<h1>The Building of the Ship</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
"Build me straight, O worthy Master!<br/>
Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel,<br/>
That shall laugh at all disaster,<br/>
And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"
</p>
<p>
The merchant's word<br/>
Delighted the Master heard;<br/>
For his heart was in his work, and the heart<br/>
Giveth grace unto every Art.<br/>
A quiet smile played round his lips,<br/>
As the eddies and dimples of the tide<br/>
Play round the bows of ships,<br/>
That steadily at anchor ride.<br/>
And with a voice that was full of glee,<br/>
He answered, "Erelong we will launch<br/>
A vessel as goodly, and strong, and stanch,<br/>
As ever weathered a wintry sea!"<br/>
And first with nicest skill and art,<br/>
Perfect and finished in every part,<br/>
A little model the Master wrought,<br/>
Which should be to the larger plan<br/>
What the child is to the man,<br/>
Its counterpart in miniature;<br/>
That with a hand more swift and sure<br/>
The greater labor might be brought<br/>
To answer to his inward thought.<br/>
And as he labored, his mind ran o'er<br/>
The various ships that were built of yore,<br/>
And above them all, and strangest of all<br/>
Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall,<br/>
Whose picture was hanging on the wall,<br/>
With bows and stern raised high in air,<br/>
And balconies hanging here and there,<br/>
And signal lanterns and flags afloat,<br/>
And eight round towers, like those that frown<br/>
From some old castle, looking down<br/>
Upon the drawbridge and the moat.<br/>
And he said with a smile, "Our ship, I wis,<br/>
Shall be of another form than this!"<br/>
It was of another form, indeed;<br/>
Built for freight, and yet for speed,<br/>
A beautiful and gallant craft;<br/>
Broad in the beam, that the stress of the blast,<br/>
Pressing down upon sail and mast,<br/>
Might not the sharp bows overwhelm;<br/>
Broad in the beam, but sloping aft<br/>
With graceful curve and slow degrees,<br/>
That she might be docile to the helm,<br/>
And that the currents of parted seas,<br/>
Closing behind, with mighty force,<br/>
Might aid and not impede her course.
</p>
<p>
In the ship-yard stood the Master,<br/>
With the model of the vessel,<br/>
That should laugh at all disaster,<br/>
And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!<br/>
Covering many a rood of ground,<br/>
Lay the timber piled around;<br/>
Timber of chestnut, and elm, and oak,<br/>
And scattered here and there, with these,<br/>
The knarred and crooked cedar knees;<br/>
Brought from regions far away,<br/>
From Pascagoula's sunny bay,<br/>
And the banks of the roaring Roanoke!<br/>
Ah! what a wondrous thing it is<br/>
To note how many wheels of toil<br/>
One thought, one word, can set in motion!<br/>
There 's not a ship that sails the ocean,<br/>
But every climate, every soil,<br/>
Must bring its tribute, great or small,<br/>
And help to build the wooden wall!
</p>
<p>
The sun was rising o'er the sea,<br/>
And long the level shadows lay,<br/>
As if they, too, the beams would be<br/>
Of some great, airy argosy,<br/>
Framed and launched in a single day.<br/>
That silent architect, the sun,<br/>
Had hewn and laid them every one,<br/>
Ere the work of man was yet begun.<br/>
Beside the Master, when he spoke,<br/>
A youth, against an anchor leaning,<br/>
Listened, to catch his slightest meaning.<br/>
Only the long waves, as they broke<br/>
In ripples on the pebbly beach,<br/>
Interrupted the old man's speech.<br/>
Beautiful they were, in sooth,<br/>
The old man and the fiery youth!<br/>
The old man, in whose busy brain<br/>
Many a ship that sailed the main<br/>
Was modelled o'er and o'er again; &mdash;<br/>
The fiery youth, who was to be<br/>
The heir of his dexterity,<br/>
The heir of his house, and his daughter's hand,<br/>
When he had built and launched from land<br/>
What the elder head had planned.
</p>
<p>
"Thus," said he, "will we build this ship!<br/>
Lay square the blocks upon the slip,<br/>
And follow well this plan of mine.<br/>
Choose the timbers with greatest care;<br/>
Of all that is unsound beware;<br/>
For only what is sound and strong<br/>
To this vessel shall belong.<br/>
Cedar of Maine and Georgia pine<br/>
Here together shall combine.<br/>
A goodly frame, and a goodly fame,<br/>
And the Union be her name!<br/>
For the day that gives her to the sea<br/>
Shall give my daughter unto thee!"
</p>
<p>
The Master's word<br/>
Enraptured the young man heard;<br/>
And as he turned his face aside,<br/>
With a look of joy and a thrill of pride<br/>
Standing before<br/>
Her father's door,<br/>
He saw the form of his promised bride.<br/>
The sun shone on her golden hair,<br/>
And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,<br/>
With the breath of morn and the soft sea air.<br/>
Like a beauteous barge was she,<br/>
Still at rest on the sandy beach,<br/>
Just beyond the billow's reach;<br/>
But he<br/>
Was the restless, seething, stormy sea!<br/>
Ah, how skilful grows the hand<br/>
That obeyeth Love's command!<br/>
It is the heart, and not the brain,<br/>
That to the highest doth attain,<br/>
And he who followeth Love's behest<br/>
Far excelleth all the rest!
</p>
<p>
Thus with the rising of the sun<br/>
Was the noble task begun,<br/>
And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds<br/>
Were heard the intermingled sounds<br/>
Of axes and of mallets, plied<br/>
With vigorous arms on every side;<br/>
Plied so deftly and so well,<br/>
That, ere the shadows of evening fell,<br/>
The keel of oak for a noble ship,<br/>
Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong,<br/>
Was lying ready, and stretched along<br/>
The blocks, well placed upon the slip.<br/>
Happy, thrice happy, every one<br/>
Who sees his labor well begun,<br/>
And not perplexed and multiplied,<br/>
By idly waiting for time and tide!
</p>
<p>
And when the hot, long day was o'er,<br/>
The young man at the Master's door<br/>
Sat with the maiden calm and still,<br/>
And within the porch, a little more<br/>
Removed beyond the evening chill,<br/>
The father sat, and told them tales<br/>
Of wrecks in the great September gales,<br/>
Of pirates coasting the Spanish Main,<br/>
And ships that never came back again,<br/>
The chance and change of a sailor's life,<br/>
Want and plenty, rest and strife,<br/>
His roving fancy, like the wind,<br/>
That nothing can stay and nothing can bind,<br/>
And the magic charm of foreign lands,<br/>
With shadows of palms, and shining sands,<br/>
Where the tumbling surf,<br/>
O'er the coral reefs of Madagascar,<br/>
Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar,<br/>
As he lies alone and asleep on the turf.<br/>
And the trembling maiden held her breath<br/>
At the tales of that awful, pitiless sea,<br/>
With all its terror and mystery,<br/>
The dim, dark sea, so like unto Death,<br/>
That divides and yet unites mankind!<br/>
And whenever the old man paused, a gleam<br/>
From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume<br/>
The silent group in the twilight gloom,<br/>
And thoughtful faces, as in a dream;<br/>
And for a moment one might mark<br/>
What had been hidden by the dark,
</p>
<p>
That the head of the maiden lay at rest,<br/>
Tenderly, on the young man's breast!
</p>
<p>
Day by day the vessel grew,<br/>
With timbers fashioned strong and true,<br/>
Stemson and keelson and sternson-knee,<br/>
Till, framed with perfect symmetry,<br/>
A skeleton ship rose up to view!<br/>
And around the bows and along the side<br/>
The heavy hammers and mallets plied,<br/>
Till after many a week, at length,<br/>
Wonderful for form and strength,<br/>
Sublime in its enormous bulk,<br/>
Loomed aloft the shadowy hulk!<br/>
And around it columns of smoke, upwreathing,<br/>
Rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething<br/>
Caldron, that glowed,<br/>
And overflowed<br/>
With the black tar, heated for the sheathing.<br/>
And amid the clamors<br/>
Of clattering hammers,<br/>
He who listened heard now and then<br/>
The song of the Master and his men: &mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Build me straight, O worthy Master,<br/>
Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel,<br/>
That shall laugh at all disaster,<br/>
And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"
</p>
<p>
With oaken brace and copper band,<br/>
Lay the rudder on the sand,<br/>
That, like a thought, should have control<br/>
Over the movement of the whole;<br/>
And near it the anchor, whose giant hand<br/>
Would reach down and grapple with the land,<br/>
And immovable and fast<br/>
Hold the great ship against the bellowing blast!<br/>
And at the bows an image stood,<br/>
By a cunning artist carved in wood,<br/>
With robes of white, that far behind<br/>
Seemed to be fluttering in the wind.<br/>
It was not shaped in a classic mould,<br/>
Not like a Nymph or Goddess of old,<br/>
Or Naiad rising from the water,<br/>
But modelled from the Master's daughter!<br/>
On many a dreary and misty night,<br/>
'T will be seen by the rays of the signal light,<br/>
Speeding along through the rain and the dark,<br/>
Like a ghost in its snow-white sark,<br/>
The pilot of some phantom bark,<br/>
Guiding the vessel, in its flight,<br/>
By a path none other knows aright!
</p>
<p>
Behold, at last,<br/>
Each tall and tapering mast<br/>
Is swung into its place;<br/>
Shrouds and stays<br/>
Holding it firm and fast!
</p>
<p>
Long ago,<br/>
In the deer-haunted forests of Maine,<br/>
When upon mountain and plain<br/>
Lay the snow,<br/>
They fell, &mdash; those lordly pines!<br/>
Those grand, majestic pines!<br/>
'Mid shouts and cheers<br/>
The jaded steers,<br/>
Panting beneath the goad,<br/>
Dragged down the weary, winding road<br/>
Those captive kings so straight and tall,<br/>
To be shorn of their streaming hair,<br/>
And naked and bare,<br/>
To feel the stress and the strain<br/>
Of the wind and the reeling main,<br/>
Whose roar<br/>
Would remind them forevermore<br/>
Of their native forests they should not see again.<br/>
And everywhere<br/>
The slender, graceful spars<br/>
Poise aloft in the air,<br/>
And at the mast-head,<br/>
White, blue, and red,<br/>
A flag unrolls the stripes and stars.<br/>
Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless,<br/>
In foreign harbors shall behold<br/>
That flag unrolled,<br/>
'T will be as a friendly hand<br/>
Stretched out from his native land,<br/>
Filling his heart with memories sweet and endless!
</p>
<p>
All is finished! and at length<br/>
Has come the bridal day<br/>
Of beauty and of strength.<br/>
To-day the vessel shall be launched!<br/>
With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched,<br/>
And o'er the bay,<br/>
Slowly, in all his splendors dight,<br/>
The great sun rises to behold the sight.
</p>
<p>
The ocean old,<br/>
Centuries old,<br/>
Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled,<br/>
Paces restless to and fro,<br/>
Up and down the sands of gold.<br/>
His beating heart is not at rest;<br/>
And far and wide,<br/>
With ceaseless flow,<br/>
His beard of snow<br/>
Heaves with the heaving of his breast.<br/>
He waits impatient for his bride.<br/>
There she stands,<br/>
With her foot upon the sands,<br/>
Decked with flags and streamers gay,<br/>
In honor of her marriage day,<br/>
Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending,<br/>
Round her like a veil descending,<br/>
Ready to be<br/>
The bride of the gray old sea.
</p>
<p>
On the deck another bride<br/>
Is standing by her lover's side.<br/>
Shadows from the flags and shrouds,<br/>
Like the shadows cast by clouds,<br/>
Broken by many a sunny fleck,<br/>
Fall around them on the deck.
</p>
<p>
The prayer is said,<br/>
The service read,<br/>
The joyous bridegroom bows his head;<br/>
And in tears the good old Master<br/>
Shakes the brown hand of his son,<br/>
Kisses his daughter's glowing cheek<br/>
In silence, for he cannot speak,<br/>
And ever faster<br/>
Down his own the tears begin to run.<br/>
The worthy pastor &mdash;<br/>
The shepherd of that wandering flock,<br/>
That has the ocean for its wold,<br/>
That has the vessel for its fold,<br/>
Leaping ever from rock to rock &mdash;<br/>
Spake, with accents mild and clear,<br/>
Words of warning, words of cheer,<br/>
But tedious to the bridegroom's ear.<br/>
He knew the chart<br/>
Of the sailor's heart,<br/>
All its pleasures and its griefs,<br/>
All its shallows and rocky reefs,<br/>
All those secret currents, that flow<br/>
With such resistless undertow,<br/>
And lift and drift, with terrible force,<br/>
The will from its moorings and its course.<br/>
Therefore he spake, and thus said he: &mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Like unto ships far off at sea,<br/>
Outward or homeward bound, are we.<br/>
Before, behind, and all around,<br/>
Floats and swings the horizon's bound,<br/>
Seems at its distant rim to rise<br/>
And climb the crystal wall of the skies,<br/>
And then again to turn and sink,<br/>
As if we could slide from its outer brink.<br/>
Ah! it is not the sea,<br/>
It is not the sea that sinks and shelves,<br/>
But ourselves<br/>
That rock and rise<br/>
With endless and uneasy motion,<br/>
Now touching the very skies,<br/>
Now sinking into the depths of ocean.<br/>
Ah! if our souls but poise and swing<br/>
Like the compass in its brazen ring,<br/>
Ever level and ever true<br/>
To the toil and the task we have to do,<br/>
We shall sail securely, and safely reach<br/>
The Fortunate Isles, on whose shining beach<br/>
The sights we see, and the sounds we hear,<br/>
Will be those of joy and not of fear!"
</p>
<p>
Then the Master,<br/>
With a gesture of command,<br/>
Waved his hand;<br/>
And at the word,<br/>
Loud and sudden there was heard,<br/>
All around them and below,<br/>
The sound of hammers, blow on blow,<br/>
Knocking away the shores and spurs.<br/>
And see! she stirs!<br/>
She starts, &mdash; she moves, &mdash; she seems to feel<br/>
The thrill of life along her keel,<br/>
And, spurning with her foot the ground,<br/>
With one exulting, joyous bound,<br/>
She leaps into the ocean's arms!
</p>
<p>
And lo! from the assembled crowd<br/>
There rose a shout, prolonged and loud,<br/>
That to the ocean seemed to say,<br/>
"Take her, O bridegroom, old and gray,<br/>
Take her to thy protecting arms,<br/>
With all her youth and all her charms!"
</p>
<p>
How beautiful she is! How fair<br/>
She lies within those arms, that press<br/>
Her form with many a soft caress<br/>
Of tenderness and watchful care!<br/>
Sail forth into the sea, O ship!<br/>
Through wind and wave, right onward steer!<br/>
The moistened eye, the trembling lip,<br/>
Are not the signs of doubt or fear.<br/>
Sail forth into the sea of life,<br/>
O gentle, loving, trusting wife,<br/>
And safe from all adversity<br/>
Upon the bosom of that sea<br/>
Thy comings and thy goings be!<br/>
For gentleness and love and trust<br/>
Prevail o'er angry wave and gust;<br/>
And in the wreck of noble lives<br/>
Something immortal still survives!
</p>
<p>
Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!<br/>
Sail on, O Union, strong and great!<br/>
Humanity with all its fears,<br/>
With all the hopes of future years,<br/>
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!<br/>
We know what Master laid thy keel,<br/>
What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,<br/>
Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,<br/>
What anvils rang, what hammers beat,<br/>
In what a forge and what a heat<br/>
Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!<br/>
Fear not each sudden sound and shock,<br/>
'T is of the wave and not the rock;<br/>
'T is but the flapping of the sail,<br/>
And not a rent made by the gale!<br/>
In spite of rock and tempest's roar,<br/>
In spite of false lights on the shore,<br/>
Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!<br/>
Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,<br/>
Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,<br/>
Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,<br/>
Are all with thee, &mdash; are all with thee!

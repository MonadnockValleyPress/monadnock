<h1>Evangeline</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Part the First</h2>
<h2>Section III</h2>
<p>
Bent like a laboring oar, that toils in the surf of the ocean,<br/>
Bent, but not broken, by age was the form of the notary public;<br/>
Shocks of yellow hair, like the silken floss of the maize, hung<br/>
Over his shoulders; his forehead was high; and glasses with horn bows<br/>
Sat astride on his nose, with a look of wisdom supernal.<br/>
Father of twenty children was he, and more than a hundred<br/>
Children's children rode on his knee, and heard his great watch tick.<br/>
Four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,<br/>
Suffering much in an old French fort as the friend of the English.<br/>
Now, though warier grown, without all guile or suspicion,<br/>
Ripe in wisdom was he, but patient, and simple, and childlike.<br/>
He was beloved by all, and most of all by the children;<br/>
For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the forest,<br/>
And of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,<br/>
And of the white Letiche, the ghost of a child who unchristened<br/>
Died, and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children;<br/>
And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,<br/>
And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,<br/>
And of the marvelous powers of four-leaved clover and horseshoes,<br/>
With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village.<br/>
Then up rose from his seat by the fireside Basil the blacksmith,<br/>
Knocked from his pipe the ashes, and slowly extending his right hand,<br/>
"Father Leblanc," he exclaimed, "thou hast heard the talk in the village,<br/>
And, perchance, canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand."<br/>
Then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,&mdash;<br/>
"Gossip enough have I heard, in sooth, yet am never the wiser;<br/>
And what their errand may be I know no better than others.<br/>
Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil intention<br/>
Brings them here, for we are at peace; and why then molest us?"<br/>
"God's name!" shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith;<br/>
"Must we in all things look for the how, and the why, and the wherefore?<br/>
Daily injustice is done, and might is the right of the strongest!"<br/>
But, without heeding his warmth, continued the notary public,&mdash;<br/>
"Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice<br/>
Triumphs; and well I remember a story, that often consoled me,<br/>
When as a captive I lay in the old French fort at Port Royal."<br/>
This was the old man's favorite tale, and he loved to repeat it<br/>
When his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them.<br/>
"Once in an ancient city, whose name I no longer remember,<br/>
Raised aloft on a column, a brazen statute of Justice<br/>
Stood in the public square, upholding the scales in its left hand,<br/>
And in its right a sword, as an emblem that justice presided<br/>
Over the laws of the land, and the hearts and homes of the people.<br/>
Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,<br/>
Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them.<br/>
But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted;<br/>
Might took the place of right, and the weak were oppressed, and the mighty<br/>
Ruled with an iron rod. Then it chanced in a nobleman's palace<br/>
That a necklace of pearls was lost, and ere long a suspicion<br/>
Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household.<br/>
She, after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,<br/>
Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of Justice.<br/>
As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,<br/>
Lo! o'er the city a tempest rose; and the bolts of the thunder<br/>
Smote the statue of bronze, and hurled in wrath from its left hand<br/>
Down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,<br/>
And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,<br/>
Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven."<br/>
Silenced, but not convinced, when the story was ended, the blacksmith<br/>
Stood like a man who fain would speak, but findeth no language;<br/>
All his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face, as the vapors<br/>
Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes in the winter.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,<br/>
Filled, till it overflowed, the pewter tankard with home-brewed<br/>
Nut-brown ale, that was famed for its strength in the village of Grand-Pre;<br/>
While from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn,<br/>
Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,<br/>
Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle.<br/>
Orderly all things proceeded, and duly and well were completed,<br/>
And the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin.<br/>
Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table<br/>
Three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver;<br/>
And the notary rising, and blessing the bride and bridegroom,<br/>
Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare.<br/>
Wiping the foam from his lip, he solemnly bowed and departed,<br/>
While in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,<br/>
Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner.<br/>
Soon was the game begun. In friendly contention the old men<br/>
Laughed at each lucky hit, or unsuccessful manoeuvre,<br/>
Laughed when a man was crowned, or a breach was made in the king-row.<br/>
Meanwhile, apart, in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,<br/>
Sat the lovers and whispered together, beholding the moon rise<br/>
Over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Silently, one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,<br/>
Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus was the evening passed. Anon the bell from the belfry<br/>
Rang out the hour of nine, the village curfew, and straightway<br/>
Rose the guests and departed; and silence reigned in the household.<br/>
Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on the door-step<br/>
Lingered long in Evangeline's heart, and filled it with gladness.<br/>
Carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth-stone,<br/>
And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer.<br/>
Soon with a soundless step the foot of Evangeline followed.<br/>
Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,<br/>
Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden.<br/>
Silent she passed through the hall, and entered the door of her chamber.<br/>
Simple that chamber was, with its curtains of white, and its clothes-press<br/>
Ample and high, on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded<br/>
Linen and woolen stuffs, by the hand of Evangeline woven<br/>
This was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,<br/>
Better than flocks and herds, being proofs of her skill as a housewife.<br/>
Soon she extinguished her lamp, for the mellow and radiant moonlight<br/>
Streamed through the windows, and lighted the room, till the heart of the maiden<br/>
Swelled and obeyed its power, like the tremulous tides of the ocean.<br/>
Ah! she was fair, exceeding fair to behold, as she stood with<br/>
Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber!<br/>
Little she dreamed that below, among the trees of the orchard,<br/>
Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow.<br/>
Yet were her thoughts of him, and at times a feeling of sadness<br/>
Passed o'er her soul, as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight<br/>
Flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment.<br/>
And, as she gazed from the window, she saw serenely the moon pass<br/>
Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star follow her footsteps,<br/>
As out of Abraham's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar.<br/>

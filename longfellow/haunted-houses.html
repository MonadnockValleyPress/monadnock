<h1>Haunted Houses</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
All houses wherein men have lived and died<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are haunted houses.  Through the open doors<br/>
The harmless phantoms on their errands glide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With feet that make no sound upon the floors.
</p>
<p>
We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the passages they come and go,<br/>
Impalpable impressions on the air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sense of something moving to and fro.
</p>
<p>
There are more guests at table, than the hosts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Invited; the illuminated hall<br/>
Is thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As silent as the pictures on the wall.
</p>
<p>
The stranger at my fireside cannot see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;<br/>
He but perceives what is; while unto me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All that has been is visible and clear.
</p>
<p>
We have no title-deeds to house or lands;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Owners and occupants of earlier dates<br/>
From graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hold in mortmain still their old estates.
</p>
<p>
The spirit-world around this world of sense<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Floats like an atmosphere, and everywhere<br/>
Wafts through these earthly mists and vapors dense<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A vital breath of more ethereal air.
</p>
<p>
Our little lives are kept in equipoise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By opposite attractions and desires;<br/>
The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the more noble instinct that aspires.
</p>
<p>
These perturbations, this perpetual jar<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of earthly wants and aspirations high,<br/>
Come from the influence of an unseen star,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An undiscovered planet in our sky.
</p>
<p>
And as the moon from some dark gate of cloud<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Throws o'er the sea a floating bridge of light,<br/>
Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the realm of mystery and night,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
So from the world of spirits there descends<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A bridge of light, connecting it with this,<br/>
O'er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.

<h1>Evangeline</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Part the Second</h2>
<h2>Section IV</h2>
<p>
Far in the West there lies a desert land, where the mountains<br/>
Lift, through perpetual snows, their lofty and luminous summits.<br/>
Down from their jagged, deep ravines, where the gorge, like a gateway, 1080<br/>
Opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,<br/>
Westward the Oregon flows and the Walleway and Owyhee.<br/>
Eastward, with devious course, among the Wind-river Mountains,<br/>
Through the Sweet-water Valley precipitate leaps the Nebraska;<br/>
And to the south, from Fontaine-quibout and the Spanish sierras,<br/>
Fretted with sands and rocks, and swept by the wind of the desert,<br/>
Numberless torrents, with ceaseless sound, descend to the ocean,<br/>
Like the great chords of a harp, in loud and solemn vibrations.<br/>
Spreading between these streams are the wondrous, beautiful prairies,<br/>
Billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,<br/>
Bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas.<br/>
Over them wandered the buffalo herds, and the elk, and the roebuck;<br/>
Over them wandered the wolves, and herds of riderless horses;<br/>
Fires that blast and blight, and winds that are weary with travel;<br/>
Over them wander the scattered tribes of Ishmael's children,<br/>
Staining the desert with blood; and above their terrible war-trails<br/>
Circles and sails aloft, on pinions majestic, the vulture,<br/>
Like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle,<br/>
By invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens.<br/>
Here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders;<br/>
Here and there rise groves from the margins of swift-running rivers;<br/>
And the grim, taciturn bear, the anchorite monk of the desert,<br/>
Climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook-side,<br/>
And over all is the sky, the clear and crystalline heaven,<br/>
Like the protecting hand of God inverted above them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Into this wonderful land, at the base of the Ozark Mountains,<br/>
Gabriel far had entered, with hunters and trappers behind him.<br/>
Day after day, with their Indian guides, the maiden and Basil<br/>
Followed his flying steps, and thought each day to o'ertake him.<br/>
Sometimes they saw, or thought they saw, the smoke of his camp-fire<br/>
Rise in the morning air from the distant plain; but at nightfall,<br/>
When they had reached the place, they found only embers and ashes.<br/>
And, though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,<br/>
Hope still guided them on, as the magic Fata Morgana<br/>
Showed them her lakes of light, that retreated and vanished before them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once, as they sat by their evening fire, there silently entered<br/>
Into the little camp an Indian woman, whose features<br/>
Wore deep traces of sorrow, and patience as great as her sorrow.<br/>
She was a Shawnee woman returning home to her people,<br/>
From the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel Camanches,<br/>
Where her Canadian husband, a coureur-des-bois, had been murdered.<br/>
Touched were their hearts at her story, and warmest and friendliest welcome<br/>
Gave they, the words of cheer, and she sat and feasted among them<br/>
On the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers.<br/>
But when their meal was done, and Basil and all his companions,<br/>
Worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison,<br/>
Stretched themselves on the ground, and slept where the quivering fire-light<br/>
Flashed on their swarthy cheeks, and their forms wrapped up in their blankets,<br/>
Then at the door of Evangeline's tent she sat and repeated<br/>
Slowly, with soft, low voice, and the charm of her Indian accent,<br/>
All the tale of her love, with its pleasures, and pains, and reverses.<br/>
Much Evangeline wept at the tale, and to know that another<br/>
Hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed.<br/>
Moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,<br/>
Yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,<br/>
She in turn related her love and all its disasters.<br/>
Mute with wonder the Shawnee sat, and when she had ended<br/>
Still was mute; but at length, as if a mysterious horror<br/>
Passed through her brain, she spake, and repeated the tale of the Mowis;<br/>
Mowis, the bridegroom of snow, who won and wedded a maiden.<br/>
But, when the morning came, arose and passed from the wigwam,<br/>
Fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,<br/>
Till she beheld him no more, though she followed far into the forest.<br/>
Then, in those sweet, low tones, that seemed like a weird incantation,<br/>
Told she the tale of the fair Lilinau, who was wooed by a phantom,<br/>
That, through the pines o'er her father's lodge, in the hush of the twilight,<br/>
Breathed like the evening wind, and whispered love to the maiden,<br/>
Till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,<br/>
And nevermore returned, nor was seen again by her people.<br/>
Silent with wonder and strange surprise, Evangeline listened<br/>
To the soft flow of her magical words, till the region around her<br/>
Seemed like enchanted ground, and her swarthy guest the enchantress.<br/>
Slowly over the tops of the Ozark Mountains the moon rose,<br/>
Lighting the little tent, and with a mysterious splendor<br/>
Touching the sombre leaves, and embracing and filling the woodland.<br/>
With a delicious sound the brook rushed by, and the branches<br/>
Swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers.<br/>
Filled with the thoughts of love was Evangeline's heart, but a secret,<br/>
Subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,<br/>
As the cold, poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow.<br/>
It was no earthly fear. A breath from the region of spirits<br/>
Seemed to float in the air of night; and she felt for a moment<br/>
That, like the Indian maid, she, too, was pursuing a phantom.<br/>
With this thought she slept, and the fear and the phantom had vanished.<br/>
Early upon the morrow the march was resumed, and the Shawnee<br/>
Said, as they journeyed along,&mdash;"On the western slope of these mountains<br/>
Dwells in his little village the Black Robe chief of the Mission.<br/>
Much he teaches the people, and tells them of Mary and Jesus;<br/>
Loud laugh their hearts with joy, and weep with pain, as they hear him."<br/>
Then, with a sudden and secret emotion, Evangeline answered,<br/>
"Let us go to the Mission, for there good tidings await us!"<br/>
Thither they turned their steeds; and behind a spur of the mountains,<br/>
Just as the sun went down, they heard a murmur of voices,<br/>
And in a meadow green and broad, by the bank of a river,<br/>
Saw the tents of the Christians, the tents of the Jesuit Mission.<br/>
Under a towering oak, that stood in the midst of the village,<br/>
Knelt the Black Robe chief with his children. A crucifix fastened<br/>
High on the trunk of the tree, and overshadowed by grapevines,<br/>
Looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it.<br/>
This was their rural chapel. Aloft, through the intricate arches<br/>
Of its aerial roof, arose the chant of their vespers,<br/>
Mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches.<br/>
Silent, with heads uncovered, the travellers, nearer approaching,<br/>
Knelt on the swarded floor, and joined in the evening devotions.<br/>
But when the service was done, and the benediction had fallen<br/>
Forth from the hands of the priest, like seed from the hands of the sower,<br/>
Slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers, and bade them<br/>
Welcome; and when they replied, he smiled with benignant expression,<br/>
Hearing the homelike sounds of his mother-tongue in the forest,<br/>
And with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam.<br/>
There upon mats and skins they reposed, and on cakes of the maize-ear<br/>
Feasted, and slaked their thirst from the water-gourd of the teacher.<br/>
Soon was their story told; and the priest with solemnity answered:&mdash;<br/>
"Not six suns have risen and set since Gabriel, seated<br/>
On this mat by my side, where now the maiden reposes,<br/>
Told me the same sad tale; then arose and continued his journey!"<br/>
Soft was the voice of the priest, and he spake with an accent of kindness;<br/>
But on Evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes<br/>
Fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed.<br/>
"Far to the north he has gone," continued the priest; "but in autumn,<br/>
When the chase is done, will return again to the Mission."<br/>
Then Evangeline said, and her voice was meek and submissive,<br/>
"Let me remain with thee, for my soul is sad and afflicted."<br/>
So seemed it wise and well unto all; and betimes on the morrow,<br/>
Mounting his Mexican steed, with his Indian guides and companions,<br/>
Homeward Basil returned, and Evangeline stayed at the Mission.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Slowly, slowly, slowly the days succeeded each other,&mdash;<br/>
Days and weeks and months; and the fields of maize that were springing<br/>
Green from the ground when a stranger she came, now waving about her,<br/>
Lifted their slender shafts, with leaves interlacing, and forming<br/>
Cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels.<br/>
Then in the golden weather the maize was husked, and the maidens<br/>
Blushed at each blood-red ear, for that betokened a lover,<br/>
But at the crooked laughed, and called it a thief in the corn-field.<br/>
Even the blood-red ear to Evangeline brought not her lover.<br/>
"Patience!" the priest would say; "have faith, and thy prayer will be answered!<br/>
Look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow,<br/>
See how its leaves are turned to the north, as true as the magnet;<br/>
This is the compass-flower, that the finger of God has planted<br/>
Here in the houseless wild, to direct the traveller's journey<br/>
Over the sea-like, pathless, limitless waste of the desert.<br/>
Such in the soul of man is faith. The blossoms of passion,<br/>
Gay and luxuriant flowers, are brighter and fuller of fragrance,<br/>
But they beguile us, and lead us astray, and their odor is deadly.<br/>
Only this humble plant can guide us here, and hereafter<br/>
Crown us with asphodel flowers, that are wet with the dews of nepenthe."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So came the autumn, and passed, and the winter&mdash;yet Gabriel came not;<br/>
Blossomed the opening spring, and the notes of the robin and bluebird<br/>
Sounded sweet upon wold and in wood, yet Gabriel came not.<br/>
But on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted<br/>
Sweeter than the song of bird, or hue or odor of blossom.<br/>
Far to the north and east, it is said, in the Michigan forests,<br/>
Gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the Saginaw River.<br/>
And, with returning guides, that sought the lakes of St. Lawrence,<br/>
Saying a sad farewell, Evangeline went from the Mission.<br/>
When over weary ways, by long and perilous marches,<br/>
She had attained at length the depths of the Michigan forests,<br/>
Found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus did the long sad years glide on, and in seasons and places<br/>
Divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden;&mdash;<br/>
Now in the Tents of Grace of the meek Moravian Missions,<br/>
Now in the noisy camps and the battle-fields of the army,<br/>
Now in secluded hamlets, in towns and populous cities.<br/>
Like a phantom she came, and passed away unremembered.<br/>
Fair was she and young, when in hope began the long journey;<br/>
Faded was she and old, when in disappointment it ended.<br/>
Each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty,<br/>
Leaving behind it, broader and deeper, the gloom and the shadow.<br/>
Then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,<br/>
Dawn of another life, that broke o'er her earthly horizon,<br/>
As in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning.<br/>

<h1>Evangeline</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Part the Second</h2>
<h2>Section I</h2>
<p>
Many a weary year had passed since the burning of Grand-Pre.<br/>
When on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,<br/>
Bearing a nation, with all its household Gods, into exile,<br/>
Exile without an end, and without an example in story.<br/>
Far asunder, on separate coasts, the Acadians landed;<br/>
Scattered were they, like flakes of snow, when the wind from the northeast<br/>
Strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the Banks of Newfoundland.<br/>
Friendless, homeless, hopeless, they wandered from city to city,<br/>
From the cold lakes of the North to sultry Southern savannas&mdash;<br/>
From the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the Father of Waters<br/>
Seizes the hills in his hands, and drags them down to the ocean,<br/>
Deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth.<br/>
Friends they sought and homes; and many, despairing, heart-broken,<br/>
Asked of the earth but a grave, and no longer a friend nor a fireside.<br/>
Written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards.<br/>
Long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered,<br/>
Lowly and meek in spirit, and patiently suffering all things.<br/>
Fair was she and young; but, alas! before her extended,<br/>
Dreary and vast and silent, the desert of life, with its pathway<br/>
Marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her,<br/>
Passions long extinguished, and hopes long dead and abandoned,<br/>
As the emigrant's way o'er the Western desert is marked by<br/>
Camp-fires long consumed, and bones that bleach in the sunshine.<br/>
Something there was in her life incomplete, imperfect, unfinished;<br/>
As if a morning of June, with all its music and sunshine,<br/>
Suddenly paused in the sky, and fading, slowly descended<br/>
Into the east again, from whence it late had arisen.<br/>
Sometimes she lingered in towns, till, urged by the fever within her,<br/>
Urged by a restless longing, the hunger and thirst of the spirit,<br/>
She would commence again her endless search and endeavor;<br/>
Sometimes in churchyards strayed, and gazed on the crosses and tombstones,<br/>
Sat by some nameless grave, and thought that perhaps in its bosom,<br/>
He was already at rest, and she longed to slumber beside him.<br/>
Sometimes a rumor, a hearsay, an inarticulate whisper,<br/>
Came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward.<br/>
Sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him,<br/>
But it was long ago, in some far-off place or forgotten.<br/>
"Gabriel Lajeunesse!" they said; "Oh, yes! we have seen him.<br/>
He was with Basil the blacksmith, and both have gone to the prairies;<br/>
Coureurs-des-bois are they, and famous hunters and trappers."<br/>
"Gabriel Lajeunesse!" said others; "Oh, yes! we have seen him.<br/>
He is a voyageur in the lowlands of Louisiana."<br/>
Then would they say, "Dear child! why dream and wait for him longer?<br/>
Are there not other youths as fair as Gabriel? Others<br/>
Who have hearts as tender and true, and spirits as loyal?<br/>
Here is Baptiste Leblanc, the notary's son, who has loved thee<br/>
Many a tedious year; come, give him thy hand and be happy!<br/>
Thou art too fair to be left to braid St. Catherine's tresses."<br/>
Then would Evangeline answer, serenely but sadly, "I cannot!<br/>
Whither my heart has gone, there follows my hand, and not elsewhere.    7<br/>
For when the heart goes before, like a lamp, and illumines the pathway,<br/>
Many things are made clear, that else lie hidden in darkness."<br/>
Thereupon the priest, her friend and father-confessor,<br/>
Said, with a smile, "O daughter! thy God thus speaketh within thee!<br/>
Talk not of wasted affection, affection never was wasted;<br/>
If it enrich not the heart of another, its waters, returning<br/>
Back to their springs, like the rain, shall fill them full of refreshment;<br/>
That which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain.<br/>
Patience; accomplish thy labor; accomplish thy work of affection!<br/>
Sorrow and silence are strong, and patient endurance is godlike.<br/>
Therefore accomplish thy labor of love, till the heart is made godlike,<br/>
Purified, strengthened, perfected, and rendered more worthy of heaven!"<br/>
Cheered by the good man's words, Evangeline labored and waited.<br/>
Still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean,<br/>
But with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered, "Despair not!"<br/>
Thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort,<br/>
Bleeding, barefooted, over the shards and thorns of existence.<br/>
Let me essay, O Muse! to follow the wanderer's footsteps;&mdash;<br/>
Not through each devious path, each changeful year of existence;<br/>
But as a traveler follows a streamlet's course through the valley:<br/>
Far from its margin at times, and seeing the gleam of its water<br/>
Here and there, in some open space, and at intervals only;<br/>
Then drawing nearer its banks, through sylvan glooms that conceal it,<br/>
Though he behold it not, he can hear its continuous murmur;<br/>
Happy, at length, if he find a spot where it reaches an outlet.<br/>

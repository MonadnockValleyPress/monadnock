<h1>Evangeline</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Part the First</h2>
<h2>Section V</h2>
<p>
Four times the sun had risen and set; and now on the fifth day<br/>
Cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farm-house.<br/>
Soon o'er the yellow fields, in silent and mournful procession,<br/>
Came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the Acadian women,<br/>
Driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea-shore,<br/>
Pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,<br/>
Ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland.<br/>
Close at their sides their children ran, and urged on the oxen,<br/>
While in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth they hurried; and there on the sea-beach<br/>
Piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants.<br/>
All day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply;<br/>
All day long the wains came laboring down from the village.<br/>
Late in the afternoon, when the sun was near to his setting,<br/>
Echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard.<br/>
Thither the women and children thronged. On a sudden the church-doors<br/>
Opened, and forth came the guard, and marching in gloomy procession<br/>
Followed the long-imprisoned, but patient, Acadian farmers.<br/>
Even as pilgrims, who journey afar from their homes and their country,<br/>
Sing as they go, and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn,<br/>
So with songs on their lips the Acadian peasants descended<br/>
Down from the church to the shore, amid their wives and their daughters.<br/>
Foremost the young men came; and raising together their voices,<br/>
Sang with tremulous lips a chant of the Catholic Missions:&mdash;<br/>
"Sacred heart of the Saviour! O inexhaustible fountain!<br/>
Fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience!"<br/>
Then the old men, as they marched, and the women that stood by the wayside<br/>
Joined in the sacred psalm, and the birds in the sunshine above them<br/>
Mingled their notes therewith, like voices of spirits departed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Half-way down to the shore Evangeline waited in silence,<br/>
Not overcome with grief, but strong in the hour of affliction,&mdash;<br/>
Calmly and sadly she waited, until the procession approached her,<br/>
And she beheld the face of Gabriel pale with emotion.<br/>
Tears then filled her eyes, and, eagerly running to meet him,<br/>
Clasped she his hands, and laid her head on his shoulder, and whispered,&mdash;<br/>
"Gabriel! be of good cheer! for if we love one another<br/>
Nothing, in truth, can harm us, whatever mischances may happen!"<br/>
Smiling she spake these words; then suddenly paused, for her father<br/>
Saw she, slowly advancing. Alas! how changed was his aspect!<br/>
Gone was the glow from his cheek, and the fire from his eye, and his footstep<br/>
Heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom.<br/>
But with a smile and a sigh, she clasped his neck and embraced him,<br/>
Speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not.<br/>
Thus to the Gasperau's mouth moved on that mournful procession.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There disorder prevailed, and the tumult and stir of embarking.<br/>
Busily plied the freighted boats; and in the confusion<br/>
Wives were torn from their husbands, and mothers, too late, saw their children<br/>
Left on the land, extending their arms, with wildest entreaties.<br/>
So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel carried,<br/>
While in despair on the shore Evangeline stood with her father.<br/>
Half the task was not done when the sun went down, and the twilight<br/>
Deepened and darkened around; and in haste the refluent ocean<br/>
Fled away from the shore, and left the line of the sand-beach<br/>
Covered with waifs of the tide, with kelp and the slippery sea-weed.<br/>
Farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,<br/>
Like to a gypsy camp, or a leaguer after a battle,<br/>
All escape cut off by the sea, and the sentinels near them,<br/>
Lay encamped for the night the houseless Acadian farmers.<br/>
Back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,<br/>
Dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles, and leaving<br/>
Inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors.<br/>
Then, as the night descended, the herds returned from their pastures,<br/>
Sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders<br/>
Lowing they waited, and long, at the well-known bars of the farm-yard,&mdash;<br/>
Waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid.<br/>
Silence reigned in the streets; from the church no Angelus sounded,<br/>
Rose no smoke from the roofs, and gleamed no lights from the windows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled,<br/>
Built of the drift-wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest.<br/>
Round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered,<br/>
Voices of women were heard, and of men, and the crying of children.<br/>
Onward from fire to fire, as from hearth to hearth in his parish,<br/>
Wandered the faithful priest, consoling and blessing and cheering,<br/>
Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita's desolate sea-shore.<br/>
Thus he approached the place where Evangeline sat with her father,<br/>
And in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man,<br/>
Haggard and hollow and wan, and without either thought or emotion,<br/>
E'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken.<br/>
Vainly Evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,<br/>
Vainly offered him food; yet he moved not, he looked not, he spake not,<br/>
But, with a vacant stare, ever gazed at the flickering fire-light.<br/>
<em>Benedicite!</em> murmured the priest, in tones of compassion.<br/>
More he fain would have said, but his heart was full, and his accents<br/>
Faltered and paused on his lips, as the feet of a child on a threshold,<br/>
Hushed by the scene he beholds, and the awful presence of sorrow.<br/>
Silently, therefore, he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,<br/>
Raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them<br/>
Moved on their way, unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals.<br/>
Then sat he down at her side, and they wept together in silence.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly rose from the south a light, as in autumn the blood-red<br/>
Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o'er the horizon<br/>
Titan-like stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow,<br/>
Seizing the rocks and the rivers, and piling huge shadows together.<br/>
Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village,<br/>
Gleamed on the sky and the sea, and the ships that lay in the roadstead.<br/>
Columns of shining smoke uprose, and flashes of flame were<br/>
Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like the quivering hands of a martyr.<br/>
Then, as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch, and, uplifting,<br/>
Whirled them aloft through the air, at once from a hundred house-tops<br/>
Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled.<br/>
</p>
<p>
These things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard.<br/>
Speechless at first they stood, then cried aloud in their anguish,<br/>
"We shall behold no more our homes in the village of Grand-Pre!"<br/>
Loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farmyards,<br/>
Thinking the day had dawned; and anon the lowing of cattle<br/>
Came on the evening breeze, by the barking of dogs interrupted.<br/>
Then rose a sound of dread, such as startles the sleeping encampments<br/>
Far in the western prairies of forests that skirt the Nebraska,<br/>
When the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind,<br/>
Or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river.<br/>
Such was the sound that arose on the night, as the herds and the horses<br/>
Broke through their folds and fences, and madly rushed o'er the meadows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Overwhelmed with the sight, yet speechless, the priest and the maiden<br/>
Gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them;<br/>
And as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion,<br/>
Lo! from his seat he had fallen, and stretched abroad on the seashore<br/>
Motionless lay his form, from which the soul had departed.<br/>
Slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head, and the maiden<br/>
Knelt at her father's side, and wailed aloud in her terror.<br/>
Then in a swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom.<br/>
Through the long night she lay in deep, oblivious slumber;<br/>
And when she woke from the trance, she beheld a multitude near her.<br/>
Faces of friends she beheld, that were mournfully gazing upon her,<br/>
Pallid, with tearful eyes, and looks of saddest compassion.<br/>
Still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape.<br/>
Reddened the sky overhead, and gleamed on the faces around her,<br/>
And like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses.<br/>
Then a familiar voice she heard, as it said to the people,&mdash;<br/>
"Let us bury him here by the sea. When a happier season<br/>
Brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile,<br/>
Then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard."<br/>
Such were the words of the priest. And there in haste by the sea-side,<br/>
Having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches,<br/>
But without bell or book, they buried the farmer of Grand-Pre.<br/>
And as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow,<br/>
Lo! with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation,<br/>
Solemnly answered the sea, and mingled its roar with the dirges.<br/>
'T was the returning tide, that afar from the waste of the ocean,<br/>
With the first dawn of the day, came heaving and hurrying landward.<br/>
Then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking;<br/>
And with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,<br/>
Leaving behind them the dead on the shore, and the village in ruins.<br/>

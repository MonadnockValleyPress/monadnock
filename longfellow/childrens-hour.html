<h1>The Children's Hour</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
Between the dark and the daylight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night is beginning to lower,<br/>
Comes a pause in the day's occupations,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is known as the Children's Hour.
</p>
<p>
I hear in the chamber above me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The patter of little feet,<br/>
The sound of a door that is opened,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And voices soft and sweet.
</p>
<p>
From my study I see in the lamplight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Descending the broad hall stair,<br/>
Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Edith with golden hair.
</p>
<p>
A whisper, and then a silence:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I know by their merry eyes<br/>
They are plotting and planning together<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To take me by surprise.
</p>
<p>
A sudden rush from the stairway,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden raid from the hall!<br/>
By three doors left unguarded<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They enter my castle wall!
</p>
<p>
They climb up into my turret<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the arms and back of my chair;<br/>
If I try to escape, they surround me;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to be everywhere.
</p>
<p>
They almost devour me with kisses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their arms about me entwine,<br/>
Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine!
</p>
<p>
Do you think, o blue-eyed banditti,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you have scaled the wall,<br/>
Such an old mustache as I am<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not a match for you all!
</p>
<p>
I have you fast in my fortress,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And will not let you depart,<br/>
But put you down into the dungeon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the round-tower of my heart.
</p>
<p>
And there will I keep you forever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, forever and a day,<br/>
Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And moulder in dust away!
</p>

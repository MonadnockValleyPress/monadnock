<h1>A Day of Sunshine</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
O gift of God!  O perfect day:<br/>
Whereon shall no man work, but play;<br/>
Whereon it is enough for me,<br/>
Not to be doing, but to be!
</p>
<p>
Through every fibre of my brain,<br/>
Through every nerve, through every vein,<br/>
I feel the electric thrill, the touch<br/>
Of life, that seems almost too much.
</p>
<p>
I hear the wind among the trees<br/>
Playing celestial symphonies;<br/>
I see the branches downward bent,<br/>
Like keys of some great instrument.
</p>
<p>
And over me unrolls on high<br/>
The splendid scenery of the sky,<br/>
Where through a sapphire sea the sun<br/>
Sails like a golden galleon,
</p>
<p>
Towards yonder cloud-land in the West,<br/>
Towards yonder Islands of the Blest,<br/>
Whose steep sierra far uplifts<br/>
Its craggy summits white with drifts.
</p>
<p>
Blow, winds! and waft through all the rooms<br/>
The snow-flakes of the cherry-blooms!<br/>
Blow, winds! and bend within my reach<br/>
The fiery blossoms of the peach!
</p>
<p>
O Life and Love! O happy throng<br/>
Of thoughts, whose only speech is song!<br/>
O heart of man! canst thou not be<br/>
Blithe as the air is, and as free?
</p>

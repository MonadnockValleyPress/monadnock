<h1>Hermes Trismegistus</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<blockquote>
As Seleucus narrates, Hermes describes the principles that rank as wholes in two myriads of books; or, as we are informed by Manetho, he perfectly unfolded these principles in three myriads six thousand five hundred and twenty-five volumes. . . . . . . Our ancestors dedicated the inventions of their wisdom to this deity, inscribing all their own writings with the name of Hermes.
<br/><br/>
&mdash;Iamblicus

<p>
Still through Egypt's desert places<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flows the lordly Nile,<br/>
From its banks the great stone faces<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaze with patient smile.<br/>
Still the pyramids imperious<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierce the cloudless skies,<br/>
And the Sphinx stares with mysterious,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemn, stony eyes.
</p>
<p>
But where are the old Egyptian<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demi-gods and kings?<br/>
Nothing left but an inscription<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graven on stones and rings.<br/>
Where are Helios and Heph√¶stus,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods of eldest eld?<br/>
Where is Hermes Trismegistus,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who their secrets held?
</p>
<p>
Where are now the many hundred<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousand books he wrote?<br/>
By the Thaumaturgists plundered,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in lands remote;<br/>
In oblivion sunk forever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when o'er the land<br/>
Blows a storm-wind, in the river<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinks the scattered sand.
</p>
<p>
Something unsubstantial, ghostly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems this Theurgist,<br/>
In deep meditation mostly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped, as in a mist.<br/>
Vague, phantasmal, and unreal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To our thought he seems,<br/>
Walking in a world ideal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a land of dreams.
</p>
<p>
Was he one, or many, merging<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name and fame in one,<br/>
Like a stream, to which, converging<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many streamlets run?<br/>
Till, with gathered power proceeding,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ampler sweep it takes,<br/>
Downward the sweet waters leading<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From unnumbered lakes.
</p>
<p>
By the Nile I see him wandering,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing now and then,<br/>
On the mystic union pondering<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between gods and men;<br/>
Half believing, wholly feeling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With supreme delight,<br/>
How the gods, themselves concealing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift men to their height.
</p>
<p>
Or in Thebes, the hundred-gated,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thoroughfare<br/>
Breathing, as if consecrated,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A diviner air;<br/>
And amid discordant noises,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the jostling throng,<br/>
Hearing far, celestial voices<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Olympian song.
</p>
<p>
Who shall call his dreams fallacious?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has searched or sought<br/>
All the unexplored and spacious<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universe of thought?<br/>
Who, in his own skill confiding,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall with rule and line<br/>
Mark the border-land dividing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human and divine?
</p>
<p>
Trismegistus! three times greatest!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How thy name sublime<br/>
Has descended to this latest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progeny of time!<br/>
Happy they whose written pages<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perish with their lives,<br/>
If amid the crumbling ages<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still their name survives!
</p>
<p>
Thine, O priest of Egypt, lately<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found I in the vast,<br/>
Weed-encumbered sombre, stately,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grave-yard of the Past;<br/>
And a presence moved before me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that gloomy shore,<br/>
As a waft of wind, that o'er me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed, and was no more.

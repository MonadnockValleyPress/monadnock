<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XIX. The Ghosts</h2>
<p>
Never stoops the soaring vulture<br/>
On his quarry in the desert,<br/>
On the sick or wounded bison,<br/>
But another vulture, watching<br/>
From his high aerial look-out,<br/>
Sees the downward plunge, and follows;<br/>
And a third pursues the second,<br/>
Coming from the invisible ether,<br/>
First a speck, and then a vulture,<br/>
Till the air is dark with pinions.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So disasters come not singly;<br/>
But as if they watched and waited,<br/>
Scanning one another's motions,<br/>
When the first descends, the others<br/>
Follow, follow, gathering flock-wise<br/>
Round their victim, sick and wounded,<br/>
First a shadow, then a sorrow,<br/>
Till the air is dark with anguish.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now, o'er all the dreary North-land,<br/>
Mighty Peboan, the Winter,<br/>
Breathing on the lakes and rivers,<br/>
Into stone had changed their waters.<br/>
From his hair he shook the snow-flakes,<br/>
Till the plains were strewn with whiteness,<br/>
One uninterrupted level,<br/>
As if, stooping, the Creator<br/>
With his hand had smoothed them over.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through the forest, wide and wailing,<br/>
Roamed the hunter on his snow-shoes;<br/>
In the village worked the women,<br/>
Pounded maize, or dressed the deer-skin;<br/>
And the young men played together<br/>
On the ice the noisy ball-play,<br/>
On the plain the dance of snow-shoes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
One dark evening, after sundown,<br/>
In her wigwam Laughing Water<br/>
Sat with old Nokomis, waiting<br/>
For the steps of Hiawatha<br/>
Homeward from the hunt returning.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On their faces gleamed the firelight,<br/>
Painting them with streaks of crimson,<br/>
In the eyes of old Nokomis<br/>
Glimmered like the watery moonlight,<br/>
In the eyes of Laughing Water<br/>
Glistened like the sun in water;<br/>
And behind them crouched their shadows<br/>
In the corners of the wigwam,<br/>
And the smoke in wreaths above them<br/>
Climbed and crowded through the smoke-flue.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the curtain of the doorway<br/>
From without was slowly lifted;<br/>
Brighter glowed the fire a moment,<br/>
And a moment swerved the smoke-wreath,<br/>
As two women entered softly,<br/>
Passed the doorway uninvited,<br/>
Without word of salutation,<br/>
Without sign of recognition,<br/>
Sat down in the farthest corner,<br/>
Crouching low among the shadows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From their aspect and their garments,<br/>
Strangers seemed they in the village;<br/>
Very pale and haggard were they,<br/>
As they sat there sad and silent,<br/>
Trembling, cowering with the shadows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Was it the wind above the smoke-flue,<br/>
Muttering down into the wigwam?<br/>
Was it the owl, the Koko-koho,<br/>
Hooting from the dismal forest?<br/>
Sure a voice said in the silence:<br/>
"These are corpses clad in garments,<br/>
These are ghosts that come to haunt you,<br/>
From the kingdom of Ponemah,<br/>
From the land of the Hereafter!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Homeward now came Hiawatha<br/>
From his hunting in the forest,<br/>
With the snow upon his tresses,<br/>
And the red deer on his shoulders.<br/>
At the feet of Laughing Water<br/>
Down he threw his lifeless burden;<br/>
Nobler, handsomer she thought him,<br/>
Than when first he came to woo her,<br/>
First threw down the deer before her,<br/>
As a token of his wishes,<br/>
As a promise of the future.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he turned and saw the strangers,<br/>
Cowering, crouching with the shadows;<br/>
Said within himself, "Who are they?<br/>
What strange guests has Minnehaha?"<br/>
But he questioned not the strangers,<br/>
Only spake to bid them welcome<br/>
To his lodge, his food, his fireside.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When the evening meal was ready,<br/>
And the deer had been divided,<br/>
Both the pallid guests, the strangers,<br/>
Springing from among the shadows,<br/>
Seized upon the choicest portions,<br/>
Seized the white fat of the roebuck,<br/>
Set apart for Laughing Water,<br/>
For the wife of Hiawatha;<br/>
Without asking, without thanking,<br/>
Eagerly devoured the morsels,<br/>
Flitted back among the shadows<br/>
In the corner of the wigwam.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Not a word spake Hiawatha,<br/>
Not a motion made Nokomis,<br/>
Not a gesture Laughing Water;<br/>
Not a change came o'er their features;<br/>
Only Minnehaha softly<br/>
Whispered, saying, "They are famished;<br/>
Let them do what best delights them;<br/>
Let them eat, for they are famished."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Many a daylight dawned and darkened,<br/>
Many a night shook off the daylight<br/>
As the pine shakes off the snow-flakes<br/>
From the midnight of its branches;<br/>
Day by day the guests unmoving<br/>
Sat there silent in the wigwam;<br/>
But by night, in storm or starlight,<br/>
Forth they went into the forest,<br/>
Bringing fire-wood to the wigwam,<br/>
Bringing pine-cones for the burning,<br/>
Always sad and always silent.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And whenever Hiawatha<br/>
Came from fishing or from hunting,<br/>
When the evening meal was ready,<br/>
And the food had been divided,<br/>
Gliding from their darksome corner,<br/>
Came the pallid guests, the strangers,<br/>
Seized upon the choicest portions<br/>
Set aside for Laughing Water,<br/>
And without rebuke or question<br/>
Flitted back among the shadows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Never once had Hiawatha<br/>
By a word or look reproved them;<br/>
Never once had old Nokomis<br/>
Made a gesture of impatience;<br/>
Never once had Laughing Water<br/>
Shown resentment at the outrage.<br/>
All had they endured in silence,<br/>
That the rights of guest and stranger,<br/>
That the virtue of free-giving,<br/>
By a look might not be lessened,<br/>
By a word might not be broken.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once at midnight Hiawatha,<br/>
Ever wakeful, ever watchful,<br/>
In the wigwam, dimly lighted<br/>
By the brands that still were burning,<br/>
By the glimmering, flickering firelight<br/>
Heard a sighing, oft repeated.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From his couch rose Hiawatha,<br/>
From his shaggy hides of bison,<br/>
Pushed aside the deer-skin curtain,<br/>
Saw the pallid guests, the shadows,<br/>
Sitting upright on their couches,<br/>
Weeping in the silent midnight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he said: "O guests! why is it<br/>
That your hearts are so afflicted,<br/>
That you sob so in the midnight?<br/>
Has perchance the old Nokomis,<br/>
Has my wife, my Minnehaha,<br/>
Wronged or grieved you by unkindness,<br/>
Failed in hospitable duties?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the shadows ceased from weeping,<br/>
Ceased from sobbing and lamenting,<br/>
And they said, with gentle voices:<br/>
"We are ghosts of the departed,<br/>
Souls of those who once were with you.<br/>
From the realms of Chibiabos<br/>
Hither have we come to try you,<br/>
Hither have we come to warn you.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Cries of grief and lamentation<br/>
Reach us in the Blessed Islands;<br/>
Cries of anguish from the living,<br/>
Calling back their friends departed,<br/>
Sadden us with useless sorrow.<br/>
Therefore have we come to try you;<br/>
No one knows us, no one heeds us.<br/>
We are but a burden to you,<br/>
And we see that the departed<br/>
Have no place among the living.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Think of this, O Hiawatha!<br/>
Speak of it to all the people,<br/>
That henceforward and forever<br/>
They no more with lamentations<br/>
Sadden the souls of the departed<br/>
In the Islands of the Blessed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Do not lay such heavy burdens<br/>
In the graves of those you bury,<br/>
Not such weight of furs and wampum,<br/>
Not such weight of pots and kettles,<br/>
For the spirits faint beneath them.<br/>
Only give them food to carry,<br/>
Only give them fire to light them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Four days is the spirit's journey<br/>
To the land of ghosts and shadows,<br/>
Four its lonely night encampments;<br/>
Four times must their fires be lighted.<br/>
Therefore, when the dead are buried,<br/>
Let a fire, as night approaches,<br/>
Four times on the grave be kindled,<br/>
That the soul upon its journey<br/>
May not lack the cheerful firelight,<br/>
May not grope about in darkness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Farewell, noble Hiawatha!<br/>
We have put you to the trial,<br/>
To the proof have put your patience,<br/>
By the insult of our presence,<br/>
By the outrage of our actions.<br/>
We have found you great and noble.<br/>
Fail not in the greater trial,<br/>
Faint not in the harder struggle."<br/>
</p>
<p>
When they ceased, a sudden darkness<br/>
Fell and filled the silent wigwam.<br/>
Hiawatha heard a rustle<br/>
As of garments trailing by him,<br/>
Heard the curtain of the doorway<br/>
Lifted by a hand he saw not,<br/>
Felt the cold breath of the night air,<br/>
For a moment saw the starlight;<br/>
But he saw the ghosts no longer,<br/>
Saw no more the wandering spirits<br/>
From the Kingdom of Ponemah,<br/>
From the Land of the Hereafter.<br/>

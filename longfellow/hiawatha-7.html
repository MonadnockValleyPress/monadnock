<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>VII. Hiawatha's Sailing</h2>
<p>
"Give me of your bark, O Birch-tree!<br/>
Of your yellow bark, O Birch-tree!<br/>
Growing by the rushing river,<br/>
Tall and stately in the valley!<br/>
I a light canoe will build me,<br/>
Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing,<br/>
That shall float upon the river,<br/>
Like a yellow leaf in Autumn,<br/>
Like a yellow water-lily!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lay aside your cloak, O Birch-tree!<br/>
Lay aside your white-skin wrapper,<br/>
For the Summer-time is coming,<br/>
And the sun is warm in heaven,<br/>
And you need no white-skin wrapper!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus aloud cried Hiawatha<br/>
In the solitary forest,<br/>
By the rushing Taquamenaw,<br/>
When the birds were singing gayly,<br/>
In the Moon of Leaves were singing,<br/>
And the sun, from sleep awaking,<br/>
Started up and said, "Behold me!<br/>
Gheezis, the great Sun, behold me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the tree with all its branches<br/>
Rustled in the breeze of morning,<br/>
Saying, with a sigh of patience,<br/>
"Take my cloak, O Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
With his knife the tree he girdled;<br/>
Just beneath its lowest branches,<br/>
Just above the roots, he cut it,<br/>
Till the sap came oozing outward;<br/>
Down the trunk, from top to bottom,<br/>
Sheer he cleft the bark asunder,<br/>
With a wooden wedge he raised it,<br/>
Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Give me of your boughs, O Cedar!<br/>
Of your strong and pliant branches,<br/>
My canoe to make more steady,<br/>
Make more strong and firm beneath me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through the summit of the Cedar<br/>
Went a sound, a cry of horror,<br/>
Went a murmur of resistance;<br/>
But it whispered, bending downward,<br/>
"Take my boughs, O Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Down he hewed the boughs of cedar,<br/>
Shaped them straightway to a frame-work,<br/>
Like two bows he formed and shaped them,<br/>
Like two bended bows together.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Give me of your roots, O Tamarack!<br/>
Of your fibrous roots, O Larch-tree!<br/>
My canoe to bind together,<br/>
So to bind the ends together<br/>
That the water may not enter,<br/>
That the river may not wet me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the Larch, with all its fibres,<br/>
Shivered in the air of morning,<br/>
Touched his forehead with its tassels,<br/>
Slid, with one long sigh of sorrow.<br/>
"Take them all, O Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the earth he tore the fibres,<br/>
Tore the tough roots of the Larch-tree,<br/>
Closely sewed the bark together,<br/>
Bound it closely to the frame-work.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Give me of your balm, O Fir-tree!<br/>
Of your balsam and your resin,<br/>
So to close the seams together<br/>
That the water may not enter,<br/>
That the river may not wet me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the Fir-tree, tall and sombre,<br/>
Sobbed through all its robes of darkness,<br/>
Rattled like a shore with pebbles,<br/>
Answered wailing, answered weeping,<br/>
"Take my balm, O Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he took the tears of balsam,<br/>
Took the resin of the Fir-tree,<br/>
Smeared therewith each seam and fissure,<br/>
Made each crevice safe from water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Give me of your quills, O Hedgehog!<br/>
All your quills, O Kagh, the Hedgehog!<br/>
I will make a necklace of them,<br/>
Make a girdle for my beauty,<br/>
And two stars to deck her bosom!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
From a hollow tree the Hedgehog<br/>
With his sleepy eyes looked at him,<br/>
Shot his shining quills, like arrows,<br/>
Saying with a drowsy murmur,<br/>
Through the tangle of his whiskers,<br/>
"Take my quills, O Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the ground the quills he gathered,<br/>
All the little shining arrows,<br/>
Stained them red and blue and yellow,<br/>
With the juice of roots and berries;<br/>
Into his canoe he wrought them,<br/>
Round its waist a shining girdle,<br/>
Round its bows a gleaming necklace,<br/>
On its breast two stars resplendent.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus the Birch Canoe was builded<br/>
In the valley, by the river,<br/>
In the bosom of the forest;<br/>
And the forest's life was in it,<br/>
All its mystery and its magic,<br/>
All the lightness of the birch-tree,<br/>
All the toughness of the cedar,<br/>
All the larch's supple sinews;<br/>
And it floated on the river<br/>
Like a yellow leaf in Autumn,<br/>
Like a yellow water-lily.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Paddles none had Hiawatha,<br/>
Paddles none he had or needed,<br/>
For his thoughts as paddles served him,<br/>
And his wishes served to guide him;<br/>
Swift or slow at will he glided,<br/>
Veered to right or left at pleasure.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he called aloud to Kwasind,<br/>
To his friend, the strong man, Kwasind,<br/>
Saying, "Help me clear this river<br/>
Of its sunken logs and sand-bars."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Straight into the river Kwasind<br/>
Plunged as if he were an otter,<br/>
Dived as if he were a beaver,<br/>
Stood up to his waist in water,<br/>
To his arm-pits in the river,<br/>
Swam and scouted in the river,<br/>
Tugged at sunken logs and branches,<br/>
With his hands he scooped the sand-bars,<br/>
With his feet the ooze and tangle.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And thus sailed my Hiawatha<br/>
Down the rushing Taquamenaw,<br/>
Sailed through all its bends and windings,<br/>
Sailed through all its deeps and shallows,<br/>
While his friend, the strong man, Kwasind,<br/>
Swam the deeps, the shallows waded.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Up and down the river went they,<br/>
In and out among its islands,<br/>
Cleared its bed of root and sand-bar,<br/>
Dragged the dead trees from its channel,<br/>
Made its passage safe and certain,<br/>
Made a pathway for the people,<br/>
From its springs among the mountains,<br/>
To the waters of Pauwating,<br/>
To the bay of Taquamenaw.<br/>

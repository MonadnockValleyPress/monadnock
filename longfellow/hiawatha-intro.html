<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Should you ask me, whence these stories?<br/>
Whence these legends and traditions,<br/>
With the odors of the forest<br/>
With the dew and damp of meadows,<br/>
With the curling smoke of wigwams,<br/>
With the rushing of great rivers,<br/>
With their frequent repetitions,<br/>
And their wild reverberations<br/>
As of thunder in the mountains?<br/>
</p>
<p>
I should answer, I should tell you,<br/>
"From the forests and the prairies,<br/>
From the great lakes of the Northland,<br/>
From the land of the Ojibways,<br/>
From the land of the Dacotahs,<br/>
From the mountains, moors, and fen-lands<br/>
Where the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,<br/>
Feeds among the reeds and rushes.<br/>
I repeat them as I heard them<br/>
From the lips of Nawadaha,<br/>
The musician, the sweet singer."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Should you ask where Nawadaha<br/>
Found these songs so wild and wayward,<br/>
Found these legends and traditions,<br/>
I should answer, I should tell you,<br/>
"In the bird's-nests of the forest,<br/>
In the lodges of the beaver,<br/>
In the hoofprint of the bison,<br/>
In the eyry of the eagle!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"All the wild-fowl sang them to him,<br/>
In the moorlands and the fen-lands,<br/>
In the melancholy marshes;<br/>
Chetowaik, the plover, sang them,<br/>
Mahng, the loon, the wild-goose, Wawa,<br/>
The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,<br/>
And the grouse, the Mushkodasa!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
If still further you should ask me,<br/>
Saying, "Who was Nawadaha?<br/>
Tell us of this Nawadaha,"<br/>
I should answer your inquiries<br/>
Straightway in such words as follow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"In the vale of Tawasentha,<br/>
In the green and silent valley,<br/>
By the pleasant water-courses,<br/>
Dwelt the singer Nawadaha.<br/>
Round about the Indian village<br/>
Spread the meadows and the corn-fields,<br/>
And beyond them stood the forest,<br/>
Stood the groves of singing pine-trees,<br/>
Green in Summer, white in Winter,<br/>
Ever sighing, ever singing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And the pleasant water-courses,<br/>
You could trace them through the valley,<br/>
By the rushing in the Spring-time,<br/>
By the alders in the Summer,<br/>
By the white fog in the Autumn,<br/>
By the black line in the Winter;<br/>
And beside them dwelt the singer,<br/>
In the vale of Tawasentha,<br/>
In the green and silent valley.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"There he sang of Hiawatha,<br/>
Sang the Song of Hiawatha,<br/>
Sang his wondrous birth and being,<br/>
How he prayed and how be fasted,<br/>
How he lived, and toiled, and suffered,<br/>
That the tribes of men might prosper,<br/>
That he might advance his people!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ye who love the haunts of Nature,<br/>
Love the sunshine of the meadow,<br/>
Love the shadow of the forest,<br/>
Love the wind among the branches,<br/>
And the rain-shower and the snow-storm,<br/>
And the rushing of great rivers<br/>
Through their palisades of pine-trees,<br/>
And the thunder in the mountains,<br/>
Whose innumerable echoes<br/>
Flap like eagles in their eyries;&mdash;<br/>
Listen to these wild traditions,<br/>
To this Song of Hiawatha!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ye who love a nation's legends,<br/>
Love the ballads of a people,<br/>
That like voices from afar off<br/>
Call to us to pause and listen,<br/>
Speak in tones so plain and childlike,<br/>
Scarcely can the ear distinguish<br/>
Whether they are sung or spoken;&mdash;<br/>
Listen to this Indian Legend,<br/>
To this Song of Hiawatha!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple,<br/>
Who have faith in God and Nature,<br/>
Who believe that in all ages<br/>
Every human heart is human,<br/>
That in even savage bosoms<br/>
There are longings, yearnings, strivings<br/>
For the good they comprehend not,<br/>
That the feeble hands and helpless,<br/>
Groping blindly in the darkness,<br/>
Touch God's right hand in that darkness<br/>
And are lifted up and strengthened;&mdash;<br/>
Listen to this simple story,<br/>
To this Song of Hiawatha!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ye, who sometimes, in your rambles<br/>
Through the green lanes of the country,<br/>
Where the tangled barberry-bushes<br/>
Hang their tufts of crimson berries<br/>
Over stone walls gray with mosses,<br/>
Pause by some neglected graveyard,<br/>
For a while to muse, and ponder<br/>
On a half-effaced inscription,<br/>
Written with little skill of song-craft,<br/>
Homely phrases, but each letter<br/>
Full of hope and yet of heart-break,<br/>
Full of all the tender pathos<br/>
Of the Here and the Hereafter;<br/>
Stay and read this rude inscription,<br/>
Read this Song of Hiawatha!<br/>

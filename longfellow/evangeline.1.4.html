<h1>Evangeline</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Part the First</h2>
<h2>Section IV</h2>
<p>
Pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of Grand-Pre.<br/>
Pleasantly gleamed in the soft, sweet air the Basin of Minas,<br/>
Where the ships, with their wavering shadows, were riding at anchor.<br/>
Life had been long astir in the village, and clamorous labor<br/>
Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning.<br/>
Now from the country around, from the farms and neighboring hamlets,<br/>
Came in their holiday dresses the blithe Acadian peasants.<br/>
Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk<br/>
Made the bright air brighter, as up from the numerous meadows,<br/>
Where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,<br/>
Group after group appeared, and joined, or passed on the highway.<br/>
Long ere noon, in the village all sounds of labor were silenced.<br/>
Thronged were the streets with people; and noisy groups at the house-doors<br/>
Sat in the cheerful sun, and rejoiced and gossiped together.<br/>
Every house was an inn, where all were welcomed and feasted;<br/>
For with this simple people, who lived like brothers together,<br/>
All things were held in common, and what one had was another's.<br/>
Yet under Benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant:<br/>
For Evangeline stood among the guests of her father.<br/>
Bright was her face with smiles, and words of welcome and gladness<br/>
Fell from her beautiful lips, and blessed the cup as she gave it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Under the open sky, in the odorous air of the orchard,<br/>
Stript of its golden fruit, was spread the feast of betrothal.<br/>
There in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated;<br/>
There good Benedict sat, and sturdy Basil the blacksmith.<br/>
Not far withdrawn from these, by the cider press and the bee-hives,<br/>
Michael the fiddler was placed, with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats.<br/>
Shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white<br/>
Hair, as it waved in the wind; and the jolly face of the fiddler<br/>
Glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers.<br/>
Gaily the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,<br/>
<em>Tous les Bourgeois de Chartres</em>, and <em>Le Carillon de Dunkerque</em>,<br/>
And anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music.<br/>
Merrily, merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances<br/>
Under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows;<br/>
Old folk and young together, and children mingled among them.<br/>
Fairest of all maids was Evangeline, Benedict's daughter!<br/>
Noblest of all the youths was Gabriel, son of the blacksmith!<br/>
</p>
<p>
So passed the morning away. And lo! with a summons sonorous<br/>
Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drum beat.<br/>
Thronged ere long was the church with men. Without, in the churchyard,<br/>
Waited the women. They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones<br/>
Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.<br/>
Then came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among them<br/>
Entered the sacred portal. With loud and dissonant clangor<br/>
Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,&mdash;<br/>
Echoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous portal<br/>
Closed, and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers.<br/>
Then uprose their commander, and spake from the steps of the altar,<br/>
Holding aloft in his hands, with the seals, the royal commission.<br/>
"You are convened this day," he said, "by his Majesty's orders.<br/>
Clement and kind has he been; but how you have answered his kindness<br/>
Let your own hearts reply! To my natural make and my temper<br/>
Painful the task is I do, which to you I know must be grievous.<br/>
Yet must I bow and obey, and deliver the will of our monarch:<br/>
Namely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and cattle of all kinds<br/>
Forfeited be to the crown; and that you yourselves from this province<br/>
Be transported to other lands. God grant you may dwell there<br/>
Ever as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people!<br/>
Prisoners now I declare you, for such is his Majesty's pleasure!"<br/>
As, when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer,<br/>
Suddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling of the hailstones<br/>
Beats down the farmer's corn in the field, and shatters his windows,<br/>
Hiding the sun, and strewing the ground with thatch from the house-roofs,<br/>
Bellowing fly the herds, and seek to break their enclosures;<br/>
So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker.<br/>
Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then rose<br/>
Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,<br/>
And, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to the door-way.<br/>
Vain was the hope of escape; and cries and fierce imprecations<br/>
Rang through the house of prayer; and high o'er the heads of the others<br/>
Rose, with his arms uplifted, the figure of Basil the blacksmith,<br/>
As, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows.<br/>
Flushed was his face and distorted with passion; and wildly he shouted,&mdash;<br/>
"Down with the tyrants of England! we never have sworn them allegiance!<br/>
Death to these foreign soldiers, who seize on our homes and our harvests!"<br/>
More he fain would have said, but the merciless hand of a soldier<br/>
Smote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,<br/>
Lo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician<br/>
Entered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the altar.<br/>
Raising his reverend hand, with a gesture he awed into silence<br/>
All that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to his people;<br/>
Deep were his tones and solemn; in accents measured and mournful<br/>
Spake he, as, after the tocsin's alarum, distinctly the clock strikes.<br/>
"What is this that ye do, my children? what madness has seized you?<br/>
Forty years of my life have I labored among you, and taught you,<br/>
Not in word alone, but in deed, to love one another!<br/>
Is this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and privations?<br/>
Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness?<br/>
This is the house of the Prince of Peace, and would you profane it<br/>
Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred?<br/>
Lo! where the crucified Christ from His cross is gazing upon you!<br/>
See! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion!<br/>
Hark! how those lips still repeat the prayer, 'O Father, forgive them!'<br/>
Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,<br/>
Let us repeat it now, and say, 'O Father, forgive them!'"<br/>
Few were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his people<br/>
Sank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,<br/>
While they repeated his prayer and said, "O Father, forgive them!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then came the evening service. The tapers gleamed from the altar;<br/>
Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest, and the people responded,<br/>
Not with their lips alone, but their hearts; and the Ave Maria<br/>
Sang they, and fell on their knees, and their souls, with devotion translated,<br/>
Rose on the ardor of prayer, like Elijah ascending to heaven.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill, and on all sides<br/>
Wandered, wailing, from house to house the women and children.<br/>
Long at her father's door Evangeline stood, with her right hand<br/>
Shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun, that, descending,<br/>
Lighted the village street with mysterious splendor, and roofed each<br/>
Peasant's cottage with golden thatch, and emblazoned its windows.<br/>
Long within had been spread the snow-white cloth on the table;<br/>
There stood the wheaten loaf, and the honey fragrant with wild flowers;<br/>
There stood the tankard of ale, and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy;<br/>
And at the head of the board the great arm-chair of the farmer.<br/>
Thus did Evangeline wait at her father's door, as the sunset<br/>
Threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows.<br/>
Ah! on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen,<br/>
And from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended,&mdash;<br/>
Charity, meekness, love, and hope, and forgiveness, and patience!<br/>
Then, all forgetful of self, she wandered into the village,<br/>
Cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women,<br/>
As o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed,<br/>
Urged by their household cares, and the weary feet of their children.<br/>
Down sank the great red sun, and in golden, glimmering vapors<br/>
Veiled the light of his face, like the Prophet descending from Sinai.<br/>
Sweetly over the village the bell of the Angelus sounded.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, amid the gloom, by the church Evangeline lingered.<br/>
All was silent within; and in vain at the door and the windows<br/>
Stood she, and listened and looked, until, overcome by emotion<br/>
"Gabriel!" cried she aloud with tremulous voice; but no answer<br/>
Came from the graves of the dead, nor the gloomier grave of the living.<br/>
Slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father.<br/>
Smouldered the fire on the hearth, on the board was the supper untasted.<br/>
Empty and drear was each room, and haunted with phantoms of terror.<br/>
Sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber.<br/>
In the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall<br/>
Loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore-tree by the window.<br/>
Keenly the lightning flashed; and the voice of the echoing thunder<br/>
Told her that God was in heaven and governed the world He created!<br/>
Then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of Heaven;<br/>
Soothed was her troubled soul, and she peacefully slumbered till morning.<br/>

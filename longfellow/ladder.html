<h1>The Ladder of St. Augustine</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
Saint Augustine! well hast thou said,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That of our vices we can frame<br/>
A ladder, if we will but tread<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath our feet each deed of shame!
</p>
<p>
All common things, each day's events,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That with the hour begin and end,<br/>
Our pleasures and our discontents,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are rounds by which we may ascend.
</p>
<p>
The low desire, the base design,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes another's virtues less;<br/>
The revel of the ruddy wine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all occasions of excess;
</p>
<p>
The longing for ignoble things;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The strife for triumph more than truth;<br/>
The hardening of the heart, that brings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Irreverence for the dreams of youth;
</p>
<p>
All thoughts of ill; all evil deeds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That have their root in thoughts of ill;<br/>
Whatever hinders or impedes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of the nobler will;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
All these must first be trampled down<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath our feet, if we would gain<br/>
In the bright fields of fair renown<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The right of eminent domain.
</p>
<p>
We have not wings, we cannot soar;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have feet to scale and climb<br/>
By slow degrees, by more and more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloudy summits of our time.
</p>
<p>
The mighty pyramids of stone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That wedge-like cleave the desert airs,<br/>
When nearer seen, and better known,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are but gigantic flights of stairs.
</p>
<p>
The distant mountains, that uprear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their solid bastions to the skies,<br/>
Are crossed by pathways, that appear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As we to higher levels rise.
</p>
<p>
The heights by great men reached and kept<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were not attained by sudden flight,<br/>
But they, while their companions slept,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were toiling upward in the night.
</p>
<p>
Standing on what too long we bore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With shoulders bent and downcast eyes,<br/>
We may discern&mdash;unseen before&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A path to higher destinies.
</p>
<p>
Nor deem the irrevocable Past,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As wholly wasted, wholly vain,<br/>
If, rising on its wrecks, at last<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To something nobler we attain.

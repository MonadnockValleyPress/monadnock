<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XIII. Blessing the Cornfields</h2>
<p>
Sing, O Song of Hiawatha,<br/>
Of the happy days that followed,<br/>
In the land of the Ojibways,<br/>
In the pleasant land and peaceful!<br/>
Sing the mysteries of Mondamin,<br/>
Sing the Blessing of the Cornfields!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Buried was the bloody hatchet,<br/>
Buried was the dreadful war-club,<br/>
Buried were all warlike weapons,<br/>
And the war-cry was forgotten.<br/>
There was peace among the nations;<br/>
Unmolested roved the hunters,<br/>
Built the birch canoe for sailing,<br/>
Caught the fish in lake and river,<br/>
Shot the deer and trapped the beaver;<br/>
Unmolested worked the women,<br/>
Made their sugar from the maple,<br/>
Gathered wild rice in the meadows,<br/>
Dressed the skins of deer and beaver.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All around the happy village<br/>
Stood the maize-fields, green and shining,<br/>
Waved the green plumes of Mondamin,<br/>
Waved his soft and sunny tresses,<br/>
Filling all the land with plenty.<br/>
'T was the women who in Spring-time<br/>
Planted the broad fields and fruitful,<br/>
Buried in the earth Mondamin;<br/>
'T was the women who in Autumn<br/>
Stripped the yellow husks of harvest,<br/>
Stripped the garments from Mondamin,<br/>
Even as Hiawatha taught them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once, when all the maize was planted,<br/>
Hiawatha, wise and thoughtful,<br/>
Spake and said to Minnehaha,<br/>
To his wife, the Laughing Water:<br/>
"You shall bless to-night the cornfields,<br/>
Draw a magic circle round them,<br/>
To protect them from destruction,<br/>
Blast of mildew, blight of insect,<br/>
Wagemin, the thief of cornfields,<br/>
Paimosaid, who steals the maize-ear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"In the night, when all is silence,<br/>
In the night, when all is darkness,<br/>
When the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin,<br/>
Shuts the doors of all the wigwams,<br/>
So that not an ear can hear you,<br/>
So that not an eye can see you,<br/>
Rise up from your bed in silence,<br/>
Lay aside your garments wholly,<br/>
Walk around the fields you planted,<br/>
Round the borders of the cornfields,<br/>
Covered by your tresses only,<br/>
Robed with darkness as a garment.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thus the fields shall be more fruitful,<br/>
And the passing of your footsteps<br/>
Draw a magic circle round them,<br/>
So that neither blight nor mildew,<br/>
Neither burrowing worm nor insect,<br/>
Shall pass o'er the magic circle;<br/>
Not the dragon-fly, Kwo-ne-she,<br/>
Nor the spider, Subbekashe,<br/>
Nor the grasshopper, Pah-puk-keena;<br/>
Nor the mighty caterpillar,<br/>
Way-muk-kwana, with the bear-skin,<br/>
King of all the caterpillars!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the tree-tops near the cornfields<br/>
Sat the hungry crows and ravens,<br/>
Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,<br/>
With his band of black marauders.<br/>
And they laughed at Hiawatha,<br/>
Till the tree-tops shook with laughter,<br/>
With their melancholy laughter,<br/>
At the words of Hiawatha.<br/>
"Hear him!" said they; "hear the Wise Man,<br/>
Hear the plots of Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
When the noiseless night descended<br/>
Broad and dark o'er field and forest,<br/>
When the mournful Wawonaissa<br/>
Sorrowing sang among the hemlocks,<br/>
And the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin,<br/>
Shut the doors of all the wigwams,<br/>
From her bed rose Laughing Water,<br/>
Laid aside her garments wholly,<br/>
And with darkness clothed and guarded,<br/>
Unashamed and unaffrighted,<br/>
Walked securely round the cornfields,<br/>
Drew the sacred, magic circle<br/>
Of her footprints round the cornfields.<br/>
</p>
<p>
No one but the Midnight only<br/>
Saw her beauty in the darkness,<br/>
No one but the Wawonaissa<br/>
Heard the panting of her bosom.<br/>
Guskewau, the darkness, wrapped her<br/>
Closely in his sacred mantle,<br/>
So that none might see her beauty,<br/>
So that none might boast, "I saw her!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the morrow, as the day dawned,<br/>
Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,<br/>
Gathered all his black marauders,<br/>
Crows and blackbirds, jays and ravens,<br/>
Clamorous on the dusky tree-tops,<br/>
And descended, fast and fearless,<br/>
On the fields of Hiawatha,<br/>
On the grave of the Mondamin.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"We will drag Mondamin," said they,<br/>
"From the grave where he is buried,<br/>
Spite of all the magic circles<br/>
Laughing Water draws around it,<br/>
Spite of all the sacred footprints<br/>
Minnehaha stamps upon it!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
But the wary Hiawatha,<br/>
Ever thoughtful, careful, watchful,<br/>
Had o'erheard the scornful laughter<br/>
When they mocked him from the tree-tops.<br/>
"Kaw!" he said, "my friends the ravens!<br/>
Kahgahgee, my King of Ravens!<br/>
I will teach you all a lesson<br/>
That shall not be soon forgotten!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He had risen before the daybreak,<br/>
He had spread o'er all the cornfields<br/>
Snares to catch the black marauders,<br/>
And was lying now in ambush<br/>
In the neighboring grove of pine-trees,<br/>
Waiting for the crows and blackbirds,<br/>
Waiting for the jays and ravens.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Soon they came with caw and clamor,<br/>
Rush of wings and cry of voices,<br/>
To their work of devastation,<br/>
Settling down upon the cornfields,<br/>
Delving deep with beak and talon,<br/>
For the body of Mondamin.<br/>
And with all their craft and cunning,<br/>
All their skill in wiles of warfare,<br/>
They perceived no danger near them,<br/>
Till their claws became entangled,<br/>
Till they found themselves imprisoned<br/>
In the snares of Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From his place of ambush came he,<br/>
Striding terrible among them,<br/>
And so awful was his aspect<br/>
That the bravest quailed with terror.<br/>
Without mercy he destroyed them<br/>
Right and left, by tens and twenties,<br/>
And their wretched, lifeless bodies<br/>
Hung aloft on poles for scarecrows<br/>
Round the consecrated cornfields,<br/>
As a signal of his vengeance,<br/>
As a warning to marauders.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Only Kahgahgee, the leader,<br/>
Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,<br/>
He alone was spared among them<br/>
As a hostage for his people.<br/>
With his prisoner-string he bound him,<br/>
Led him captive to his wigwam,<br/>
Tied him fast with cords of elm-bark<br/>
To the ridge-pole of his wigwam.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Kahgahgee, my raven!" said he,<br/>
"You the leader of the robbers,<br/>
You the plotter of this mischief,<br/>
The contriver of this outrage,<br/>
I will keep you, I will hold you,<br/>
As a hostage for your people,<br/>
As a pledge of good behavior!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he left him, grim and sulky,<br/>
Sitting in the morning sunshine<br/>
On the summit of the wigwam,<br/>
Croaking fiercely his displeasure,<br/>
Flapping his great sable pinions,<br/>
Vainly struggling for his freedom,<br/>
Vainly calling on his people!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Summer passed, and Shawondasee<br/>
Breathed his sighs o'er all the landscape,<br/>
From the South-land sent his ardor,<br/>
Wafted kisses warm and tender;<br/>
And the maize-field grew and ripened,<br/>
Till it stood in all the splendor<br/>
Of its garments green and yellow,<br/>
Of its tassels and its plumage,<br/>
And the maize-ears full and shining<br/>
Gleamed from bursting sheaths of verdure.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Nokomis, the old woman,<br/>
Spake, and said to Minnehaha:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"'T is the Moon when leaves are falling;<br/>
All the wild rice has been gathered,<br/>
And the maize is ripe and ready;<br/>
Let us gather in the harvest,<br/>
Let us wrestle with Mondamin,<br/>
Strip him of his plumes and tassels,<br/>
Of his garments green and yellow!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the merry Laughing Water<br/>
Went rejoicing from the wigwam,<br/>
With Nokomis, old and wrinkled,<br/>
And they called the women round them,<br/>
Called the young men and the maidens,<br/>
To the harvest of the cornfields,<br/>
To the husking of the maize-ear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the border of the forest,<br/>
Underneath the fragrant pine-trees,<br/>
Sat the old men and the warriors<br/>
Smoking in the pleasant shadow.<br/>
In uninterrupted silence<br/>
Looked they at the gamesome labor<br/>
Of the young men and the women;<br/>
Listened to their noisy talking,<br/>
To their laughter and their singing,<br/>
Heard them chattering like the magpies,<br/>
Heard them laughing like the blue-jays,<br/>
Heard them singing like the robins.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And whene'er some lucky maiden<br/>
Found a red ear in the husking,<br/>
Found a maize-ear red as blood is,<br/>
"Nushka!" cried they all together,<br/>
"Nushka! you shall have a sweetheart,<br/>
You shall have a handsome husband!"<br/>
"Ugh!" the old men all responded<br/>
From their seats beneath the pine-trees.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And whene'er a youth or maiden<br/>
Found a crooked ear in husking,<br/>
Found a maize-ear in the husking<br/>
Blighted, mildewed, or misshapen,<br/>
Then they laughed and sang together,<br/>
Crept and limped about the cornfields,<br/>
Mimicked in their gait and gestures<br/>
Some old man, bent almost double,<br/>
Singing singly or together:<br/>
"Wagemin, the thief of cornfields!<br/>
Paimosaid, who steals the maize-ear!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Till the cornfields rang with laughter,<br/>
Till from Hiawatha's wigwam<br/>
Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,<br/>
Screamed and quivered in his anger,<br/>
And from all the neighboring tree-tops<br/>
Cawed and croaked the black marauders.<br/>
"Ugh!" the old men all responded,<br/>
From their seats beneath the pine-trees!<br/>

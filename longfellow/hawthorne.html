<h1>Hawthorne</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h3>May 23, 1864</h3>
<p>
How beautiful it was, that one bright day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long week of rain!<br/>
Though all its splendor could not chase away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The omnipresent pain.
</p>
<p>
The lovely town was white with apple-blooms,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great elms o'erhead<br/>
Dark shadows wove on their aerial looms<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot through with golden thread.
</p>
<p>
Across the meadows, by the gray old manse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The historic river flowed:<br/>
I was as one who wanders in a trance,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconscious of his road.
</p>
<p>
The faces of familiar friends seemed strange;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their voices I could hear,<br/>
And yet the words they uttered seemed to change<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their meaning to my ear.
</p>
<p>
For the one face I looked for was not there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The one low voice was mute;<br/>
Only an unseen presence filled the air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And baffled my pursuit.
</p>
<p>
Now I look back, and meadow, manse, and stream<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dimly my thought defines;<br/>
I only see&mdash;a dream within a dream&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hill-top hearsed with pines.
</p>
<p>
I only hear above his place of rest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their tender undertone,<br/>
The infinite longings of a troubled breast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice so like his own.
</p>
<p>
There in seclusion and remote from men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard hand lies cold,<br/>
Which at its topmost speed let fall the pen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And left the tale half told.
</p>
<p>
Ah! who shall lift that wand of magic power,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lost clew regain?<br/>
The unfinished window in Aladdin's tower<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfinished must remain!

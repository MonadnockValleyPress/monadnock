<h1>Evangeline</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Part the First</h2>
<h2>Section II</h2>
<p>
Now had the season returned, when the nights grow colder and longer,<br/>
And the retreating sun the sign of the Scorpion enters.<br/>
Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air, from the ice-bound,<br/>
Desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands.<br/>
Harvests were gathered in; and wild with the winds of September<br/>
Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of old with the angel.<br/>
All the signs foretold a winter long and inclement.<br/>
Bees, with prophetic instinct of want, had hoarded their honey<br/>
Till the hives overflowed; and the Indian hunters asserted<br/>
Cold would the winter be, for thick was the fur of the foxes.<br/>
Such was the advent of autumn. Then followed that beautiful season,<br/>
Called by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer of All-Saints!<br/>
Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the landscape<br/>
Lay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood.<br/>
Peace seemed to reign upon earth, and the restless heart of the ocean<br/>
Was for a moment consoled. All sounds were in harmony blended.<br/>
Voices of children at play, the crowing of cocks in the farm-yards,<br/>
Whir of wings in the drowsy air, and the cooing of pigeons<br/>
All were subdued and low as the murmurs of love, and the great sun<br/>
Looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him;<br/>
While arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,<br/>
Bright with the sheen of the dew, each glittering tree of the forest<br/>
Flashed like the plane-tree the Persian adorned with mantles and jewels.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness.<br/>
Day with its burden and heat had departed, and twilight descending<br/>
Brought back the evening star to the sky, and the herds to the homestead.<br/>
Pawing the ground they came, and resting their necks on each other,<br/>
And with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening.<br/>
Foremost, bearing the bell, Evangeline's beautiful heifer,<br/>
Proud of her snow-white hide, and the ribbon that waved from her collar,<br/>
Quietly paced and slow, as if conscious of human affection.<br/>
Then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside,<br/>
Where was their favorite pasture. Behind them followed the watch-dog,<br/>
Patient, full of importance, and grand in the pride of his instinct,<br/>
Walking from side to side with a lordly air, and superbly<br/>
Waving his bushy tail, and urging forward the stragglers;<br/>
Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept; their protector,<br/>
When from the forest at night, through the starry silence, the wolves howled.<br/>
Late, with the rising moon, returned the wains from the marshes,<br/>
Laden with briny hay, that filled the air with its odor.<br/>
Cheerily neighed the steeds, with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,<br/>
While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,<br/>
Painted with brilliant dyes, and adorned with tassels of crimson,<br/>
Nodded in bright array, like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms.<br/>
Patiently stood the cows meanwhile, and yielded their udders<br/>
Unto the milkmaid's hand; whilst loud and in regular cadence<br/>
Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended.<br/>
Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm-yard,<br/>
Echoed back by the barns. Anon they sank into stillness;<br/>
Heavily closed, with a jarring sound, the valves of the barn-doors,<br/>
Rattled the wooden bars, and all for a season was silent.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In-doors, warm by the wide-mouthed fireplace, idly the farmer<br/>
Sat in his elbow-chair, and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths<br/>
Struggled together like foes in a burning city. Behind him,<br/>
Nodding and mocking along the wall with gestures fantastic,<br/>
Darted his own huge shadow, and vanished away into darkness.<br/>
Faces, clumsily carved in oak, on the back of his arm-chair,<br/>
Laughed in the flickering light, and the pewter plates on the dresser<br/>
Caught and reflected the flame, as shields of armies the sunshine.<br/>
Fragments of song the old man sang, and carols of Christmas,<br/>
Such as at home, in the olden time, his fathers before him<br/>
Sang in their Norman orchards and bright Burgundian vineyards.<br/>
Close at her father's side was the gentle Evangeline seated,<br/>
Spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her.<br/>
Silent awhile were its treadles, at rest was its diligent shuttle,<br/>
While the monotonous drone of the wheel, like the drone of a bagpipe,<br/>
Followed the old man's song, and united the fragments together.<br/>
As in a church, when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,<br/>
Footfalls are heard in the aisles, or words of priest at the altar,<br/>
So, in each pause of the song, with measured motion the clock clicked.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus as they sat, there were footsteps heard, and, suddenly lifted,<br/>
Sounded the wooden latch, and the door swung back on its hinges.<br/>
Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was Basil the blacksmith,<br/>
And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who was with him.<br/>
"Welcome!" the farmer exclaimed, as their footsteps paused on the threshold,<br/>
"Welcome, Basil, my friend! Come, take thy place on the settle<br/>
Close by the chimney-side, which is always empty without thee;<br/>
Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco;<br/>
Never so much thyself art thou as when, through the curling<br/>
Smoke of the pipe or the forge, thy friendly and jovial face gleams<br/>
Round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes."<br/>
Then, with a smile of content, thus answered Basil the blacksmith,<br/>
Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside:&mdash;<br/>
"Benedict Bellefontaine, thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad!<br/>
Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou, when others are filled with<br/>
Gloomy forebodings of ill, and see only ruin before them.<br/>
Happy art thou, as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe."<br/>
Pausing a moment, to take the pipe that Evangeline brought him,<br/>
And with a coal from the embers had lighted, he slowly continued:&mdash;<br/>
"Four days now are passed since the English ships at their anchors<br/>
Ride in the Gaspereau's mouth, with their cannon pointed against us.<br/>
What their design may be is unknown; but all are commanded<br/>
On the morrow to meet in the church, where his Majesty's mandate<br/>
Will be proclaimed as law in the land. Alas! in the mean time<br/>
Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people."<br/>
Then made answer the farmer:&mdash;"Perhaps some friendlier purpose<br/>
Brings these ships to our shores. Perhaps the harvests in England<br/>
By untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,<br/>
And from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children."<br/>
"Not so thinketh the folk in the village," said warmly the blacksmith,<br/>
Shaking his head as in doubt; then, heaving a sigh, he continued:&mdash;<br/>
"Louisburg is not forgotten, nor Beau Sejour, nor Port Royal.<br/>
Many already have fled to the forest, and lurk on its outskirts,<br/>
Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to-morrow.<br/>
Arms have been taken from us, and warlike weapons of all kinds;<br/>
Nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower."<br/>
Then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer:&mdash;<br/>
"Safer are we unarmed, in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,<br/>
Safer within these peaceful dikes besieged by the ocean,<br/>
Than our fathers in forts, besieged by the enemy's cannon.<br/>
Fear no evil, my friend, and to-night may no shadow of sorrow<br/>
Fall on this house and hearth; for this is the night of the contract.<br/>
Built are the house and the barn. The merry lads of the village<br/>
Strongly have built them and well; and, breaking the glebe round about them,<br/>
Filled the barn with hay, and the house with food for a twelvemonth.<br/>
Rene Leblanc will be here anon, with his papers and inkhorn.<br/>
Shall we not then be glad, and rejoice in the joy of our children?"<br/>
As apart by the window she stood, with her hand in her lover's,<br/>
Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,<br/>
And, as they died on his lips, the worthy notary entered.<br/>

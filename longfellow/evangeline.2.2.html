<h1>Evangeline</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Part the Second</h2>
<h2>Section II</h2>
<p>
It was the month of May. Far down the Beautiful River,<br/>
Past the Ohio shore and past the mouth of the Wabash,<br/>
Into the golden stream of the broad and swift Mississippi,<br/>
Floated a cumbrous boat, that was rowed by Acadian boatmen.<br/>
It was a band of exiles: a raft, as it were, from the shipwrecked<br/>
Nation, scattered along the coast, now floating together,<br/>
Bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune;<br/>
Men and women and children, who, guided by hope or by hearsay,<br/>
Sought for their kith and their kin among the few-acred farmers<br/>
On the Acadian coast, and the prairies of fair Opelousas.<br/>
With them Evangeline went, and her guide, the Father Felician.<br/>
Onward o'er sunken sands, through a wilderness sombre with forests,<br/>
Day after day they glided adown the turbulent river;<br/>
Night after night, by their blazing fires, encamped on its borders.<br/>
Now through rushing chutes, among green islands, where plumelike<br/>
Cotton-trees nodded their shadowy crests, they swept with the current,<br/>
Then emerged into broad lagoons, where silvery sand-bars<br/>
Lay in the stream, and along the wimpling waves of their margin,<br/>
Shining with snow-white plumes, large flocks of pelicans waded.<br/>
Level the landscape grew, and along the shores of the river,<br/>
Shaded by china-trees, in the midst of luxuriant gardens,<br/>
Stood the houses of planters, with negro cabins and dove-cots.<br/>
They were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,<br/>
Where through the Golden Coast, and groves of orange and citron,<br/>
Sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward.<br/>
They, too, swerved from their course; and, entering the Bayou of Plaquemine,<br/>
Soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,<br/>
Which, like a network of steel, extended in every direction.<br/>
Over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress<br/>
Met in a dusky arch, and trailing mosses in mid-air<br/>
Waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals.<br/>
Deathlike the silence seemed, and unbroken, save by the herons<br/>
Home to their roosts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset,<br/>
Or by the owl, as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter.<br/>
Lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,<br/>
Gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,<br/>
Down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin.<br/>
Dreamlike, and indistinct, and strange were all things around them;<br/>
And o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,&mdash;<br/>
Strange forebodings of ill, unseen and that cannot be compassed.<br/>
As, at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies,<br/>
Far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,<br/>
So, at the hoof-beats of fate, with sad forebodings of evil,<br/>
Shrinks and closes the heart, ere the stroke of doom has attained it.<br/>
But Evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision, that faintly<br/>
Floated before her eyes, and beckoned her on through the moonlight.<br/>
It was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom.<br/>
Through those shadowy aisles had Gabriel wandered before her,<br/>
And every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, in his place, at the prow of the boat, rose one of the oarsmen,<br/>
And, as a signal sound, if others like them peradventure<br/>
Sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams, blew a blast on his bugle.<br/>
Wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang,<br/>
Breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest.<br/>
Soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music.<br/>
Multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance,<br/>
Over the watery floor, and beneath the reverberant branches;<br/>
But not a voice replied; no answer came from the darkness;<br/>
And when the echoes had ceased, like a sense of pain was the silence.<br/>
Then Evangeline slept; but the boatmen rowed through the midnight,<br/>
Silent at times, then singing familiar Canadian boat-songs,<br/>
Such as they sang of old on their own Acadian rivers.<br/>
While through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert,<br/>
Far off,&mdash;indistinct,&mdash;as of wave or wind in the forest,<br/>
Mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades; and before them<br/>
Lay, in the golden sun, the lakes of the Atchafalaya.<br/>
Water-lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations<br/>
Made by the passing oars, and, resplendent in beauty, the lotus<br/>
Lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen.<br/>
Faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms,<br/>
And with the heat of noon; and numberless sylvan islands,<br/>
Fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses,<br/>
Near to whose shores they glided along, invited to slumber.<br/>
Soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended.<br/>
Under the boughs of Wachita willows, that grew by the margin,<br/>
Safely their boat was moored; and scattered about on the greensward,<br/>
Tired with their midnight toil, the weary travellers slumbered.<br/>
Over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar.<br/>
Swinging from its great arms, the trumpet-flower and the grapevine<br/>
Hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of Jacob,<br/>
On whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending, descending,<br/>
Were the swift humming-birds, that flitted from blossom to blossom.<br/>
Such was the vision Evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it.<br/>
Filled was her heart with love, and the dawn of an opening heaven<br/>
Lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nearer, ever nearer, among the numberless islands,<br/>
Darted a light, swift boat, that sped away o'er the water,<br/>
Urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers.<br/>
Northward its prow was turned, to the land of the bison and beaver.<br/>
At the helm sat a youth, with countenance thoughtful and careworn.<br/>
Dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow, and a sadness<br/>
Somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written.<br/>
Gabriel was it, who, weary with waiting, unhappy and restless,<br/>
Sought in the Western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow.<br/>
Swiftly they glided along, close under the lee of the island,<br/>
But by the opposite bank, and behind a screen of palmettos;<br/>
So that they saw not the boat, where it lay concealed in the willows;<br/>
All undisturbed by the dash of their oars, and unseen, were the sleepers;<br/>
Angel of God was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden.<br/>
Swiftly they glided away, like the shade of a cloud on the prairie.<br/>
After the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,<br/>
As from a magic trance the sleepers awoke, and the maiden<br/>
Said with a sigh to the friendly priest, "O Father Felician!<br/>
Something says in my heart that near me Gabriel wanders.<br/>
Is it a foolish dream, an idle and vague superstition?<br/>
Or has an angel passed, and revealed the truth to my spirit?"<br/>
Then, with a blush, she added, "Alas for my credulous fancy!<br/>
Unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning."<br/>
But made answer the reverend man, and he smiled as he answered,&mdash;<br/>
"Daughter, thy words are not idle; nor are they to me without meaning,<br/>
Feeling is deep and still; and the word that floats on the surface<br/>
Is as the tossing buoy, that betrays where the anchor is hidden.<br/>
Therefore trust to thy heart, and to what the world calls illusions.<br/>
Gabriel truly is near thee; for not far away to the southward,<br/>
On the banks of the Teche, are the towns of St. Maur and St. Martin.<br/>
There the long-wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom,<br/>
There the long-absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold.<br/>
Beautiful is the land, with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees;<br/>
Under the feet a garden of flowers, and the bluest of heavens<br/>
Bending above, and resting its dome on the walls of the forest.<br/>
They who dwell there have named it the Eden of Louisiana."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey.<br/>
Softly the evening came. The sun from the western horizon<br/>
Like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape;<br/>
Twinkling vapors arose; and sky and water and forest<br/>
Seemed all on fire at the touch, and melted and mingled together.<br/>
Hanging between two skies, a cloud with edges of silver,<br/>
Floated the boat, with its dripping oars, on the motionless water.<br/>
Filled was Evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness.<br/>
Touched by the magic spell, the sacred fountains of feeling<br/>
Glowed with the light of love, as the skies and waters around her.<br/>
Then from a neighboring thicket the mocking-bird, wildest of singers,<br/>
Swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water,<br/>
Shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music<br/>
That the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen.<br/>
Plaintive at first were the tones, and sad; then soaring to madness<br/>
Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied Bacchantes.<br/>
Single notes were then heard, in sorrowful, low, lamentation;<br/>
Till, having gathered them all, he flung them abroad in derision,<br/>
As when, after a storm, a gust of wind through the tree-tops<br/>
Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches.<br/>
With such a prelude as this, and hearts that throbbed with emotion,<br/>
Slowly they entered the Teche, where it flows through the green Opelousas,<br/>
And, through the amber air, above the crest of the woodland,<br/>
Saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling;&mdash;<br/>
Sounds of a horn they heard, and the distant lowing of cattle.<br/>

<h1>A Psalm of Life</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h3>What the Heart of the Young Man Said to the Psalmist</h3>
<p>
Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is but an empty dream!
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;And things are not what they seem.
</p>
<p>
Life is real! Life is earnest!
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grave is not its goal;
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not spoken of the soul.
</p>
<p>
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is our destined end or way;
But to act, that each to-morrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;Find us farther than to-day.
</p>
<p>
Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;And our hearts, though stout and brave,
Still, like muffled drums, are beating
&nbsp;&nbsp;Funeral marches to the grave.
</p>
<p>
In the world’s broad field of battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bivouac of Life,
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a hero in the strife!
</p>
<p>
Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the dead Past bury its dead!
Act,&mdash;act in the living Present!
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart within, and God o’erhead!
</p>
<p>
Lives of great men all remind us
&nbsp;&nbsp;We can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
&nbsp;&nbsp;Footprints on the sands of time;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Footprints, that perhaps another,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing, shall take heart again.
</p>
<p>
Let us, then, be up and doing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a heart for any fate;
Still achieving, still pursuing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn to labor and to wait.
</p>

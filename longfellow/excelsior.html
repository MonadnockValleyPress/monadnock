<h1>Excelsior</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
The shades of night were falling fast,<br/>
As through an Alpine village passed<br/>
A youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice,<br/>
A banner with the strange device,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excelsior!
</p>
<p>
His brow was sad; his eye beneath,<br/>
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath,<br/>
And like a silver clarion rung<br/>
The accents of that unknown tongue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excelsior!
</p>
<p>
In happy homes he saw the light<br/>
Of household fires gleam warm and bright;<br/>
Above, the spectral glaciers shone,<br/>
And from his lips escaped a groan,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excelsior!
</p>
<p>
"Try not the Pass!" the old man said:<br/>
"Dark lowers the tempest overhead,<br/>
The roaring torrent is deep and wide!"<br/>
And loud that clarion voice replied,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excelsior!
</p>
<p>
"Oh stay," the maiden said, "and rest<br/>
Thy weary head upon this breast!"<br/>
A tear stood in his bright blue eye,<br/>
But still he answered, with a sigh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excelsior!
</p>
<p>
"Beware the pine-tree's withered branch!<br/>
Beware the awful avalanche!"<br/>
This was the peasant's last Good-night,<br/>
A voice replied, far up the height,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excelsior!
</p>
<p>
At break of day, as heavenward<br/>
The pious monks of Saint Bernard<br/>
Uttered the oft-repeated prayer,<br/>
A voice cried through the startled air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excelsior!
</p>
<p>
A traveller, by the faithful hound,<br/>
Half-buried in the snow was found,<br/>
Still grasping in his hand of ice<br/>
That banner with the strange device,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excelsior!
</p>
<p>
There in the twilight cold and gray,<br/>
Lifeless, but beautiful, he lay,<br/>
And from the sky, serene and far,<br/>
A voice fell, like a falling star,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excelsior!

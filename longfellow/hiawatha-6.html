<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>VI. Hiawatha's Friends</h2>
<p>
Two good friends had Hiawatha,<br/>
Singled out from all the others,<br/>
Bound to him in closest union,<br/>
And to whom he gave the right hand<br/>
Of his heart, in joy and sorrow;<br/>
Chibiabos, the musician,<br/>
And the very strong man, Kwasind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Straight between them ran the pathway,<br/>
Never grew the grass upon it;<br/>
Singing birds, that utter falsehoods,<br/>
Story-tellers, mischief-makers,<br/>
Found no eager ear to listen,<br/>
Could not breed ill-will between them,<br/>
For they kept each other's counsel,<br/>
Spake with naked hearts together,<br/>
Pondering much and much contriving<br/>
How the tribes of men might prosper.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Most beloved by Hiawatha<br/>
Was the gentle Chibiabos,<br/>
He the best of all musicians,<br/>
He the sweetest of all singers.<br/>
Beautiful and childlike was he,<br/>
Brave as man is, soft as woman,<br/>
Pliant as a wand of willow,<br/>
Stately as a deer with antlers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When he sang, the village listened;<br/>
All the warriors gathered round him,<br/>
All the women came to hear him;<br/>
Now he stirred their souls to passion,<br/>
Now he melted them to pity.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the hollow reeds he fashioned<br/>
Flutes so musical and mellow,<br/>
That the brook, the Sebowisha,<br/>
Ceased to murmur in the woodland,<br/>
That the wood-birds ceased from singing,<br/>
And the squirrel, Adjidaumo,<br/>
Ceased his chatter in the oak-tree,<br/>
And the rabbit, the Wabasso,<br/>
Sat upright to look and listen.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yes, the brook, the Sebowisha,<br/>
Pausing, said, "O Chibiabos,<br/>
Teach my waves to flow in music,<br/>
Softly as your words in singing!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yes, the bluebird, the Owaissa,<br/>
Envious, said, "O Chibiabos,<br/>
Teach me tones as wild and wayward,<br/>
Teach me songs as full of frenzy!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yes, the robin, the Opechee,<br/>
Joyous, said, "O Chibiabos,<br/>
Teach me tones as sweet and tender,<br/>
Teach me songs as full of gladness!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the whippoorwill, Wawonaissa,<br/>
Sobbing, said, "O Chibiabos,<br/>
Teach me tones as melancholy,<br/>
Teach me songs as full of sadness!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
All the many sounds of nature<br/>
Borrowed sweetness from his singing;<br/>
All the hearts of men were softened<br/>
By the pathos of his music;<br/>
For he sang of peace and freedom,<br/>
Sang of beauty, love, and longing;<br/>
Sang of death, and life undying<br/>
In the Islands of the Blessed,<br/>
In the kingdom of Ponemah,<br/>
In the land of the Hereafter.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Very dear to Hiawatha<br/>
Was the gentle Chibiabos,<br/>
He the best of all musicians,<br/>
He the sweetest of all singers;<br/>
For his gentleness he loved him,<br/>
And the magic of his singing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Dear, too, unto Hiawatha<br/>
Was the very strong man, Kwasind,<br/>
He the strongest of all mortals,<br/>
He the mightiest among many;<br/>
For his very strength he loved him,<br/>
For his strength allied to goodness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Idle in his youth was Kwasind,<br/>
Very listless, dull, and dreamy,<br/>
Never played with other children,<br/>
Never fished and never hunted,<br/>
Not like other children was he;<br/>
But they saw that much he fasted,<br/>
Much his Manito entreated,<br/>
Much besought his Guardian Spirit.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lazy Kwasind!" said his mother,<br/>
"In my work you never help me!<br/>
In the Summer you are roaming<br/>
Idly in the fields and forests;<br/>
In the Winter you are cowering<br/>
O'er the firebrands in the wigwam!<br/>
In the coldest days of Winter<br/>
I must break the ice for fishing;<br/>
With my nets you never help me!<br/>
At the door my nets are hanging,<br/>
Dripping, freezing with the water;<br/>
Go and wring them, Yenadizze!<br/>
Go and dry them in the sunshine!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Slowly, from the ashes, Kwasind<br/>
Rose, but made no angry answer;<br/>
From the lodge went forth in silence,<br/>
Took the nets, that hung together,<br/>
Dripping, freezing at the doorway;<br/>
Like a wisp of straw he wrung them,<br/>
Like a wisp of straw he broke them,<br/>
Could not wring them without breaking,<br/>
Such the strength was in his fingers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lazy Kwasind!" said his father,<br/>
"In the hunt you never help me;<br/>
Every bow you touch is broken,<br/>
Snapped asunder every arrow;<br/>
Yet come with me to the forest,<br/>
You shall bring the hunting homeward."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Down a narrow pass they wandered,<br/>
Where a brooklet led them onward,<br/>
Where the trail of deer and bison<br/>
Marked the soft mud on the margin,<br/>
Till they found all further passage<br/>
Shut against them, barred securely<br/>
By the trunks of trees uprooted,<br/>
Lying lengthwise, lying crosswise,<br/>
And forbidding further passage.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"We must go back," said the old man,<br/>
"O'er these logs we cannot clamber;<br/>
Not a woodchuck could get through them,<br/>
Not a squirrel clamber o'er them!"<br/>
And straightway his pipe he lighted,<br/>
And sat down to smoke and ponder.<br/>
But before his pipe was finished,<br/>
Lo! the path was cleared before him;<br/>
All the trunks had Kwasind lifted,<br/>
To the right hand, to the left hand,<br/>
Shot the pine-trees swift as arrows,<br/>
Hurled the cedars light as lances.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lazy Kwasind!" said the young men,<br/>
As they sported in the meadow:<br/>
"Why stand idly looking at us,<br/>
Leaning on the rock behind you?<br/>
Come and wrestle with the others,<br/>
Let us pitch the quoit together!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Lazy Kwasind made no answer,<br/>
To their challenge made no answer,<br/>
Only rose, and slowly turning,<br/>
Seized the huge rock in his fingers,<br/>
Tore it from its deep foundation,<br/>
Poised it in the air a moment,<br/>
Pitched it sheer into the river,<br/>
Sheer into the swift Pauwating,<br/>
Where it still is seen in Summer.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once as down that foaming river,<br/>
Down the rapids of Pauwating,<br/>
Kwasind sailed with his companions,<br/>
In the stream he saw a beaver,<br/>
Saw Ahmeek, the King of Beavers,<br/>
Struggling with the rushing currents,<br/>
Rising, sinking in the water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Without speaking, without pausing,<br/>
Kwasind leaped into the river,<br/>
Plunged beneath the bubbling surface,<br/>
Through the whirlpools chased the beaver,<br/>
Followed him among the islands,<br/>
Stayed so long beneath the water,<br/>
That his terrified companions<br/>
Cried, "Alas! good-by to Kwasind!<br/>
We shall never more see Kwasind!"<br/>
But he reappeared triumphant,<br/>
And upon his shining shoulders<br/>
Brought the beaver, dead and dripping,<br/>
Brought the King of all the Beavers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And these two, as I have told you,<br/>
Were the friends of Hiawatha,<br/>
Chibiabos, the musician,<br/>
And the very strong man, Kwasind.<br/>
Long they lived in peace together,<br/>
Spake with naked hearts together,<br/>
Pondering much and much contriving<br/>
How the tribes of men might prosper.<br/>

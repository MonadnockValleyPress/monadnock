<h1>The Revenge of Rain-in-the-Face</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
In that desolate land and lone,<br/>
Where the Big Horn and Yellowstone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Roar down their mountain path,<br/>
By their fires the Sioux Chiefs<br/>
Muttered their woes and griefs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the menace of their wrath.
</p>
<p>
"Revenge!" cried Rain-in-the-Face,<br/>
"Revenue upon all the race<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the White Chief with yellow hair!"<br/>
And the mountains dark and high<br/>
From their crags re-echoed the cry<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his anger and despair.
</p>
<p>
In the meadow, spreading wide<br/>
By woodland and riverside<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian village stood;<br/>
All was silent as a dream,<br/>
Save the rushing of the stream<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the blue-jay in the wood.
</p>
<p>
In his war paint and his beads,<br/>
Like a bison among the reeds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In ambush the Sitting Bull<br/>
Lay with three thousand braves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouched in the clefts and caves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Savage, unmerciful!
</p>
<p>
Into the fatal snare<br/>
The White Chief with yellow hair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his three hundred men<br/>
Dashed headlong, sword in hand;<br/>
But of that gallant band<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one returned again.
</p>
<p>
The sudden darkness of death<br/>
Overwhelmed them like the breath<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And smoke of a furnace fire:<br/>
By the river's bank, and between<br/>
The rocks of the ravine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They lay in their bloody attire.
</p>
<p>
But the foemen fled in the night,<br/>
And Rain-in-the-Face, in his flight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplifted high in air<br/>
As a ghastly trophy, bore<br/>
The brave heart, that beat no more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the White Chief with yellow hair.
</p>
<p>
Whose was the right and the wrong?<br/>
Sing it, O funeral song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a voice that is full of tears,<br/>
And say that our broken faith<br/>
Wrought all this ruin and scathe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Year of a Hundred Years.

<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XVII. The Hunting of Pau-Puk-Keewis</h2>
<p>
Full of wrath was Hiawatha<br/>
When he came into the village,<br/>
Found the people in confusion,<br/>
Heard of all the misdemeanors,<br/>
All the malice and the mischief,<br/>
Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hard his breath came through his nostrils,<br/>
Through his teeth he buzzed and muttered<br/>
Words of anger and resentment,<br/>
Hot and humming, like a hornet.<br/>
"I will slay this Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Slay this mischief-maker!" said he.<br/>
"Not so long and wide the world is,<br/>
Not so rude and rough the way is,<br/>
That my wrath shall not attain him,<br/>
That my vengeance shall not reach him!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then in swift pursuit departed<br/>
Hiawatha and the hunters<br/>
On the trail of Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Through the forest, where he passed it,<br/>
To the headlands where he rested;<br/>
But they found not Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Only in the trampled grasses,<br/>
In the whortleberry-bushes,<br/>
Found the couch where he had rested,<br/>
Found the impress of his body.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the lowlands far beneath them,<br/>
From the Muskoday, the meadow,<br/>
Pau-Puk-Keewis, turning backward,<br/>
Made a gesture of defiance,<br/>
Made a gesture of derision;<br/>
And aloud cried Hiawatha,<br/>
From the summit of the mountains:<br/>
"Not so long and wide the world is,<br/>
Not so rude and rough the way is,<br/>
But my wrath shall overtake you,<br/>
And my vengeance shall attain you!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Over rock and over river,<br/>
Through bush, and brake, and forest,<br/>
Ran the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis;<br/>
Like an antelope he bounded,<br/>
Till he came unto a streamlet<br/>
In the middle of the forest,<br/>
To a streamlet still and tranquil,<br/>
That had overflowed its margin,<br/>
To a dam made by the beavers,<br/>
To a pond of quiet water,<br/>
Where knee-deep the trees were standing,<br/>
Where the water lilies floated,<br/>
Where the rushes waved and whispered.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
On the dam of trunks and branches,<br/>
Through whose chinks the water spouted,<br/>
O'er whose summit flowed the streamlet.<br/>
From the bottom rose the beaver,<br/>
Looked with two great eyes of wonder,<br/>
Eyes that seemed to ask a question,<br/>
At the stranger, Pau-Puk-Keewis.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet,<br/>
Flowed the bright and silvery water,<br/>
And he spake unto the beaver,<br/>
With a smile he spake in this wise:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O my friend Ahmeek, the beaver,<br/>
Cool and pleasant is the water;<br/>
Let me dive into the water,<br/>
Let me rest there in your lodges;<br/>
Change me, too, into a beaver!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Cautiously replied the beaver,<br/>
With reserve he thus made answer:<br/>
"Let me first consult the others,<br/>
Let me ask the other beavers."<br/>
Down he sank into the water,<br/>
Heavily sank he, as a stone sinks,<br/>
Down among the leaves and branches,<br/>
Brown and matted at the bottom.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet,<br/>
Spouted through the chinks below him,<br/>
Dashed upon the stones beneath him,<br/>
Spread serene and calm before him,<br/>
And the sunshine and the shadows<br/>
Fell in flecks and gleams upon him,<br/>
Fell in little shining patches,<br/>
Through the waving, rustling branches.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the bottom rose the beavers,<br/>
Silently above the surface<br/>
Rose one head and then another,<br/>
Till the pond seemed full of beavers,<br/>
Full of black and shining faces.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To the beavers Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Spake entreating, said in this wise:<br/>
"Very pleasant is your dwelling,<br/>
O my friends! and safe from danger;<br/>
Can you not, with all your cunning,<br/>
All your wisdom and contrivance,<br/>
Change me, too, into a beaver?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Yes!" replied Ahmeek, the beaver,<br/>
He the King of all the beavers,<br/>
"Let yourself slide down among us,<br/>
Down into the tranquil water."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Down into the pond among them<br/>
Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis;<br/>
Black became his shirt of deer-skin,<br/>
Black his moccasins and leggings,<br/>
In a broad black tail behind him<br/>
Spread his fox-tails and his fringes;<br/>
He was changed into a beaver.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Make me large," said Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
"Make me large and make me larger,<br/>
Larger than the other beavers."<br/>
"Yes," the beaver chief responded,<br/>
"When our lodge below you enter,<br/>
In our wigwam we will make you<br/>
Ten times larger than the others."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus into the clear, brown water<br/>
Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis:<br/>
Found the bottom covered over<br/>
With the trunks of trees and branches,<br/>
Hoards of food against the winter,<br/>
Piles and heaps against the famine;<br/>
Found the lodge with arching doorway,<br/>
Leading into spacious chambers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here they made him large and larger,<br/>
Made him largest of the beavers,<br/>
Ten times larger than the others.<br/>
"You shall be our ruler," said they;<br/>
"Chief and King of all the beavers."<br/>
</p>
<p>
But not long had Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Sat in state among the beavers,<br/>
When there came a voice, of warning<br/>
From the watchman at his station<br/>
In the water-flags and lilies,<br/>
Saying, "Here is Hiawatha!<br/>
Hiawatha with his hunters!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then they heard a cry above them,<br/>
Heard a shouting and a tramping,<br/>
Heard a crashing and a rushing,<br/>
And the water round and o'er them<br/>
Sank and sucked away in eddies,<br/>
And they knew their dam was broken.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the lodge's roof the hunters<br/>
Leaped, and broke it all asunder;<br/>
Streamed the sunshine through the crevice,<br/>
Sprang the beavers through the doorway,<br/>
Hid themselves in deeper water,<br/>
In the channel of the streamlet;<br/>
But the mighty Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Could not pass beneath the doorway;<br/>
He was puffed with pride and feeding,<br/>
He was swollen like a bladder.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through the roof looked Hiawatha,<br/>
Cried aloud, "O Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Vain are all your craft and cunning,<br/>
Vain your manifold disguises!<br/>
Well I know you, Pau-Puk-Keewis!"<br/>
With their clubs they beat and bruised him,<br/>
Beat to death poor Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Pounded him as maize is pounded,<br/>
Till his skull was crushed to pieces.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Six tall hunters, lithe and limber,<br/>
Bore him home on poles and branches,<br/>
Bore the body of the beaver;<br/>
But the ghost, the Jeebi in him,<br/>
Thought and felt as Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Still lived on as Pau-Puk-Keewis.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And it fluttered, strove, and struggled,<br/>
Waving hither, waving thither,<br/>
As the curtains of a wigwam<br/>
Struggle with their thongs of deer-skin,<br/>
When the wintry wind is blowing;<br/>
Till it drew itself together,<br/>
Till it rose up from the body,<br/>
Till it took the form and features<br/>
Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Vanishing into the forest.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But the wary Hiawatha<br/>
Saw the figure ere it vanished,<br/>
Saw the form of Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Glide into the soft blue shadow<br/>
Of the pine-trees of the forest;<br/>
Toward the squares of white beyond it,<br/>
Toward an opening in the forest.<br/>
Like a wind it rushed and panted,<br/>
Bending all the boughs before it,<br/>
And behind it, as the rain comes,<br/>
Came the steps of Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To a lake with many islands<br/>
Came the breathless Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Where among the water-lilies<br/>
Pishnekuh, the brant, were sailing;<br/>
Through the tufts of rushes floating,<br/>
Steering through the reedy Islands.<br/>
Now their broad black beaks they lifted,<br/>
Now they plunged beneath the water,<br/>
Now they darkened in the shadow,<br/>
Now they brightened in the sunshine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Pishnekuh!" cried Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
"Pishnekuh! my brothers!" said he,<br/>
"Change me to a brant with plumage,<br/>
With a shining neck and feathers,<br/>
Make me large, and make me larger,<br/>
Ten times larger than the others."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Straightway to a brant they changed him,<br/>
With two huge and dusky pinions,<br/>
With a bosom smooth and rounded,<br/>
With a bill like two great paddles,<br/>
Made him larger than the others,<br/>
Ten times larger than the largest,<br/>
Just as, shouting from the forest,<br/>
On the shore stood Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Up they rose with cry and clamor,<br/>
With a whir and beat of pinions,<br/>
Rose up from the reedy Islands,<br/>
From the water-flags and lilies.<br/>
And they said to Pau-Puk-Keewis:<br/>
"In your flying, look not downward,<br/>
Take good heed and look not downward,<br/>
Lest some strange mischance should happen,<br/>
Lest some great mishap befall you!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fast and far they fled to northward,<br/>
Fast and far through mist and sunshine,<br/>
Fed among the moors and fen-lands,<br/>
Slept among the reeds and rushes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the morrow as they journeyed,<br/>
Buoyed and lifted by the South-wind,<br/>
Wafted onward by the South-wind,<br/>
Blowing fresh and strong behind them,<br/>
Rose a sound of human voices,<br/>
Rose a clamor from beneath them,<br/>
From the lodges of a village,<br/>
From the people miles beneath them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For the people of the village<br/>
Saw the flock of brant with wonder,<br/>
Saw the wings of Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Flapping far up in the ether,<br/>
Broader than two doorway curtains.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Pau-Puk-Keewis heard the shouting,<br/>
Knew the voice of Hiawatha,<br/>
Knew the outcry of Iagoo,<br/>
And, forgetful of the warning,<br/>
Drew his neck in, and looked downward,<br/>
And the wind that blew behind him<br/>
Caught his mighty fan of feathers,<br/>
Sent him wheeling, whirling downward!<br/>
</p>
<p>
All in vain did Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Struggle to regain his balance!<br/>
Whirling round and round and downward,<br/>
He beheld in turn the village<br/>
And in turn the flock above him,<br/>
Saw the village coming nearer,<br/>
And the flock receding farther,<br/>
Heard the voices growing louder,<br/>
Heard the shouting and the laughter;<br/>
Saw no more the flocks above him,<br/>
Only saw the earth beneath him;<br/>
Dead out of the empty heaven,<br/>
Dead among the shouting people,<br/>
With a heavy sound and sullen,<br/>
Fell the brant with broken pinions.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But his soul, his ghost, his shadow,<br/>
Still survived as Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Took again the form and features<br/>
Of the handsome Yenadizze,<br/>
And again went rushing onward,<br/>
Followed fast by Hiawatha,<br/>
Crying: "Not so wide the world is,<br/>
Not so long and rough the way is,<br/>
But my wrath shall overtake you,<br/>
But my vengeance shall attain you!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And so near he came, so near him,<br/>
That his hand was stretched to seize him,<br/>
His right hand to seize and hold him,<br/>
When the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Whirled and spun about in circles,<br/>
Fanned the air into a whirlwind,<br/>
Danced the dust and leaves about him,<br/>
And amid the whirling eddies<br/>
Sprang into a hollow oak-tree,<br/>
Changed himself into a serpent,<br/>
Gliding out through root and rubbish.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With his right hand Hiawatha<br/>
Smote amain the hollow oak-tree,<br/>
Rent it into shreds and splinters,<br/>
Left it lying there in fragments.<br/>
But in vain; for Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Once again in human figure,<br/>
Full in sight ran on before him,<br/>
Sped away in gust and whirlwind,<br/>
On the shores of Gitche Gumee,<br/>
Westward by the Big-Sea-Water,<br/>
Came unto the rocky headlands,<br/>
To the Pictured Rocks of sandstone,<br/>
Looking over lake and landscape.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the Old Man of the Mountain,<br/>
He the Manito of Mountains,<br/>
Opened wide his rocky doorways,<br/>
Opened wide his deep abysses,<br/>
Giving Pau-Puk-Keewis shelter<br/>
In his caverns dark and dreary,<br/>
Bidding Pau-Puk-Keewis welcome<br/>
To his gloomy lodge of sandstone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There without stood Hiawatha,<br/>
Found the doorways closed against him,<br/>
With his mittens, Minjekahwun,<br/>
Smote great caverns in the sandstone,<br/>
Cried aloud in tones of thunder,<br/>
"Open! I am Hiawatha!"<br/>
But the Old Man of the Mountain<br/>
Opened not, and made no answer<br/>
From the silent crags of sandstone,<br/>
From the gloomy rock abysses.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he raised his hands to heaven,<br/>
Called imploring on the tempest,<br/>
Called Waywassimo, the lightning,<br/>
And the thunder, Annemeekee;<br/>
And they came with night and darkness,<br/>
Sweeping down the Big-Sea-Water<br/>
From the distant Thunder Mountains;<br/>
And the trembling Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Heard the footsteps of the thunder,<br/>
Saw the red eyes of the lightning,<br/>
Was afraid, and crouched and trembled.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Waywassimo, the lightning,<br/>
Smote the doorways of the caverns,<br/>
With his war-club smote the doorways,<br/>
Smote the jutting crags of sandstone,<br/>
And the thunder, Annemeekee,<br/>
Shouted down into the caverns,<br/>
Saying, "Where is Pau-Puk-Keewis!"<br/>
And the crags fell, and beneath them<br/>
Dead among the rocky ruins<br/>
Lay the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Lay the handsome Yenadizze,<br/>
Slain in his own human figure.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ended were his wild adventures,<br/>
Ended were his tricks and gambols,<br/>
Ended all his craft and cunning,<br/>
Ended all his mischief-making,<br/>
All his gambling and his dancing,<br/>
All his wooing of the maidens.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the noble Hiawatha<br/>
Took his soul, his ghost, his shadow,<br/>
Spake and said: "O Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Never more in human figure<br/>
Shall you search for new adventures;<br/>
Never more with jest and laughter<br/>
Dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds;<br/>
But above there in the heavens<br/>
You shall soar and sail in circles;<br/>
I will change you to an eagle,<br/>
To Keneu, the great war-eagle,<br/>
Chief of all the fowls with feathers,<br/>
Chief of Hiawatha's chickens."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the name of Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Lingers still among the people,<br/>
Lingers still among the singers,<br/>
And among the story-tellers;<br/>
And in Winter, when the snow-flakes<br/>
Whirl in eddies round the lodges,<br/>
When the wind in gusty tumult<br/>
O'er the smoke-flue pipes and whistles,<br/>
"There," they cry, "comes Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
He is dancing through the village,<br/>
He is gathering in his harvest!"<br/>

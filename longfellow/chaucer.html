<h1>Chaucer</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
An old man in a lodge within a park;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The chamber walls depicted all around<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With portraitures of huntsman, hawk, and hound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hurt deer.  He listeneth to the lark,<br/>
Whose song comes with the sunshine through the dark<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of painted glass in leaden lattice bound;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He listeneth and he laugheth at the sound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then writeth in a book like any clerk.<br/>
He is the poet of the dawn, who wrote<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canterbury Tales, and his old age<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made beautiful with song; and as I read<br/>
I hear the crowing cock, I hear the note<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lark and linnet, and from every page<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise odors of ploughed field or flowery mead.

<h1>The Cross of Snow</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
In the long, sleepless watches of the night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentle face&mdash;the face of one long dead&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks at me from the wall, where round its head<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.<br/>
Here in this room she died; and soul more white<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never through martyrdom of fire was led<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To its repose; nor can in books be read<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend of a life more benedight.<br/>
There is a mountain in the distant West<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That, sun-defying, in its deep ravines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Displays a cross of snow upon its side.<br/>
Such is the cross I wear upon my breast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These eighteen years, through all the changing scenes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seasons, changeless since the day she died.

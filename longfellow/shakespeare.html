<h1>Shakespeare</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
A vision as of crowded city streets,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With human life in endless overflow;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder of thoroughfares; trumpets that blow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To battle; clamor, in obscure retreats,<br/>
Of sailors landed from their anchored fleets;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolling of bells in turrets, and below<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of children, and bright flowers that throw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er garden-walls their intermingled sweets!<br/>
This vision comes to me when I unfold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of the Poet paramount,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom all the Muses loved, not one alone;&mdash;<br/>
Into his hands they put the lyre of gold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, crowned with sacred laurel at their fount,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Placed him as Musagetes on their throne.

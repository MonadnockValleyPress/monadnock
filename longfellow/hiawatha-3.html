<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>III. Hiawatha's Childhood</h2>
<p>
Downward through the evening twilight,<br/>
In the days that are forgotten,<br/>
In the unremembered ages,<br/>
From the full moon fell Nokomis,<br/>
Fell the beautiful Nokomis,<br/>
She a wife, but not a mother.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She was sporting with her women,<br/>
Swinging in a swing of grape-vines,<br/>
When her rival the rejected,<br/>
Full of jealousy and hatred,<br/>
Cut the leafy swing asunder,<br/>
Cut in twain the twisted grape-vines,<br/>
And Nokomis fell affrighted<br/>
Downward through the evening twilight,<br/>
On the Muskoday, the meadow,<br/>
On the prairie full of blossoms.<br/>
"See! a star falls!" said the people;<br/>
"From the sky a star is falling!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
There among the ferns and mosses,<br/>
There among the prairie lilies,<br/>
On the Muskoday, the meadow,<br/>
In the moonlight and the starlight,<br/>
Fair Nokomis bore a daughter.<br/>
And she called her name Wenonah,<br/>
As the first-born of her daughters.<br/>
And the daughter of Nokomis<br/>
Grew up like the prairie lilies,<br/>
Grew a tall and slender maiden,<br/>
With the beauty of the moonlight,<br/>
With the beauty of the starlight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And Nokomis warned her often,<br/>
Saying oft, and oft repeating,<br/>
"Oh, beware of Mudjekeewis,<br/>
Of the West-Wind, Mudjekeewis;<br/>
Listen not to what he tells you;<br/>
Lie not down upon the meadow,<br/>
Stoop not down among the lilies,<br/>
Lest the West-Wind come and harm you!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
But she heeded not the warning,<br/>
Heeded not those words of wisdom,<br/>
And the West-Wind came at evening,<br/>
Walking lightly o'er the prairie,<br/>
Whispering to the leaves and blossoms,<br/>
Bending low the flowers and grasses,<br/>
Found the beautiful Wenonah,<br/>
Lying there among the lilies,<br/>
Wooed her with his words of sweetness,<br/>
Wooed her with his soft caresses,<br/>
Till she bore a son in sorrow,<br/>
Bore a son of love and sorrow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus was born my Hiawatha,<br/>
Thus was born the child of wonder;<br/>
But the daughter of Nokomis,<br/>
Hiawatha's gentle mother,<br/>
In her anguish died deserted<br/>
By the West-Wind, false and faithless,<br/>
By the heartless Mudjekeewis.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For her daughter long and loudly<br/>
Wailed and wept the sad Nokomis;<br/>
"Oh that I were dead!" she murmured,<br/>
"Oh that I were dead, as thou art!<br/>
No more work, and no more weeping,<br/>
Wahonowin! Wahonowin!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
By the shores of Gitche Gumee,<br/>
By the shining Big-Sea-Water,<br/>
Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,<br/>
Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.<br/>
Dark behind it rose the forest,<br/>
Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,<br/>
Rose the firs with cones upon them;<br/>
Bright before it beat the water,<br/>
Beat the clear and sunny water,<br/>
Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There the wrinkled old Nokomis<br/>
Nursed the little Hiawatha,<br/>
Rocked him in his linden cradle,<br/>
Bedded soft in moss and rushes,<br/>
Safely bound with reindeer sinews;<br/>
Stilled his fretful wail by saying,<br/>
"Hush! the Naked Bear will hear thee!"<br/>
Lulled him into slumber, singing,<br/>
"Ewa-yea! my little owlet!<br/>
Who is this, that lights the wigwam?<br/>
With his great eyes lights the wigwam?<br/>
Ewa-yea! my little owlet!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Many things Nokomis taught him<br/>
Of the stars that shine in heaven;<br/>
Showed him Ishkoodah, the comet,<br/>
Ishkoodah, with fiery tresses;<br/>
Showed the Death-Dance of the spirits,<br/>
Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs,<br/>
Flaring far away to northward<br/>
In the frosty nights of Winter;<br/>
Showed the broad white road in heaven,<br/>
Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,<br/>
Running straight across the heavens,<br/>
Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
At the door on summer evenings<br/>
Sat the little Hiawatha;<br/>
Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,<br/>
Heard the lapping of the waters,<br/>
Sounds of music, words of wonder;<br/>
"Minne-wawa!" said the Pine-trees,<br/>
"Mudway-aushka!" said the water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Saw the fire-fly, Wah-wah-taysee,<br/>
Flitting through the dusk of evening,<br/>
With the twinkle of its candle<br/>
Lighting up the brakes and bushes,<br/>
And he sang the song of children,<br/>
Sang the song Nokomis taught him:<br/>
"Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,<br/>
Little, flitting, white-fire insect,<br/>
Little, dancing, white-fire creature,<br/>
Light me with your little candle,<br/>
Ere upon my bed I lay me,<br/>
Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Saw the moon rise from the water<br/>
Rippling, rounding from the water,<br/>
Saw the flecks and shadows on it,<br/>
Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis?"<br/>
And the good Nokomis answered:<br/>
"Once a warrior, very angry,<br/>
Seized his grandmother, and threw her<br/>
Up into the sky at midnight;<br/>
Right against the moon he threw her;<br/>
'T is her body that you see there."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Saw the rainbow in the heaven,<br/>
In the eastern sky, the rainbow,<br/>
Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis?"<br/>
And the good Nokomis answered:<br/>
"'T is the heaven of flowers you see there;<br/>
All the wild-flowers of the forest,<br/>
All the lilies of the prairie,<br/>
When on earth they fade and perish,<br/>
Blossom in that heaven above us."<br/>
</p>
<p>
When he heard the owls at midnight,<br/>
Hooting, laughing in the forest,<br/>
"What is that?" he cried in terror,<br/>
"What is that," he said, "Nokomis?"<br/>
And the good Nokomis answered:<br/>
"That is but the owl and owlet,<br/>
Talking in their native language,<br/>
Talking, scolding at each other."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the little Hiawatha<br/>
Learned of every bird its language,<br/>
Learned their names and all their secrets,<br/>
How they built their nests in Summer,<br/>
Where they hid themselves in Winter,<br/>
Talked with them whene'er he met them,<br/>
Called them "Hiawatha's Chickens."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of all beasts he learned the language,<br/>
Learned their names and all their secrets,<br/>
How the beavers built their lodges,<br/>
Where the squirrels hid their acorns,<br/>
How the reindeer ran so swiftly,<br/>
Why the rabbit was so timid,<br/>
Talked with them whene'er he met them,<br/>
Called them "Hiawatha's Brothers."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then Iagoo, the great boaster,<br/>
He the marvellous story-teller,<br/>
He the traveller and the talker,<br/>
He the friend of old Nokomis,<br/>
Made a bow for Hiawatha;<br/>
From a branch of ash he made it,<br/>
From an oak-bough made the arrows,<br/>
Tipped with flint, and winged with feathers,<br/>
And the cord he made of deer-skin.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he said to Hiawatha:<br/>
"Go, my son, into the forest,<br/>
Where the red deer herd together,<br/>
Kill for us a famous roebuck,<br/>
Kill for us a deer with antlers!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Forth into the forest straightway<br/>
All alone walked Hiawatha<br/>
Proudly, with his bow and arrows;<br/>
And the birds sang round him, o'er him,<br/>
"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"<br/>
Sang the robin, the Opechee,<br/>
Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,<br/>
"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Up the oak-tree, close beside him,<br/>
Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo,<br/>
In and out among the branches,<br/>
Coughed and chattered from the oak-tree,<br/>
Laughed, and said between his laughing,<br/>
"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the rabbit from his pathway<br/>
Leaped aside, and at a distance<br/>
Sat erect upon his haunches,<br/>
Half in fear and half in frolic,<br/>
Saying to the little hunter,<br/>
"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
But he heeded not, nor heard them,<br/>
For his thoughts were with the red deer;<br/>
On their tracks his eyes were fastened,<br/>
Leading downward to the river,<br/>
To the ford across the river,<br/>
And as one in slumber walked he.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hidden in the alder-bushes,<br/>
There he waited till the deer came,<br/>
Till he saw two antlers lifted,<br/>
Saw two eyes look from the thicket,<br/>
Saw two nostrils point to windward,<br/>
And a deer came down the pathway,<br/>
Flecked with leafy light and shadow.<br/>
And his heart within him fluttered,<br/>
Trembled like the leaves above him,<br/>
Like the birch-leaf palpitated,<br/>
As the deer came down the pathway.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, upon one knee uprising,<br/>
Hiawatha aimed an arrow;<br/>
Scarce a twig moved with his motion,<br/>
Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled,<br/>
But the wary roebuck started,<br/>
Stamped with all his hoofs together,<br/>
Listened with one foot uplifted,<br/>
Leaped as if to meet the arrow;<br/>
Ah! the singing, fatal arrow,<br/>
Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Dead he lay there in the forest,<br/>
By the ford across the river;<br/>
Beat his timid heart no longer,<br/>
But the heart of Hiawatha<br/>
Throbbed and shouted and exulted,<br/>
As he bore the red deer homeward,<br/>
And Iagoo and Nokomis<br/>
Hailed his coming with applauses.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the red deer's hide Nokomis<br/>
Made a cloak for Hiawatha,<br/>
From the red deer's flesh Nokomis<br/>
Made a banquet to his honor.<br/>
All the village came and feasted,<br/>
All the guests praised Hiawatha,<br/>
Called him Strong-Heart, Soan-ge-taha!<br/>
Called him Loon-Heart, Mahn-go-taysee!<br/>

<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>VIII. Hiawatha's Fishing</h2>
<p>
Forth upon the Gitche Gumee,<br/>
On the shining Big-Sea-Water,<br/>
With his fishing-line of cedar,<br/>
Of the twisted bark of cedar,<br/>
Forth to catch the sturgeon Nahma,<br/>
Mishe-Nahma, King of Fishes,<br/>
In his birch canoe exulting<br/>
All alone went Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through the clear, transparent water<br/>
He could see the fishes swimming<br/>
Far down in the depths below him;<br/>
See the yellow perch, the Sahwa,<br/>
Like a sunbeam in the water,<br/>
See the Shawgashee, the craw-fish,<br/>
Like a spider on the bottom,<br/>
On the white and sandy bottom.<br/>
</p>
<p>
At the stern sat Hiawatha,<br/>
With his fishing-line of cedar;<br/>
In his plumes the breeze of morning<br/>
Played as in the hemlock branches;<br/>
On the bows, with tail erected,<br/>
Sat the squirrel, Adjidaumo;<br/>
In his fur the breeze of morning<br/>
Played as in the prairie grasses.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On the white sand of the bottom<br/>
Lay the monster Mishe-Nahma,<br/>
Lay the sturgeon, King of Fishes;<br/>
Through his gills he breathed the water,<br/>
With his fins he fanned and winnowed,<br/>
With his tail he swept the sand-floor.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There he lay in all his armor;<br/>
On each side a shield to guard him,<br/>
Plates of bone upon his forehead,<br/>
Down his sides and back and shoulders<br/>
Plates of bone with spines projecting;<br/>
Painted was he with his war-paints,<br/>
Stripes of yellow, red, and azure,<br/>
Spots of brown and spots of sable;<br/>
And he lay there on the bottom,<br/>
Fanning with his fins of purple,<br/>
As above him Hiawatha<br/>
In his birch canoe came sailing,<br/>
With his fishing-line of cedar.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Take my bait," cried Hiawatha,<br/>
Down into the depths beneath him,<br/>
"Take my bait, O Sturgeon, Nahma!<br/>
Come up from below the water,<br/>
Let us see which is the stronger!"<br/>
And he dropped his line of cedar<br/>
Through the clear, transparent water,<br/>
Waited vainly for an answer,<br/>
Long sat waiting for an answer,<br/>
And repeating loud and louder,<br/>
"Take my bait, O King of Fishes!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Quiet lay the sturgeon, Nahma,<br/>
Fanning slowly in the water,<br/>
Looking up at Hiawatha,<br/>
Listening to his call and clamor,<br/>
His unnecessary tumult,<br/>
Till he wearied of the shouting;<br/>
And he said to the Kenozha,<br/>
To the pike, the Maskenozha,<br/>
"Take the bait of this rude fellow,<br/>
Break the line of Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
In his fingers Hiawatha<br/>
Felt the loose line jerk and tighten,<br/>
As he drew it in, it tugged so<br/>
That the birch canoe stood endwise,<br/>
Like a birch log in the water,<br/>
With the squirrel, Adjidaumo,<br/>
Perched and frisking on the summit.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Full of scorn was Hiawatha<br/>
When he saw the fish rise upward,<br/>
Saw the pike, the Maskenozha,<br/>
Coming nearer, nearer to him,<br/>
And he shouted through the water,<br/>
"Esa! esa! shame upon you!<br/>
You are but the pike, Kenozha,<br/>
You are not the fish I wanted,<br/>
You are not the King of Fishes!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Reeling downward to the bottom<br/>
Sank the pike in great confusion,<br/>
And the mighty sturgeon, Nahma,<br/>
Said to Ugudwash, the sun-fish,<br/>
To the bream, with scales of crimson,<br/>
"Take the bait of this great boaster,<br/>
Break the line of Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Slowly upward, wavering, gleaming,<br/>
Rose the Ugudwash, the sun-fish,<br/>
Seized the line of Hiawatha,<br/>
Swung with all his weight upon it,<br/>
Made a whirlpool in the water,<br/>
Whirled the birch canoe in circles,<br/>
Round and round in gurgling eddies,<br/>
Till the circles in the water<br/>
Reached the far-off sandy beaches,<br/>
Till the water-flags and rushes<br/>
Nodded on the distant margins.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But when Hiawatha saw him<br/>
Slowly rising through the water,<br/>
Lifting up his disk refulgent,<br/>
Loud he shouted in derision,<br/>
"Esa! esa! shame upon you!<br/>
You are Ugudwash, the sun-fish,<br/>
You are not the fish I wanted,<br/>
You are not the King of Fishes!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Slowly downward, wavering, gleaming,<br/>
Sank the Ugudwash, the sun-fish,<br/>
And again the sturgeon, Nahma,<br/>
Heard the shout of Hiawatha,<br/>
Heard his challenge of defiance,<br/>
The unnecessary tumult,<br/>
Ringing far across the water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the white sand of the bottom<br/>
Up he rose with angry gesture,<br/>
Quivering in each nerve and fibre,<br/>
Clashing all his plates of armor,<br/>
Gleaming bright with all his war-paint;<br/>
In his wrath he darted upward,<br/>
Flashing leaped into the sunshine,<br/>
Opened his great jaws, and swallowed<br/>
Both canoe and Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Down into that darksome cavern<br/>
Plunged the headlong Hiawatha,<br/>
As a log on some black river<br/>
Shoots and plunges down the rapids,<br/>
Found himself in utter darkness,<br/>
Groped about in helpless wonder,<br/>
Till he felt a great heart beating,<br/>
Throbbing in that utter darkness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he smote it in his anger,<br/>
With his fist, the heart of Nahma,<br/>
Felt the mighty King of Fishes<br/>
Shudder through each nerve and fibre,<br/>
Heard the water gurgle round him<br/>
As he leaped and staggered through it,<br/>
Sick at heart, and faint and weary.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Crosswise then did Hiawatha<br/>
Drag his birch-canoe for safety,<br/>
Lest from out the jaws of Nahma,<br/>
In the turmoil and confusion,<br/>
Forth he might be hurled and perish.<br/>
And the squirrel, Adjidaumo,<br/>
Frisked and chatted very gayly,<br/>
Toiled and tugged with Hiawatha<br/>
Till the labor was completed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then said Hiawatha to him,<br/>
"O my little friend, the squirrel,<br/>
Bravely have you toiled to help me;<br/>
Take the thanks of Hiawatha,<br/>
And the name which now he gives you;<br/>
For hereafter and forever<br/>
Boys shall call you Adjidaumo,<br/>
Tail-in-air the boys shall call you!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And again the sturgeon, Nahma,<br/>
Gasped and quivered in the water,<br/>
Then was still, and drifted landward<br/>
Till he grated on the pebbles,<br/>
Till the listening Hiawatha<br/>
Heard him grate upon the margin,<br/>
Felt him strand upon the pebbles,<br/>
Knew that Nahma, King of Fishes,<br/>
Lay there dead upon the margin.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he heard a clang and flapping,<br/>
As of many wings assembling,<br/>
Heard a screaming and confusion,<br/>
As of birds of prey contending,<br/>
Saw a gleam of light above him,<br/>
Shining through the ribs of Nahma,<br/>
Saw the glittering eyes of sea-gulls,<br/>
Of Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, peering,<br/>
Gazing at him through the opening,<br/>
Heard them saying to each other,<br/>
"'T is our brother, Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he shouted from below them,<br/>
Cried exulting from the caverns:<br/>
"O ye sea-gulls! O my brothers!<br/>
I have slain the sturgeon, Nahma;<br/>
Make the rifts a little larger,<br/>
With your claws the openings widen,<br/>
Set me free from this dark prison,<br/>
And henceforward and forever<br/>
Men shall speak of your achievements,<br/>
Calling you Kayoshk, the sea-gulls,<br/>
Yes, Kayoshk, the Noble Scratchers!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the wild and clamorous sea-gulls<br/>
Toiled with beak and claws together,<br/>
Made the rifts and openings wider<br/>
In the mighty ribs of Nahma,<br/>
And from peril and from prison,<br/>
From the body of the sturgeon,<br/>
From the peril of the water,<br/>
They released my Hiawatha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He was standing near his wigwam,<br/>
On the margin of the water,<br/>
And he called to old Nokomis,<br/>
Called and beckoned to Nokomis,<br/>
Pointed to the sturgeon, Nahma,<br/>
Lying lifeless on the pebbles,<br/>
With the sea-gulls feeding on him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I have slain the Mishe-Nahma,<br/>
Slain the King of Fishes!" said he;<br/>
"Look! the sea-gulls feed upon him,<br/>
Yes, my friends Kayoshk, the sea-gulls;<br/>
Drive them not away, Nokomis,<br/>
They have saved me from great peril<br/>
In the body of the sturgeon,<br/>
Wait until their meal is ended,<br/>
Till their craws are full with feasting,<br/>
Till they homeward fly, at sunset,<br/>
To their nests among the marshes;<br/>
Then bring all your pots and kettles,<br/>
And make oil for us in Winter."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And she waited till the sun set,<br/>
Till the pallid moon, the Night-sun,<br/>
Rose above the tranquil water,<br/>
Till Kayoshk, the sated sea-gulls,<br/>
From their banquet rose with clamor,<br/>
And across the fiery sunset<br/>
Winged their way to far-off islands,<br/>
To their nests among the rushes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To his sleep went Hiawatha,<br/>
And Nokomis to her labor,<br/>
Toiling patient in the moonlight,<br/>
Till the sun and moon changed places,<br/>
Till the sky was red with sunrise,<br/>
And Kayoshk, the hungry sea-gulls,<br/>
Came back from the reedy islands,<br/>
Clamorous for their morning banquet.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Three whole days and nights alternate<br/>
Old Nokomis and the sea-gulls<br/>
Stripped the oily flesh of Nahma,<br/>
Till the waves washed through the rib-bones,<br/>
Till the sea-gulls came no longer,<br/>
And upon the sands lay nothing<br/>
But the skeleton of Nahma.<br/>

<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>I. The Peace-Pipe</h2>
<p>
On the Mountains of the Prairie,<br/>
On the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry,<br/>
Gitche Manito, the mighty,<br/>
He the Master of Life, descending,<br/>
On the red crags of the quarry<br/>
Stood erect, and called the nations,<br/>
Called the tribes of men together.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From his footprints flowed a river,<br/>
Leaped into the light of morning,<br/>
O'er the precipice plunging downward<br/>
Gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet.<br/>
And the Spirit, stooping earthward,<br/>
With his finger on the meadow<br/>
Traced a winding pathway for it,<br/>
Saying to it, "Run in this way!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the red stone of the quarry<br/>
With his hand he broke a fragment,<br/>
Moulded it into a pipe-head,<br/>
Shaped and fashioned it with figures;<br/>
From the margin of the river<br/>
Took a long reed for a pipe-stem,<br/>
With its dark green leaves upon it;<br/>
Filled the pipe with bark of willow,<br/>
With the bark of the red willow;<br/>
Breathed upon the neighboring forest,<br/>
Made its great boughs chafe together,<br/>
Till in flame they burst and kindled;<br/>
And erect upon the mountains,<br/>
Gitche Manito, the mighty,<br/>
Smoked the calumet, the Peace-Pipe,<br/>
As a signal to the nations.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the smoke rose slowly, slowly,<br/>
Through the tranquil air of morning,<br/>
First a single line of darkness,<br/>
Then a denser, bluer vapor,<br/>
Then a snow-white cloud unfolding,<br/>
Like the tree-tops of the forest,<br/>
Ever rising, rising, rising,<br/>
Till it touched the top of heaven,<br/>
Till it broke against the heaven,<br/>
And rolled outward all around it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the Vale of Tawasentha,<br/>
From the Valley of Wyoming,<br/>
From the groves of Tuscaloosa,<br/>
From the far-off Rocky Mountains,<br/>
From the Northern lakes and rivers<br/>
All the tribes beheld the signal,<br/>
Saw the distant smoke ascending,<br/>
The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the Prophets of the nations<br/>
Said: "Behold it, the Pukwana!<br/>
By the signal of the Peace-Pipe,<br/>
Bending like a wand of willow,<br/>
Waving like a hand that beckons,<br/>
Gitche Manito, the mighty,<br/>
Calls the tribes of men together,<br/>
Calls the warriors to his council!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Down the rivers, o'er the prairies,<br/>
Came the warriors of the nations,<br/>
Came the Delawares and Mohawks,<br/>
Came the Choctaws and Camanches,<br/>
Came the Shoshonies and Blackfeet,<br/>
Came the Pawnees and Omahas,<br/>
</p>
<p>
Came the Mandans and Dacotahs,<br/>
Came the Hurons and Ojibways,<br/>
All the warriors drawn together<br/>
By the signal of the Peace-Pipe,<br/>
To the Mountains of the Prairie,<br/>
To the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry,<br/>
</p>
<p>
And they stood there on the meadow,<br/>
With their weapons and their war-gear,<br/>
Painted like the leaves of Autumn,<br/>
Painted like the sky of morning,<br/>
Wildly glaring at each other;<br/>
In their faces stern defiance,<br/>
In their hearts the feuds of ages,<br/>
The hereditary hatred,<br/>
The ancestral thirst of vengeance.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Gitche Manito, the mighty,<br/>
The creator of the nations,<br/>
Looked upon them with compassion,<br/>
With paternal love and pity;<br/>
Looked upon their wrath and wrangling<br/>
But as quarrels among children,<br/>
But as feuds and fights of children!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Over them he stretched his right hand,<br/>
To subdue their stubborn natures,<br/>
To allay their thirst and fever,<br/>
By the shadow of his right hand;<br/>
Spake to them with voice majestic<br/>
As the sound of far-off waters,<br/>
Falling into deep abysses,<br/>
Warning, chiding, spake in this wise:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O my children! my poor children!<br/>
Listen to the words of wisdom,<br/>
Listen to the words of warning,<br/>
From the lips of the Great Spirit,<br/>
From the Master of Life, who made you!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I have given you lands to hunt in,<br/>
I have given you streams to fish in,<br/>
I have given you bear and bison,<br/>
I have given you roe and reindeer,<br/>
I have given you brant and beaver,<br/>
Filled the marshes full of wild-fowl,<br/>
Filled the rivers full of fishes:<br/>
Why then are you not contented?<br/>
Why then will you hunt each other?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I am weary of your quarrels,<br/>
Weary of your wars and bloodshed,<br/>
Weary of your prayers for vengeance,<br/>
Of your wranglings and dissensions;<br/>
All your strength is in your union,<br/>
All your danger is in discord;<br/>
Therefore be at peace henceforward,<br/>
And as brothers live together.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I will send a Prophet to you,<br/>
A Deliverer of the nations,<br/>
Who shall guide you and shall teach you,<br/>
Who shall toil and suffer with you.<br/>
If you listen to his counsels,<br/>
You will multiply and prosper;<br/>
If his warnings pass unheeded,<br/>
You will fade away and perish!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Bathe now in the stream before you,<br/>
Wash the war-paint from your faces,<br/>
Wash the blood-stains from your fingers,<br/>
Bury your war-clubs and your weapons,<br/>
Break the red stone from this quarry,<br/>
Mould and make it into Peace-Pipes,<br/>
Take the reeds that grow beside you,<br/>
Deck them with your brightest feathers,<br/>
Smoke the calumet together,<br/>
And as brothers live henceforward!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then upon the ground the warriors<br/>
Threw their cloaks and shirts of deer-skin,<br/>
Threw their weapons and their war-gear,<br/>
Leaped into the rushing river,<br/>
Washed the war-paint from their faces.<br/>
Clear above them flowed the water,<br/>
Clear and limpid from the footprints<br/>
Of the Master of Life descending;<br/>
Dark below them flowed the water,<br/>
Soiled and stained with streaks of crimson,<br/>
As if blood were mingled with it!<br/>
</p>
<p>
From the river came the warriors,<br/>
Clean and washed from all their war-paint;<br/>
On the banks their clubs they buried,<br/>
Buried all their warlike weapons.<br/>
Gitche Manito, the mighty,<br/>
The Great Spirit, the creator,<br/>
Smiled upon his helpless children!<br/>
</p>
<p>
And in silence all the warriors<br/>
Broke the red stone of the quarry,<br/>
Smoothed and formed it into Peace-Pipes,<br/>
Broke the long reeds by the river,<br/>
Decked them with their brightest feathers,<br/>
And departed each one homeward,<br/>
While the Master of Life, ascending,<br/>
Through the opening of cloud-curtains,<br/>
Through the doorways of the heaven,<br/>
Vanished from before their faces,<br/>
In the smoke that rolled around him,<br/>
The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe!<br/>

<h1>Paul Revere's Ride</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
Listen, my children, and you shall hear<br/>
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,<br/>
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:<br/>
Hardly a man is now alive<br/>
Who remembers that famous day and year.
</p>
<p>
He said to his friend,&mdash; "If the British march<br/>
By land or sea from the town to-night,<br/>
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch<br/>
Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,&mdash;<br/>
One if by land, and two if by sea;<br/>
And I on the opposite shore will be,<br/>
Ready to ride and spread the alarm<br/>
Through every Middlesex village and farm,<br/>
For the country-folk to be up and to arm."
</p>
<p>
Then he said good-night, and with muffled oar<br/>
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,<br/>
Just as the moon rose over the bay,<br/>
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay<br/>
The Somersett, British man-of-war:<br/>
A phantom ship, with each mast and spar<br/>
Across the moon, like a prison-bar,<br/>
And a huge, black hulk, that was magnified<br/>
By its own reflection in the tide.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street<br/>
Wanders and watches with eager ears,<br/>
Till in the silence around him he hears<br/>
The muster of men at the barrack-door,<br/>
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,<br/>
And the measured tread of the grenadiers<br/>
Marching down to their boats on the shore.
</p>
<p>
Then he climbed to the tower of the church,<br/>
Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,<br/>
To the belfry-chamber overhead,<br/>
And startled the pigeons from their perch<br/>
On the sombre rafters, that round him made<br/>
Masses and moving shapes of shade,&mdash;<br/>
Up the light ladder, slender and tall,<br/>
To the highest window in the wall,<br/>
Where he paused to listen and look down<br/>
A moment on the roofs of the town,<br/>
And the moonlight flowing over all.
</p>
<p>
Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead<br/>
In their night-encampment on the hill,<br/>
Wrapped in silence so deep and still,<br/>
That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,<br/>
The watchful night-wind, as it went<br/>
Creeping along from tent to tent,<br/>
And seeming to whisper, "All is well!"<br/>
A moment only he feels the spell<br/>
Of the place and the hour, the secret dread<br/>
Of the lonely belfry and the dead;<br/>
For suddenly all his thoughts are bent<br/>
On a shadowy something far away,<br/>
Where the river widens to meet the bay,&mdash;<br/>
A line of black, that bends and floats<br/>
On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,<br/>
Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,<br/>
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere<br/>
Now he patted his horse's side,<br/>
Now gazed on the landscape far and near,<br/>
Then impetuous stamped the earth,<br/>
And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;<br/>
But mostly he watched with eager search<br/>
The belfry-tower of the old North Church,<br/>
As it rose above the graves on the hill,<br/>
Lonely, and spectral, and sombre, and still.
</p>
<p>
And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height,<br/>
A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!<br/>
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,<br/>
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight<br/>
A second lamp in the belfry burns!
</p>
<p>
A hurry of hoofs in a village-street,<br/>
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,<br/>
And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark<br/>
Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet:<br/>
That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,<br/>
The fate of a nation was riding that night;<br/>
And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,<br/>
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.
</p>
<p>
It was twelve by the village-clock,<br/>
When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.<br/>
He heard the crowing of the cock,<br/>
And the barking of the farmer's dog,<br/>
And felt the damp of the river-fog,<br/>
That rises when the sun goes down.
</p>
<p>
It was one by the village-clock,<br/>
When he rode into Lexington.<br/>
He saw the gilded weathercock<br/>
Swim in the moonlight as he passed,<br/>
And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,<br/>
Gaze at him with a spectral glare,<br/>
As if they already stood aghast<br/>
At the bloody work they would look upon.
</p>
<p>
It was two by the village-clock,<br/>
When he came to the bridge in Concord town.<br/>
He heard the bleating of the flock,<br/>
And the twitter of birds among the trees,<br/>
And felt the breath of the morning-breeze<br/>
Blowing over the meadows brown.<br/>
And one was safe and asleep in his bed<br/>
Who at the bridge would be first to fall,<br/>
Who that day would be lying dead,<br/>
Pierced by a British musket-ball.
</p>
<p>
You know the rest. In the books you have read<br/>
How the British regulars fired and fled,&mdash;<br/>
How the farmers gave them ball for ball,<br/>
From behind each fence and farmyard-wall,<br/>
Chasing the red-coats down the lane,<br/>
Then crossing the fields to emerge again<br/>
Under the trees at the turn of the road,<br/>
And only pausing to fire and load.
</p>
<p>
So through the night rode Paul Revere;<br/>
And so through the night went his cry of alarm<br/>
To every Middlesex village and farm,&mdash;<br/>
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,&mdash;<br/>
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,<br/>
And a word that shall echo forevermore!<br/>
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,<br/>
Through all our history, to the last,<br/>
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,<br/>
The people will waken and listen to hear<br/>
The hurrying hoof-beat of that steed,<br/>
And the midnight-message of Paul Revere.

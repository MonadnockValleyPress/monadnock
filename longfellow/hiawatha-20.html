<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XX. The Famine</h2>
<p>
Oh the long and dreary Winter!<br/>
Oh the cold and cruel Winter!<br/>
Ever thicker, thicker, thicker<br/>
Froze the ice on lake and river,<br/>
Ever deeper, deeper, deeper<br/>
Fell the snow o'er all the landscape,<br/>
Fell the covering snow, and drifted<br/>
Through the forest, round the village.<br/>
Hardly from his buried wigwam<br/>
Could the hunter force a passage;<br/>
With his mittens and his snow-shoes<br/>
Vainly walked he through the forest,<br/>
Sought for bird or beast and found none,<br/>
Saw no track of deer or rabbit,<br/>
In the snow beheld no footprints,<br/>
In the ghastly, gleaming forest<br/>
Fell, and could not rise from weakness,<br/>
Perished there from cold and hunger.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh the famine and the fever!<br/>
Oh the wasting of the famine!<br/>
Oh the blasting of the fever!<br/>
Oh the wailing of the children!<br/>
Oh the anguish of the women!<br/>
</p>
<p>
All the earth was sick and famished;<br/>
Hungry was the air around them,<br/>
Hungry was the sky above them,<br/>
And the hungry stars in heaven<br/>
Like the eyes of wolves glared at them!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Into Hiawatha's wigwam<br/>
Came two other guests, as silent<br/>
As the ghosts were, and as gloomy,<br/>
Waited not to be invited<br/>
Did not parley at the doorway<br/>
Sat there without word of welcome<br/>
In the seat of Laughing Water;<br/>
Looked with haggard eyes and hollow<br/>
At the face of Laughing Water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the foremost said: "Behold me!<br/>
I am Famine, Bukadawin!"<br/>
And the other said: "Behold me!<br/>
I am Fever, Ahkosewin!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the lovely Minnehaha<br/>
Shuddered as they looked upon her,<br/>
Shuddered at the words they uttered,<br/>
Lay down on her bed in silence,<br/>
Hid her face, but made no answer;<br/>
Lay there trembling, freezing, burning<br/>
At the looks they cast upon her,<br/>
At the fearful words they uttered.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Forth into the empty forest<br/>
Rushed the maddened Hiawatha;<br/>
In his heart was deadly sorrow,<br/>
In his face a stony firmness;<br/>
On his brow the sweat of anguish<br/>
Started, but it froze and fell not.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Wrapped in furs and armed for hunting,<br/>
With his mighty bow of ash-tree,<br/>
With his quiver full of arrows,<br/>
With his mittens, Minjekahwun,<br/>
Into the vast and vacant forest<br/>
On his snow-shoes strode he forward.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Gitche Manito, the Mighty!"<br/>
Cried he with his face uplifted<br/>
In that bitter hour of anguish,<br/>
"Give your children food, O father!<br/>
Give us food, or we must perish!<br/>
Give me food for Minnehaha,<br/>
For my dying Minnehaha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through the far-resounding forest,<br/>
Through the forest vast and vacant<br/>
Rang that cry of desolation,<br/>
But there came no other answer<br/>
Than the echo of his crying,<br/>
Than the echo of the woodlands,<br/>
"Minnehaha! Minnehaha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
All day long roved Hiawatha<br/>
In that melancholy forest,<br/>
Through the shadow of whose thickets,<br/>
In the pleasant days of Summer,<br/>
Of that ne'er forgotten Summer,<br/>
He had brought his young wife homeward<br/>
From the land of the Dacotahs;<br/>
When the birds sang in the thickets,<br/>
And the streamlets laughed and glistened,<br/>
And the air was full of fragrance,<br/>
And the lovely Laughing Water<br/>
Said with voice that did not tremble,<br/>
"I will follow you, my husband!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
In the wigwam with Nokomis,<br/>
With those gloomy guests that watched her,<br/>
With the Famine and the Fever,<br/>
She was lying, the Beloved,<br/>
She, the dying Minnehaha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hark!" she said; "I hear a rushing,<br/>
Hear a roaring and a rushing,<br/>
Hear the Falls of Minnehaha<br/>
Calling to me from a distance!"<br/>
"No, my child!" said old Nokomis,<br/>
"'T is the night-wind in the pine-trees!"<br/>
"Look!" she said; "I see my father<br/>
Standing lonely at his doorway,<br/>
Beckoning to me from his wigwam<br/>
In the land of the Dacotahs!"<br/>
"No, my child!" said old Nokomis.<br/>
"'T is the smoke, that waves and beckons!"<br/>
"Ah!" said she, "the eyes of Pauguk<br/>
Glare upon me in the darkness,<br/>
I can feel his icy fingers<br/>
Clasping mine amid the darkness!<br/>
Hiawatha! Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the desolate Hiawatha,<br/>
Far away amid the forest,<br/>
Miles away among the mountains,<br/>
Heard that sudden cry of anguish,<br/>
Heard the voice of Minnehaha<br/>
Calling to him in the darkness,<br/>
"Hiawatha! Hiawatha!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Over snow-fields waste and pathless,<br/>
Under snow-encumbered branches,<br/>
Homeward hurried Hiawatha,<br/>
Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,<br/>
Heard Nokomis moaning, wailing:<br/>
"Wahonowin! Wahonowin!<br/>
Would that I had perished for you,<br/>
Would that I were dead as you are!<br/>
Wahonowin! Wahonowin!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he rushed into the wigwam,<br/>
Saw the old Nokomis slowly<br/>
Rocking to and fro and moaning,<br/>
Saw his lovely Minnehaha<br/>
Lying dead and cold before him,<br/>
And his bursting heart within him<br/>
Uttered such a cry of anguish,<br/>
That the forest moaned and shuddered,<br/>
That the very stars in heaven<br/>
Shook and trembled with his anguish.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he sat down, still and speechless,<br/>
On the bed of Minnehaha,<br/>
At the feet of Laughing Water,<br/>
At those willing feet, that never<br/>
More would lightly run to meet him,<br/>
Never more would lightly follow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With both hands his face he covered,<br/>
Seven long days and nights he sat there,<br/>
As if in a swoon he sat there,<br/>
Speechless, motionless, unconscious<br/>
Of the daylight or the darkness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then they buried Minnehaha;<br/>
In the snow a grave they made her<br/>
In the forest deep and darksome<br/>
Underneath the moaning hemlocks;<br/>
Clothed her in her richest garments<br/>
Wrapped her in her robes of ermine,<br/>
Covered her with snow, like ermine;<br/>
Thus they buried Minnehaha.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And at night a fire was lighted,<br/>
On her grave four times was kindled,<br/>
For her soul upon its journey<br/>
To the Islands of the Blessed.<br/>
From his doorway Hiawatha<br/>
Saw it burning in the forest,<br/>
Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks;<br/>
From his sleepless bed uprising,<br/>
From the bed of Minnehaha,<br/>
Stood and watched it at the doorway,<br/>
That it might not be extinguished,<br/>
Might not leave her in the darkness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Farewell!" said he, "Minnehaha!<br/>
Farewell, O my Laughing Water!<br/>
All my heart is buried with you,<br/>
All my thoughts go onward with you!<br/>
Come not back again to labor,<br/>
Come not back again to suffer,<br/>
Where the Famine and the Fever<br/>
Wear the heart and waste the body.<br/>
Soon my task will be completed,<br/>
Soon your footsteps I shall follow<br/>
To the Islands of the Blessed,<br/>
To the Kingdom of Ponemah,<br/>
To the Land of the Hereafter!"<br/>

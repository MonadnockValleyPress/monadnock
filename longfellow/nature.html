<h1>Nature</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
As a fond mother, when the day is o'er,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leads by the hand her little child to bed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Half willing, half reluctant to be led,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave his broken playthings on the floor,<br/>
Still gazing at them through the open door,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor wholly reassured and comforted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By promises of others in their stead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, though more splendid, may not please him more;<br/>
So Nature deals with us, and takes away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our playthings one by one, and by the hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leads us to rest so gently, that we go<br/>
Scarce knowing if we wish to go or stay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being too full of sleep to understand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How far the unknown transcends the what we know.

<h1>My Lost Youth</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
Often I think of the beautiful town<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is seated by the sea;<br/>
Often in thought go up and down<br/>
The pleasant streets of that dear old town,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my youth comes back to me.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a verse of a Lapland song<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is haunting my memory still:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A boy's will is the wind's will,<br/>
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."
</p>
<p>
I can see the shadowy lines of its trees,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And catch, in sudden gleams,<br/>
The sheen of the far-surrounding seas,<br/>
And islands that were the Hesperides<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all my boyish dreams.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the burden of that old song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It murmurs and whispers still:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A boy's will is the wind's will,<br/>
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."
</p>
<p>
I remember the black wharves and the slips,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sea-tides tossing free;<br/>
And Spanish sailors with bearded lips,<br/>
And the beauty and mystery of the ships,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magic of the sea.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the voice of that wayward song<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is singing and saying still:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A boy's will is the wind's will,<br/>
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."
</p>
<p>
I remember the bulwarks by the shore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fort upon the hill;<br/>
The sunrise gun, with its hollow roar,<br/>
The drum-beat repeated o'er and o'er,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bugle wild and shrill.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the music of that old song<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throbs in my memory still:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A boy's will is the wind's will,<br/>
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."
</p>
<p>
I remember the sea-fight far away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How it thundered o'er the tide!<br/>
And the dead captains, as they lay<br/>
In their graves, o'erlooking the tranquil bay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they in battle died.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sound of that mournful song<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes through me with a thrill:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A boy's will is the wind's will,<br/>
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."
</p>
<p>
I can see the breezy dome of groves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows of Deering's Woods;<br/>
And the friendships old and the early loves<br/>
Come back with a sabbath sound, as of doves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In quiet neighborhoods.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the verse of that sweet old song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It flutters and murmurs still:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A boy's will is the wind's will,<br/>
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."
</p>
<p>
I remember the gleams and glooms that dart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the schoolboy's brain;<br/>
The song and the silence in the heart,<br/>
That in part are prophecies, and in part<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are longings wild and vain.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the voice of that fitful song<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sings on, and is never still:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A boy's will is the wind's will,<br/>
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."
</p>
<p>
There are things of which I may not speak;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dreams that cannot die;<br/>
There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak,<br/>
And bring a pallor into the cheek,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a mist before the eye.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the words of that fatal song<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come over me like a chill:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A boy's will is the wind's will,<br/>
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."
</p>
<p>
Strange to me now are the forms I meet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When I visit the dear old town;<br/>
But the native air is pure and sweet,<br/>
And the trees that o'ershadow each well-known street,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As they balance up and down,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are singing the beautiful song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are sighing and whispering still:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A boy's will is the wind's will,<br/>
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."
</p>
<p>
And Deering's Woods are fresh and fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with joy that is almost pain<br/>
My heart goes back to wander there,<br/>
And among the dreams of the days that were,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I find my lost youth again.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strange and beautiful song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groves are repeating it still:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A boy's will is the wind's will,<br/>
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."

<h1>Divina Commedia</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Oft have I seen at some cathedral door<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor<br/>
Kneel to repeat his paternoster o'er;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off the noises of the world retreat;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud vociferations of the street<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Become an undistinguishable roar.<br/>
So, as I enter here from day to day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave my burden at this minster gate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,<br/>
The tumult of the time disconsolate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To inarticulate murmurs dies away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While the eternal ages watch and wait.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This crowd of statues, in whose folded sleeves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers,<br/>
And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers!<br/>
Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What exultations trampling on despair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,<br/>
What passionate outcry of a soul in pain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprose this poem of the earth and air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This medieval miracle of song!
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
I enter, and I see thee in the gloom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the long aisles, O poet saturnine!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is filled with some unknown perfume;<br/>
The congregation of the dead make room<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like rooks that haunt Ravenna's groves of pine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb.<br/>
From the confessionals I hear arise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lamentations from the crypts below;<br/>
And then a voice celestial, that begins<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the pathetic words, "Although your sins<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As scarlet be," and ends with "as the snow."
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
With snow-white veil and garments as of flame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She stands before thee, who so long ago<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From which thy song and all its splendors came;<br/>
And while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice about thy heart melts as the snow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On mountain height; and in swift overflow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame.<br/>
Thou makest full confession; and a gleam,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the dawn on some dark forest cast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase;<br/>
Lethe and Eunoe&mdash;the remembered dream<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the forgotten sorrow&mdash;bring at last<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That perfect pardon which is perfect peace.
</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>
I lift mine eyes, and all the windows blaze<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With forms of saints and holy men who died,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here martyred and hereafter glorified;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great Rose upon its leaves displays<br/>
Christ's Triumph, and the angelic roundelays,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With splendor upon splendor multiplied;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Beatrice again at Dante's side<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No more rebukes, but smiles her words of praise.<br/>
And then the organ sounds, and unseen choirs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing the old Latin hymns of peace and love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And benedictions of the Holy Ghost;<br/>
And the melodious bells among the spires<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er all the house-tops and through heaven above<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Proclaim the elevation of the Host!
</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>
O star of morning and of liberty!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O bringer of the light, whose splendor shines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the darkness of the Apennines,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forerunner of the day that is to be!<br/>
The voices of the city and the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices of the mountains and the pines,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat thy song, till the familiar lines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are footpaths for the thought of Italy!<br/>
Thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the nations, and a sound is heard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As of a mighty wind, and men devout,<br/>
Strangers of Rome, and the new proselytes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In their own language hear thy wondrous word,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And many are amazed and many doubt.

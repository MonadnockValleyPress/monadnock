<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>XI. Hiawatha's Wedding-Feast</h2>
<p>
You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
How the handsome Yenadizze<br/>
Danced at Hiawatha's wedding;<br/>
How the gentle Chibiabos,<br/>
He the sweetest of musicians,<br/>
Sang his songs of love and longing;<br/>
How Iagoo, the great boaster,<br/>
He the marvellous story-teller,<br/>
Told his tales of strange adventure,<br/>
That the feast might be more joyous,<br/>
That the time might pass more gayly,<br/>
And the guests be more contented.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sumptuous was the feast Nokomis<br/>
Made at Hiawatha's wedding;<br/>
All the bowls were made of bass-wood,<br/>
White and polished very smoothly,<br/>
All the spoons of horn of bison,<br/>
Black and polished very smoothly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She had sent through all the village<br/>
Messengers with wands of willow,<br/>
As a sign of invitation,<br/>
As a token of the feasting;<br/>
And the wedding guests assembled,<br/>
Clad in all their richest raiment,<br/>
Robes of fur and belts of wampum,<br/>
Splendid with their paint and plumage,<br/>
Beautiful with beads and tassels.<br/>
</p>
<p>
First they ate the sturgeon, Nahma,<br/>
And the pike, the Maskenozha,<br/>
Caught and cooked by old Nokomis;<br/>
Then on pemican they feasted,<br/>
Pemican and buffalo marrow,<br/>
Haunch of deer and hump of bison,<br/>
Yellow cakes of the Mondamin,<br/>
And the wild rice of the river.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But the gracious Hiawatha,<br/>
And the lovely Laughing Water,<br/>
And the careful old Nokomis,<br/>
Tasted not the food before them,<br/>
Only waited on the others<br/>
Only served their guests in silence.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And when all the guests had finished,<br/>
Old Nokomis, brisk and busy,<br/>
From an ample pouch of otter,<br/>
Filled the red-stone pipes for smoking<br/>
With tobacco from the South-land,<br/>
Mixed with bark of the red willow,<br/>
And with herbs and leaves of fragrance.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then she said, "O Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
Dance for us your merry dances,<br/>
Dance the Beggar's Dance to please us,<br/>
That the feast may be more joyous,<br/>
That the time may pass more gayly,<br/>
And our guests be more contented!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
He the idle Yenadizze,<br/>
He the merry mischief-maker,<br/>
Whom the people called the Storm-Fool,<br/>
Rose among the guests assembled.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Skilled was he in sports and pastimes,<br/>
In the merry dance of snow-shoes,<br/>
In the play of quoits and ball-play;<br/>
Skilled was he in games of hazard,<br/>
In all games of skill and hazard,<br/>
Pugasaing, the Bowl and Counters,<br/>
Kuntassoo, the Game of Plum-stones.<br/>
Though the warriors called him Faint-Heart,<br/>
Called him coward, Shaugodaya,<br/>
Idler, gambler, Yenadizze,<br/>
Little heeded he their jesting,<br/>
Little cared he for their insults,<br/>
For the women and the maidens<br/>
Loved the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He was dressed in shirt of doeskin,<br/>
White and soft, and fringed with ermine,<br/>
All inwrought with beads of wampum;<br/>
He was dressed in deer-skin leggings,<br/>
Fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine,<br/>
And in moccasins of buck-skin,<br/>
Thick with quills and beads embroidered.<br/>
On his head were plumes of swan's down,<br/>
On his heels were tails of foxes,<br/>
In one hand a fan of feathers,<br/>
And a pipe was in the other.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Barred with streaks of red and yellow,<br/>
Streaks of blue and bright vermilion,<br/>
Shone the face of Pau-Puk-Keewis.<br/>
From his forehead fell his tresses,<br/>
Smooth, and parted like a woman's,<br/>
Shining bright with oil, and plaited,<br/>
Hung with braids of scented grasses,<br/>
As among the guests assembled,<br/>
To the sound of flutes and singing,<br/>
To the sound of drums and voices,<br/>
Rose the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis,<br/>
And began his mystic dances.<br/>
</p>
<p>
First he danced a solemn measure,<br/>
Very slow in step and gesture,<br/>
In and out among the pine-trees,<br/>
Through the shadows and the sunshine,<br/>
Treading softly like a panther.<br/>
Then more swiftly and still swifter,<br/>
Whirling, spinning round in circles,<br/>
Leaping o'er the guests assembled,<br/>
Eddying round and round the wigwam,<br/>
Till the leaves went whirling with him,<br/>
Till the dust and wind together<br/>
Swept in eddies round about him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then along the sandy margin<br/>
Of the lake, the Big-Sea-Water,<br/>
On he sped with frenzied gestures,<br/>
Stamped upon the sand, and tossed it<br/>
Wildly in the air around him;<br/>
Till the wind became a whirlwind,<br/>
Till the sand was blown and sifted<br/>
Like great snowdrifts o'er the landscape,<br/>
Heaping all the shores with Sand Dunes,<br/>
Sand Hills of the Nagow Wudjoo!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus the merry Pau-Puk-Keewis<br/>
Danced his Beggar's Dance to please them,<br/>
And, returning, sat down laughing<br/>
There among the guests assembled,<br/>
Sat and fanned himself serenely<br/>
With his fan of turkey-feathers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then they said to Chibiabos,<br/>
To the friend of Hiawatha,<br/>
To the sweetest of all singers,<br/>
To the best of all musicians,<br/>
"Sing to us, O Chibiabos!<br/>
Songs of love and songs of longing,<br/>
That the feast may be more joyous,<br/>
That the time may pass more gayly,<br/>
And our guests be more contented!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the gentle Chibiabos<br/>
Sang in accents sweet and tender,<br/>
Sang in tones of deep emotion,<br/>
Songs of love and songs of longing;<br/>
Looking still at Hiawatha,<br/>
Looking at fair Laughing Water,<br/>
Sang he softly, sang in this wise:<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Onaway! Awake, beloved!<br/>
Thou the wild-flower of the forest!<br/>
Thou the wild-bird of the prairie!<br/>
Thou with eyes so soft and fawn-like!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"If thou only lookest at me,<br/>
I am happy, I am happy,<br/>
As the lilies of the prairie,<br/>
When they feel the dew upon them!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Sweet thy breath is as the fragrance<br/>
Of the wild-flowers in the morning,<br/>
As their fragrance is at evening,<br/>
In the Moon when leaves are falling.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Does not all the blood within me<br/>
Leap to meet thee, leap to meet thee,<br/>
As the springs to meet the sunshine,<br/>
In the Moon when nights are brightest?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Onaway! my heart sings to thee,<br/>
Sings with joy when thou art near me,<br/>
As the sighing, singing branches<br/>
In the pleasant Moon of Strawberries!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"When thou art not pleased, beloved,<br/>
Then my heart is sad and darkened,<br/>
As the shining river darkens<br/>
When the clouds drop shadows on it!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"When thou smilest, my beloved,<br/>
Then my troubled heart is brightened,<br/>
As in sunshine gleam the ripples<br/>
That the cold wind makes in rivers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Smiles the earth, and smile the waters,<br/>
Smile the cloudless skies above us,<br/>
But I lose the way of smiling<br/>
When thou art no longer near me!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I myself, myself! behold me!<br/>
Blood of my beating heart, behold me!<br/>
Oh awake, awake, beloved!<br/>
Onaway! awake, beloved!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus the gentle Chibiabos<br/>
Sang his song of love and longing;<br/>
And Iagoo, the great boaster,<br/>
He the marvellous story-teller,<br/>
He the friend of old Nokomis,<br/>
Jealous of the sweet musician,<br/>
Jealous of the applause they gave him,<br/>
Saw in all the eyes around him,<br/>
Saw in all their looks and gestures,<br/>
That the wedding guests assembled<br/>
Longed to hear his pleasant stories,<br/>
His immeasurable falsehoods.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Very boastful was Iagoo;<br/>
Never heard he an adventure<br/>
But himself had met a greater;<br/>
Never any deed of daring<br/>
But himself had done a bolder;<br/>
Never any marvellous story<br/>
But himself could tell a stranger.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Would you listen to his boasting,<br/>
Would you only give him credence,<br/>
No one ever shot an arrow<br/>
Half so far and high as he had;<br/>
Ever caught so many fishes,<br/>
Ever killed so many reindeer,<br/>
Ever trapped so many beaver!<br/>
</p>
<p>
None could run so fast as he could,<br/>
None could dive so deep as he could,<br/>
None could swim so far as he could;<br/>
None had made so many journeys,<br/>
None had seen so many wonders,<br/>
As this wonderful Iagoo,<br/>
As this marvellous story-teller!<br/>
Thus his name became a by-word<br/>
And a jest among the people;<br/>
And whene'er a boastful hunter<br/>
Praised his own address too highly,<br/>
Or a warrior, home returning,<br/>
Talked too much of his achievements,<br/>
All his hearers cried, "Iagoo!<br/>
Here's Iagoo come among us!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He it was who carved the cradle<br/>
Of the little Hiawatha,<br/>
Carved its framework out of linden,<br/>
Bound it strong with reindeer sinews;<br/>
He it was who taught him later<br/>
How to make his bows and arrows,<br/>
How to make the bows of ash-tree,<br/>
And the arrows of the oak-tree.<br/>
So among the guests assembled<br/>
At my Hiawatha's wedding<br/>
Sat Iagoo, old and ugly,<br/>
Sat the marvellous story-teller.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And they said, "O good Iagoo,<br/>
Tell us now a tale of wonder,<br/>
Tell us of some strange adventure,<br/>
That the feast may be more joyous,<br/>
That the time may pass more gayly,<br/>
And our guests be more contented!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And Iagoo answered straightway,<br/>
"You shall hear a tale of wonder,<br/>
You shall hear the strange adventures<br/>
Of Osseo, the Magician,<br/>
From the Evening Star descending."<br/>

<h1>The Song of Hiawatha</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>IV. Hiawatha and Mudjekeewis</h2>
<p>
Out of childhood into manhood<br/>
Now had grown my Hiawatha,<br/>
Skilled in all the craft of hunters,<br/>
Learned in all the lore of old men,<br/>
In all youthful sports and pastimes,<br/>
In all manly arts and labors.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift of foot was Hiawatha;<br/>
He could shoot an arrow from him,<br/>
And run forward with such fleetness,<br/>
That the arrow fell behind him!<br/>
Strong of arm was Hiawatha;<br/>
He could shoot ten arrows upward,<br/>
Shoot them with such strength and swiftness,<br/>
That the tenth had left the bow-string<br/>
Ere the first to earth had fallen!<br/>
</p>
<p>
He had mittens, Minjekahwun,<br/>
Magic mittens made of deer-skin;<br/>
When upon his hands he wore them,<br/>
He could smite the rocks asunder,<br/>
He could grind them into powder.<br/>
He had moccasins enchanted,<br/>
Magic moccasins of deer-skin;<br/>
When he bound them round his ankles,<br/>
When upon his feet he tied them,<br/>
At each stride a mile he measured!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Much he questioned old Nokomis<br/>
Of his father Mudjekeewis;<br/>
Learned from her the fatal secret<br/>
Of the beauty of his mother,<br/>
Of the falsehood of his father;<br/>
And his heart was hot within him,<br/>
Like a living coal his heart was.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he said to old Nokomis,<br/>
"I will go to Mudjekeewis,<br/>
See how fares it with my father,<br/>
At the doorways of the West-Wind,<br/>
At the portals of the Sunset!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
From his lodge went Hiawatha,<br/>
Dressed for travel, armed for hunting;<br/>
Dressed in deer-skin shirt and leggings,<br/>
Richly wrought with quills and wampum;<br/>
On his head his eagle-feathers,<br/>
Round his waist his belt of wampum,<br/>
In his hand his bow of ash-wood,<br/>
Strung with sinews of the reindeer;<br/>
In his quiver oaken arrows,<br/>
Tipped with jasper, winged with feathers;<br/>
With his mittens, Minjekahwun,<br/>
With his moccasins enchanted.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Warning said the old Nokomis,<br/>
"Go not forth, O Hiawatha!<br/>
To the kingdom of the West-Wind,<br/>
To the realms of Mudjekeewis,<br/>
Lest he harm you with his magic,<br/>
Lest he kill you with his cunning!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
But the fearless Hiawatha<br/>
Heeded not her woman's warning;<br/>
Forth he strode into the forest,<br/>
At each stride a mile he measured;<br/>
Lurid seemed the sky above him,<br/>
Lurid seemed the earth beneath him,<br/>
Hot and close the air around him,<br/>
Filled with smoke and fiery vapors,<br/>
As of burning woods and prairies,<br/>
For his heart was hot within him,<br/>
Like a living coal his heart was.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So he journeyed westward, westward,<br/>
Left the fleetest deer behind him,<br/>
Left the antelope and bison;<br/>
Crossed the rushing Esconaba,<br/>
Crossed the mighty Mississippi,<br/>
Passed the Mountains of the Prairie,<br/>
Passed the land of Crows and Foxes,<br/>
Passed the dwellings of the Blackfeet,<br/>
Came unto the Rocky Mountains,<br/>
To the kingdom of the West-Wind,<br/>
Where upon the gusty summits<br/>
Sat the ancient Mudjekeewis,<br/>
Ruler of the winds of heaven.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Filled with awe was Hiawatha<br/>
At the aspect of his father.<br/>
On the air about him wildly<br/>
Tossed and streamed his cloudy tresses,<br/>
Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses,<br/>
Glared like Ishkoodah, the comet,<br/>
Like the star with fiery tresses.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Filled with joy was Mudjekeewis<br/>
When he looked on Hiawatha,<br/>
Saw his youth rise up before him<br/>
In the face of Hiawatha,<br/>
Saw the beauty of Wenonah<br/>
From the grave rise up before him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Welcome!" said he, "Hiawatha,<br/>
To the kingdom of the West-Wind<br/>
Long have I been waiting for you<br/>
Youth is lovely, age is lonely,<br/>
Youth is fiery, age is frosty;<br/>
You bring back the days departed,<br/>
You bring back my youth of passion,<br/>
And the beautiful Wenonah!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Many days they talked together,<br/>
Questioned, listened, waited, answered;<br/>
Much the mighty Mudjekeewis<br/>
Boasted of his ancient prowess,<br/>
Of his perilous adventures,<br/>
His indomitable courage,<br/>
His invulnerable body.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Patiently sat Hiawatha,<br/>
Listening to his father's boasting;<br/>
With a smile he sat and listened,<br/>
Uttered neither threat nor menace,<br/>
Neither word nor look betrayed him,<br/>
But his heart was hot within him,<br/>
Like a living coal his heart was.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then he said, "O Mudjekeewis,<br/>
Is there nothing that can harm you?<br/>
Nothing that you are afraid of?"<br/>
And the mighty Mudjekeewis,<br/>
Grand and gracious in his boasting,<br/>
Answered, saying, "There is nothing,<br/>
Nothing but the black rock yonder,<br/>
Nothing but the fatal Wawbeek!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he looked at Hiawatha<br/>
With a wise look and benignant,<br/>
With a countenance paternal,<br/>
Looked with pride upon the beauty<br/>
Of his tall and graceful figure,<br/>
Saying, "O my Hiawatha!<br/>
Is there anything can harm you?<br/>
Anything you are afraid of?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
But the wary Hiawatha<br/>
Paused awhile, as if uncertain,<br/>
Held his peace, as if resolving,<br/>
And then answered, "There is nothing,<br/>
Nothing but the bulrush yonder,<br/>
Nothing but the great Apukwa!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
And as Mudjekeewis, rising,<br/>
Stretched his hand to pluck the bulrush,<br/>
Hiawatha cried in terror,<br/>
Cried in well-dissembled terror,<br/>
"Kago! kago! do not touch it!"<br/>
"Ah, kaween!" said Mudjekeewis,<br/>
"No indeed, I will not touch it!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then they talked of other matters;<br/>
First of Hiawatha's brothers,<br/>
First of Wabun, of the East-Wind,<br/>
Of the South-Wind, Shawondasee,<br/>
Of the North, Kabibonokka;<br/>
Then of Hiawatha's mother,<br/>
Of the beautiful Wenonah,<br/>
Of her birth upon the meadow,<br/>
Of her death, as old Nokomis<br/>
Had remembered and related.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And he cried, "O Mudjekeewis,<br/>
It was you who killed Wenonah,<br/>
Took her young life and her beauty,<br/>
Broke the Lily of the Prairie,<br/>
Trampled it beneath your footsteps;<br/>
You confess it! you confess it!"<br/>
And the mighty Mudjekeewis<br/>
Tossed upon the wind his tresses,<br/>
Bowed his hoary head in anguish,<br/>
With a silent nod assented.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then up started Hiawatha,<br/>
And with threatening look and gesture<br/>
Laid his hand upon the black rock,<br/>
On the fatal Wawbeek laid it,<br/>
With his mittens, Minjekahwun,<br/>
Rent the jutting crag asunder,<br/>
Smote and crushed it into fragments,<br/>
Hurled them madly at his father,<br/>
The remorseful Mudjekeewis,<br/>
For his heart was hot within him,<br/>
Like a living coal his heart was.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But the ruler of the West-Wind<br/>
Blew the fragments backward from him,<br/>
With the breathing of his nostrils,<br/>
With the tempest of his anger,<br/>
Blew them back at his assailant;<br/>
Seized the bulrush, the Apukwa,<br/>
Dragged it with its roots and fibres<br/>
From the margin of the meadow,<br/>
From its ooze the giant bulrush;<br/>
Long and loud laughed Hiawatha!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then began the deadly conflict,<br/>
Hand to hand among the mountains;<br/>
From his eyry screamed the eagle,<br/>
The Keneu, the great war-eagle,<br/>
Sat upon the crags around them,<br/>
Wheeling flapped his wings above them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Like a tall tree in the tempest<br/>
Bent and lashed the giant bulrush;<br/>
And in masses huge and heavy<br/>
Crashing fell the fatal Wawbeek;<br/>
Till the earth shook with the tumult<br/>
And confusion of the battle,<br/>
And the air was full of shoutings,<br/>
And the thunder of the mountains,<br/>
Starting, answered, "Baim-wawa!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Back retreated Mudjekeewis,<br/>
Rushing westward o'er the mountains,<br/>
Stumbling westward down the mountains,<br/>
Three whole days retreated fighting,<br/>
Still pursued by Hiawatha<br/>
To the doorways of the West-Wind,<br/>
To the portals of the Sunset,<br/>
To the earth's remotest border,<br/>
Where into the empty spaces<br/>
Sinks the sun, as a flamingo<br/>
Drops into her nest at nightfall<br/>
In the melancholy marshes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hold!" at length cried Mudjekeewis,<br/>
"Hold, my son, my Hiawatha!<br/>
'T is impossible to kill me,<br/>
For you cannot kill the immortal<br/>
I have put you to this trial,<br/>
But to know and prove your courage;<br/>
Now receive the prize of valor!<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Go back to your home and people,<br/>
Live among them, toil among them,<br/>
Cleanse the earth from all that harms it,<br/>
Clear the fishing-grounds and rivers,<br/>
Slay all monsters and magicians,<br/>
All the Wendigoes, the giants,<br/>
All the serpents, the Kenabeeks,<br/>
As I slew the Mishe-Mokwa,<br/>
Slew the Great Bear of the mountains.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And at last when Death draws near you,<br/>
When the awful eyes of Pauguk<br/>
Glare upon you in the darkness,<br/>
I will share my kingdom with you,<br/>
Ruler shall you be thenceforward<br/>
Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,<br/>
Of the home-wind, the Keewaydin."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus was fought that famous battle<br/>
In the dreadful days of Shah-shah,<br/>
In the days long since departed,<br/>
In the kingdom of the West-Wind.<br/>
Still the hunter sees its traces<br/>
Scattered far o'er hill and valley;<br/>
Sees the giant bulrush growing<br/>
By the ponds and water-courses,<br/>
Sees the masses of the Wawbeek<br/>
Lying still in every valley.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Homeward now went Hiawatha;<br/>
Pleasant was the landscape round him,<br/>
Pleasant was the air above him,<br/>
For the bitterness of anger<br/>
Had departed wholly from him,<br/>
From his brain the thought of vengeance,<br/>
From his heart the burning fever.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Only once his pace he slackened,<br/>
Only once he paused or halted,<br/>
Paused to purchase heads of arrows<br/>
Of the ancient Arrow-maker,<br/>
In the land of the Dacotahs,<br/>
Where the Falls of Minnehaha<br/>
Flash and gleam among the oak-trees,<br/>
Laugh and leap into the valley.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There the ancient Arrow-maker<br/>
Made his arrow-heads of sandstone,<br/>
Arrow-heads of chalcedony,<br/>
Arrow-heads of flint and jasper,<br/>
Smoothed and sharpened at the edges,<br/>
Hard and polished, keen and costly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With him dwelt his dark-eyed daughter,<br/>
Wayward as the Minnehaha,<br/>
With her moods of shade and sunshine,<br/>
Eyes that smiled and frowned alternate,<br/>
Feet as rapid as the river,<br/>
Tresses flowing like the water,<br/>
And as musical a laughter:<br/>
And he named her from the river,<br/>
From the water-fall he named her,<br/>
Minnehaha, Laughing Water.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Was it then for heads of arrows,<br/>
Arrow-heads of chalcedony,<br/>
Arrow-heads of flint and jasper,<br/>
That my Hiawatha halted<br/>
In the land of the Dacotahs?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Was it not to see the maiden,<br/>
See the face of Laughing Water<br/>
Peeping from behind the curtain,<br/>
Hear the rustling of her garments<br/>
From behind the waving curtain,<br/>
As one sees the Minnehaha<br/>
Gleaming, glancing through the branches,<br/>
As one hears the Laughing Water<br/>
From behind its screen of branches?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Who shall say what thoughts and visions<br/>
Fill the fiery brains of young men?<br/>
Who shall say what dreams of beauty<br/>
Filled the heart of Hiawatha?<br/>
All he told to old Nokomis,<br/>
When he reached the lodge at sunset,<br/>
Was the meeting with his father,<br/>
Was his fight with Mudjekeewis;<br/>
Not a word he said of arrows,<br/>
Not a word of Laughing Water.<br/>

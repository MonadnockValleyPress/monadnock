<h1>The Bells of San Blas</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
What say the Bells of San Blas<br/>
To the ships that southward pass<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the harbor of Mazatlan?<br/>
To them it is nothing more<br/>
Than the sound of surf on the shore,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing more to master or man.
</p>
<p>
But to me, a dreamer of dreams,<br/>
To whom what is and what seems<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are often one and the same,&mdash;<br/>
The Bells of San Blas to me<br/>
Have a strange, wild melody,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And are something more than a name.
</p>
<p>
For bells are the voice of the church;<br/>
They have tones that touch and search<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearts of young and old;<br/>
One sound to all, yet each<br/>
Lends a meaning to their speech,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the meaning is manifold.
</p>
<p>
They are a voice of the Past,<br/>
Of an age that is fading fast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a power austere and grand,<br/>
When the flag of Spain unfurled<br/>
Its folds o'er this western world,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Priest was lord of the land.
</p>
<p>
The chapel that once looked down<br/>
On the little seaport town<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has crumbled into the dust;<br/>
And on oaken beams below<br/>
The bells swing to and fro,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And are green with mould and rust.
</p>
<p>
"Is, then, the old faith dead,"<br/>
They say, "and in its stead<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is some new faith proclaimed,<br/>
That we are forced to remain<br/>
Naked to sun and rain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsheltered and ashamed?
</p>
<p>
"Once, in our tower aloof,<br/>
We rang over wall and roof<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our warnings and our complaints;<br/>
And round about us there<br/>
The white doves filled the air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the white souls of the saints.
</p>
<p>
"The saints!  Ah, have they grown<br/>
Forgetful of their own?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they asleep, or dead,<br/>
That open to the sky<br/>
Their ruined Missions lie,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer tenanted?
</p>
<p>
"Oh, bring us back once more<br/>
The vanished days of yore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the world with faith was filled;<br/>
Bring back the fervid zeal,<br/>
The hearts of fire and steel,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands that believe and build.
</p>
<p>
"Then from our tower again<br/>
We will send over land and main<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our voices of command,<br/>
Like exiled kings who return<br/>
To their thrones, and the people learn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Priest is lord of the land!"
</p>
<p>
O Bells of San Blas in vain<br/>
Ye call back the Past again;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Past is deaf to your prayer!<br/>
Out of the shadows of night<br/>
The world rolls into light;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is daybreak everywhere.

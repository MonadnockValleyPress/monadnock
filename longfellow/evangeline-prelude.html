<h1>Evangeline</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<h2>Prelude</h2>
<p>
This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,<br/>
Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,<br/>
Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,<br/>
Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.<br/>
Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced neighboring ocean<br/>
Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This is the forest primeval; but where are the hearts that beneath it<br/>
Leaped like the roe, when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman?<br/>
Where is the thatch-roofed village, the home of Acadian farmers&mdash;<br/>
Men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,<br/>
Darkened by shadows of earth, but reflecting an image of heaven?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Waste are those pleasant farms, and the farmers forever departed!<br/>
Scattered like dust and leaves, when the mighty blasts of October<br/>
Seize them, and whirl them aloft, and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean.<br/>
Naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of Grand-Pre.<br/>
Ye who believe in affection that hopes, and endures, and is patient,<br/>
Ye who believe in the beauty and strength of woman's devotion.<br/>
List to the mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the forest;<br/>
List to a Tale of Love in Acadie, home of the happy.<br/>

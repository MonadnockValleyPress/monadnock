<h1>The Village Blacksmith</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
Under a spreading chestnut-tree<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The village smithy stands;<br/>
The smith, a mighty man is he,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With large and sinewy hands;<br/>
And the muscles of his brawny arms<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are strong as iron bands.
</p>
<p>
His hair is crisp, and black, and long,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is like the tan;<br/>
His brow is wet with honest sweat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He earns whate'er he can,<br/>
And looks the whole world in the face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he owes not any man.
</p>
<p>
Week in, week out, from morn till night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can hear his bellows blow;<br/>
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With measured beat and slow,<br/>
Like a sexton ringing the village bell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the evening sun is low.
</p>
<p>
And children coming home from school<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look in at the open door;<br/>
They love to see the flaming forge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bear the bellows roar,<br/>
And catch the burning sparks that fly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like chaff from a threshing-floor.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He goes on Sunday to the church,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sits among his boys;<br/>
He hears the parson pray and preach,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He hears his daughter's voice,<br/>
Singing in the village choir,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And it makes his heart rejoice.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It sounds to him like her mother's voice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing in Paradise!<br/>
He needs must think of her once more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How in the grave she lies;<br/>
And with his hard, rough hand he wipes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A tear out of his eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Toiling,&mdash;rejoicing,&mdash;sorrowing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward through life he goes;<br/>
Each morning sees some task begin,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each evening sees it close<br/>
Something attempted, something done,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has earned a night's repose.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,<br/>
For the lesson thou hast taught!<br/>
Thus at the flaming forge of life<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fortunes must be wrought;<br/>
Thus on its sounding anvil shaped<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each burning deed and thought.<br/>
</p>

<h1>The Rainy Day</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
The day is cold, and dark, and dreary<br/>
It rains, and the wind is never weary;<br/>
The vine still clings to the mouldering wall,<br/>
But at every gust the dead leaves fall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the day is dark and dreary.
</p>
<p>
My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;<br/>
It rains, and the wind is never weary;<br/>
My thoughts still cling to the mouldering Past,<br/>
But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the days are dark and dreary.
</p>
<p>
Be still, sad heart! and cease repining;<br/>
Behind the clouds is the sun still shining;<br/>
Thy fate is the common fate of all,<br/>
Into each life some rain must fall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some days must be dark and dreary.
</p>

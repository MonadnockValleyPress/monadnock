<h1>Keats</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
The young Endymion sleeps Endymion's sleep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The shepherd-boy whose tale was left half told!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The solemn grove uplifts its shield of gold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the red rising moon, and loud and deep<br/>
The nightingale is singing from the steep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is midsummer, but the air is cold;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it be death?  Alas, beside the fold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A shepherd's pipe lies shattered near his sheep.<br/>
Lo! in the moonlight gleams a marble white,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On which I read: "Here lieth one whose name<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was writ in water."  And was this the meed<br/>
Of his sweet singing?  Rather let me write:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The smoking flax before it burst to flame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was quenched by death, and broken the bruis√®d reed."

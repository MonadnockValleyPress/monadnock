<h1>The Arrow and the Song</h1>
<h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h2>
<p>
I shot an arrow into the air,<br/>
It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br/>
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight<br/>
Could not follow it in its flight.
</p>
<p>
I breathed a song into the air,<br/>
It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br/>
For who has sight so keen and strong,<br/>
That it can follow the flight of song?
</p>
<p>
Long, long afterward, in an oak<br/>
I found the arrow, still unbroke;<br/>
And the song, from beginning to end,<br/>
I found again in the heart of a friend.

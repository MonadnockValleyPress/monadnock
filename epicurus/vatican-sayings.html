<h4>Translator's Notes</h4>

<p id='n0'>[0] The English translation is provided under <a href='http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/'>Creative Commons CC0</a> (for details, refer to the <a href='#pubnote'>Publisher's Note</a>). The Greek text is in the <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/'>public domain</a>. The text provided here generally follows that of Hermann Usener as published in his <cite>Epicurea</cite> (1887), with some attention paid to the texts of G. Arrighetti as published in <cite>Epicuro Opere</cite> (Torino: Giulio Einaudi Editore, 1960) and of A.A. Long and D.N. Sedley as published in Volume 2 of <cite>The Hellenistic Philosophers</cite> (Cambridge University Press, 1987). [<a href='#a0'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n4'>[4] This idea is also expressed at <a href='letter.html#p133'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 133</a>. [<a href='#a4'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n9'>[9] The word ἀνάγκη is translated here as "compulsion", not "necessity"; it shares the same root ("force", "constraint") with the word that Epicurus uses for "the necessary desires" (see for instance <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a29'>Principal Doctrine #29</a> and <a href='#a21'>Vatican Saying #21</a>), but it seems to be used here in the negative sense of an external force as opposed to the inborn desires for the things that are necessary for happiness, physical health, or life itself (see <a href='letter.html#p127'>Letter to Menoeceus 127</a>). [<a href='#a9'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n14'>[14] The point about not controlling tomorrow is discussed in greater detail at <a href='letter.html#p133'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 133</a>. The word ἀσχολούμενος is often translated as "being without leisure"; however, it also means not having time <em>for</em> something, and here that "something" seems to be life itself. [<a href='#a14'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n16'>[16] The underyling imagery here derives from hunting: the soul is lured (δελεασθεὶς from δέλεαρ "bait") and trapped (ἐθηρεύθη, a passive form of θηρεύω "to hunt") into doing what is bad. [<a href='#a16'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n21'>[21] Elsewhere, Epicurus contrasts the natural and necessary desires with the unnecessary desires, not the harmful desires, although he often points out that the unnecessary desires tend to cause harm; see for example <a href='letter.html#p127'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 127</a> and Principal Doctrines <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a26'>#26</a> and <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a30'>#30</a>. [<a href='#a21'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n23'>[23] Here I follow Long and Sedley in using the received text (ἀρετή = excellence or virtue) rather than Usener's widely-adopted emendation (αἱρετή = choiceworthy). The standard objection to ἀρετή is that it makes little sense to call every friendship a virtue. However, I think that "excellence" does greater justice to the pagan meaning of ἀρετή than does the Victorian-sounding "virtue", and that "every friendship is an excellence in itself" is not far-fetched in the context of ancient Greek ethics, despite the fact that it might strike us moderns as a bit strange (see also <a href='letter.html#p132'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 132</a>). The Greek word ὠφελεία means literally advantage or aid or help, not mutual advantage; however, I think the concept of mutuality is implied by other statements that Epicurus makes about friendship, such as Principal Doctrines <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a31'>#31</a>, <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a32'>#32</a>, <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a33'>#33</a>, <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a37'>#37</a>, <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a38'>#38</a>, and <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a39'>#39</a>. [<a href='#a23'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n28'>[28] I have translated τοὺς προχείρους ("those who are ready", here in the sense of "over-ready") as "those who grasp after" because χείρ is the word for hand. There is also a play on words in the second clause, where χάρις (grace, fortune, pleasure) is used in the sense of "delight" and in the sense of "for the sake of"; to preserve the pun, I have translated both instances using the word "pleasure". I take the meaning as related to an idea from <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a8'>Principal Doctrine #8</a>: we must pay for the long-term pleasures of friendship by venturing the possibility of some short-term pain ("risking some pleasure"); see also <a href='letter.html#p129'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 129</a> and <a href='#a73'>Vatican Saying #73</a>. This is enlightened hedonism at its most social, if you will. [<a href='#a28'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n29'>[29] Because the term "natural philosophy" is somewhat outdated in English, I translate φυσιολογία as "the study of what is natural" (not "the study of nature", which today implies the physical sciences instead of what is of greatest interest to Epicurus: human nature). On Epicurean disdain for traditional Greek enculturation (παιδεία) as almost a kind of indoctrination, see <a href='fragments.html#a117'>Fragment #117</a>. At <a href='fragments.html#a187'>Fragment #187</a> Epicurus also says that he has not wanted to please the many in his thinking and writing. [<a href='#a29'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n33'>[33] On rivalling the gods for happiness, see <a href='letter.html#p135'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 135</a>. [<a href='#a33'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n34'>[34] Here Epicurus makes a pun on the Greek word χρεία (use, advantage, utility, need). [<a href='#a34'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n35'>[35] The word translated here as "ruin" (λυμαίνομαι) means, at root, to mistreat. The implication is that not honoring the good things you have achieved is a sign of disrespect and shows a lack of appreciation. See also Vatican Sayings <a href='#a69'>#69</a> and <a href='#a75'>#75</a>. [<a href='#a35'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n42'>[42] That is, the greatest good consists of the lack of pain and trouble, so that removing pain and trouble brings unsurpassed joy; see also <a href='fragments.html#a423'>Fragment #423</a>. [<a href='#a42'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n44'>[44] The word αὐτάρκεια is often translated as "self-sufficiency", but I think "self-reliance" is slightly better because the Epicurean sage needs friends and therefore is not entirely self-sufficient. [<a href='#a44'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n45'>[45] Here σοβαρός (haughty, pompous) seems to be used in the positive sense of "proud" or "fearless"; the latter word especially ties the study of what is natural to the lack of fear that an Epicurean sage feels with regard to death, meteorological phenomena, and other natural facts. As with <a href='#a29'>Vatican Saying #29</a>, I translate φυσιολογία as "the study of what is natural". As to honoring what one achieves instead of what comes from good fortune, see <a href='letter.html#p133'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 133</a> and following. [<a href='#a45'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n46'>[46] Although I have translated φαύλας συνηθείας as "common customs", it could also mean "bad habits" (thus giving this saying a more personal slant); however, συνήθεια typically means the habits or customs that arise from living together in society rather than the habits of a particular person, so I consider the less personal reading to be more likely. [<a href='#a46'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n54'>[54] On health as the result of practicing wisdom, see for example <a href='letter.html#p122'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 122</a>, <a href='#64'>Vatican Saying #64</a>, and <a href='fragments.html#a221'>Fragment #221</a>. [<a href='#a54'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n53'>[53] Good people do not deserve to be envied because success in living is not a matter of strife or struggle but of being without pain in the body and trouble in the soul, which is the natural limit of joy and easily attained by anyone; see for instance <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a21'>Principal Doctrine #21</a>. [<a href='#a53'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n55'>[55] The words τῶν ἀπολλυμένων are commonly translated in the weak sense of "what has been", but the root denotation of ἀπολλύω is much stonger: it means to destroy, to demolish, to lay waste, to slay, to ruin, to vanish, to be lost. [<a href='#a55'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n56-57'>[56-57] Sayings 56 and 57 are traditionally put together by means of an 11-word lacuna; although I am suspicious about this reconstruction, I have not yet had a chance to perform the research necessary to confirm or deny my suspicions. [<a href='#a56-57'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n58'>[58] Many translations render ἐγκύκλια as "public education", "general education", "culture", and the like; however, the word really means "ordinary" or "quotidian", so that περὶ τὰ ἐγκύκλια means "ordinary matters" or "quotidian concerns". Words for "education" and "culture" (e.g., παιδεία) do not appear in the Greek text of this saying. This is not to say that Epicurus favored the kind of enculturation that was common in ancient Greece (see for instance Vatican Sayings <a href='#a45'>#45</a> and <a href='#a46'>#46</a> along with Fragments <a href='fragments.html#a117'>#117</a> and <a href='fragments.html#a163'>#163</a>). [<a href='#a58'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n60'>[60] This saying is a bit cryptic. Some translations render it almost as meaning that the soul is born again at death, but clearly that would be at odds with the rest of what Epicurus says (e.g., <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a2'>Principal Doctrine #2</a>). I take it to mean that human beings do not change throughout life in their essential needs: a person who is dying, just like a newborn baby, needs only to not be hungry, not be thirsty, not be cold (see <a href='#a33'>Vatican Saying #33</a> and <a href='fragments.html#a200'>Fragment #200</a>). [<a href='#a60'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n61'>[61] The exact meaning of this saying is difficult to discern. However, it seems to be related to <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a40'>Principal Doctrine #40</a> in its emphasis on trust and fellowship. [<a href='#a61'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n63'>[63] The phrase ἐν λεπτότητι καθαριότης is somewhat obscure; καθαριότης means purity, cleanliness, neatness, scupulousness, integrity, elegance, refinement, simplicity, frugality, economy, etc., while λεπτότης means thinness, meagreness, fineness, delicacy, subtlety, etc. Can there be a purity in meagreness, a scrupulousness in delicacy, an integrity in fineness, a frugality in subtlety? Translating this phrase as "an elegance in simplicity" ties it to other statements Epicurus makes about both living beautifully (e.g., <a href='#a17'>Vatican Saying #17</a>) and living simply or naturally (e.g., <a href='#a21'>Vatican Saying #21</a>). [<a href='#a63'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n67'>[67] The text reads "a free life" (ἐλεύθερος βίος) rather than "a free person", but that would complicate the translation unnecessarily. [<a href='#a67'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n71'>[71] Literally, τὸ κατὰ ἐπιθυμίαν ἐπιζητούμενον means something like "what is sought because of this desire" (cf. Aristotle's <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> 1098b22); however "the object of desire" is more readable in modern English. [<a href='#a71'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n73'>[73] The verb λυσιτελέω means at root "to pay what is due" (later in constructions with the infinitive merely "it is better to do this than the alternative"); thus this saying has a connection to others in which Epicurus emphasizes that it is sometimes worthwhile to experience or risk the possibility of one pain for the sake of avoiding another pain or experiencing a greater pleasure (see for instance <a href='letter.html#p129'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 129</a>, <a href='letter.html#p129'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 129</a>, <a href='principal-doctrines.html#a8'>Principal Doctrine #8</a>, <a href='#a28'>Vatican Saying #28</a>, and <a href='fragments.html#a442'>Fragment #442</a>). [<a href='#a73'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n75'>[75] The force of ὅρα here might be "provide for" (as I have translated it), "beware", or even just "look to"; the overall sense is that preparing for a supposed afterlife shows a lack of appreciation for the good things of life on earth. [<a href='#a75'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n77'>[77] On αὐτάρκεια as "self-reliance", see the <a href='#n44'>note</a> on <a href='#a44'>Vatican Saying #44</a>. Self-reliance is discussed in greater depth at <a href='letter.html#p130'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 130</a>. [<a href='#a77'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n78'>[78] The idea of immortal goods is also mentioned at <a href='letter.html#p135'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 135</a>. [<a href='#a78'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n80'>[80] On the state of frenzy, see also <a href='#a11'>Vatican Saying #11</a>. [<a href='#a80'>back</a>]</p>
<p id='n81'>[81] Here Epicurus explains that things like money and fame are vague and indefinite causes for happiness, in contrast to clear and definite causes like focusing on the necessary desires, or on the natural desires if fulfilling them does not cause you harm. Interestingly, the Greek word ἀδιορίστος is an Aristotelian term for ideas or causes that are vague or indefinite; see for instance <cite>Prior Analytics</cite> 26b23, <cite>Physics</cite> 184b11, and <cite>Parts of Animals</cite> 639a22. These matters are discussed at greater length in <a href='letter.html#p133'>Letter to Menoeceus, Section 133</a> and following. [<a href='#a81'>back</a>]</p>

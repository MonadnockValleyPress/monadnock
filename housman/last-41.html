<h4>Fancy's Knell</h4>
<p>
When lads were home from labour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Abdon under Clee,<br/>
A man would call his neighbor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And both would send for me.<br/>
And where the light in lances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the mead was laid,<br/>
There to the dances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fetched my flute and played.
</p>
<p>
Ours were idle pleasures,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet oh, content we were,<br/>
The young to wind the measures,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old to heed the air;<br/>
And I to lift with playing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From tree and tower and steep<br/>
The light delaying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flute the sun to sleep.
</p>
<p>
The youth toward his fancy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would turn his brow of tan,<br/>
And Tom would pair with Nancy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dick step off with Fan;<br/>
The girl would lift her glances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his, and both be mute:<br/>
Well went the dances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At evening to the flute.
</p>
<p>
Wenlock Edge was umbered,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bright was Abdon Burf,<br/>
And warm between them slumbered<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smooth green miles of turf;<br/>
Until from grass and clover<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upshot beam would fade,<br/>
And England over<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced the lofty shade.
</p>
<p>
The lofty shade advances,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fetch my flute and play:<br/>
Come, lads, and learn the dances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And praise the tune to-day.<br/>
To-morrow, more's the pity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away we both must hie,<br/>
To air the ditty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to earth I.
</p>
<p>THE END</p>

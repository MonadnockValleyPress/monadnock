<h1>A Shropshire Lad</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>XXXVII</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As through the wild green hills of Wyre<br/>
The train ran, changing sky and shire,<br/>
And far behind, a fading crest,<br/>
Low in the forsaken west<br/>
Sank the high-reared head of Clee,<br/>
My hand lay empty on my knee.<br/>
Aching on my knee it lay:<br/>
That morning half a shire away<br/>
So many an honest fellow's fist<br/>
Had well-nigh wrung it from the wrist.<br/>
Hand, said I, since now we part<br/>
From fields and men we know by heart,<br/>
For strangers' faces, strangers' lands,&#151;<br/>
Hand, you have held true fellows' hands.<br/>
Be clean then; rot before you do<br/>
A thing they'll not believe of you.<br/>
You and I must keep from shame<br/>
In London streets the Shropshire name;<br/>
On banks of Thames they must not say<br/>
Severn breeds worse men than they;<br/>
And friends abroad must bear in mind<br/>
Friends at home they leave behind.<br/>
Oh, I shall be stiff and cold<br/>
When I forget you, hearts of gold;<br/>
The land where I shall mind you not<br/>
Is the land where all's forgot.<br/>
And if my foot returns no more<br/>
To Teme nor Corve nor Severn shore,<br/>
Luck, my lads, be with you still<br/>
By falling stream and standing hill,<br/>
By chiming tower and whispering tree,<br/>
Men that made a man of me.<br/>
About your work in town and farm<br/>
Still you'll keep my head from harm,<br/>
Still you'll help me, hands that gave<br/>
A grasp to friend me to the grave.<br/>

<h1>A Shropshire Lad</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>XLIV</h3>
<p>
Shot? so quick, so clean an ending?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh that was right, lad, that was brave:<br/>
Yours was not an ill for mending,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas best to take it to the grave.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
Oh you had forethought, you could reason,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw your road and where it led,<br/>
And early wise and brave in season<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the pistol to your head.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
Oh soon, and better so than later<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After long disgrace and scorn,<br/>
You shot dead the household traitor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul that should not have been born.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
Right you guessed the rising morrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And scorned to tread the mire you must:<br/>
Dust's your wages, son of sorrow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But men may come to worse than dust.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
Souls undone, undoing others,&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time since the tale began.<br/>
You would not live to wrong your brothers:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh lad, you died as fits a man.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
Now to your grave shall friend and stranger<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With ruth and some with envy come:<br/>
Undishonoured, clear of danger,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean of guilt, pass hence and home.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
Turn safe to rest, no dreams, no waking;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, man, here's the wreath I've made:<br/>
'Tis not a gift that's worth the taking,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But wear it and it will not fade.<br/>

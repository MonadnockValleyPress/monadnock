<h1>Last Poems</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>VI</h3>
<h4>Lancer</h4>
<p>
I 'listed at home for a lancer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?<br/>
I 'listed at home for a lancer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ride on a horse to my grave.
</p>
<p>
And over the seas we were bidden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A country to take and to keep;<br/>
And far with the brave I have ridden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now with the brave I shall sleep.
</p>
<p>
For round me the men will be lying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That learned me the way to behave.<br/>
And showed me my business of dying:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
</p>
<p>
They ask and there is not an answer;<br/>
Says I, I will 'list for a lancer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
</p>
<p>
And I with the brave shall be sleeping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ease on my mattress of loam,<br/>
When back from their taking and keeping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadron is riding home.
</p>
<p>
The wind with the plumes will be playing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls will stand watching them wave,<br/>
And eyeing my comrades and saying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
</p>
<p>
They ask and there is not an answer;<br/>
Says you, I will 'list for a lancer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

<h1>A Shropshire Lad</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>XXXIV</h3>
<h4>The New Mistress</h4>
<p>
<em>"'Oh, sick I am to see you, will you never let me be?</em><br/>
<em>You may be good for something, but you are not good for me.</em><br/>
<em>Oh, go where you are wanted, for you are not wanted here.'</em><br/>
And that was all the farewell when I parted from my dear.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
"I will go where I am wanted, to a lady born and bred<br/>
Who will dress me free for nothing in a uniform of red;<br/>
She will not be sick to see me if I only keep it clean:<br/>
I will go where I am wanted for a soldier of the Queen.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
"I will go where I am wanted, for the sergeant does not mind;<br/>
He may be sick to see me but he treats me very kind:<br/>
He gives me beer and breakfast and a ribbon for my cap,<br/>
And I never knew a sweetheart spend her money on a chap.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
"I will go where I am wanted, where there's room for one or two,<br/>
And the men are none too many for the work there is to do;<br/>
Where the standing line wears thinner and the dropping dead lie thick;<br/>
And the enemies of England they shall see me and be sick."<br/>

<h1>Last Poems</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>I publish these poems, few though they are, because it is not likely that I shall ever be impelled to write much more. I can no longer expect to be revisited by the continuous excitement under which in the early months of 1895 I wrote the greater part of my first book, nor indeed could I well sustain it if it came; and it is best that what I have written should be printed while I am here to see it through the press and control its spelling and punctuation. About a quarter of this matter belongs to the April of the present year, but most of it to dates between 1895 and 1910.</p>
<p>September 1922</p>
<p>
We'll to the woods no more,<br/>
The laurels are all cut,<br/>
The bowers are bare of bay<br/>
That once the Muses wore;<br/>
The year draws in the day<br/>
And soon will evening shut:<br/>
The laurels all are cut,<br/>
We'll to the woods no more.<br/>
Oh we'll no more, no more<br/>
To the leafy woods away,<br/>
To the high wild woods of laurel<br/>
And the bowers of bay no more.

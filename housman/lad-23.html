<h1>A Shropshire Lad</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>XXIII</h3>
<p>
The lads in their hundreds to Ludlow come in for the fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There's men from the barn and the forge and the mill and the fold,<br/>
The lads for the girls and the lads for the liquor are there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there with the rest are the lads that will never be old.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
There's chaps from the town and the field and the till and the cart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And many to count are the stalwart, and many the brave,<br/>
And many the handsome of face and the handsome of heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And few that will carry their looks or their truth to the grave.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
I wish one could know them, I wish there were tokens to tell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortunate fellows that now you can never discern;<br/>
And then one could talk with them friendly and wish them farewell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch them depart on the way that they will not return.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
But now you may stare as you like and there's nothing to scan;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And brushing your elbow unguessed-at and not to be told<br/>
They carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lads that will die in their glory and never be old.<br/>

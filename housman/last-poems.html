<h1>Last Poems</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman (1922)</h2>
<hr/>
<p>I publish these poems, few though they are, because it is not likely that I shall ever be impelled to write much more. I can no longer expect to be revisited by the continuous excitement under which in the early months of 1895 I wrote the greater part of my first book, nor indeed could I well sustain it if it came; and it is best that what I have written should be printed while I am here to see it through the press and control its spelling and punctuation. About a quarter of this matter belongs to the April of the present year, but most of it to dates between 1895 and 1910.</p>
<p>September 1922</p>
<p>
We'll to the woods no more,<br/>
The laurels are all cut,<br/>
The bowers are bare of bay<br/>
That once the Muses wore;<br/>
The year draws in the day<br/>
And soon will evening shut:<br/>
The laurels all are cut,<br/>
We'll to the woods no more.<br/>
Oh we'll no more, no more<br/>
To the leafy woods away,<br/>
To the high wild woods of laurel<br/>
And the bowers of bay no more.
</p>

<h2>I. The West</h2>
<p>
Beyond the moor and the mountain crest<br/>
&mdash;Comrade, look not on the west&mdash;<br/>
The sun is down and drinks away<br/>
From air and land the lees of day.
</p>
<p>
The long cloud and the single pine<br/>
Sentinel the ending line,<br/>
And out beyond it, clear and wan,<br/>
Reach the gulfs of evening on.
</p>
<p>
The son of woman turns his brow<br/>
West from forty countries now,<br/>
And, as the edge of heaven he eyes,<br/>
Thinks eternal thoughts, and sighs.
</p>
<p>
Oh wide's the world, to rest or roam,<br/>
With change abroad and cheer at home,<br/>
Fights and furloughs, talk and tale,<br/>
Company and beef and ale.
</p>
<p>
But if I front the evening sky<br/>
Silent on the west look I,<br/>
And my comrade, stride for stride,<br/>
Paces silent at my side,
</p>
<p>
Comrade, look not on the west:<br/>
'Twill have the heart out of your breast;<br/>
'Twill take your thoughts and sink them far,<br/>
Leagues beyond the sunset bar.
</p>
<p>
Oh lad, I fear that yon's the sea<br/>
Where they fished for you and me,<br/>
And there, from whence we both were ta'en,<br/>
You and I shall drown again.
</p>
<p>
Send not on your soul before<br/>
To dive from that beguiling shore,<br/>
And let not yet the swimmer leave<br/>
His clothes upon the sands of eve.
</p>
<p>
Too fast to yonder strand forlorn<br/>
We journey, to the sunken bourn,<br/>
To flush the fading tinges eyed<br/>
By other lads at eventide.
</p>
<p>
Wide is the world, to rest or roam,<br/>
And early 'tis for turning home:<br/>
Plant your heel on earth and stand,<br/>
And let's forget our native land.
</p>
<p>
When you and I are split on air<br/>
Long we shall be strangers there;<br/>
Friends of flesh and bone are best;<br/>
Comrade, look not on the west.
</p>
<h2>II. </h2>
<p>
As I gird on for fighting<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sword upon my thigh,<br/>
I think on old ill fortunes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of better men than I.
</p>
<p>
Think I, the round world over,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What golden lads are low<br/>
With hurts not mine to mourn for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shames I shall not know.
</p>
<p>
What evil luck soever<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me remains in store,<br/>
'Tis sure much finer fellows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have fared much worse before.
</p>
<p>
So here are things to think on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ought to make me brave,<br/>
As I strap on for fighting<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sword that will not save.
</p>
<h2>III.</h2>
<p>
Her strong enchantments failing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her towers of fear in wreck,<br/>
Her limbecks dried of poisons<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the knife at her neck,
</p>
<p>
The Queen of air and darkness<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begins to shrill and cry,<br/>
'O young man, O my slayer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow you shall die.'
</p>
<p>
O Queen of air and darkness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think 'tis truth you say,<br/>
And I shall die to-morrow;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you will die to-day.
</p>
<h2>IV. Illic Jacet</h2>
<p>
Oh hard is the bed they have made him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And common the blanket and cheap;<br/>
But there he will lie as they laid him:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where else could you trust him to sleep?
</p>
<p>
To sleep when the bugle is crying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cravens have heard and are brave,<br/>
When mothers and sweethearts are sighing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lads are in love with the grave.
</p>
<p>
Oh dark is the chamber and lonely,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lights and companions depart;<br/>
But lief will he lose them and only<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold the desire of his heart.
</p>
<p>
And low is the roof, but it covers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sleeper content to repose;<br/>
And far from his friends and his lovers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lies with the sweetheart he chose.
</p>
<h2>V. Grenadier</h2>
<p>
The Queen she sent to look for me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant he did say,<br/>
'Young man, a soldier will you be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thirteen pence a day?'
</p>
<p>
For thirteen pence a day did I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take off the things I wore,<br/>
And I have marched to where I lie,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall march no more.
</p>
<p>
My mouth is dry, my shirt is wet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My blood runs all away,<br/>
So now I shall not die in debt<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thirteen pence a day.
</p>
<p>
To-morrow after new young men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant he must see,<br/>
For things will all be over then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the Queen and me.
</p>
<p>
And I shall have to bate my price,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For in the grave, they say,<br/>
Is neither knowledge nor device<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor thirteen pence a day.
</p>
<h2>VI. Lancer</h2>
<p>
I 'listed at home for a lancer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?<br/>
I 'listed at home for a lancer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ride on a horse to my grave.
</p>
<p>
And over the seas we were bidden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A country to take and to keep;<br/>
And far with the brave I have ridden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now with the brave I shall sleep.
</p>
<p>
For round me the men will be lying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That learned me the way to behave.<br/>
And showed me my business of dying:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
</p>
<p>
They ask and there is not an answer;<br/>
Says I, I will 'list for a lancer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
</p>
<p>
And I with the brave shall be sleeping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ease on my mattress of loam,<br/>
When back from their taking and keeping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadron is riding home.
</p>
<p>
The wind with the plumes will be playing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls will stand watching them wave,<br/>
And eyeing my comrades and saying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
</p>
<p>
They ask and there is not an answer;<br/>
Says you, I will 'list for a lancer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
</p>
<h2>VII.</h2>
<p>
In valleys green and still<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where lovers wander maying<br/>
They hear from over hill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A music playing.
</p>
<p>
Behind the drum and fife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past hawthornwood and hollow,<br/>
Through earth and out of life<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers follow.
</p>
<p>
The soldier's is the trade:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any wind or weather<br/>
He steals the heart of maid<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And man together.
</p>
<p>
The lover and his lass<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the hawthorn lying<br/>
Have heard the soldiers pass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And both are sighing.
</p>
<p>
And down the distance they<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dying note and swelling<br/>
Walk the resounding way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the still dwelling.
</p>
<h2>VIII.</h2>
<p>
Soldier from the wars returning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoiler of the taken town,<br/>
Here is ease that asks not earning;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn you in and sit you down.
</p>
<p>
Peace is come and wars are over,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome you and welcome all,<br/>
While the charger crops the clover<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his bridle hangs in stall.
</p>
<p>
Now no more of winters biting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filth in trench from fall to spring,<br/>
Summers full of sweat and fighting<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Kesar or the King.
</p>
<p>
Rest you, charger, rust you, bridle;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kings and kesars, keep your pay;<br/>
Soldier, sit you down and idle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the inn of night for aye.
</p>
<h2>IX.</h2>
<p>
The chestnut casts his flambeaux, and the flowers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stream from the hawthorn on the wind away,<br/>
The doors clap to, the pane is blind with showers.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass me the can, lad; there's an end of May.
</p>
<p>
There's one spoilt spring to scant our mortal lot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One season ruined of our little store.<br/>
May will be fine next year as like as not:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh ay, but then we shall be twenty-four.
</p>
<p>
We for a certainty are not the first<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have sat in taverns while the tempest hurled<br/>
Their hopeful plans to emptiness, and cursed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever brute and blackguard made the world.
</p>
<p>
It is in truth iniquity on high<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cheat our sentenced souls of aught they crave,<br/>
And mar the merriment as you and I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fare on our long fool's-errand to the grave.
</p>
<p>
Iniquity it is; but pass the can.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lad, no pair of kings our mothers bore;<br/>
Our only portion is the estate of man:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want the moon, but we shall get no more.
</p>
<p>
If here to-day the cloud of thunder lours<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow it will hie on far behests;<br/>
The flesh will grieve on other bones than ours<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, and the soul will mourn in other breasts.
</p>
<p>
The troubles of our proud and angry dust<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are from eternity, and shall not fail.<br/>
Bear them we can, and if we can we must.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoulder the sky, my lad, and drink your ale.
</p>
<h2>X.</h2>
<p>
Could man be drunk for ever<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With liquor, love, or fights,<br/>
Lief should I rouse at morning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lief lie down of nights.
</p>
<p>
But men at whiles are sober<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think by fits and starts,<br/>
And if they think, they fasten<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hands upon their hearts.
</p>
<h2>XI.</h2>
<p>
Yonder see the morning blink:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is up, and up must I,<br/>
To wash and dress and eat and drink<br/>
And look at things and talk and think<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And work, and God knows why.
</p>
<p>
Oh often have I washed and dressed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what's to show for all my pain?<br/>
Let me lie abed and rest:<br/>
Ten thousand times I've done my best<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all's to do again.
</p>
<h2>XII.</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws of God, the laws of man,<br/>
He may keep that will and can;<br/>
Now I:  let God and man decree<br/>
Laws for themselves and not for me;<br/>
And if my ways are not as theirs<br/>
Let them mind their own affairs.<br/>
Their deeds I judge and much condemn,<br/>
Yet when did I make laws for them?<br/>
Please yourselves, say I, and they<br/>
Need only look the other way.<br/>
But no, they will not; they must still<br/>
Wrest their neighbour to their will,<br/>
And make me dance as they desire<br/>
With jail and gallows and hell-fire.<br/>
And how am I to face the odds<br/>
Of man's bedevilment and God's?<br/>
I, a stranger and afraid<br/>
In a world I never made.<br/>
They will be master, right or wrong;<br/>
Though both are foolish, both are strong,<br/>
And since, my soul, we cannot fly<br/>
To Saturn or Mercury,<br/>
Keep we must, if keep we can,<br/>
These foreign laws of God and man.
</p>
<h2>XIII. The Deserter</h2>
<p>
"What sound awakened me, I wonder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now 'tis dumb."<br/>
"Wheels on the road most like, or thunder:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie down; 'twas not the drum.:
</p>
<p>
"Toil at sea and two in haven<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trouble far:<br/>
Fly, crow, away, and follow, raven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that croaks for war."
</p>
<p>
"Hark, I heard the bugle crying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where am I?<br/>
My friends are up and dressed and dying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will dress and die."
</p>
<p>
"Oh love is rare and trouble plenty<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And carrion cheap,<br/>
And daylight dear at four-and-twenty:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie down again and sleep."
</p>
<p>
"Reach me my belt and leave your prattle:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your hour is gone;<br/>
But my day is the day of battle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that comes dawning on.
</p>
<p>
"They mow the field of man in season:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell, my fair,<br/>
And, call it truth or call it treason,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell the vows that were."
</p>
<p>
"Ay, false heart, forsake me lightly:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis like the brave.<br/>
They find no bed to joy in rightly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they find the grave.
</p>
<p>
"Their love is for their own undoing.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And east and west<br/>
They scour about the world a-wooing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet in their breast.
</p>
<p>
"Sail away the ocean over,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh sail away,<br/>
And lie there with your leaden lover<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever and a day."
</p>
<h2>XIV. The Culprit</h2>
<p>
The night my father got me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mind was not on me;<br/>
He did not plague his fancy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To muse if I should be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son you see.
</p>
<p>
The day my mother bore me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a fool and glad,<br/>
For all the pain I cost her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she had borne the lad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That borne she had.
</p>
<p>
My mother and my father<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the light they lie;<br/>
The warrant would not find them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here 'tis only I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall hang so high.
</p>
<p>
Oh let not man remember<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul that God forgot,<br/>
But fetch the county kerchief<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And noose me in the knot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will rot.
</p>
<p>
For so the game is ended<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should not have begun.<br/>
My father and my mother<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had a likely son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have none.
</p>
<h2>XV. Eight o'Clock</h2>
<p>
He stood, and heard the steeple<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprinkle the quarters on the morning town.<br/>
One, two, three, four, to market-place and people<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It tossed them down.
</p>
<p>
Strapped, noosed, nighing his hour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood and counted them and cursed his luck;<br/>
And then the clock collected in the tower<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its strength, and struck.
</p>
<h2>XVI. Spring Morning</h2>
<p>
Star and coronal and bell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April underfoot renews,<br/>
And the hope of man as well<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers among the morning dews.
</p>
<p>
Now the old come out to look,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter past and winter's pains.<br/>
How the sky in pool and brook<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glitters on the grassy plains.
</p>
<p>
Easily the gentle air<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wafts the turning season on;<br/>
Things to comfort them are there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though 'tis true the best are gone.
</p>
<p>
Now the scorned unlucky lad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rousing from his pillow gnawn<br/>
Mans his heart and deep and glad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinks the valiant air of dawn.
</p>
<p>
Half the night he longed to die,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now are sown on hill and plain<br/>
Pleasures worth his while to try<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere he longs to die again.
</p>
<p>
Blue the sky from east to west<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arches, and the world is wide,<br/>
Though the girl he loves the best<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rouses from another's side.
</p>
<h2>XVII. Astronomy</h2>
<p>
The Wain upon the northern steep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descends and lifts away.<br/>
Oh I will sit me down and weep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For bones in Africa.
</p>
<p>
For pay and medals, name and rank,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things that he has not found,<br/>
He hove the Cross to heaven and sank<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pole-star underground.
</p>
<p>
And now he does not even see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signs of the nadir roll<br/>
At night over the ground where he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is buried with the pole.
</p>
<h2>XVIII.</h2>
<p>
The rain, it streams on stone and hillock,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boot clings to the clay.<br/>
Since all is done that's due and right<br/>
Let's home; and now, my lad, good-night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I must turn away.
</p>
<p>
Good-night, my lad, for nought's eternal;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No league of ours, for sure.<br/>
Tomorrow I shall miss you less,<br/>
And ache of heart and heaviness<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are things that time should cure.
</p>
<p>
Over the hill the highway marches<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what's beyond is wide:<br/>
Oh soon enough will pine to nought<br/>
Remembrance and the faithful thought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sits the grave beside.
</p>
<p>
The skies, they are not always raining<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor grey the twelvemonth through;<br/>
And I shall meet good days and mirth,<br/>
And range the lovely lands of earth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With friends no worse than you.
</p>
<p>
But oh, my man, the house is fallen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That none can build again;<br/>
My man, how full of joy and woe<br/>
Your mother bore you years ago<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-night to lie in the rain.
</p>
<h2>XIX.</h2>
<p>
In midnights of November,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dead Man's Fair is nigh,<br/>
And danger in the valley,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And anger in the sky,
</p>
<p>
Around the huddling homesteads<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leafless timber roars,<br/>
And the dead call the dying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finger at the doors.
</p>
<p>
Oh, yonder faltering fingers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are hands I used to hold;<br/>
Their false companion drowses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaves them in the cold.
</p>
<p>
Oh, to the bed of ocean,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Africk and to Ind,<br/>
I will arise and follow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the rainy wind.
</p>
<p>
The night goes out and under<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its train forlorn;<br/>
Hues in the east assemble<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cocks crow up the morn.
</p>
<p>
The living are the living<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dead the dead will stay,<br/>
And I will sort with comrades<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That face the beam of day.
</p>
<h2>XX.</h2>
<p>
The night is freezing fast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow comes December;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And winterfalls of old<br/>
Are with me from the past;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chiefly I remember<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Dick would hate the cold.
</p>
<p>
Fall, winter, fall; for he,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prompt hand and headpiece clever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has woven a winter robe,<br/>
And made of earth and sea<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His overcoat for ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wears the turning globe.
</p>
<h2>XXI.</h2>
<p>
The fairies break their dances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the printed lawn,<br/>
And up from India glances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver sail of dawn.
</p>
<p>
The candles burn their sockets,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blinds let through the day,<br/>
The young man feels his pockets<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wonders what's to pay.
</p>
<h2>XXII.</h2>
<p>
The sloe was lost in flower,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The April elm was dim;<br/>
That was the lover's hour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour for lies and him.
</p>
<p>
If thorns are all the bower,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If north winds freeze the fir,<br/>
Why, 'tis another's hour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour for truth and her.
</p>
<h2>XXIII.</h2>
<p>
In the morning, in the morning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the happy field of hay,<br/>
Oh they looked at one another<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the light of day.
</p>
<p>
In the blue and silver morning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the haycock as they lay,<br/>
Oh they looked at one another<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they looked away.
</p>
<h2>XXIV. Epithalamium</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is here, Urania's son,<br/>
Hymen come from Helicon;<br/>
God that glads the lover's heart,<br/>
He is here to join and part.<br/>
So the groomsman quits your side<br/>
And the bridegroom seeks the bride:<br/>
Friend and comrade yield you o'er<br/>
To her that hardly loves you more.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the sun his skyward beam<br/>
Has tilted from the Ocean stream.<br/>
Light the Indies, laggard sun:<br/>
Happy bridegroom, day is done,<br/>
And the star from Oeta's steep<br/>
Calls to bed but not to sleep.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy bridegroom, Hesper brings<br/>
All desired and timely things.<br/>
All whom morning sends to roam,<br/>
Hesper loves to lead them home.<br/>
Home return who him behold,<br/>
Child to mother, sheep to fold,<br/>
Bird to nest from wandering wide:<br/>
Happy bridegroom, seek your bride.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour it out, the golden cup<br/>
Given and guarded, brimming up,<br/>
Safe through jostling markets borne<br/>
And the thicket of the thorn;<br/>
Folly spurned and danger past,<br/>
Pour it to the god at last.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to smother noise and light,<br/>
Is stolen abroad the wildering night,<br/>
And the blotting shades confuse<br/>
Path and meadow full of dews;<br/>
And the high heavens, that all control,<br/>
Turn in silence round the pole.<br/>
Catch the starry beams they shed<br/>
Prospering the marriage bed,<br/>
And breed the land that reared your prime<br/>
Sons to stay the rot of time.<br/>
All is quiet, no alarms;<br/>
Nothing fear of nightly harms.<br/>
Safe you sleep on guarded ground,<br/>
And in silent circle round<br/>
The thoughts of friends keep watch and ward,<br/>
Harnessed angels, hand on sword.
</p>
<h2>XXV. The Oracles</h2>
<p>
'Tis mute, the word they went to hear on high Dodona mountain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When winds were in the oakenshaws and all the cauldrons tolled,<br/>
And mute's the midland navel-stone beside the singing fountain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And echoes list to silence now where gods told lies of old.
</p>
<p>
I took my question to the shrine that has not ceased from speaking,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart within, that tells the truth and tells it twice as plain;
And from the cave of oracles I heard the priestess shrieking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she and I should surely die and never live again.
</p>
<p>
Oh priestess, what you cry is clear, and sound good sense I think it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let the screaming echoes rest, and froth your mouth no more.<br/>
'Tis true there's better boose than brine, but he that drowns must drink it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, my lass, the news is news that men have heard before.
</p>
<p>
The King with half the East at heel is marched from lands of morning;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fighters drink the rivers up, their shafts benight the air.<br/>
And he that stands will die for nought, and home there's no returning.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spartans on the sea-wet rock sat down and combed their hair.
</p>
<h2>XXVI.</h2>
<p>
The half-moon westers low, my love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wind brings up the rain;<br/>
And wide apart lie we, my love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seas between the twain.
</p>
<p>
I know not if it rains, my love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land where you do lie;<br/>
And oh, so sound you sleep, my love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know no more than I.
</p>
<h2>XXVII.</h2>
<p>
The sigh that heaves the grasses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence thou wilt never rise<br/>
Is of the air that passes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knows not if it sighs.
</p>
<p>
The diamond tears adorning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy low mound on the lea,<br/>
Those are the tears of morning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That weeps, but not for thee.
</p>
<h2>XXVIII.</h2>
<p>
Now dreary dawns the eastern light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fall of eve is drear,<br/>
And cold the poor man lies at night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so goes out the year.
</p>
<p>
Little is the luck I've had,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, 'tis comfort small<br/>
To think that many another lad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has had no luck at all.
</p>
<h2>XXIX.</h2>
<p>
Wake not for the world-heard thunder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the chime that earthquakes toll.<br/>
Star may plot in heaven with planet,<br/>
Lightning rive the rock of granite,<br/>
Tempest tread the oakwood under:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear not you for flesh nor soul.<br/>
Marching, fighting, victory past,<br/>
Stretch your limbs in peace at last.
</p>
<p>
Stir not for the soldiers drilling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the fever nothing cures:<br/>
Throb of drum and timbal's rattle<br/>
Call but man alive to battle,<br/>
And the fife with death-notes filling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screams for blood but not for yours.<br/>
Times enough you bled your best;<br/>
Sleep on now, and take your rest.
</p>
<p>
Sleep, my lad; the French are landed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London's burning, Windsor's down;<br/>
Clasp your cloak of earth about you,<br/>
We must man the ditch without you,<br/>
March unled and fight short-handed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charge to fall and swim to drown.<br/>
Duty, friendship, bravery o'er,<br/>
Sleep away, lad; wake no more.
</p>
<h2>XXX. Sinner's Rue</h2>
<p>
I walked alone and thinking,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faint the nightwind blew<br/>
And stirred on mounds at crossways<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower of sinner's rue.
</p>
<p>
Where the roads part they bury<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him that his own hand slays,<br/>
And so the weed of sorrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springs at the four cross ways.
</p>
<p>
By night I plucked it hueless,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When morning broke 'twas blue:<br/>
Blue at my breast I fastened<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower of sinner's rue.
</p>
<p>
It seemed a herb of healing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A balsam and a sign,<br/>
Flower of a heart whose trouble<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must have been worse than mine.
</p>
<p>
Dead clay that did me kindness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can do none to you,<br/>
But only wear for breastknot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower of sinner's rue.
</p>
<h2>XXXI. Hell's Gate</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward led the road again<br/>
Through the sad uncoloured plain<br/>
Under twilight brooding dim,<br/>
And along the utmost rim<br/>
Wall and rampart risen to sight<br/>
Cast a shadow not of night,<br/>
And beyond them seemed to glow<br/>
Bonfires lighted long ago.<br/>
And my dark conductor broke<br/>
Silence at my side and spoke,<br/>
Saying, "You conjecture well:<br/>
Yonder is the gate of hell."
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill as yet the eye could see<br/>
The eternal masonry,<br/>
But beneath it on the dark<br/>
To and fro there stirred a spark.<br/>
And again the sombre guide<br/>
Knew my question, and replied:<br/>
"At hell gate the damned in turn<br/>
Pace for sentinel and burn."
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dully at the leaden sky<br/>
Staring, and with idle eye<br/>
Measuring the listless plain,<br/>
I began to think again.<br/>
Many things I thought of then,<br/>
Battle, and the loves of men,<br/>
Cities entered, oceans crossed,<br/>
Knowledge gained and virtue lost,<br/>
Cureless folly done and said,<br/>
And the lovely way that led<br/>
To the slimepit and the mire<br/>
And the everlasting fire.<br/>
And against a smoulder dun<br/>
And a dawn without a sun<br/>
Did the nearing bastion loom,<br/>
And across the gate of gloom<br/>
Still one saw the sentry go,<br/>
Trim and burning, to and fro,<br/>
One for women to admire<br/>
In his finery of fire.<br/>
Something, as I watched him pace,<br/>
Minded me of time and place,<br/>
Soldiers of another corps<br/>
And a sentry known before.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever darker hell on high<br/>
Reared its strength upon the sky,<br/>
And our footfall on the track<br/>
Fetched the daunting echo back.<br/>
But the soldier pacing still<br/>
The insuperable sill,<br/>
Nursing his tormented pride,<br/>
Turned his head to neither side,<br/>
Sunk into himself apart<br/>
And the hell-fire of his heart.<br/>
But against our entering in<br/>
From the drawbridge Death and Sin<br/>
Rose to render key and sword<br/>
To their father and their lord.<br/>
And the portress foul to see<br/>
Lifted up her eyes on me<br/>
Smiling, and I made reply:<br/>
"Met again, my lass," said I.<br/>
Then the sentry turned his head,<br/>
Looked, and knew me, and was Ned.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once he looked, and halted straight,<br/>
Set his back against the gate,<br/>
Caught his musket to his chin,<br/>
While the hive of hell within<br/>
Sent abroad a seething hum<br/>
As of towns whose king is come<br/>
Leading conquest home from far<br/>
And the captives of his war,<br/>
And the car of triumph waits,<br/>
And they open wide the gates.<br/>
But across the entry barred<br/>
Straddled the revolted guard,<br/>
Weaponed and accoutred well<br/>
From the arsenals of hell;<br/>
And beside him, sick and white,<br/>
Sin to left and Death to right<br/>
Turned a countenance of fear<br/>
On the flaming mutineer.<br/>
Over us the darkness bowed,<br/>
And the anger in the cloud<br/>
Clenched the lightning for the stroke;<br/>
But the traitor musket spoke.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hollowness of hell<br/>
Sounded as its master fell,<br/>
And the mourning echo rolled<br/>
Ruin through his kingdom old.<br/>
Tyranny and terror flown<br/>
Left a pair of friends alone,<br/>
And beneath the nether sky<br/>
All that stirred was he and I.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent, nothing found to say,<br/>
We began the backward way;<br/>
And the ebbing luster died<br/>
From the soldier at my side,<br/>
As in all his spruce attire<br/>
Failed the everlasting fire.<br/>
Midmost of the homeward track<br/>
Once we listened and looked back;<br/>
But the city, dusk and mute,<br/>
Slept, and there was no pursuit.
</p>
<h2>XXXII.</h2>
<p>
When I would muse in boyhood<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild green woods among,<br/>
And nurse resolves and fancies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the world was young,<br/>
It was not foes to conquer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor sweethearts to be kind,<br/>
But it was friends to die for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I would seek and find.
</p>
<p>
I sought them far and found them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sure, the straight, the brave,<br/>
The hearts I lost my own to,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The souls I could not save.<br/>
They braced their belts about them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They crossed in ships the sea,<br/>
They sought and found six feet of ground,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there they died for me.
</p>
<h2>XXXIII.</h2>
<p>
When the eye of day is shut,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stars deny their beams,<br/>
And about the forest hut<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blows the roaring wood of dreams,
</p>
<p>
From deep clay, from desert rock,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sunk sands of the main,<br/>
Come not at my door to knock,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearts that loved me not again.
</p>
<p>
Sleep, be still, turn to your rest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lands where you are laid;<br/>
In far lodgings east and west<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie down on the beds you made.
</p>
<p>
In gross marl, in blowing dust,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the drowned ooze of the sea,<br/>
Where you would not, lie you must,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie you must, and not with me.
</p>
<h2>XXXIV. The First of May</h2>
<p>
The orchards half the way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From home to Ludlow fair<br/>
Flowered on the first of May<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mays when I was there;<br/>
And seen from stile or turning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plume of smoke would show<br/>
Where fires were burning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That went out long ago.
</p>
<p>
The plum broke forth in green,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pear stood high and snowed,<br/>
My friends and I between<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would take the Ludlow road;<br/>
Dressed to the nines and drinking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And light in heart and limb,<br/>
And each chap thinking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair was held for him.
</p>
<p>
Between the trees in flower<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New friends at fairtime tread<br/>
The way where Ludlow tower<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands planted on the dead.<br/>
Our thoughts, a long while after,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think, our words they say;<br/>
Theirs now's the laughter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair, the first of May.
</p>
<p>
Ay, yonder lads are yet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fools that we were then;<br/>
For oh, the sons we get<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are still the sons of men.<br/>
The sumless tale of sorrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is all unrolled in vain:<br/>
May comes to-morrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ludlow fair again.
</p>
<h2>XXXV.</h2>
<p>
When first my way to fair I took<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few pence in purse had I,<br/>
And long I used to stand and look<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At things I could not buy.
</p>
<p>
Now times are altered:  if I care<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To buy a thing, I can;<br/>
The pence are here and here's the fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where's the lost young man?
</p>
<p>
&mdash;To think that two and two are four<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And neither five nor three<br/>
The heart of man has long been sore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long 'tis like to be.
</p>
<h2>XXXVI. Revolution</h2>
<p>
West and away the wheels of darkness roll,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day's beamy banner up the east is borne,<br/>
Spectres and fears, the nightmare and her foal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drown in the golden deluge of the morn.
</p>
<p>
But over sea and continent from sight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe to the Indies has the earth conveyed<br/>
The vast and moon-eclipsing cone of night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her towering foolscap of eternal shade.
</p>
<p>
See, in mid heaven the sun is mounted; hark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belfries tingle to the noonday chime.<br/>
'Tis silent, and the subterranean dark<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has crossed the nadir, and begins to climb.
</p>
<h2>XXXVII. Epitaph on an Army of Mercenaries</h2>
<p>
These, in the day when heaven was falling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour when earth's foundations fled,<br/>
Followed their mercenary calling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took their wages and are dead.
</p>
<p>
Their shoulders held the sky suspended;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood, and earth's foundations stay;<br/>
What God abandoned, these defended,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saved the sum of things for pay.
</p>
<h2>XXXVIII.</h2>
<p>
Oh stay at home, my lad, and plough<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land and not the sea,<br/>
And leave the soldiers at their drill,<br/>
And all about the idle hill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shepherd your sheep with me.
</p>
<p>
Oh stay with company and mirth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And daylight and the air;<br/>
Too full already is the grave<br/>
Of fellows that were good and brave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And died because they were.
</p>
<h2>XXXIX.</h2>
<p>
When summer's end is nighing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And skies at evening cloud,<br/>
I muse on change and fortune<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the feats I vowed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young and proud.
</p>
<p>
The weathercock at sunset<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would lose the slanted ray,<br/>
And I would climb the beacon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That looked to Wales away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the last of day.
</p>
<p>
From hill and cloud and heaven<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hues of evening died;<br/>
Night welled through lane and hollow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hushed the countryside,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I had youth and pride.
</p>
<p>
And I with earth and nightfall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In converse high would stand,<br/>
Late, till the west was ashen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And darkness hard at hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the eye lost the land.
</p>
<p>
The year might age, and cloudy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessening day might close,<br/>
But air of other summers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed from beyond the snows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I had hope of those.
</p>
<p>
They came and were and are not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And come no more anew;<br/>
And all the years and seasons<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever can ensue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must now be worse and few.
</p>
<p>
So here's an end of roaming<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On eves when autumn nighs:<br/>
The ear too fondly listens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For summer's parting sighs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the heart replies.
</p>
<h2>XL.</h2>
<p>
Tell me not here, it needs not saying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What tune the enchantress plays<br/>
In aftermaths of soft September<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or under blanching mays,<br/>
For she and I were long acquainted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I knew all her ways.
</p>
<p>
On russet floors, by waters idle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pine lets fall its cone;<br/>
The cuckoo shouts all day at nothing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In leafy dells alone;<br/>
And traveler's joy beguiles in autumn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearts that have lost their own.
</p>
<p>
On acres of the seeded grasses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changing burnish heaves;<br/>
Or marshalled under moons of harvest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand still all night the sheaves;<br/>
Or beeches strip in storms for winter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stain the wind with leaves.
</p>
<p>
Possess, as I possessed a season,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countries I resign,<br/>
Where over elmy plains the highway<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would mount the hills and shine,<br/>
And full of shade the pillared forest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would murmur and be mine.
</p>
<p>
For nature, heartless, witless nature,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will neither care nor know<br/>
What stranger's feet may find the meadow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trespass there and go,<br/>
Nor ask amid the dews of morning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are mine or no.
</p>
<h2>XLI. Fancy's Knell</h2>
<p>
When lads were home from labour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Abdon under Clee,<br/>
A man would call his neighbor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And both would send for me.<br/>
And where the light in lances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the mead was laid,<br/>
There to the dances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fetched my flute and played.
</p>
<p>
Ours were idle pleasures,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet oh, content we were,<br/>
The young to wind the measures,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old to heed the air;<br/>
And I to lift with playing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From tree and tower and steep<br/>
The light delaying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flute the sun to sleep.
</p>
<p>
The youth toward his fancy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would turn his brow of tan,<br/>
And Tom would pair with Nancy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dick step off with Fan;<br/>
The girl would lift her glances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his, and both be mute:<br/>
Well went the dances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At evening to the flute.
</p>
<p>
Wenlock Edge was umbered,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bright was Abdon Burf,<br/>
And warm between them slumbered<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smooth green miles of turf;<br/>
Until from grass and clover<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upshot beam would fade,<br/>
And England over<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced the lofty shade.
</p>
<p>
The lofty shade advances,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fetch my flute and play:<br/>
Come, lads, and learn the dances<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And praise the tune to-day.<br/>
To-morrow, more's the pity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away we both must hie,<br/>
To air the ditty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to earth I.

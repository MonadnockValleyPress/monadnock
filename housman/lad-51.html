<h1>A Shropshire Lad</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>LI</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Loitering with a vacant eye<br/>
Along the Grecian gallery,<br/>
And brooding on my heavy ill,<br/>
I met a statue standing still.<br/>
Still in marble stone stood he,<br/>
And stedfastly he looked at me.<br/>
"Well met," I thought the look would say,<br/>
"We both were fashioned far away;<br/>
We neither knew, when we were young,<br/>
These Londoners we live among."<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still he stood and eyed me hard,<br/>
An earnest and a grave regard:<br/>
"What, lad, drooping with your lot?<br/>
I too would be where I am not.<br/>
I too survey that endless line<br/>
Of men whose thoughts are not as mine.<br/>
Years, ere you stood up from rest,<br/>
On my neck the collar prest;<br/>
Years, when you lay down your ill,<br/>
I shall stand and bear it still.<br/>
Courage, lad, 'tis not for long:<br/>
Stand, quit you like stone, be strong."<br/>
So I thought his look would say;<br/>
And light on me my trouble lay,<br/>
And I stept out in flesh and bone<br/>
Manful like the man of stone.<br/>

<h1>A Shropshire Lad</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>XLVIII</h3>
<p>
Be still, my soul, be still; the arms you bear are brittle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth and high heaven are fixt of old and founded strong.<br/>
Think rather, &#151;  call to thought, if now you grieve a little,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The days when we had rest, O soul, for they were long.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
Men loved unkindness then, but lightless in the quarry<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I slept and saw not; tears fell down, I did not mourn;<br/>
Sweat ran and blood sprang out and I was never sorry:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it was well with me, in days ere I was born.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
Now, and I muse for why and never find the reason,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I pace the earth, and drink the air, and feel the sun.<br/>
Be still, be still, my soul; it is but for a season:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us endure an hour and see injustice done.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
Ay, look: high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All thoughts to rive the heart are here, and all are vain:<br/>
Horror and scorn and hate and fear and indignation&#151;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh why did I awake?  when shall I sleep again?<br/>
</p>

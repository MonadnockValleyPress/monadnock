<h1>A Shropshire Lad</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>XLVII</h3>
<h4>The Carpenter's Son</h4>
<p>
"Here the hangman stops his cart:<br/>
Now the best of friends must part.<br/>
Fare you well, for ill fare I:<br/>
Live, lads, and I will die.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Oh, at home had I but stayed<br/>
'Prenticed to my father's trade,<br/>
Had I stuck to plane and adze,<br/>
I had not been lost, my lads.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then I might have built perhaps<br/>
Gallows-trees for other chaps,<br/>
Never dangled on my own,<br/>
Had I left but ill alone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Now, you see, they hang me high,<br/>
And the people passing by<br/>
Stop to shake their fists and curse;<br/>
So 'tis come from ill to worse.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Here hang I, and right and left<br/>
Two poor fellows hang for theft:<br/>
All the same's the luck we prove,<br/>
Though the midmost hangs for love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Comrades all, that stand and gaze,<br/>
Walk henceforth in other ways;<br/>
See my neck and save your own:<br/>
Comrades all, leave ill alone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Make some day a decent end,<br/>
Shrewder fellows than your friend.<br/>
Fare you well, for ill fare I:<br/>
Live lads, and I will die."<br/>

<h1>Last Poems</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>XXV</h3>
<h4>The Oracles</h4>
<p>
'Tis mute, the word they went to hear on high Dodona mountain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When winds were in the oakenshaws and all the cauldrons tolled,<br/>
And mute's the midland navel-stone beside the singing fountain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And echoes list to silence now where gods told lies of old.
</p>
<p>
I took my question to the shrine that has not ceased from speaking,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart within, that tells the truth and tells it twice as plain;
And from the cave of oracles I heard the priestess shrieking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she and I should surely die and never live again.
</p>
<p>
Oh priestess, what you cry is clear, and sound good sense I think it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let the screaming echoes rest, and froth your mouth no more.<br/>
'Tis true there's better boose than brine, but he that drowns must drink it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, my lass, the news is news that men have heard before.
</p>
<p>
The King with half the East at heel is marched from lands of morning;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fighters drink the rivers up, their shafts benight the air.<br/>
And he that stands will die for nought, and home there's no returning.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spartans on the sea-wet rock sat down and combed their hair.

<h1>Last Poems</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>XII</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws of God, the laws of man,<br/>
He may keep that will and can;<br/>
Now I:  let God and man decree<br/>
Laws for themselves and not for me;<br/>
And if my ways are not as theirs<br/>
Let them mind their own affairs.<br/>
Their deeds I judge and much condemn,<br/>
Yet when did I make laws for them?<br/>
Please yourselves, say I, and they<br/>
Need only look the other way.<br/>
But no, they will not; they must still<br/>
Wrest their neighbour to their will,<br/>
And make me dance as they desire<br/>
With jail and gallows and hell-fire.<br/>
And how am I to face the odds<br/>
Of man's bedevilment and God's?<br/>
I, a stranger and afraid<br/>
In a world I never made.<br/>
They will be master, right or wrong;<br/>
Though both are foolish, both are strong,<br/>
And since, my soul, we cannot fly<br/>
To Saturn or Mercury,<br/>
Keep we must, if keep we can,<br/>
These foreign laws of God and man.

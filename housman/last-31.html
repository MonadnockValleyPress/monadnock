<h3>XXXI</h3>
<h4>Hell's Gate</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward led the road again<br/>
Through the sad uncoloured plain<br/>
Under twilight brooding dim,<br/>
And along the utmost rim<br/>
Wall and rampart risen to sight<br/>
Cast a shadow not of night,<br/>
And beyond them seemed to glow<br/>
Bonfires lighted long ago.<br/>
And my dark conductor broke<br/>
Silence at my side and spoke,<br/>
Saying, "You conjecture well:<br/>
Yonder is the gate of hell."
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill as yet the eye could see<br/>
The eternal masonry,<br/>
But beneath it on the dark<br/>
To and fro there stirred a spark.<br/>
And again the sombre guide<br/>
Knew my question, and replied:<br/>
"At hell gate the damned in turn<br/>
Pace for sentinel and burn."
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dully at the leaden sky<br/>
Staring, and with idle eye<br/>
Measuring the listless plain,<br/>
I began to think again.<br/>
Many things I thought of then,<br/>
Battle, and the loves of men,<br/>
Cities entered, oceans crossed,<br/>
Knowledge gained and virtue lost,<br/>
Cureless folly done and said,<br/>
And the lovely way that led<br/>
To the slimepit and the mire<br/>
And the everlasting fire.<br/>
And against a smoulder dun<br/>
And a dawn without a sun<br/>
Did the nearing bastion loom,<br/>
And across the gate of gloom<br/>
Still one saw the sentry go,<br/>
Trim and burning, to and fro,<br/>
One for women to admire<br/>
In his finery of fire.<br/>
Something, as I watched him pace,<br/>
Minded me of time and place,<br/>
Soldiers of another corps<br/>
And a sentry known before.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever darker hell on high<br/>
Reared its strength upon the sky,<br/>
And our footfall on the track<br/>
Fetched the daunting echo back.<br/>
But the soldier pacing still<br/>
The insuperable sill,<br/>
Nursing his tormented pride,<br/>
Turned his head to neither side,<br/>
Sunk into himself apart<br/>
And the hell-fire of his heart.<br/>
But against our entering in<br/>
From the drawbridge Death and Sin<br/>
Rose to render key and sword<br/>
To their father and their lord.<br/>
And the portress foul to see<br/>
Lifted up her eyes on me<br/>
Smiling, and I made reply:<br/>
"Met again, my lass," said I.<br/>
Then the sentry turned his head,<br/>
Looked, and knew me, and was Ned.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once he looked, and halted straight,<br/>
Set his back against the gate,<br/>
Caught his musket to his chin,<br/>
While the hive of hell within<br/>
Sent abroad a seething hum<br/>
As of towns whose king is come<br/>
Leading conquest home from far<br/>
And the captives of his war,<br/>
And the car of triumph waits,<br/>
And they open wide the gates.<br/>
But across the entry barred<br/>
Straddled the revolted guard,<br/>
Weaponed and accoutred well<br/>
From the arsenals of hell;<br/>
And beside him, sick and white,<br/>
Sin to left and Death to right<br/>
Turned a countenance of fear<br/>
On the flaming mutineer.<br/>
Over us the darkness bowed,<br/>
And the anger in the cloud<br/>
Clenched the lightning for the stroke;<br/>
But the traitor musket spoke.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hollowness of hell<br/>
Sounded as its master fell,<br/>
And the mourning echo rolled<br/>
Ruin through his kingdom old.<br/>
Tyranny and terror flown<br/>
Left a pair of friends alone,<br/>
And beneath the nether sky<br/>
All that stirred was he and I.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent, nothing found to say,<br/>
We began the backward way;<br/>
And the ebbing luster died<br/>
From the soldier at my side,<br/>
As in all his spruce attire<br/>
Failed the everlasting fire.<br/>
Midmost of the homeward track<br/>
Once we listened and looked back;<br/>
But the city, dusk and mute,<br/>
Slept, and there was no pursuit.

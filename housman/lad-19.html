<h1>A Shropshire Lad</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>XIX</h3>
<h4>To an Athlete Dying Young</h4>
<p>
The time you won your town the race<br/>
We chaired you through the market-place;<br/>
Man and boy stood cheering by,<br/>
And home we brought you shoulder-high.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To-day, the road all runners come,<br/>
Shoulder-high we bring you home,<br/>
And set you at your threshold down,<br/>
Townsman of a stiller town.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Smart lad, to slip betimes away<br/>
From fields where glory does not stay,<br/>
And early though the laurel grows<br/>
It withers quicker than the rose.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Eyes the shady night has shut<br/>
Cannot see the record cut,<br/>
And silence sounds no worse than cheers<br/>
After earth has stopped the ears:<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now you will not swell the rout<br/>
Of lads that wore their honors out,<br/>
Runners whom reknown outran<br/>
And the name died before the man.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So set, before the echoes fade,<br/>
The fleet foot on the sill of shade,<br/>
And hold to the low lintel up<br/>
The still-defended challenge-cup.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And round that early-laurelled head<br/>
Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead,<br/>
And find unwithered on its curls<br/>
The garland briefer than a girl's.<br/>

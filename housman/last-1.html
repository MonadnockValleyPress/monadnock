<h1>Last Poems</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<h4>The West</h4>
<p>
Beyond the moor and the mountain crest<br/>
&mdash;Comrade, look not on the west&mdash;<br/>
The sun is down and drinks away<br/>
From air and land the lees of day.
</p>
<p>
The long cloud and the single pine<br/>
Sentinel the ending line,<br/>
And out beyond it, clear and wan,<br/>
Reach the gulfs of evening on.
</p>
<p>
The son of woman turns his brow<br/>
West from forty countries now,<br/>
And, as the edge of heaven he eyes,<br/>
Thinks eternal thoughts, and sighs.
</p>
<p>
Oh wide's the world, to rest or roam,<br/>
With change abroad and cheer at home,<br/>
Fights and furloughs, talk and tale,<br/>
Company and beef and ale.
</p>
<p>
But if I front the evening sky<br/>
Silent on the west look I,<br/>
And my comrade, stride for stride,<br/>
Paces silent at my side,
</p>
<p>
Comrade, look not on the west:<br/>
'Twill have the heart out of your breast;<br/>
'Twill take your thoughts and sink them far,<br/>
Leagues beyond the sunset bar.
</p>
<p>
Oh lad, I fear that yon's the sea<br/>
Where they fished for you and me,<br/>
And there, from whence we both were ta'en,<br/>
You and I shall drown again.
</p>
<p>
Send not on your soul before<br/>
To dive from that beguiling shore,<br/>
And let not yet the swimmer leave<br/>
His clothes upon the sands of eve.
</p>
<p>
Too fast to yonder strand forlorn<br/>
We journey, to the sunken bourn,<br/>
To flush the fading tinges eyed<br/>
By other lads at eventide.
</p>
<p>
Wide is the world, to rest or roam,<br/>
And early 'tis for turning home:<br/>
Plant your heel on earth and stand,<br/>
And let's forget our native land.
</p>
<p>
When you and I are split on air<br/>
Long we shall be strangers there;<br/>
Friends of flesh and bone are best;<br/>
Comrade, look not on the west.

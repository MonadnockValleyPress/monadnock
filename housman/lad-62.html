<h1>A Shropshire Lad</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>LXII</h3>
<p>
"Terence, this is stupid stuff:<br/>
You eat your victuals fast enough;<br/>
There can't be much amiss, 'tis clear,<br/>
To see the rate you drink your beer.<br/>
But oh, good Lord, the verse you make,<br/>
It gives a chap the belly-ache.<br/>
The cow, the old cow, she is dead;<br/>
It sleeps well, the horned head:<br/>
We poor lads, 'tis our turn now<br/>
To hear such tunes as killed the cow.<br/>
Pretty friendship 'tis to rhyme<br/>
Your friends to death before their time<br/>
Moping melancholy mad:<br/>
Come, pipe a tune to dance to, lad."<br/>
</p>
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, if 'tis dancing you would be,<br/>
There's brisker pipes than poetry.<br/>
Say, for what were hop-yards meant,<br/>
Or why was Burton built on Trent?<br/>
Oh many a peer of England brews<br/>
Livelier liquor than the Muse,<br/>
And malt does more than Milton can<br/>
To justify God's ways to man.<br/>
Ale, man, ale's the stuff to drink<br/>
For fellows whom it hurts to think:<br/>
Look into the pewter pot<br/>
To see the world as the world's not.<br/>
And faith, 'tis pleasant till 'tis past:<br/>
The mischief is that 'twill not last.<br/>
Oh I have been to Ludlow fair<br/>
And left my necktie God knows where,<br/>
And carried half way home, or near,<br/>
Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer:<br/>
Then the world seemed none so bad,<br/>
And I myself a sterling lad;<br/>
And down in lovely muck I've lain,<br/>
Happy till I woke again.<br/>
Then I saw the morning sky:<br/>
Heigho, the tale was all a lie;<br/>
The world, it was the old world yet,<br/>
I was I, my things were wet,<br/>
And nothing now remained to do<br/>
But begin the game anew.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, since the world has still<br/>
Much good, but much less good than ill,<br/>
And while the sun and moon endure<br/>
Luck's a chance, but trouble's sure,<br/>
I'd face it as a wise man would,<br/>
And train for ill and not for good.<br/>
'Tis true, the stuff I bring for sale<br/>
Is not so brisk a brew as ale:<br/>
Out of a stem that scored the hand<br/>
I wrung it in a weary land.<br/>
But take it: if the smack is sour<br/>
The better for the embittered hour;<br/>
It will do good to heart and head<br/>
When your soul is in my soul's stead;<br/>
And I will friend you, if I may,<br/>
In the dark and cloudy day.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a king reigned in the East:<br/>
There, when kings will sit to feast,<br/>
They get their fill before they think<br/>
With poisoned meat and poisoned drink.<br/>
He gathered all that sprang to birth<br/>
From the many-venomed earth;<br/>
First a little, thence to more,<br/>
He sampled all her killing store;<br/>
And easy, smiling, seasoned sound,<br/>
Sate the king when healths went round.<br/>
They put arsenic in his meat<br/>
And stared aghast to watch him eat;<br/>
They poured strychnine in his cup<br/>
And shook to see him drink it up:<br/>
They shook, they stared as white's their shirt:<br/>
Them it was their poison hurt.<br/>
&#151;I tell the tale that I heard told.<br/>
Mithridates, he died old.<br/>

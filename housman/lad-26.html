<h1>A Shropshire Lad</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>XXVI</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the field as we came by<br/>
A year ago, my love and I,<br/>
The aspen over stile and stone<br/>
Was talking to itself alone.<br/>
"Oh who are these that hiss and pass?<br/>
A country lover and his lass;<br/>
Two lovers looking to be wed;<br/>
And time shall put them both to bed,<br/>
But she shall lie with earth above,<br/>
And he beside another love."<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sure enough beneath the tree<br/>
There walks another love with me,<br/>
And overhead the aspen heaves<br/>
Its rainy-sounding silver leaves;<br/>
And I spell nothing in their stir,<br/>
But now perhaps they speak to her,<br/>
And plain for her to understand<br/>
They talk about a time at hand<br/>
When I shall sleep with clover clad,<br/>
And she beside another lad.<br/>

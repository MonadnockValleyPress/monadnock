<h1>A Shropshire Lad</h1>
<h2>by A.E. Housman</h2>
<h3>XLI</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own shire, if I was sad,<br/>
Homely comforters I had:<br/>
The earth, because my heart was sore,<br/>
Sorrowed for the son she bore;<br/>
And standing hills, long to remain,<br/>
Shared their short-lived comrade's pain.<br/>
And bound for the same bourn as I,<br/>
On every road I wandered by,<br/>
Trod beside me, close and dear,<br/>
The beautiful and death-struck year:<br/>
Whether in the woodland brown<br/>
I heard the beechnut rustle down,<br/>
And saw the purple crocus pale<br/>
Flower about the autumn dale;<br/>
Or littering far the fields of May<br/>
Lady-smocks a-bleaching lay,<br/>
And like a skylit water stood<br/>
The bluebells in the azured wood.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yonder, lightening other loads,<br/>
The seasons range the country roads,<br/>
But here in London streets I ken<br/>
No such helpmates, only men;<br/>
And these are not in plight to bear,<br/>
If they would, another's care.<br/>
They have enough as 'tis: I see<br/>
In many an eye that measures me<br/>
The mortal sickness of a mind<br/>
Too unhappy to be kind.<br/>
Undone with misery, all they can<br/>
Is to hate their fellow man;<br/>
And till they drop they needs must still<br/>
Look at you and wish you ill.<br/>

<h1>Thanatopsis</h1>
<h2>by William Cullen Bryant</h2>
<p>
To him who in the love of Nature holds<br/>
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks<br/>
A various language; for his gayer hours<br/>
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile<br/>
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides<br/>
Into his darker musings, with a mild<br/>
And healing sympathy, that steals away<br/>
Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts<br/>
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight<br/>
Over thy spirit, and sad images<br/>
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,<br/>
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,<br/>
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;&mdash;<br/>
Go forth, under the open sky, and list<br/>
To Nature's teachings, while from all around&mdash;<br/>
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air&mdash;<br/>
Comes a still voice&mdash;Yet a few days, and thee<br/>
The all-beholding sun shall see no more<br/>
In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,<br/>
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,<br/>
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist<br/>
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim<br/>
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,<br/>
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up<br/>
Thine individual being, shalt thou go<br/>
To mix for ever with the elements,<br/>
To be a brother to the insensible rock<br/>
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain<br/>
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak<br/>
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet not to thine eternal resting-place<br/>
Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish<br/>
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down<br/>
With patriarchs of the infant world&mdash;with kings,<br/>
The powerful of the earth&mdash;the wise, the good,<br/>
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,<br/>
All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills<br/>
Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,&mdash;the vales<br/>
Stretching in pensive quietness between;<br/>
The venerable woods&mdash;rivers that move<br/>
In majesty, and the complaining brooks<br/>
That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,<br/>
Old Ocean's gray and melancholy waste,&mdash;<br/>
Are but the solemn decorations all<br/>
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,<br/>
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,<br/>
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,<br/>
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread<br/>
The globe are but a handful to the tribes<br/>
That slumber in its bosom.&mdash;- Take the wings<br/>
Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,<br/>
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods<br/>
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,<br/>
Save his own dashings&mdash;yet the dead are there:<br/>
And millions in those solitudes, since first<br/>
The flight of years began, have laid them down<br/>
In their last sleep&mdash;the dead reign there alone,<br/>
So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw<br/>
In silence from the living, and no friend<br/>
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe<br/>
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh<br/>
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care<br/>
Plod on, and each one as before will chase<br/>
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave<br/>
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come<br/>
And make their bed with thee. As the long train<br/>
Of ages glide away, the sons of men,<br/>
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes<br/>
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,<br/>
The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man&mdash;<br/>
Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,<br/>
By those, who in their turn shall follow them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So live, that when thy summons comes to join<br/>
The innumerable caravan, which moves<br/>
To that mysterious realm, where each shall take<br/>
His chamber in the silent halls of death,<br/>
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,<br/>
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed<br/>
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,<br/>
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch<br/>
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.<br/>

<h1>The Snow-Shower</h1>
<h2>by William Cullen Bryant</h2>
<p>
Stand here by my side and turn, I pray,<br/>
On the lake below thy gentle eyes;<br/>
The clouds hang over it, heavy and gray,<br/>
And dark and silent the water lies;<br/>
And out of that frozen mist the snow<br/>
In wavering flakes begins to flow;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flake after flake<br/>
They sink in the dark and silent lake.<br/>
</p>
<p>
See how in a living swarm they come<br/>
From the chambers beyond that misty veil;<br/>
Some hover awhile in air, and some<br/>
Rush prone from the sky like summer hail.<br/>
All, dropping swiftly or settling slow,<br/>
Meet, and are still in the depths below;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flake after flake<br/>
Dissolved in the dark and silent lake.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here delicate snow-stars, out of the cloud,<br/>
Come floating downward in airy play,<br/>
Like spangles dropped from the glistening crowd<br/>
That whiten by night the milky way;<br/>
There broader and burlier masses fall;<br/>
The sullen water buries them all&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flake after flake&mdash;<br/>
All drowned in the dark and silent lake.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And some, as on tender wings they glide<br/>
From their chilly birth-cloud, dim and gray,<br/>
Are joined in their fall, and, side by side,<br/>
Come clinging along their unsteady way;<br/>
As friend with friend, or husband with wife,<br/>
Makes hand in hand the passage of life;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each mated flake<br/>
Soon sinks in the dark and silent lake.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Lo! while we are gazing, in swifter haste<br/>
Stream down the snows, till the air is white<br/>
As, myriads by myriads madly chased,<br/>
They fling themselves from their shadowy height.<br/>
The fair, frail creatures of middle sky,<br/>
What speed they make, with their grave so nigh;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flake after flake,<br/>
To lie in the dark and silent lake!<br/>
</p>
<p>
I see in thy gentle eyes a tear;<br/>
They turn to me in sorrowful thought;<br/>
Thou thinkest of friends, the good and dear,<br/>
Who were for a time, and now are not;<br/>
Like these fair children of cloud and frost,<br/>
That glisten a moment and then are lost,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flake after flake&mdash;<br/>
All lost in the dark and silent lake.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet look again, for the clouds divide;<br/>
A gleam of blue on the water lies;<br/>
And far away, on the mountain-side,<br/>
A sunbeam falls from the opening skies,<br/>
But the hurrying host that flew between<br/>
The cloud and the water, no more is seen;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flake after flake,<br/>
At rest in the dark and silent lake.<br/>

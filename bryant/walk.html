<h1>My Autumn Walk</h1>
<h2>by William Cullen Bryant</h2>
<p>
On woodlands ruddy with autumn<br/>
The amber sunshine lies;<br/>
I look on the beauty round me,<br/>
And tears come into my eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For the wind that sweeps the meadows<br/>
Blows out of the far Southwest,<br/>
Where our gallant men are fighting,<br/>
And the gallant dead are at rest.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The golden-rod is leaning,<br/>
And the purple aster waves<br/>
In a breeze from the land of battles,<br/>
A breath from the land of graves.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Full fast the leaves are dropping<br/>
Before that wandering breath;<br/>
As fast, on the field of battle,<br/>
Our brethren fall in death.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Beautiful over my pathway<br/>
The forest spoils are shed;<br/>
They are spotting the grassy hillocks<br/>
With purple and gold and red.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Beautiful is the death-sleep<br/>
Of those who bravely fight<br/>
In their country's holy quarrel,<br/>
And perish for the Right.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But who shall comfort the living,<br/>
The light of whose homes is gone:<br/>
The bride that, early widowed,<br/>
Lives broken-hearted on;<br/>
</p>
<p>
The matron whose sons are lying<br/>
In graves on a distant shore;<br/>
The maiden, whose promised husband<br/>
Comes back from the war no more?<br/>
</p>
<p>
I look on the peaceful dwellings<br/>
Whose windows glimmer in sight,<br/>
With croft and garden and orchard,<br/>
That bask in the mellow light;<br/>
</p>
<p>
And I know that, when our couriers<br/>
With news of victory come,<br/>
They will bring a bitter message<br/>
Of hopeless grief to some.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again I turn to the woodlands,<br/>
And shudder as I see<br/>
The mock-grape's blood-red banner<br/>
Hung out on the cedar-tree;<br/>
</p>
<p>
And I think of days of slaughter,<br/>
And the night-sky red with flames,<br/>
On the Chattahoochee's meadows,<br/>
And the wasted banks of the James.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh, for the fresh spring-season,<br/>
When the groves are in their prime;<br/>
And far away in the future<br/>
Is the frosty autumn-time!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh, for that better season,<br/>
When the pride of the foe shall yield,<br/>
And the hosts of God and Freedom<br/>
March back from the well-won field;<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the matron shall clasp her first-born<br/>
With tears of joy and pride;<br/>
And the scarred and war-worn lover<br/>
Shall claim his promised bride!<br/>
</p>
<p>
The leaves are swept from the branches;<br/>
But the living buds are there,<br/>
With folded flower and foliage,<br/>
To sprout in a kinder air.<br/>
</p>
<p>&mdash;October, 1864.</p>

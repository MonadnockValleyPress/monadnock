<h1>The Flood of Years</h1>
<h2>by William Cullen Bryant</h2>
<p>
A mighty Hand, from an exhaustless Urn,<br/>
Pours forth the never-ending Flood of Years,<br/>
Among the nations. How the rushing waves<br/>
Bear all before them! On their foremost edge,<br/>
And there alone, is Life. The Present there<br/>
Tosses and foams, and fills the air with roar<br/>
Of mingled noises. There are they who toil,<br/>
And they who strive, and they who feast, and they<br/>
Who hurry to and fro. The sturdy swain—<br/>
Woodman and delver with the spade—is there,<br/>
And busy artisan beside his bench,<br/>
And pallid student with his written roll.<br/>
A moment on the mounting billow seen,<br/>
The flood sweeps over them and they are gone.<br/>
There groups of revellers whose brows are twined<br/>
With roses, ride the topmost swell awhile,<br/>
And as they raise their flowing cups and touch<br/>
The clinking brim to brim, are whirled beneath<br/>
The waves and disappear. I hear the jar<br/>
Of beaten drums, and thunders that break forth<br/>
From cannon, where the advancing billow sends<br/>
Up to the sight long files of armèd men,<br/>
That hurry to the charge through flame and smoke.<br/>
The torrent bears them under, whelmed and hid<br/>
Slayer and slain, in heaps of bloody foam.<br/>
Down go the steed and rider, the plumed chief<br/>
Sinks with his followers; the head that wears<br/>
The imperial diadem goes down beside<br/>
The felon's with cropped ear and branded cheek.<br/>
A funeral-train—the torrent sweeps away<br/>
Bearers and bier and mourners. By the bed<br/>
Of one who dies men gather sorrowing,<br/>
And women weep aloud; the flood rolls on;<br/>
The wail is stifled and the sobbing group<br/>
Borne under. Hark to that shrill, sudden shout,<br/>
The cry of an applauding multitude,<br/>
Swayed by some loud-voiced orator who wields<br/>
The living mass as if he were its soul!<br/>
The waters choke the shout and all is still.<br/>
Lo! next a kneeling crowd, and one who spreads<br/>
The hands in prayer—the engulfing wave o'ertakes<br/>
And swallows them and him. A sculptor wields<br/>
The chisel, and the stricken marble grows<br/>
To beauty; at his easel, eager-eyed,<br/>
A painter stands, and sunshine at his touch<br/>
Gathers upon his canvas, and life glows;<br/>
A poet, as he paces to and fro,<br/>
Murmurs his sounding lines. Awhile they ride<br/>
The advancing billow, till its tossing crest<br/>
Strikes them and flings them under, while their tasks<br/>
Are yet unfinished. See a mother smile<br/>
On her young babe that smiles to her again;<br/>
The torrent wrests it from her arms; she shrieks<br/>
And weeps, and midst her tears is carried down.<br/>
A beam like that of moonlight turns the spray<br/>
To glistening pearls; two lovers, hand in hand,<br/>
Rise on the billowy swell and fondly look<br/>
Into each other's eyes. The rushing flood<br/>
Flings them apart: the youth goes down; the maid<br/>
With hands outstretched in vain, and streaming eyes,<br/>
Waits for the next high wave to follow him.<br/>
An aged man succeeds; his bending form<br/>
Sinks slowly. Mingling with the sullen stream<br/>
Gleam the white locks, and then are seen no more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Lo! wider grows the stream—a sea-like flood<br/>
Saps earth's walled cities; massive palaces<br/>
Crumble before it; fortresses and towers<br/>
Dissolve in the swift waters; populous realms<br/>
Swept by the torrent see their ancient tribes<br/>
Engulfed and lost; their very languages<br/>
Stifled, and never to be uttered more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I pause and turn my eyes, and looking back<br/>
Where that tumultuous flood has been, I see<br/>
The silent ocean of the Past, a waste<br/>
Of waters weltering over graves, its shores<br/>
Strewn with the wreck of fleets where mast and hull<br/>
Drop away piecemeal; battlemented walls<br/>
Frown idly, green with moss, and temples stand<br/>
Unroofed, forsaken by the worshipper.<br/>
There lie memorial stones, whence time has gnawed<br/>
The graven legends, thrones of kings o'erturned,<br/>
The broken altars of forgotten gods,<br/>
Foundations of old cities and long streets<br/>
Where never fall of human foot is heard,<br/>
On all the desolate pavement. I behold<br/>
Dim glimmerings of lost jewels, far within<br/>
The sleeping waters, diamond, sardonyx,<br/>
Ruby and topaz, pearl and chrysolite,<br/>
Once glittering at the banquet on fair brows<br/>
That long ago were dust, and all around<br/>
Strewn on the surface of that silent sea<br/>
Are withering bridal wreaths, and glossy locks<br/>
Shorn from dear brows, by loving hands, and scrolls<br/>
O'er written, haply with fond words of love<br/>
And vows of friendship, and fair pages flung<br/>
Fresh from the printer's engine. There they lie<br/>
A moment, and then sink away from sight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I look, and the quick tears are in my eyes,<br/>
For I behold in every one of these<br/>
A blighted hope, a separate history<br/>
Of human sorrows, telling of dear ties<br/>
Suddenly broken, dreams of happiness<br/>
Dissolved in air, and happy days too brief<br/>
That sorrowfully ended, and I think<br/>
How painfully must the poor heart have beat<br/>
In bosoms without number, as the blow<br/>
Was struck that slew their hope and broke their peace.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sadly I turn and look before, where yet<br/>
The Flood must pass, and I behold a mist<br/>
Where swarm dissolving forms, the brood of Hope,<br/>
Divinely fair, that rest on banks of flowers,<br/>
Or wander among rainbows, fading soon<br/>
And reappearing, haply giving place<br/>
To forms of grisly aspect such as Fear<br/>
Shapes from the idle air—where serpents lift<br/>
The head to strike, and skeletons stretch forth<br/>
The bony arm in menace. Further on<br/>
A belt of darkness seems to bar the way<br/>
Long, low, and distant, where the Life to come<br/>
Touches the Life that is. The Flood of Years<br/>
Rolls toward it near and nearer. It must pass<br/>
That dismal barrier. What is there beyond?<br/>
Hear what the wise and good have said. Beyond<br/>
That belt of darkness, still the Years roll on<br/>
More gently, but with not less mighty sweep.<br/>
They gather up again and softly bear<br/>
All the sweet lives that late were overwhelmed<br/>
And lost to sight, all that in them was good,<br/>
Noble, and truly great, and worthy of love—<br/>
The lives of infants and ingenuous youths,<br/>
Sages and saintly women who have made<br/>
Their households happy; all are raised and borne<br/>
By that great current in its onward sweep,<br/>
Wandering and rippling with caressing waves<br/>
Around green islands with the breath<br/>
Of flowers that never wither. So they pass<br/>
From stage to stage along the shining course<br/>
Of that bright river, broadening like a sea.<br/>
As its smooth eddies curl along their way<br/>
They bring old friends together; hands are clasped<br/>
In joy unspeakable; the mother's arms<br/>
Again are folded round the child she loved<br/>
And lost. Old sorrows are forgotten now,<br/>
Or but remembered to make sweet the hour<br/>
That overpays them; wounded hearts that bled<br/>
Or broke are healed forever. In the room<br/>
Of this grief-shadowed present, there shall be<br/>
A Present in whose reign no grief shall gnaw<br/>
The heart, and never shall a tender tie<br/>
Be broken; in whose reign the eternal Change<br/>
That waits on growth and action shall proceed<br/>
With everlasting Concord hand in hand.<br/>

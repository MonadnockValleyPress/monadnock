<h1>The Planting of the Apple-Tree</h1>
<h2>by William Cullen Bryant</h2>
<p>
Come, let us plant the apple-tree.<br/>
Cleave the tough greensward with the spade;<br/>
Wide let its hollow bed be made;<br/>
There gently lay the roots, and there<br/>
Sift the dark mould with kindly care,<br/>
And press it o'er them tenderly,<br/>
As, round the sleeping infant's feet,<br/>
We softly fold the cradle-sheet:<br/>
So plant we the apple-tree.<br/>
</p>
<p>
What plant we in this apple-tree?<br/>
Buds, which the breath of summer days<br/>
Shall lengthen into leafy sprays;<br/>
Boughs where the thrush, with crimson breast,<br/>
Shall haunt and sing and hide her nest;<br/>
We plant, upon the sunny lea,<br/>
A shadow for the noontide hour,<br/>
A shelter from the summer shower,<br/>
When we plant the apple-tree.<br/>
</p>
<p>
What plant we in this apple-tree?<br/>
Sweets for a hundred flowery springs<br/>
To load the May-wind's restless wings,<br/>
When, from the orchard-row, he pours<br/>
Its fragrance through our open doors;<br/>
A world of blossoms for the bee,<br/>
Flowers for the sick girl's silent room,<br/>
For the glad infant sprigs of bloom,<br/>
We plant with the apple-tree.<br/>
</p>
<p>
What plant we in this apple-tree?<br/>
Fruits that shall swell in sunny June,<br/>
And redden in the August noon,<br/>
And drop, when gentle airs come by,<br/>
That fan the blue September sky,<br/>
While children come, with cries of glee,<br/>
And seek them where the fragrant grass<br/>
Betrays their bed to those who pass,<br/>
At the foot of the apple-tree.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And when, above this apple-tree,<br/>
The winter stars are quivering bright,<br/>
And winds go howling through the night,<br/>
Girls, whose young eyes o'erflow with mirth,<br/>
Shall peel its fruit by cottage-hearth,<br/>
And guests in prouder homes shall see,<br/>
Heaped with the grape of Cintra's vine<br/>
And golden orange of the line,<br/>
The fruit of the apple-tree.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The fruitage of this apple-tree<br/>
Winds and our flag of stripe and star<br/>
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar,<br/>
Where men shall wonder at the view,<br/>
And ask in what fair groves they grew;<br/>
And sojourners beyond the sea<br/>
Shall think of childhood's careless day,<br/>
And long, long hours of summer play,<br/>
In the shade of the apple-tree.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Each year shall give this apple-tree<br/>
A broader flush of roseate bloom,<br/>
A deeper maze of verdurous gloom,<br/>
And loosen, when the frost-clouds lower,<br/>
The crisp brown leaves in thicker shower.<br/>
The years shall come and pass, but we<br/>
Shall hear no longer, where we lie,<br/>
The summer's songs, the autumn's sigh,<br/>
In the boughs of the apple-tree.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And time shall waste this apple-tree.<br/>
Oh, when its aged branches throw<br/>
Thin shadows on the ground below,<br/>
Shall fraud and force and iron will<br/>
Oppress the weak and helpless still?<br/>
What shall the tasks of mercy be,<br/>
Amid the toils, the strifes, the tears<br/>
Of those who live when length of years<br/>
Is wasting this little apple-tree?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Who planted this old apple-tree?"<br/>
The children of that distant day<br/>
Thus to some aged man shall say;<br/>
And, gazing on its mossy stem,<br/>
The gray-haired man shall answer them:<br/>
"A poet of the land was he,<br/>
Born in the rude but good old times;<br/>
'Tis said he made some quaint old rhymes,<br/>
On planting the apple-tree."<br/>

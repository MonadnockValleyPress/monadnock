<h1>A Scene on the Banks of the Hudson</h1>
<h2>by William Cullen Bryant</h2>
<p>
Cool shades and dews are round my way,<br/>
And silence of the early day;<br/>
Mid the dark rocks that watch his bed,<br/>
Glitters the mighty Hudson spread,<br/>
Unrippled, save by drops that fall<br/>
From shrubs that fringe his mountain wall;<br/>
And o'er the clear still water swells<br/>
The music of the Sabbath bells.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All, save this little nook of land,<br/>
Circled with trees, on which I stand;<br/>
All, save that line of hills which lie<br/>
Suspended in the mimic sky&mdash;<br/>
Seems a blue void, above, below,<br/>
Through which the white clouds come and go;<br/>
And from the green world's farthest steep<br/>
I gaze into the airy deep.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Loveliest of lovely things are they,<br/>
On earth, that soonest pass away.<br/>
The rose that lives its little hour<br/>
Is prized beyond the sculptured flower.<br/>
Even love, long tried and cherished long,<br/>
Becomes more tender and more strong<br/>
At thought of that insatiate grave<br/>
From which its yearnings cannot save.<br/>
</p>
<p>
River! in this still hour thou hast<br/>
Too much of heaven on earth to last;<br/>
Nor long may thy still waters lie,<br/>
An image of the glorious sky.<br/>
Thy fate and mine are not repose,<br/>
And ere another evening close,<br/>
Thou to thy tides shalt turn again,<br/>
And I to seek the crowd of men.<br/>
</p>

<h1>I Broke the Spell That Held Me Long</h1>
<h2>by William Cullen Bryant</h2>
<p>
I broke the spell that held me long,<br/>
The dear, dear witchery of song.<br/>
I said, the poet's idle lore<br/>
Shall waste my prime of years no more,<br/>
For Poetry, though heavenly born,<br/>
Consorts with poverty and scorn.
</p>
<p>
I broke the spell&mdash;nor deemed its power<br/>
Could fetter me another hour.<br/>
Ah, thoughtless! how could I forget<br/>
Its causes were around me yet?<br/>
For wheresoe'er I looked, the while,<br/>
Was Nature's everlasting smile.
</p>
<p>
Still came and lingered on my sight<br/>
Of flowers and streams the bloom and light,<br/>
And glory of the stars and sun;&mdash;<br/>
And these and poetry are one.<br/>
They, ere the world had held me long,<br/>
Recalled me to the love of song.

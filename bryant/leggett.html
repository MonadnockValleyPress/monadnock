<h1>In Memory of William Leggett</h1>
<h2>by William Cullen Bryant</h2>
<p>
The earth may ring, from shore to shore,<br/>
With echoes of a glorious name,<br/>
But he, whose loss our tears deplore,<br/>
Has left behind him more than fame.
</p>
<p>
For when the death-frost came to lie<br/>
On Leggett's warm and mighty heart,<br/>
And quench his bold and friendly eye,<br/>
His spirit did not all depart.
</p>
<p>
The words of fire that from his pen<br/>
Were flung upon the fervid page,<br/>
Still move, still shake the hearts of men,<br/>
Amid a cold and coward age.
</p>
<p>
His love of truth, too warm, too strong<br/>
For Hope or Fear to chain or chill,<br/>
His hate of tyranny and wrong,<br/>
Burn in the breasts he kindled still.
</p>

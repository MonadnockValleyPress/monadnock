<h1>Oh Fairest of the Rural Maids</h1>
<h2>by William Cullen Bryant</h2>
<p>
Oh fairest of the rural maids!<br/>
Thy birth was in the forest shades;<br/>
Green boughs, and glimpses of the sky,<br/>
Were all that met thine infant eye.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thy sports, thy wanderings, when a child,<br/>
Were ever in the sylvan wild;<br/>
And all the beauty of the place<br/>
Is in thy heart and on thy face.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The twilight of the trees and rocks<br/>
Is in the light shade of thy locks;<br/>
Thy step is as the wind, that weaves<br/>
Its playful way among the leaves.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thine eyes are springs, in whose serene<br/>
And silent waters heaven is seen;<br/>
Their lashes are the herbs that look<br/>
On their young figures in the brook.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The forest depths, by foot unpressed,<br/>
Are not more sinless than thy breast;<br/>
The holy peace, that fills the air<br/>
Of those calm solitudes, is there.<br/>
</p>

<h1>Not Yet</h1>
<h2>by William Cullen Bryant</h2>
<p>
Oh country, marvel of the earth!<br/>
Oh realm to sudden greatness grown!<br/>
The age that gloried in thy birth,<br/>
Shall it behold thee overthrown?<br/>
Shall traitors lay that greatness low?<br/>
No, land of Hope and Blessing, No!<br/>
</p>
<p>
And we, who wear thy glorious name,<br/>
Shall we, like cravens, stand apart,<br/>
When those whom thou hast trusted aim<br/>
The death-blow at thy generous heart?<br/>
Forth goes the battle-cry, and lo!<br/>
Hosts rise in harness, shouting, No!<br/>
</p>
<p>
And they who founded, in our land,<br/>
The power that rules from sea to sea,<br/>
Bled they in vain, or vainly planned<br/>
To leave their country great and free?<br/>
Their sleeping ashes, from below,<br/>
Send up the thrilling murmur, No!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Knit they the gentle ties which long<br/>
These sister States were proud to wear,<br/>
And forged the kindly links so strong<br/>
For idle hands in sport to tear?<br/>
For scornful hands aside to throw?<br/>
No, by our fathers' memory, No!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Our humming marts, our iron ways,<br/>
Our wind-tossed woods on mountain-crest,<br/>
The hoarse Atlantic, with its bays,<br/>
The calm, broad Ocean of the West,<br/>
And Mississippi's torrent-flow,<br/>
And loud Niagara, answer, No!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Not yet the hour is nigh when they<br/>
Who deep in Eld's dim twilight sit,<br/>
Earth's ancient kings, shall rise and say,<br/>
"Proud country, welcome to the pit!<br/>
So soon art thou, like us, brought low!"<br/>
No, sullen group of shadows, No!<br/>
</p>
<p>
For now, behold, the arm that gave<br/>
The victory in our fathers' day,<br/>
Strong, as of old, to guard and save&mdash;<br/>
That mighty arm which none can stay&mdash;<br/>
On clouds above and fields below,<br/>
Writes, in men's sight, the answer, No!<br/>
<p>&mdash;July, 1861.</p>

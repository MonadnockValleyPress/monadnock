<h1>Leaves of Grass</h1>
<h2>(1855 Edition)</h2>
<h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
<h3>A Song for Occupations</h3>
<p>
Come closer to me,<br/>
Push close my lovers and take the best I possess,<br/>
Yield closer and closer and give me the best you possess.
</p>
<p>
This is unfinished business with me . . . . how is it with you?<br/>
I was chilled with the cold types and cylinder and wet paper between us.
</p>
<p>
I pass so poorly with paper and types . . . . I must pass with the contact of bodies and souls.
</p>
<p>
I do not thank you for liking me as I am, and liking the touch of me . . . . I know that it is good for you to do so.
</p>
<p>
Were all educations practical and ornamental well displayed out of me, what would it amount to?<br/>
Were I as the head teacher or charitable proprietor or wise statesman, what would it amount to?<br/>
Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you, would that satisfy you?
</p>
<p>
The learned and virtuous and benevolent, and the usual terms;<br/>
A man like me, and never the usual terms.
</p>
<p>
Neither a servant nor a master am I,<br/>
I take no sooner a large price than a small price . . . . I will have my own whoever enjoys me,<br/>
I will be even with you, and you shall be even with me.
</p>
<p>
If you are a workman or workwoman I stand as nigh as the nighest that works in the same shop,<br/>
If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend, I demand as good as your brother or dearest friend,<br/>
If your lover or husband or wife is welcome by day or night, I must be personally as welcome;<br/>
If you have become degraded or ill, then I will become so for your sake;<br/>
If you remember your foolish and outlawed deeds, do you think I cannot remember my foolish and outlawed deeds?<br/>
If you carouse at the table I say I will carouse at the opposite side of the table;<br/>
If you meet some stranger in the street and love him or her, do I not often meet strangers in the street and love them?<br/>
If you see a good deal remarkable in me I see just as much remarkable in you.
</p>
<p>
Why what have you thought of yourself?<br/>
Is it you then that thought yourself less?<br/>
Is it you that thought the President greater than you? or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than you?
</p>
<p>
Because you are greasy or pimpled  &mdash;  or that you was once drunk, or a thief, or diseased, or rheumatic, or a prostitute  &mdash;  or are so now  &mdash;  or from frivolity or impotence  &mdash;  or that you are no scholar, and never saw your name in print . . . . do you give in that you are any less immortal?
</p>
<p>
Souls of men and women! it is not you I call unseen, unheard, untouchable and untouching;<br/>
It is not you I go argue pro and con about, and to settle whether you are alive or no;<br/>
I own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns . . . . and see and hear you, and what you give and take;<br/>
What is there you cannot give and take?
</p>
<p>
I see not merely that you are polite or whitefaced . . . . married or single . . . . citizens of old states or citizens of new states . . . . eminent in some profession . . . . a lady or gentleman in a parlor . . . . or dressed in the jail uniform . . . . or pulpit uniform,<br/>
Not only the free Utahan, Kansian, or Arkansian . . . . not only the free Cuban . . . not merely the slave . . . . not Mexican native, or Flatfoot, or negro from Africa,<br/>
Iroquois eating the warflesh  &mdash;  fishtearer in his lair of rocks and sand . . . . Esquimaux in the dark cold snowhouse . . . . Chinese with his transverse eyes . . . . Bedowee  &mdash;  or wandering nomad  &mdash;  or tabounschik at the head of his droves,<br/>
Grown, half-grown, and babe  &mdash;  of this country and every country, indoors and outdoors I see . . . . and all else is behind or through them.
</p>
<p>
The wife  &mdash;  and she is not one jot less than the husband,<br/>
The daughter  &mdash;  and she is just as good as the son,<br/>
The mother  &mdash;  and she is every bit as much as the father.
</p>
<p>
Offspring of those not rich  &mdash;  boys apprenticed to trades,<br/>
Young fellows working on farms and old fellows working on farms;<br/>
The naive . . . . the simple and hardy . . . . he going to the polls to vote . . . . he who has a good time, and he who has a bad time;<br/>
Mechanics, southerners, new arrivals, sailors, mano'warsmen, merchantmen, coasters,<br/>
All these I see . . . . but nigher and farther the same I see;<br/>
None shall escape me, and none shall wish to escape me.
</p>
<p>
I bring what you much need, yet always have,<br/>
I bring not money or amours or dress or eating . . . . but I bring as good;<br/>
And send no agent or medium . . . . and offer no representative of value  &mdash;  but offer the value itself.
</p>
<p>
There is something that comes home to one now and perpetually,<br/>
It is not what is printed or preached or discussed . . . . it eludes discussion and print,<br/>
It is not to be put in a book . . . . it is not in this book,<br/>
It is for you whoever you are . . . . it is no farther from you than your hearing and sight are from you,<br/>
It is hinted by nearest and commonest and readiest . . . . it is not them, though it is endlessly provoked by them . . . . What is there ready and near you now?
</p>
<p>
You may read in many languages and read nothing about it;<br/>
You may read the President's message and read nothing about it there,<br/>
Nothing in the reports from the state department or treasury department . . . . or in the daily papers, or the weekly papers,<br/>
Or in the census returns or assessors' returns or prices current or any accounts of stock.
</p>
<p>
The sun and stars that float in the open air . . . . the appleshaped earth and we upon it . . . . surely the drift of them is something grand;<br/>
I do not know what it is except that it is grand, and that it is happiness,<br/>
And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation, or bon-mot or reconnoissance,<br/>
And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for us, and without luck must be a failure for us,<br/>
And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain contingency.
</p>
<p>
The light and shade  &mdash;  the curious sense of body and identity  &mdash;  the greed that with perfect complaisance devours all things  &mdash;  the endless pride and outstretching of man  &mdash;  unspeakable joys and sorrows,<br/>
The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees . . . . and the wonders that fill each minute of time forever and each acre of surface and space forever,<br/>
Have you reckoned them as mainly for a trade or farmwork? or for the profits of a store? or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman's leisure or a lady's leisure?
</p>
<p>
Have you reckoned the landscape took substance and form that it might be painted in a picture?<br/>
Or men and women that they might be written of, and songs sung?<br/>
Or the attraction of gravity and the great laws and harmonious combinations and the fluids of the air as subjects for the savans?<br/>
Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?<br/>
Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?<br/>
Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables or agriculture itself?
</p>
<p>
Old institutions . . . . these arts libraries legends collections  &mdash;  and the practice handed along in manufactures . . . . will we rate them so high?<br/>
Will we rate our prudence and business so high? . . . . I have no objection,<br/>
I rate them as high as the highest . . . . but a child born of a woman and man I rate beyond all rate.
</p>
<p>
We thought our Union grand and our Constitution grand;<br/>
I do not say they are not grand and good  &mdash;  for they are,<br/>
I am this day just as much in love with them as you,<br/>
But I am eternally in love with you and with all my fellows upon the earth.
</p>
<p>
We consider the bibles and religions divine . . . . I do not say they are not divine,<br/>
I say they have all grown out of you and may grow out of you still,<br/>
It is not they who give the life . . . . it is you who give the life;<br/>
Leaves are not more shed from the trees or trees from the earth than they are shed out of you.
</p>
<p>
The sum of all known value and respect I add up in you whoever you are;<br/>
The President is up there in the White House for you . . . . it is not you who are here for him,<br/>
The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you . . . . not you here for them,<br/>
The Congress convenes every December for you,<br/>
Laws, courts, the forming of states, the charters of cities, the going and coming of commerce and mails are all for you.
</p>
<p>
All doctrines, all politics and civilization exurge from you,<br/>
All sculpture and monuments and anything inscribed anywhere are tallied in you,<br/>
The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records reach is in you this hour  &mdash;  and myths and tales the same;<br/>
If you were not breathing and walking here where would they all be?<br/>
The most renowned poems would be ashes . . . . orations and plays would be vacuums.
</p>
<p>
All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it;<br/>
Did you think it was in the white or gray stone? or the lines of the arches and cornices?
</p>
<p>
All music is what awakens from you when you are reminded by the instruments,<br/>
It is not the violins and the cornets . . . . it is not the oboe nor the beating drums  &mdash;  nor the notes of the baritone singer singing his sweet romanza . . . . nor those of the men's chorus, nor those of the women's chorus,<br/>
It is nearer and farther than they.
</p>
<p>
Will the whole come back then?<br/>
Can each see the signs of the best by a look in the lookingglass? Is there nothing greater or more?<br/>
Does all sit there with you and here with me?
</p>
<p>
The old forever new things . . . . you foolish child! . . . . the closest simplest things  &mdash;  this moment with you,<br/>
Your person and every particle that relates to your person,<br/>
The pulses of your brain waiting their chance and encouragement at every deed or sight;<br/>
Anything you do in public by day, and anything you do in secret betweendays,<br/>
What is called right and what is called wrong . . . . what you behold or touch . . . . what causes your anger or wonder,<br/>
The anklechain of the slave, the bed of the bedhouse, the cards of the gambler, the plates of the forger;<br/>
What is seen or learned in the street, or intuitively learned,<br/>
What is learned in the public school  &mdash;  spelling, reading, writing and ciphering . . . . the blackboard and the teacher's diagrams:<br/>
The panes of the windows and all that appears through them . . . . the going forth in the morning and the aimless spending of the day;<br/>
(What is it that you made money? what is it that you got what you wanted?)<br/>
The usual routine . . . . the workshop, factory, yard, office, store, or desk;<br/>

The plumbob and trowel and level . . the wall-scaffold, and the work of walls and ceilings . . or any mason-work:<br/>

The sloop's tiller . . the pilot's wheel and bell . . the yacht or fish-smack . . the great gay-pennanted three-hundred-foot steamboat under full headway, with her proud fat breasts and her delicate swift-flashing paddles;<br/>

Smallarms and rifles . . . . the powder and shot and caps and wadding . . . . the ordnance for war . . . . the carriages:<br/>

City and country . . fireplace and candle . . gaslight and heater and aqueduct;<br/>
The message of the governor, mayor, or chief of police . . . . the dishes of breakfast or dinner or supper;<br/>
The bunkroom, the fire-engine, the string-team, and the car or truck behind;<br/>
The paper I write on or you write on . . and every word we write . . and every cross and twirl of the pen . . and the curious way we write what we think . . . . yet very faintly;<br/>
The directory, the detector, the ledger . . . . the books in ranks or the bookshelves . . . . the clock attached to the wall,<br/>
The ring on your finger . . the lady's wristlet . . the hammers of stonebreakers or coppersmiths . . the druggist's vials and jars;<br/>
The etui of surgical instruments, and the etui of oculist's or aurist's instruments, or dentist's instruments;<br/>
Glassblowing, grinding of wheat and corn . . casting, and what is cast . . tinroofing, shingledressing,<br/>

Ironworks or whiteleadworks . . the sugarhouse . . steam-saws, and the great mills and factories;<br/>

Billiards and tenpins . . . . the ladders and hanging ropes of the gymnasium, and the manly exercises;<br/>
The designs for wallpapers or oilcloths or carpets . . . . the fancies for goods for women . . . . the bookbinder's stamps;<br/>
Leatherdressing, coachmaking, boilermaking, ropetwisting, distilling, signpainting, limeburning, coopering, cottonpicking,<br/>
The walkingbeam of the steam-engine . . the throttle and governors, and the up and down rods,<br/>
Stavemachines and plainingmachines . . . . the cart of the carman . . the omnibus . . the ponderous dray;<br/>
The snowplough and two engines pushing it . . . . the ride in the express train of only one car . . . . the swift go through a howling storm:<br/>

In them the heft of the heaviest . . . . in them far more than you estimated, and far less also,<br/>
In them, not yourself . . . . you and your soul enclose all things, regardless of estimation,<br/>
In them your themes and hints and provokers . . if not, the whole earth has no themes or hints or provokers, and never had.
</p>
<p>
I do not affirm what you see beyond is futile . . . . I do not advise you to stop,<br/>
I do not say leadings you thought great are not great,<br/>
But I say that none lead to greater or sadder or happier than those lead to.
</p>
<p>
Will you seek afar off? You surely come back at last,<br/>
In things best known to you finding the best or as good as the best,<br/>
In folks nearest to you finding also the sweetest and strongest and lovingest,<br/>
Happiness not in another place, but this place . . not for another hour, but this hour,<br/>
Man in the first you see or touch . . . . always in your friend or brother or nighest neighbor . . . . Woman in your mother or lover or wife,<br/>
And all else thus far known giving place to men and women.
</p>
<p>
When the psalm sings instead of the singer,<br/>
When the script preaches instead of the preacher,<br/>
When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that carved the supporting desk,<br/>
When the sacred vessels or the bits of the eucharist, or the lath and plast, procreate as effectually as the young silversmiths or bakers, or the masons in their overalls,<br/>
When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman and child convince,<br/>
When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the nightwatchman's daughter,<br/>
When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite and are my friendly companions,<br/>
I intend to reach them my hand and make as much of them as I do of men and women.

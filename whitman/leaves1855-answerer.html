<h1>Leaves of Grass</h1>
<h2>(1855 Edition)</h2>
<h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
<h3>Song of the Answerer</h3>
<p>
A young man came to me with a message from his brother,<br/>
How should the young man know the whether and when of his brother?<br/>
Tell him to send me the signs.
</p>
<p>
And I stood before the young man face to face, and took his right hand in my left hand and his left hand in my right hand,<br/>
And I answered for his brother and for men . . . . and I answered for the poet, and sent these signs.
</p>
<p>
Him all wait for . . . . him all yield up to . . . . his word is decisive and final,<br/>
Him they accept . . . . in him lave . . . . in him perceive themselves as amid light,<br/>
Him they immerse, and he immerses them.
</p>
<p>
Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape, people and animals,<br/>
The profound earth and its attributes, and the unquiet ocean,<br/>
All enjoyments and properties, and money, and whatever money will buy,<br/>
The best farms . . . . others toiling and planting, and he unavoidably reaps,<br/>
The noblest and costliest cities . . . . others grading and building, and he domiciles there;<br/>
Nothing for any one but what is for him . . . . near and far are for him,<br/>
The ships in the offing . . . . the perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for any body.
</p>
<p>
He puts things in their attitudes,<br/>
He puts today out of himself with plasticity and love,<br/>
He places his own city, times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and sisters, associations employment and politics, so that the rest never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them.
</p>
<p>
He is the answerer,<br/>
What can be answered he answers, and what cannot be answered he shows how it cannot be answered.
</p>
<p>
A man is a summons and challenge,<br/>
It is vain to skulk . . . . Do you hear that mocking and laughter? Do you hear the ironical echoes?
</p>
<p>
Books friendships philosophers priests action pleasure pride beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction;<br/>
He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and down also.
</p>
<p>
Whichever the sex . . . whatever the season or place he may go freshly and gently and safely by day or by night,<br/>
He has the passkey of hearts . . . . to him the response of the prying of hands on the knobs.
</p>
<p>
His welcome is universal . . . . the flow of beauty is not more welcome or universal than he is,<br/>
The person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.
</p>
<p>
Every existence has its idiom . . . . every thing has an idiom and tongue;<br/>
He resolves all tongues into his own, and bestows it upon men . . and any man translates . . and any man translates himself also:<br/>
One part does not counteract another part . . . . He is the joiner . . he sees how they join.
</p>
<p>
He says indifferently and alike, How are you friend? to the President at his levee,<br/>
And he says Good day my brother, to Cudge that hoes in the sugarfield;<br/>
And both understand him and know that his speech is right.
</p>
<p>
He walks with perfect ease in the capitol,<br/>
He walks among the Congress . . . . and one representative says to another, Here is our equal appearing and new.
</p>
<p>
Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,<br/>
And the soldiers suppose him to be a captain . . . . and the sailors that he has followed the sea,<br/>
And the authors take him for an author . . . . and the artists for an artist,<br/>
And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them;<br/>
No matter what the work is, that he is one to follow it or has followed it,<br/>
No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and sisters there.
</p>
<p>
The English believe he comes of their English stock,<br/>
A Jew to the Jew he seems . . . . a Russ to the Russ . . . . usual and near . . removed from none.
</p>
<p>
Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffeehouse claims him,<br/>
The Italian or Frenchman is sure, and the German is sure, and the Spaniard is sure . . . . and the island Cuban is sure.
</p>
<p>
The engineer, the deckhand on the great lakes or on the Mississippi or St Lawrence or Sacramento or Hudson or Delaware claims him.
</p>
<p>
The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood,<br/>
The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see themselves in the ways of him . . . . he strangely transmutes them,<br/>
They are not vile any more . . . . they hardly know themselves, they are so grown.
</p>
<p>
You think it would be good to be the writer of melodious verses,<br/>
Well it would be good to be the writer of melodious verses;<br/>
But what are verses beyond the flowing character you could have? . . . . or beyond beautiful manners and behaviour?<br/>
Or beyond one manly or affectionate deed of an apprenticeboy? . . or old woman? . . or man that has been in prison or is likely to be in prison?

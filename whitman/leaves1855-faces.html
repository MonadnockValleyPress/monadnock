<h1>Leaves of Grass</h1>
<h2>(1855 Edition)</h2>
<h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
<h3>Faces</h3>
<p>
Sauntering the pavement or riding the country byroad here then are faces,<br/>
Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, ideality,<br/>
The spiritual prescient face, the always welcome common benevolent face,<br/>
The face of the singing of music, the grand faces of natural lawyers and judges broad at the backtop,<br/>
The faces of hunters and fishers, bulged at the brows . . . . the shaved blanched faces of orthodox citizens,<br/>
The pure extravagant yearning questioning artist's face,<br/>
The welcome ugly face of some beautiful soul . . . . the handsome detested or despised face,<br/>
The sacred faces of infants . . . . the illuminated face of the mother of many children,<br/>
The face of an amour . . . . the face of veneration,<br/>
The face as of a dream . . . . the face of an immobile rock,<br/>
The face withdrawn of its good and bad . . a castrated face,<br/>
A wild hawk . . his wings clipped by the clipper,<br/>
A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife of the gelder.
</p>
<p>
Sauntering the pavement or crossing the ceaseless ferry, here then are faces;<br/>
I see them and complain not and am content with all.<br/>
Do you suppose I could be content with all if I thought them their own finale?
</p>
<p>
This now is too lamentable a face for a man;<br/>
Some abject louse asking leave to be . . cringing for it,<br/>
Some milknosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig to its hole.
</p>
<p>
This face is a dog's snout sniffing for garbage;<br/>
Snakes nest in that mouth . . I hear the sibilant threat.
</p>
<p>
This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea,<br/>
Its sleepy and wobbling icebergs crunch as they go.
</p>
<p>
This is a face of bitter herbs . . . . this an emetic . . . . they need no label,<br/>
And more of the drugshelf . . laudanum, caoutchouc, or hog's lard.
</p>
<p>
This face is an epilepsy advertising and doing business . . . . its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry,<br/>
Its veins down the neck distend . . . . its eyes roll till they show nothing but their whites,<br/>
Its teeth grit . . the palms of the hands are cut by the turned-in nails,<br/>
The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground while he speculates well.
</p>
<p>
This face is bitten by vermin and worms,<br/>
And this is some murderer's knife with a halfpulled scabbard.
</p>
<p>
This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee,<br/>
An unceasing deathbell tolls there.
</p>
<p>
Those are really men! . . . . the bosses and tufts of the great round globe.
</p>
<p>
Features of my equals, would you trick me with your creased and cadaverous march?<br/>
Well then you cannot trick me.
</p>
<p>
I see your rounded never-erased flow,<br/>
I see neath the rims of your haggard and mean disguises.
</p>
<p>
Splay and twist as you like . . . . poke with the tangling fores of fishes or rats,<br/>
You'll be unmuzzled . . . . you certainly will.
</p>
<p>
I saw the face of the most smeared and slobbering idiot they had at the asylum,<br/>
And I knew for my consolation what they knew not;<br/>
I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my brother,<br/>
The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement;<br/>
And I shall look again in a score or two of ages,<br/>
And I shall meet the real landlord perfect and unharmed, every inch as good as myself.
</p>
<p>
The Lord advances and yet advances:<br/>
Always the shadow in front . . . . always the reached hand bringing up the laggards.
</p>
<p>
Out of this face emerge banners and horses . . . . O superb! . . . . I see what is coming,<br/>
I see the high pioneercaps . . . . I see the staves of runners clearing the way,<br/>
I hear victorious drums.
</p>
<p>
This face is a lifeboat;<br/>
This is the face commanding and bearded . . . . it asks no odds of the rest;<br/>
This face is flavored fruit ready for eating;<br/>
This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good.
</p>
<p>
These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake,<br/>
They show their descent from the Master himself.
</p>
<p>
Off the word I have spoken I except not one . . . . red white or black, all are deific,<br/>
In each house is the ovum . . . . it comes forth after a thousand years.
</p>
<p>
Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me,<br/>
Tall and sufficient stand behind and make signs to me;<br/>
I read the promise and patiently wait.
</p>
<p>
This is a fullgrown lily's face,<br/>
She speaks to the limber-hip'd man near the garden pickets,<br/>
Come here, she blushingly cries . . . . Come nigh to me limber-hip'd man and give me your finger and thumb,<br/>
Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can upon you,<br/>
Fill me with albescent honey . . . . bend down to me,<br/>
Rub to me with your chafing beard . . rub to my breast and shoulders.
</p>
<p>
The old face of the mother of many children:<br/>
Whist! I am fully content.
</p>
<p>
Lulled and late is the smoke of the Sabbath morning,<br/>
It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences,<br/>
It hangs thin by the sassafras, the wildcherry and the catbrier under them.
</p>
<p>
I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,<br/>
I heard what the run of poets were saying so long,<br/>
Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white froth and the water-blue.
</p>
<p>
Behold a woman!<br/>
She looks out from her quaker cap . . . . her face is clearer and more beautiful than the sky.
</p>
<p>
She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch of the farmhouse,<br/>
The sun just shines on her old white head.
</p>
<p>
Her ample gown is of creamhued linen,<br/>
Her grandsons raised the flax, and her granddaughters spun it with the distaff and the wheel.
</p>
<p>
The melodious character of the earth!<br/>
The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go and does not wish to go!<br/>
The justified mother of men!

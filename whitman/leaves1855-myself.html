<h1>Leaves of Grass</h1>
<h2>(1855 Edition)</h2>
<h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
<h3>Song of Myself</h3>
<p>
I celebrate myself,<br/>
And what I assume you shall assume,<br/>
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.
</p>
<p>
I loafe and invite my soul,<br/>
I lean and loafe at my ease . . . . observing a spear of summer grass.
</p>
<p>
Houses and roof perfumes . . . . the shelves are crowded with perfumes,<br/>
I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and like it,<br/>
The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.
</p>
<p>
The atmosphere is not a perfume . . . . it has no taste of the distillation . . . . it is odorless,<br/>
It is for my mouth forever . . . . I am in love with it,<br/>
I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,<br/>
I am mad for it to be in contact with me.
</p>
<p>
The smoke of my own breath,<br/>
Echos, ripples, and buzzed whispers . . . . loveroot, silkthread, crotch and vine,<br/>
My respiration and inspiration . . . . the beating of my heart . . . . the passing of blood and air through my lungs,<br/>
The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and darkcolored sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,<br/>
The sound of the belched words of my voice . . . . words loosed to the eddies of the wind,<br/>
A few light kisses . . . . a few embraces . . . . a reaching around of arms,<br/>
The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,<br/>
The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hillsides,<br/>
The feeling of health . . . . the full-noon trill . . . . the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.
</p>
<p>
Have you reckoned a thousand acres much? Have you reckoned the earth much?<br/>
Have you practiced so long to learn to read?<br/>
Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?
</p>
<p>
Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,<br/>
You shall possess the good of the earth and sun . . . . there are millions of suns left,<br/>
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand . . . . nor look through the eyes of the dead . . . . nor feed on the spectres in books,<br/>
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,<br/>
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from yourself.
</p>
<p>
I have heard what the talkers were talking . . . . the talk of the beginning and the end,<br/>
But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.
</p>
<p>
There was never any more inception than there is now,<br/>
Nor any more youth or age than there is now;<br/>
And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br/>
Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.
</p>
<p>
Urge and urge and urge,<br/>
Always the procreant urge of the world.
</p>
<p>
Out of the dimness opposite equals advance . . . . Always substance and increase,<br/>
Always a knit of identity . . . . always distinction . . . . always a breed of life.
</p>
<p>
To elaborate is no avail . . . . Learned and unlearned feel that it is so.
</p>
<p>
Sure as the most certain sure . . . . plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams,<br/>
Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,<br/>
I and this mystery here we stand.
</p>
<p>
Clear and sweet is my soul . . . . and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.
</p>
<p>
Lack one lacks both . . . . and the unseen is proved by the seen,<br/>
Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.
</p>
<p>
Showing the best and dividing it from the worst, age vexes age,<br/>
Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.
</p>
<p>
Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,<br/>
Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.
</p>
<p>
I am satisfied . . . . I see, dance, laugh, sing;<br/>
As God comes a loving bedfellow and sleeps at my side all night and close on the peep of the day,<br/>
And leaves for me baskets covered with white towels bulging the house with their plenty,<br/>
Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,<br/>
That they turn from gazing after and down the road,<br/>
And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,<br/>
Exactly the contents of one, and exactly the contents of two, and which is ahead?
</p>
<p>
Trippers and askers surround me,<br/>
People I meet . . . . . the effect upon me of my early life . . . . of the ward and city I live in . . . . of the nation,<br/>
The latest news . . . . discoveries, inventions, societies . . . . authors old and new,<br/>
My dinner, dress, associates, looks, business, compliments, dues,<br/>
The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,<br/>
The sickness of one of my folks  &mdash;  or of myself . . . . or<br/>

ill-doing . . . . or loss or lack of money . . . . or depressions or exaltations,<br/>
They come to me days and nights and go from me again,<br/>
But they are not the Me myself.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,<br/>
Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,<br/>
Looks down, is erect, bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,<br/>
Looks with its sidecurved head curious what will come next,<br/>
Both in and out of the game, and watching and wondering at it.
</p>
<p>
Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders,<br/>
I have no mockings or arguments . . . . I witness and wait.
</p>
<p>
I believe in you my soul . . . . the other I am must not abase itself to you,<br/>
And you must not be abased to the other.
</p>
<p>
Loafe with me on the grass . . . . loose the stop from your throat,<br/>
Not words, not music or rhyme I want . . . . not custom or lecture, not even the best,<br/>
Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.
</p>
<p>
I mind how we lay in June, such a transparent summer morning;<br/>
You settled your head athwart my hips and gently turned over upon me,<br/>
And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my barestript heart,<br/>
And reached till you felt my beard, and reached till you held my feet.
</p>
<p>
Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and joy and knowledge that pass all the art and argument of the earth;<br/>
And I know that the hand of God is the elderhand of my own,<br/>
And I know that the spirit of God is the eldest brother of my own,<br/>
And that all the men ever born are also my brothers . . . . and the women my sisters and lovers,<br/>
And that a kelson of the creation is love;<br/>
And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,<br/>
And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,<br/>
And mossy scabs of the wormfence, and heaped stones, and elder and mullen and pokeweed.
</p>
<p>
A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;<br/>
How could I answer the child? . . . . I do not know what it is any more than he.
</p>
<p>
I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.
</p>
<p>
Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br/>
A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,<br/>
Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say Whose?
</p>
<p>
Or I guess the grass is itself a child . . . . the produced babe of the vegetation.
</p>
<p>
Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br/>
And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,<br/>
Growing among black folks as among white,<br/>
Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.
</p>
<p>
And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.
</p>
<p>
Tenderly will I use you curling grass,<br/>
It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,<br/>
It may be if I had known them I would have loved them;<br/>
It may be you are from old people and from women, and from offspring taken soon out of their mothers' laps,<br/>
And here you are the mothers' laps.
</p>
<p>
This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,<br/>
Darker than the colorless beards of old men,<br/>
Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.
</p>
<p>
O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!<br/>
And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.
</p>
<p>
I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,<br/>
And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.
</p>
<p>
What do you think has become of the young and old men?<br/>
And what do you think has become of the women and children?
</p>
<p>
They are alive and well somewhere;<br/>
The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,<br/>
And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,<br/>
And ceased the moment life appeared.
</p>
<p>
All goes onward and outward . . . . and nothing collapses,<br/>
And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.
</p>
<p>
Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?<br/>
I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.
</p>
<p>
I pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-washed babe . . . . and am not contained between my hat and boots,<br/>
And peruse manifold objects, no two alike, and every one good,<br/>
The earth good, and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.
</p>
<p>
I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,<br/>
I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself;<br/>
They do not know how immortal, but I know.
</p>
<p>
Every kind for itself and its own . . . . for me mine male and female,<br/>
For me all that have been boys and that love women,<br/>
For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,<br/>
For me the sweetheart and the old maid . . . . for me mothers and the mothers of mothers,<br/>
For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,<br/>
For me children and the begetters of children.
</p>
<p>
Who need be afraid of the merge?<br/>
Undrape . . . . you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,<br/>
I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,<br/>
And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless . . . . and can never be shaken away.
</p>
<p>
The little one sleeps in its cradle,<br/>
I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand.<br/>
The youngster and the redfaced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,<br/>
I peeringly view them from the top.
</p>
<p>
The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom.<br/>
It is so . . . . I witnessed the corpse . . . . there the pistol had fallen.
</p>
<p>
The blab of the pave . . . . the tires of carts and sluff of bootsoles and talk of the promenaders,<br/>
The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,<br/>
The carnival of sleighs, the clinking and shouted jokes and pelts of snowballs;<br/>
The hurrahs for popular favorites . . . . the fury of roused mobs,<br/>
The flap of the curtained litter  &mdash;  the sick man inside, borne to the hospital,<br/>
The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,<br/>
The excited crowd  &mdash;  the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd;<br/>
The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,<br/>
The souls moving along . . . . are they invisible while the least atom of the stones is visible?<br/>
What groans of overfed or half-starved who fall on the flags sunstruck or in fits,<br/>
What exclamations of women taken suddenly, who hurry home and give birth to babes,<br/>
What living and buried speech is always vibrating here . . . . what howls restrained by decorum,<br/>
Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips,<br/>
I mind them or the resonance of them . . . . I come again and again.
</p>
<p>
The big doors of the country-barn stand open and ready<br/>
The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,<br/>
The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,<br/>
The armfuls are packed to the sagging mow:<br/>
I am there . . . . I help . . . . I came stretched atop of the load,<br/>
I felt its soft jolts . . . . one leg reclined on the other,<br/>
I jump from the crossbeams, and seize the clover and timothy,<br/>
And roll head over heels, and tangle my hair full of wisps.
</p>
<p>
Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,<br/>
Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,<br/>
In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,<br/>
Kindling a fire and broiling the freshkilled game,<br/>
Soundly falling asleep on the gathered leaves, my dog and gun by my side.
</p>
<p>
The Yankee clipper is under her three skysails . . . . she cuts the sparkle and scud,<br/>
My eyes settle the land . . . . I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.
</p>
<p>
The boatmen and clamdiggers arose early and stopped for me,<br/>
I tucked my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time,<br/>
You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.
</p>
<p>
I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far-west . . . . the bride was a red girl,<br/>
Her father and his friends sat near by crosslegged and dumbly smoking . . . . they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders;<br/>
On a bank lounged the trapper . . . . he was dressed mostly in skins . . . . his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck,<br/>
One hand rested on his rifle . . . . the other hand held firmly the wrist of the red girl,<br/>
She had long eyelashes . . . . her head was bare . . . . her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reached to her feet.
</p>
<p>
The runaway slave came to my house and stopped outside,<br/>
I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,<br/>
Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsey and weak,<br/>
And went where he sat on a log, and led him in and assured him,<br/>
And brought water and filled a tub for his sweated body and bruised feet,<br/>
And gave him a room that entered from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,<br/>
And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,<br/>
And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;
</p>
<p>
He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and passed north,<br/>
I had him sit next me at table . . . . my firelock leaned in the corner.
</p>
<p>
Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,<br/>
Twenty-eight young men, and all so friendly,<br/>
Twenty-eight years of womanly life, and all so lonesome.
</p>
<p>
She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,<br/>
She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.
</p>
<p>
Which of the young men does she like the best?<br/>
Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.
</p>
<p>
Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,<br/>
You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.
</p>
<p>
Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,<br/>
The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.
</p>
<p>
The beards of the young men glistened with wet, it ran from their long hair,<br/>
Little streams passed all over their bodies.
</p>
<p>
An unseen hand also passed over their bodies,<br/>
It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.
</p>
<p>
The young men float on their backs, their white bellies swell to the sun . . . . they do not ask who seizes fast to them,<br/>
They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,<br/>
They do not think whom they souse with spray.
</p>
<p>
The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market,<br/>
I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and breakdown.
</p>
<p>
Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,<br/>
Each has his main-sledge . . . . they are all out . . . . there is a great heat in the fire.
</p>
<p>
From the cinder-strewed threshold I follow their movements,<br/>
The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,<br/>
Overhand the hammers roll  &mdash;  overhand so slow  &mdash;  overhand so sure,<br/>
They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.
</p>
<p>
The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses . . . . the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain,<br/>
The negro that drives the huge dray of the stoneyard . . . . steady and tall he stands poised on one leg on the stringpiece,<br/>
His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hipband,<br/>
His glance is calm and commanding . . . . he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead,<br/>
The sun falls on his crispy hair and moustache . . . . falls on the black of his polish'd and perfect limbs.
</p>
<p>
I behold the picturesque giant and love him . . . . and I do not stop there,<br/>
I go with the team also.
</p>
<p>
In me the caresser of life wherever moving . . . . backward as well as forward slueing,<br/>
To niches aside and junior bending.
</p>
<p>
Oxen that rattle the yoke or halt in the shade, what is that you express in your eyes?<br/>
It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.
</p>
<p>
My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and daylong ramble,<br/>
They rise together, they slowly circle around. . . . . I believe in those winged purposes,<br/>
And acknowledge the red yellow and white playing within me,<br/>
And consider the green and violet and the tufted crown intentional;<br/>
And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,<br/>
And the mockingbird in the swamp never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,<br/>
And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.
</p>
<p>
The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,<br/>
Ya-honk! he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation;<br/>
The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen closer,<br/>
I find its purpose and place up there toward the November sky.
</p>
<p>
The sharphoofed moose of the north, the cat on the housesill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog,<br/>
The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,<br/>
The brood of the turkeyhen, and she with her halfspread wings,<br/>
I see in them and myself the same old law.
</p>
<p>
The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,<br/>
They scorn the best I can do to relate them.
</p>
<p>
I am enamoured of growing outdoors,<br/>
Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,<br/>
Of the builders and steerers of ships, of the wielders of axes and mauls, of the drivers of horses,<br/>
I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.
</p>
<p>
What is commonest and cheapest and nearest and easiest is Me,<br/>
Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,<br/>
Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,<br/>
Not asking the sky to come down to my goodwill,<br/>
Scattering it freely forever.
</p>
<p>
The pure contralto sings in the organloft,<br/>
The carpenter dresses his plank . . . . the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp,<br/>
The married and unmarried children ride home to their thanksgiving dinner,<br/>
The pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm,<br/>
The mate stands braced in the whaleboat, lance and harpoon are ready,<br/>
The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,<br/>
The deacons are ordained with crossed hands at the altar,<br/>
The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel,<br/>
The farmer stops by the bars of a Sunday and looks at the oats and rye,<br/>
The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirmed case,<br/>
He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother's bedroom;<br/>
The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,<br/>
He turns his quid of tobacco, his eyes get blurred with the manuscript;<br/>
The malformed limbs are tied to the anatomist's table,<br/>
What is removed drops horribly in a pail;<br/>
The quadroon girl is sold at the stand . . . . the drunkard nods by the barroom stove,<br/>
The machinist rolls up his sleeves . . . . the policeman travels his beat . . . . the gate-keeper marks who pass,<br/>
The young fellow drives the express-wagon . . . . I love him though I do not know him;<br/>
The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,<br/>
The western turkey-shooting draws old and young . . . . some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs,<br/>
Out from the crowd steps the marksman and takes his position and levels his piece;<br/>
The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,<br/>
The woollypates hoe in the sugarfield, the overseer views them from his saddle;<br/>
The bugle calls in the ballroom, the gentlemen run for their partners, the dancers bow to each other;<br/>
The youth lies awake in the cedar-roofed garret and harks to the musical rain,<br/>
The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,<br/>
The reformer ascends the platform, he spouts with his mouth and nose,<br/>
The company returns from its excursion, the darkey brings up the rear and bears the well-riddled target,<br/>
The squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemmed cloth is offering moccasins and beadbags for sale,<br/>
The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with halfshut eyes bent sideways,<br/>
The deckhands make fast the steamboat, the plank is thrown for the shoregoing passengers,<br/>
The young sister holds out the skein, the elder sister winds it off in a ball and stops now and then for the knots,<br/>
The one-year wife is recovering and happy, a week ago she bore her first child,<br/>
The cleanhaired Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the factory or mill,<br/>
The nine months' gone is in the parturition chamber, her faintness and pains are advancing;<br/>
The pavingman leans on his twohanded rammer  &mdash;  the reporter's lead flies swiftly over the notebook  &mdash;  the signpainter is lettering with red and gold,<br/>
The canal-boy trots on the towpath  &mdash;  the bookkeeper counts at his desk  &mdash;  the shoemaker waxes his thread,<br/>
The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him,<br/>
The child is baptised  &mdash;  the convert is making the first professions,<br/>
The regatta is spread on the bay . . . . how the white sails sparkle!<br/>
The drover watches his drove, he sings out to them that would stray,<br/>
The pedlar sweats with his pack on his back  &mdash;  the purchaser higgles about the odd cent,<br/>
The camera and plate are prepared, the lady must sit for her daguerreotype,<br/>
The bride unrumples her white dress, the minutehand of the clock moves slowly,<br/>
The opium eater reclines with rigid head and just-opened lips,<br/>
The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck,<br/>
The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other,<br/>
(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you,)<br/>
The President holds a cabinet council, he is surrounded by the great secretaries,<br/>
On the piazza walk five friendly matrons with twined arms;<br/>
The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold,<br/>
The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle,<br/>
The fare-collector goes through the train  &mdash;  he gives notice by the jingling of loose change,<br/>
The floormen are laying the floor  &mdash;  the tinners are tinning the roof  &mdash;  the masons are calling for mortar,<br/>
In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers;<br/>
Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gathered . . . . it is the Fourth of July . . . . what salutes of cannon and small arms!<br/>
Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs and the mower mows and the wintergrain falls in the ground;<br/>
Off on the lakes the pikefisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface,<br/>
The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe,<br/>
The flatboatmen make fast toward dusk near the cottonwood or pekantrees,<br/>
The coon-seekers go now through the regions of the Red river, or through those drained by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,<br/>
The torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahoochee or Altamahaw;<br/>
Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great grandsons around them,<br/>
In walls of adobe, in canvass tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day's sport.<br/>
The city sleeps and the country sleeps,<br/>
The living sleep for their time . . . . the dead sleep for their time,<br/>
The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife;<br/>
And these one and all tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,<br/>
And such as it is to be of these more or less I am.
</p>
<p>
I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,<br/>
Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,<br/>
Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,<br/>
Stuffed with the stuff that is coarse, and stuffed with the stuff that is fine,<br/>
One of the great nation, the nation of many nations  &mdash;  the smallest the same and the largest the same,<br/>
A southerner soon as a northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable,<br/>
A Yankee bound my own way . . . . ready for trade . . . . my joints the limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,<br/>
A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deerskin leggings,<br/>
A boatman over the lakes or bays or along coasts . . . . a Hoosier, a Badger, a Buckeye,<br/>
A Louisianian or Georgian, a poke-easy from sandhills and pines,<br/>
At home on Canadian snowshoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen off Newfoundland,<br/>
At home in the fleet of iceboats, sailing with the rest and tacking,<br/>
At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine or the Texan ranch,<br/>
Comrade of Californians . . . . comrade of free northwesterners, loving their big proportions,<br/>
Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen  &mdash;  comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat;<br/>
A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfulest,<br/>
A novice beginning experient of myriads of seasons,<br/>
Of every hue and trade and rank, of every caste and religion,<br/>
Not merely of the New World but of Africa Europe or Asia . . . . a wandering savage,<br/>
A farmer, mechanic, or artist . . . . a gentleman, sailor, lover or quaker,<br/>
A prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician or priest.
</p>
<p>
I resist anything better than my own diversity,<br/>
And breathe the air and leave plenty after me,<br/>
And am not stuck up, and am in my place.
</p>
<p>
The moth and the fisheggs are in their place,<br/>
The suns I see and the suns I cannot see are in their place,<br/>
The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.
</p>
<p>
These are the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me,<br/>
If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing or next to nothing,<br/>
If they do not enclose everything they are next to nothing,<br/>
If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,<br/>
If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.
</p>
<p>
This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,<br/>
This is the common air that bathes the globe.
</p>
<p>
This is the breath of laws and songs and behaviour,<br/>
This is the tasteless water of souls . . . . this is the true sustenance,<br/>
It is for the illiterate . . . . it is for the judges of the supreme court . . . . it is for the federal capitol and the state capitols,<br/>
It is for the admirable communes of literary men and composers and singers and lecturers and engineers and savans,<br/>
It is for the endless races of working people and farmers and seamen.
</p>
<p>
This is the trill of a thousand clear cornets and scream of the octave flute and strike of triangles.<br/>
I play not a march for victors only . . . . I play great marches for conquered and slain persons.
</p>
<p>
Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?<br/>
I also say it is good to fall . . . . battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.
</p>
<p>
I sound triumphal drums for the dead . . . . I fling through my embouchures the loudest and gayest music to them,<br/>
Vivas to those who have failed, and to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea, and those themselves who sank in the sea,<br/>
And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes, and the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known.
</p>
<p>
This is the meal pleasantly set . . . . this is the meat and drink for natural hunger,<br/>
It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous . . . . I make appointments with all,<br/>
I will not have a single person slighted or left away,<br/>
The keptwoman and sponger and thief are hereby invited . . . . the heavy-lipped slave is invited . . . . the venerealee is invited,<br/>
There shall be no difference between them and the rest.
</p>
<p>
This is the press of a bashful hand . . . . this is the float and odor of hair,<br/>
This is the touch of my lips to yours . . . . this is the murmur of yearning,<br/>
This is the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,<br/>
This is the thoughtful merge of myself and the outlet again.
</p>
<p>
Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?<br/>
Well I have . . . . for the April rain has, and the mica on the side of a rock has.
</p>
<p>
Do you take it I would astonish?<br/>
Does the daylight astonish? or the early redstart twittering through the woods?<br/>
Do I astonish more than they?
</p>
<p>
This hour I tell things in confidence,<br/>
I might not tell everybody but I will tell you.
</p>
<p>
Who goes there! hankering, gross, mystical, nude?<br/>
How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?
</p>
<p>
What is a man anyhow? What am I? and what are you?<br/>
All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,<br/>
Else it were time lost listening to me.
</p>
<p>
I do not snivel that snivel the world over,<br/>
That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth,<br/>
That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the end but threadbare crape and tears.
</p>
<p>
Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids . . . . conformity goes to the fourth-removed,<br/>
I cock my hat as I please indoors or out.
</p>
<p>
Shall I pray? Shall I venerate and be ceremonious?
</p>
<p>
I have pried through the strata and analyzed to a hair,<br/>
And counselled with doctors and calculated close and found no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.
</p>
<p>
In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barleycorn less,<br/>
And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.
</p>
<p>
And I know I am solid and sound,<br/>
To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,<br/>
All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.
</p>
<p>
And I know I am deathless,<br/>
I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,<br/>
I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.
</p>
<p>
I know I am august,<br/>
I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,<br/>
I see that the elementary laws never apologize,<br/>
I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by after all.
</p>
<p>
I exist as I am, that is enough,<br/>
If no other in the world be aware I sit content,<br/>
And if each and all be aware I sit content.
</p>
<p>
One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself,<br/>
And whether I come to my own today or in ten thousand or ten million years,<br/>
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.
</p>
<p>
My foothold is tenoned and mortised in granite,<br/>
I laugh at what you call dissolution,<br/>
And I know the amplitude of time.
</p>
<p>
I am the poet of the body,<br/>
And I am the poet of the soul.
</p>
<p>
The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of hell are with me,<br/>
The first I graft and increase upon myself . . . . the latter I translate into a new tongue.
</p>
<p>
I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,<br/>
And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,<br/>
And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.<br/>
I chant a new chant of dilation or pride,<br/>
We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,<br/>
I show that size is only developement.
</p>
<p>
Have you outstript the rest? Are you the President?<br/>
It is a trifle . . . . they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on.
</p>
<p>
I am he that walks with the tender and growing night;<br/>
I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.
</p>
<p>
Press close barebosomed night! Press close magnetic nourishing night!<br/>
Night of south winds! Night of the large few stars!<br/>
Still nodding night! Mad naked summer night!
</p>
<p>
Smile O voluptuous coolbreathed earth!<br/>
Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br/>
Earth of departed sunset! Earth of the mountains misty-topt!<br/>
Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!<br/>
Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br/>
Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!<br/>
Far-swooping elbowed earth! Rich apple-blossomed earth!<br/>
Smile, for your lover comes!
</p>
<p>
Prodigal! you have given me love! . . . . therefore I to you give love!<br/>
O unspeakable passionate love!
</p>
<p>
Thruster holding me tight and that I hold tight!<br/>
We hurt each other as the bridegroom and the bride hurt each other.
</p>
<p>
You sea! I resign myself to you also . . . . I guess what you mean,<br/>
I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,<br/>
I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me;<br/>
We must have a turn together . . . . I undress . . . . hurry me out of sight of the land,<br/>
Cushion me soft . . . . rock me in billowy drowse,<br/>
Dash me with amorous wet . . . . I can repay you.
</p>
<p>
Sea of stretched ground-swells!<br/>
Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths!<br/>
Sea of the brine of life! Sea of unshovelled and always-ready graves!<br/>
Howler and scooper of storms! Capricious and dainty sea!<br/>
I am integral with you . . . . I too am of one phase and of all phases.
</p>
<p>
Partaker of influx and efflux . . . . extoler of hate and conciliation,<br/>
Extoler of amies and those that sleep in each others' arms.
</p>
<p>
I am he attesting sympathy;<br/>
Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them?
</p>
<p>
I am the poet of commonsense and of the demonstrable and of immortality;<br/>
And am not the poet of goodness only . . . . I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.
</p>
<p>
Washes and razors for foofoos . . . . for me freckles and a bristling beard.
</p>
<p>
What blurt is it about virtue and about vice?<br/>
Evil propels me, and reform of evil propels me . . . . I stand indifferent,<br/>
My gait is no faultfinder's or rejecter's gait,<br/>
I moisten the roots of all that has grown.
</p>
<p>
Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?<br/>
Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be worked over and rectified?
</p>
<p>
I step up to say that what we do is right and what we affirm is right . . . . and some is only the ore of right,<br/>
Witnesses of us . . . . one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,<br/>
Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,<br/>
Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.
</p>
<p>
This minute that comes to me over the past decillions,<br/>
There is no better than it and now.
</p>
<p>
What behaved well in the past or behaves well today is not such a wonder,<br/>
The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.
</p>
<p>
Endless unfolding of words of ages!<br/>
And mine a word of the modern . . . . a word en masse.
</p>
<p>
A word of the faith that never balks,<br/>
One time as good as another time . . . . here or henceforward it is all the same to me.
</p>
<p>
A word of reality . . . . materialism first and last imbueing.
</p>
<p>
Hurrah for positive science! Long live exact demonstration!<br/>
Fetch stonecrop and mix it with cedar and branches of lilac;<br/>
This is the lexicographer or chemist . . . . this made a grammar of the old cartouches,<br/>
These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas,<br/>
This is the geologist, and this works with the scalpel, and this is a mathematician.
</p>
<p>
Gentlemen I receive you, and attach and clasp hands with you,<br/>
The facts are useful and real . . . . they are not my dwelling . . . . I enter by them to an area of the dwelling.
</p>
<p>
I am less the reminder of property or qualities, and more the reminder of life,<br/>
And go on the square for my own sake and for others' sakes,<br/>
And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipped,<br/>
And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.
</p>
<p>
Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br/>
Disorderly fleshy and sensual . . . . eating drinking and breeding,<br/>
No sentimentalist . . . . no stander above men and women or apart from them . . . . no more modest than immodest.
</p>
<p>
Unscrew the locks from the doors!<br/>
Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!
</p>
<p>
Whoever degrades another degrades me . . . . and whatever is done or said returns at last to me,<br/>
And whatever I do or say I also return.
</p>
<p>
Through me the afflatus surging and surging . . . . through me the current and index.
</p>
<p>
I speak the password primeval . . . . I give the sign of democracy;<br/>
By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.
</p>
<p>
Through me many long dumb voices,<br/>
Voices of the interminable generations of slaves,<br/>
Voices of prostitutes and of deformed persons,<br/>
Voices of the diseased and despairing, and of thieves and dwarfs,<br/>
Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,<br/>
And of the threads that connect the stars  &mdash;  and of wombs, and of the fatherstuff,<br/>
And of the rights of them the others are down upon,<br/>
Of the trivial and flat and foolish and despised,<br/>
Of fog in the air and beetles rolling balls of dung.
</p>
<p>
Through me forbidden voices,<br/>
Voices of sexes and lusts . . . . voices veiled, and I remove the veil,<br/>
Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigured.
</p>
<p>
I do not press my finger across my mouth,<br/>
I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,<br/>
Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.
</p>
<p>
I believe in the flesh and the appetites,<br/>
Seeing hearing and feeling are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.
</p>
<p>
Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched from;<br/>
The scent of these arm-pits is aroma finer than prayer,<br/>
This head is more than churches or bibles or creeds.
</p>
<p>
If I worship any particular thing it shall be some of the spread of my body;<br/>
Translucent mould of me it shall be you,<br/>
Shaded ledges and rests, firm masculine coulter, it shall be you,<br/>
Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you,<br/>
You my rich blood, your milky stream pale strippings of my life;<br/>
Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you,<br/>
My brain it shall be your occult convolutions,<br/>
Root of washed sweet-flag, timorous pond-snipe, nest of guarded duplicate eggs, it shall be you,<br/>
Mixed tussled hay of head and beard and brawn it shall be you,<br/>
Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you;<br/>
Sun so generous it shall be you,<br/>
Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you,<br/>
You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you,<br/>
Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you,<br/>
Broad muscular fields, branches of liveoak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you,<br/>
Hands I have taken, face I have kissed, mortal I have ever touched, it shall be you.
</p>
<p>
I dote on myself . . . . there is that lot of me, and all so luscious,<br/>
Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy.<br/>
I cannot tell how my ankles bend . . . . nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,<br/>
Nor the cause of the friendship I emit . . . . nor the cause of the friendship I take again.
</p>
<p>
To walk up my stoop is unaccountable . . . . I pause to consider if it really be,<br/>
That I eat and drink is spectacle enough for the great authors and schools,<br/>
A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.
</p>
<p>
To behold the daybreak!<br/>
The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,<br/>
The air tastes good to my palate.
</p>
<p>
Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols, silently rising, freshly exuding,<br/>
Scooting obliquely high and low.
</p>
<p>
Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,<br/>
Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.
</p>
<p>
The earth by the sky staid with . . . . the daily close of their junction,<br/>
The heaved challenge from the east that moment over my head,<br/>
The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!
</p>
<p>
Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sunrise would kill me,<br/>
If I could not now and always send sunrise out of me.
</p>
<p>
We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,<br/>
We found our own my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.
</p>
<p>
My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,<br/>
With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.<br/>
Speech is the twin of my vision . . . . it is unequal to measure itself.
</p>
<p>
It provokes me forever,<br/>
It says sarcastically, Walt, you understand enough . . . . why don't you let it out then?
</p>
<p>
Come now I will not be tantalized . . . . you conceive too much of articulation.
</p>
<p>
Do you not know how the buds beneath are folded?<br/>
Waiting in gloom protected by frost,<br/>
The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,<br/>
I underlying causes to balance them at last,<br/>
My knowledge my live parts . . . . it keeping tally with the meaning of things,<br/>
Happiness . . . . which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day.
</p>
<p>
My final merit I refuse you . . . . I refuse putting from me the best I am.
</p>
<p>
Encompass worlds but never try to encompass me,<br/>
I crowd your noisiest talk by looking toward you.
</p>
<p>
Writing and talk do not prove me,<br/>
I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,<br/>
With the hush of my lips I confound the topmost skeptic.
</p>
<p>
I think I will do nothing for a long time but listen,<br/>
And accrue what I hear into myself . . . . and let sounds contribute toward me.
</p>
<p>
I hear the bravuras of birds . . . . the bustle of growing wheat . . . . gossip of flames . . . . clack of sticks cooking my meals.
</p>
<p>
I hear the sound of the human voice . . . . a sound I love,<br/>
I hear all sounds as they are tuned to their uses . . . .  sounds of the city and sounds out of the city . . . . sounds of the day and night;<br/>
Talkative young ones to those that like them . . . . the recitative of fish-pedlars and fruit-pedlars . . . . the loud laugh of workpeople at their meals,<br/>
The angry base of disjointed friendship . . . . the faint tones of the sick,<br/>
The judge with hands tight to the desk, his shaky lips pronouncing a death-sentence,<br/>
The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves . . . . the refrain of the anchor-lifters;<br/>
The ring of alarm-bells . . . . the cry of fire . . . . the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and colored lights,<br/>
The steam-whistle . . . . the solid roll of the train of approaching cars;<br/>
The slow-march played at night at the head of the association,<br/>
They go to guard some corpse . . . . the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.
</p>
<p>
I hear the violincello or man's heart's complaint,<br/>
And hear the keyed cornet or else the echo of sunset.
</p>
<p>
I hear the chorus . . . . it is a grand-opera . . . . this indeed is music!
</p>
<p>
A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,<br/>
The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.
</p>
<p>
I hear the trained soprano . . . . she convulses me like the climax of my love-grip;<br/>
The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,<br/>
It wrenches unnamable ardors from my breast,<br/>
It throbs me to gulps of the farthest down horror,<br/>
It sails me . . . . I dab with bare feet . . . . they are licked by the indolent waves,<br/>
I am exposed . . . . cut by bitter and poisoned hail,<br/>
Steeped amid honeyed morphine . . . . my windpipe squeezed in the fakes of death,<br/>
Let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,<br/>
And that we call Being.
</p>
<p>
To be in any form, what is that?<br/>
If nothing lay more developed the quahaug and its callous shell were enough.
</p>
<p>
Mine is no callous shell,<br/>
I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,<br/>
They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.
</p>
<p>
I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,<br/>
To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I can stand.
</p>
<p>
Is this then a touch? . . . . quivering me to a new identity,<br/>
Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,<br/>
Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,<br/>
My flesh and blood playing out lightning, to strike what is hardly different from myself,<br/>
On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,<br/>
Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,<br/>
Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,<br/>
Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,<br/>
Unbuttoning my clothes and holding me by the bare waist,<br/>
Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture fields,<br/>
Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,<br/>
They bribed to swap off with touch, and go and graze at the edges of me,<br/>
No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,<br/>
Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them awhile,<br/>
Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.
</p>
<p>
The sentries desert every other part of me,<br/>
They have left me helpless to a red marauder,<br/>
They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.
</p>
<p>
I am given up by traitors;<br/>
I talk wildly . . . . I have lost my wits . . . . I and nobody else am the greatest traitor,<br/>
I went myself first to the headland . . . . my own hands carried me there.
</p>
<p>
You villain touch! what are you doing? . . . . my breath is tight in its throat;<br/>
Unclench your floodgates! you are too much for me.
</p>
<p>
Blind loving wrestling touch! Sheathed hooded sharptoothed touch!<br/>
Did it make you ache so leaving me?
</p>
<p>
Parting tracked by arriving . . . . perpetual payment of the perpetual loan,<br/>
Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.
</p>
<p>
Sprouts take and accumulate . . . . stand by the curb prolific and vital,<br/>
Landscapes projected masculine full-sized and golden.
</p>
<p>
All truths wait in all things,<br/>
They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,<br/>
They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,<br/>
The insignificant is as big to me as any,<br/>
What is less or more than a touch?
</p>
<p>
Logic and sermons never convince,<br/>
The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.
</p>
<p>
Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,<br/>
Only what nobody denies is so.
</p>
<p>
A minute and a drop of me settle my brain;<br/>
I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,<br/>
And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,<br/>
And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,<br/>
And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific,<br/>
And until every one shall delight us, and we them.
</p>
<p>
I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journeywork of the stars,<br/>
And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,<br/>
And the tree-toad is a chef-d'ouvre for the highest,<br/>
And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,<br/>
And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,<br/>
And the cow crunching with depressed head surpasses any statue,<br/>
And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels,<br/>
And I could come every afternoon of my life to look at the farmer's girl boiling her iron tea-kettle and baking shortcake.
</p>
<p>
I find I incorporate gneiss and coal and long-threaded moss and fruits and grains and esculent roots,<br/>
And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,<br/>
And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,<br/>
And call any thing close again when I desire it.
</p>
<p>
In vain the speeding or shyness,<br/>
In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,<br/>
In vain the mastadon retreats beneath its own powdered bones,<br/>
In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,<br/>
In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,<br/>
In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,<br/>
In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,<br/>
In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,<br/>
In vain the razorbilled auk sails far north to Labrador,<br/>
I follow quickly . . . . I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.
</p>
<p>
I think I could turn and live awhile with the animals . . . . they are so placid and self-contained,<br/>
I stand and look at them sometimes half the day long.
</p>
<p>
They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br/>
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,<br/>
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,<br/>
Not one is dissatisfied . . . . not one is demented with the mania of owning things,<br/>
Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,<br/>
Not one is respectable or industrious over the whole earth.
</p>
<p>
So they show their relations to me and I accept them;<br/>
They bring me tokens of myself . . . . they evince them plainly in their possession.
</p>
<p>
I do not know where they got those tokens,<br/>
I must have passed that way untold times ago and negligently dropt them,<br/>
Myself moving forward then and now and forever,<br/>
Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,<br/>
Infinite and omnigenous and the like of these among them;<br/>
Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,<br/>
Picking out here one that shall be my amie,<br/>
Choosing to go with him on brotherly terms.
</p>
<p>
A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,<br/>
Head high in the forehead and wide between the ears,<br/>
Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,<br/>
Eyes well apart and full of sparkling wickedness . . . . ears finely cut and flexibly moving.
</p>
<p>
His nostrils dilate . . . . my heels embrace him . . . . his well built limbs tremble with pleasure . . . . we speed around and return.<br/>
I but use you a moment and then I resign you stallion . . . . and do not need your paces, and outgallop them,<br/>
And myself as I stand or sit pass faster than you.
</p>
<p>
Swift wind! Space! My Soul! Now I know it is true what I guessed at;<br/>
What I guessed when I loafed on the grass,<br/>
What I guessed while I lay alone in my bed . . . . and again as I walked the beach under the paling stars of the morning.
</p>
<p>
My ties and ballasts leave me . . . . I travel . . . . I sail . . . . my elbows rest in the sea-gaps,<br/>
I skirt the sierras . . . . my palms cover continents,<br/>
I am afoot with my vision.
</p>
<p>
By the city's quadrangular houses . . . . in log-huts, or camping with lumbermen,<br/>
Along the ruts of the turnpike . . . . along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,<br/>
Hoeing my onion-patch, and rows of carrots and parsnips . . . . crossing savannas . . . trailing in forests,<br/>
Prospecting . . . . gold-digging . . . . girdling the trees of a new purchase,<br/>
Scorched ankle-deep by the hot sand . . . . hauling my boat down the shallow river;<br/>
Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead . . . . where the buck turns furiously at the hunter,<br/>
Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock . . . . where the otter is feeding on fish,<br/>
Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,<br/>
Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey . . . . where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-tail;<br/>
Over the growing sugar . . . . over the cottonplant . . . . over the rice in its low moist field;<br/>
Over the sharp-peaked farmhouse with its scalloped scum and slender shoots from the gutters;<br/>
Over the western persimmon . . . . over the longleaved corn and the delicate blueflowered flax;<br/>
Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and a buzzer there with the rest,<br/>
Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;<br/>
Scaling mountains . . . . pulling myself cautiously up . . . . holding on by low scragged limbs,<br/>
Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush;<br/>
Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheatlot,<br/>
Where the bat flies in the July eve . . . . where the great goldbug drops through the dark;<br/>
Where the flails keep time on the barn floor,<br/>
Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow,<br/>
Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides,<br/>
Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, and andirons straddle the hearth-slab, and cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;<br/>
Where triphammers crash . . . . where the press is whirling its cylinders;<br/>
Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes out of its ribs;<br/>
Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft . . . . floating in it myself and looking composedly down;<br/>
Where the life-car is drawn on the slipnoose . . . . where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,<br/>
Where the she-whale swims with her calves and never forsakes them,<br/>
Where the steamship trails hindways its long pennant of smoke,<br/>
Where the ground-shark's fin cuts like a black chip out of the water,<br/>
Where the half-burned brig is riding on unknown currents,<br/>
Where shells grow to her slimy deck, and the dead are corrupting below;<br/>
Where the striped and starred flag is borne at the head of the regiments;<br/>
Approaching Manhattan, up by the long-stretching island,<br/>
Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance;<br/>
Upon a door-step . . . . upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,<br/>
Upon the race-course, or enjoying pic-nics or jigs or a good game of base-ball,<br/>
At he-festivals with blackguard jibes and ironical license and bull-dances and drinking and laughter,<br/>
At the cider-mill, tasting the sweet of the brown sqush . . . . sucking the juice through a straw,<br/>
At apple-pealings, wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,<br/>
At musters and beach-parties and friendly bees and huskings and house-raisings;<br/>
Where the mockingbird sounds his delicious gurgles, and cackles and screams and weeps,<br/>
Where the hay-rick stands in the barnyard, and the dry-stalks are scattered, and the brood cow waits in the hovel,<br/>
Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, and the stud to the mare, and the cock is treading the hen,<br/>
Where the heifers browse, and the geese nip their food with short jerks;<br/>
Where the sundown shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,<br/>
Where the herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near;<br/>
Where the hummingbird shimmers . . . . where the neck of the longlived swan is curving and winding;<br/>
Where the laughing-gull scoots by the slappy shore and laughs her near-human laugh;<br/>
Where beehives range on a gray bench in the garden half-hid by the high weeds;<br/>
Where the band-necked partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out;<br/>
Where burial coaches enter the arched gates of a cemetery;<br/>
Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees;<br/>
Where the yellow-crowned heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs;<br/>
Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon;<br/>
Where the katydid works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well;<br/>
Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,<br/>
Through the salt-lick or orange glade . . . . or under conical firs;<br/>
Through the gymnasium . . . . through the curtained saloon . . . . through the office or public hall;<br/>
Pleased with the native and pleased with the foreign . . . . pleased with the new and old,<br/>
Pleased with women, the homely as well as the handsome,<br/>
Pleased with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,<br/>
Pleased with the primitive tunes of the choir of the whitewashed church,<br/>
Pleased with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, or any preacher . . . . looking seriously at the camp-meeting;<br/>
Looking in at the shop-windows in Broadway the whole forenoon . . . . pressing the flesh of my nose to the thick plate-glass,<br/>
Wandering the same afternoon with my face turned up to the clouds;<br/>
My right and left arms round the sides of two friends and I in the middle;<br/>
Coming home with the bearded and dark-cheeked bush-boy . . . . riding behind him at the drape of the day;<br/>
Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet, or the moccasin print;<br/>
By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,<br/>
By the coffined corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;<br/>
Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure;<br/>
Hurrying with the modern crowd, as eager and fickle as any,<br/>
Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him;<br/>
Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,<br/>
Walking the old hills of Judea with the beautiful gentle god by my side;<br/>
Speeding through space . . . . speeding through heaven and the stars,<br/>
Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and the diameter of eighty thousand miles,<br/>
Speeding with tailed meteors . . . . throwing fire-balls like the rest,<br/>
Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly;<br/>
Storming enjoying planning loving cautioning,<br/>
Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,<br/>
I tread day and night such roads.
</p>
<p>
I visit the orchards of God and look at the spheric product,<br/>
And look at quintillions ripened, and look at quintillions green.
</p>
<p>
I fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing soul,<br/>
My course runs below the soundings of plummets.
</p>
<p>
I help myself to material and immaterial,<br/>
No guard can shut me off, no law can prevent me.
</p>
<p>
I anchor my ship for a little while only,<br/>
My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.<br/>
I go hunting polar furs and the seal . . . . leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff . . . . clinging to topples of brittle and blue.
</p>
<p>
I ascend to the foretruck . . . . I take my place late at night in the crow's nest . . . . we sail through the arctic sea . . . . it is plenty light enough,<br/>
Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,<br/>
The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them . . . . the scenery is plain in all directions,<br/>
The white-topped mountains point up in the distance . . . . I fling out my fancies toward them;<br/>
We are about approaching some great battlefield in which we are soon to be engaged,<br/>
We pass the colossal outposts of the encampments . . . . we pass with still feet and caution;<br/>
Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruined city . . . . the blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.
</p>
<p>
I am a free companion . . . . I bivouac by invading watchfires.
</p>
<p>
I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,<br/>
And tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.
</p>
<p>
My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,<br/>
They fetch my man's body up dripping and drowned.
</p>
<p>
I understand the large hearts of heroes,<br/>
The courage of present times and all times;<br/>
How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship, and death chasing it up and down the storm,<br/>
How he knuckled tight and gave not back one inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,<br/>
And chalked in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, We will not desert you;<br/>
How he saved the drifting company at last,<br/>
How the lank loose-gowned women looked when boated from the side of their prepared graves,<br/>
How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipped unshaved men;<br/>
All this I swallow and it tastes good . . . . I like it well, and it becomes mine,<br/>
I am the man . . . . I suffered . . . . I was there.
</p>
<p>
The disdain and calmness of martyrs,<br/>
The mother condemned for a witch and burnt with dry wood, and her children gazing on;<br/>
The hounded slave that flags in the race and leans by the fence, blowing and covered with sweat,<br/>
The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck,<br/>
The murderous buckshot and the bullets,<br/>
All these I feel or am.
</p>
<p>
I am the hounded slave . . . . I wince at the bite of the dogs,<br/>
Hell and despair are upon me . . . . crack and again crack the marksmen,<br/>
I clutch the rails of the fence . . . . my gore dribs thinned with the ooze of my skin,<br/>
I fall on the weeds and stones,<br/>
The riders spur their unwilling horses and haul close,<br/>
They taunt my dizzy ears . . . . they beat me violently over the head with their whip-stocks.
</p>
<p>
Agonies are one of my changes of garments;<br/>
I do not ask the wounded person how he feels . . . . I myself become the wounded person,<br/>
My hurt turns livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.
</p>
<p>
I am the mashed fireman with breastbone broken . . . . tumbling walls buried me in their debris,<br/>
Heat and smoke I inspired . . . . I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,<br/>
I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels;<br/>
They have cleared the beams away . . . . they tenderly lift me forth.
</p>
<p>
I lie in the night air in my red shirt . . . . the pervading hush is for my sake,<br/>
Painless after all I lie, exhausted but not so unhappy,<br/>
White and beautiful are the faces around me . . . . the heads are bared of their fire-caps,<br/>
The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.
</p>
<p>
Distant and dead resuscitate,<br/>
They show as the dial or move as the hands of me . . . . and I am the clock myself.
</p>
<p>
I am an old artillerist, and tell of some fort's bombardment . . . . and am there again.
</p>
<p>
Again the reveille of drummers . . . . again the attacking cannon and mortars and howitzers,<br/>
Again the attacked send their cannon responsive.
</p>
<p>
I take part . . . . I see and hear the whole,<br/>
The cries and curses and roar . . . . the plaudits for well aimed shots,<br/>
The ambulanza slowly passing and trailing its red drip,<br/>
Workmen searching after damages and to make indispensible repairs,<br/>
The fall of grenades through the rent roof . . . . the fan-shaped explosion,<br/>
The whizz of limbs heads stone wood and iron high in the air.<br/>
Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general . . . . he furiously waves with his hand,<br/>
He gasps through the clot . . . . Mind not me . . . . mind . . . . the entrenchments.
</p>
<p>
I tell not the fall of Alamo . . . . not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,<br/>
The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo.
</p>
<p>
Hear now the tale of a jetblack sunrise,<br/>
Hear of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.
</p>
<p>
Retreating they had formed in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks,<br/>
Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's nine times their number was the price they took in advance,<br/>
Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,<br/>
They treated for an honorable capitulation, received writing and seal, gave up their arms, and marched back prisoners of war.
</p>
<p>
They were the glory of the race of rangers,<br/>
Matchless with a horse, a rifle, a song, a supper or a courtship,<br/>
Large, turbulent, brave, handsome, generous, proud and affectionate,<br/>
Bearded, sunburnt, dressed in the free costume of hunters,<br/>
Not a single one over thirty years of age.
</p>
<p>
The second Sunday morning they were brought out in squads and massacred . . . . it was beautiful early summer,<br/>
The work commenced about five o'clock and was over by eight.
</p>
<p>
None obeyed the command to kneel,<br/>
Some made a mad and helpless rush . . . . some stood stark and straight,<br/>
A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart . . . . the living and dead lay together,<br/>
The maimed and mangled dug in the dirt . . . . the new-comers saw them there;<br/>
Some half-killed attempted to crawl away,<br/>
These were dispatched with bayonets or battered with the blunts of muskets;<br/>
A youth not seventeen years old seized his assassin till two more came to release him,<br/>
The three were all torn, and covered with the boy's blood.
</p>
<p>
At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;<br/>
And that is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men,<br/>
And that was a jetblack sunrise.
</p>
<p>
Did you read in the seabooks of the oldfashioned frigate-fight?<br/>
Did you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
</p>
<p>
Our foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you,<br/>
His was the English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;<br/>
Along the lowered eve he came, horribly raking us.
</p>
<p>
We closed with him . . . . the yards entangled . . . . the cannon touched,<br/>
My captain lashed fast with his own hands.
</p>
<p>
We had received some eighteen-pound shots under the water,<br/>
On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.
</p>
<p>
Ten o'clock at night, and the full moon shining and the leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,<br/>
The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.
</p>
<p>
The transit to and from the magazine was now stopped by the sentinels,<br/>
They saw so many strange faces they did not know whom to trust.
</p>
<p>
Our frigate was afire . . . . the other asked if we demanded quarters? if our colors were struck and the fighting done?
</p>
<p>
I laughed content when I heard the voice of my little captain,<br/>
We have not struck, he composedly cried, We have just begun our part of the fighting.
</p>
<p>
Only three guns were in use,<br/>
One was directed by the captain himself against the enemy's mainmast,<br/>
Two well-served with grape and canister silenced his musketry and cleared his decks.
</p>
<p>
The tops alone seconded the fire of this little battery, especially the maintop,<br/>
They all held out bravely during the whole of the action.
</p>
<p>
Not a moment's cease,<br/>
The leaks gained fast on the pumps . . . . the fire eat toward the powder-magazine,<br/>
One of the pumps was shot away . . . . it was generally thought we were sinking.<br/>
Serene stood the little captain,<br/>
He was not hurried . . . . his voice was neither high nor low,<br/>
His eyes gave more light to us than our battle-lanterns.
</p>
<p>
Toward twelve at night, there in the beams of the moon they surrendered to us.
</p>
<p>
Stretched and still lay the midnight,<br/>
Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,<br/>
Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking . . . . preparations to pass to the one we had conquered,<br/>
The captain on the quarter deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet,<br/>
Near by the corpse of the child that served in the cabin,<br/>
The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curled whiskers,<br/>
The flames spite of all that could be done flickering aloft and below,<br/>
The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,<br/>
Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves . . . . dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,<br/>
The cut of cordage and dangle of rigging . . . . the slight shock of the soothe of waves,<br/>
Black and impassive guns, and litter of powder-parcels, and the strong scent,<br/>
Delicate sniffs of the seabreeze . . . . smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore . . . death-messages given in charge to survivors,<br/>
The hiss of the surgeon's knife and the gnawing teeth of his saw,<br/>
The wheeze, the cluck, the swash of falling blood . . . . the short wild scream, the long dull tapering groan,<br/>
These so . . . . these irretrievable.
</p>
<p>
O Christ! My fit is mastering me!<br/>
What the rebel said gaily adjusting his throat to the rope-noose,<br/>
What the savage at the stump, his eye-sockets empty, his mouth spirting whoops and defiance,<br/>
What stills the traveler come to the vault at Mount Vernon,<br/>
What sobers the Brooklyn boy as he looks down the shores of the Wallabout and remembers the prison ships,<br/>
What burnt the gums of the redcoat at Saratoga when he surrendered his brigades,<br/>
These become mine and me every one, and they are but little,<br/>
I become as much more as I like.
</p>
<p>
I become any presence or truth of humanity here,<br/>
And see myself in prison shaped like another man,<br/>
And feel the dull unintermitted pain.
</p>
<p>
For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,<br/>
It is I let out in the morning and barred at night.
</p>
<p>
Not a mutineer walks handcuffed to the jail, but I am handcuffed to him and walk by his side,<br/>
I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips.
</p>
<p>
Not a youngster is taken for larceny, but I go up too and am tried and sentenced.
</p>
<p>
Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp, but I also lie at the last gasp,<br/>
My face is ash-colored, my sinews gnarl . . . . away from me people retreat.
</p>
<p>
Askers embody themselves in me, and I am embodied in them,<br/>
I project my hat and sit shamefaced and beg.
</p>
<p>
I rise extatic through all, and sweep with the true gravitation,<br/>
The whirling and whirling is elemental within me.
</p>
<p>
Somehow I have been stunned. Stand back!<br/>
Give me a little time beyond my cuffed head and slumbers and dreams and gaping,<br/>
I discover myself on a verge of the usual mistake.
</p>
<p>
That I could forget the mockers and insults!<br/>
That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers!<br/>
That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning!
</p>
<p>
I remember . . . . I resume the overstaid fraction,<br/>
The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it . . . . or to any graves,<br/>
The corpses rise . . . . the gashes heal . . . . the fastenings roll away.
</p>
<p>
I troop forth replenished with supreme power, one of an average unending procession,<br/>
We walk the roads of Ohio and Massachusetts and Virginia and Wisconsin and New York and New Orleans and Texas and Montreal and San Francisco and Charleston and Savannah and Mexico,<br/>
Inland and by the seacoast and boundary lines . . . . and we pass the boundary lines.
</p>
<p>
Our swift ordinances are on their way over the whole earth,<br/>
The blossoms we wear in our hats are the growth of two thousand years.
</p>
<p>
Eleves I salute you,<br/>
I see the approach of your numberless gangs . . . . I see you understand yourselves and me,<br/>
And know that they who have eyes are divine, and the blind and lame are equally divine,<br/>
And that my steps drag behind yours yet go before them,<br/>
And are aware how I am with you no more than I am with everybody.
</p>
<p>
The friendly and flowing savage . . . . Who is he?<br/>
Is he waiting for civilization or past it and mastering it?
</p>
<p>
Is he some southwesterner raised outdoors? Is he Canadian?<br/>
Is he from the Mississippi country? or from Iowa, Oregon or California? or from the mountains? or prairie life or bush-life? or from the sea?
</p>
<p>
Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,<br/>
They desire he should like them and touch them and speak to them and stay with them.
</p>
<p>
Behaviour lawless as snow-flakes . . . . words simple as grass . . . . uncombed head and laughter and naivete;<br/>
Slowstepping feet and the common features, and the common modes and emanations,<br/>
They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,<br/>
They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath . . . . they fly out of the glance of his eyes.
</p>
<p>
Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask . . . . lie over,<br/>
You light surfaces only . . . . I force the surfaces and the depths also.
</p>
<p>
Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,<br/>
Say old topknot! what do you want?
</p>
<p>
Man or woman! I might tell how I like you, but cannot,<br/>
And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,<br/>
And might tell the pinings I have . . . . the pulse of my nights and days.
</p>
<p>
Behold I do not give lectures or a little charity,<br/>
What I give I give out of myself.
</p>
<p>
You there, impotent, loose in the knees, open your scarfed chops till I blow grit within you,<br/>
Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,<br/>
I am not to be denied . . . . I compel . . . . I have stores plenty and to spare,<br/>
And any thing I have I bestow.
</p>
<p>
I do not ask who you are . . . . that is not important to me,<br/>
You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.
</p>
<p>
To a drudge of the cottonfields or emptier of privies I lean . . . . on his right cheek I put the family kiss,<br/>
And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.
</p>
<p>
On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes,<br/>
This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.
</p>
<p>
To any one dying . . . . thither I speed and twist the knob of the door,<br/>
Turn the bedclothes toward the foot of the bed,<br/>
Let the physician and the priest go home.
</p>
<p>
I seize the descending man . . . . I raise him with resistless will.
</p>
<p>
O despairer, here is my neck,<br/>
By God! you shall not go down! Hang your whole weight upon me.
</p>
<p>
I dilate you with tremendous breath . . . . I buoy you up;<br/>
Every room of the house do I fill with an armed force . . . . lovers of me, bafflers of graves:<br/>
Sleep! I and they keep guard all night;<br/>
Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,<br/>
I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,<br/>
And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.
</p>
<p>
I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,<br/>
And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.
</p>
<p>
I heard what was said of the universe,<br/>
Heard it and heard of several thousand years;<br/>
It is middling well as far as it goes . . . . but is that all?
</p>
<p>
Magnifying and applying come I,<br/>
Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,<br/>
The most they offer for mankind and eternity less than a spirt of my own seminal wet,<br/>
Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah and laying them away,<br/>
Lithographing Kronos and Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,<br/>
Buying drafts of Osiris and Isis and Belus and Brahma and Adonai,<br/>
In my portfolio placing Manito loose, and Allah on a leaf, and the crucifix engraved,<br/>
With Odin, and the hideous-faced Mexitli, and all idols and images,<br/>
Honestly taking them all for what they are worth, and not a cent more,<br/>
Admitting they were alive and did the work of their day,<br/>
Admitting they bore mites as for unfledged birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves,<br/>
Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself . . . . bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,<br/>
Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,<br/>
Putting higher claims for him there with his rolled-up sleeves, driving the mallet and chisel;<br/>
Not objecting to special revelations . . . . considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand as curious as any revelation;<br/>
Those ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes more to me than the gods of the antique wars,<br/>
Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,<br/>
Their brawny limbs passing safe over charred laths . . . . their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;<br/>
By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born;<br/>
Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagged out at their waists;<br/>
The snag-toothed hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come,<br/>
Selling all he possesses and traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery:<br/>
What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not filling the square rod then;<br/>
The bull and the bug never worshipped half enough,<br/>
Dung and dirt more admirable than was dreamed,<br/>
The supernatural of no account . . . . myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes,<br/>
The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the best, and be as prodigious,<br/>
Guessing when I am it will not tickle me much to receive puffs out of pulpit or print;<br/>
By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator!<br/>
Putting myself here and now to the ambushed womb of the shadows!
</p>
<p>
. . . . A call in the midst of the crowd,<br/>
My own voice, orotund sweeping and final.
</p>
<p>
Come my children,<br/>
Come my boys and girls, and my women and household and intimates,<br/>
Now the performer launches his nerve . . . . he has passed his prelude on the reeds within.
</p>
<p>
Easily written loosefingered chords! I feel the thrum of their climax and close.
</p>
<p>
My head evolves on my neck,<br/>
Music rolls, but not from the organ . . . . folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.
</p>
<p>
Ever the hard and unsunk ground,<br/>
Ever the eaters and drinkers . . . . ever the upward and downward sun . . . . ever the air and the ceaseless tides,<br/>
Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing and wicked and real,<br/>
Ever the old inexplicable query . . . . ever that thorned thumb  &mdash;  that breath of itches and thirsts,<br/>
Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth;<br/>
Ever love . . . . ever the sobbing liquid of life,<br/>
Ever the bandage under the chin . . . . ever the tressels of death.
</p>
<p>
Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,<br/>
To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,<br/>
Tickets buying or taking or selling, but in to the feast never once going;<br/>
Many sweating and ploughing and thrashing, and then the chaff for payment receiving,<br/>
A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.
</p>
<p>
This is the city . . . . and I am one of the citizens;<br/>
Whatever interests the rest interests me . . . . politics, churches, newspapers, schools,<br/>
Benevolent societies, improvements, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, markets,<br/>
Stocks and stores and real estate and personal estate.
</p>
<p>
They who piddle and patter here in collars and tailed coats . . . . I am aware who they are . . . . and that they are not worms or fleas,<br/>
I acknowledge the duplicates of myself under all the scrape-lipped and pipe-legged concealments.
</p>
<p>
The weakest and shallowest is deathless with me,<br/>
What I do and say the same waits for them,<br/>
Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.
</p>
<p>
I know perfectly well my own egotism,<br/>
And know my omniverous words, and cannot say any less,<br/>
And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.
</p>
<p>
My words are words of a questioning, and to indicate reality;<br/>
This printed and bound book . . . . but the printer and the printing-office boy?<br/>
The marriage estate and settlement . . . . but the body and mind of the bridegroom? also those of the bride?<br/>
The panorama of the sea . . . . but the sea itself?<br/>
The well-taken photographs . . . . but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms?<br/>
The fleet of ships of the line and all the modern improvements . . . . but the craft and pluck of the admiral?<br/>
The dishes and fare and furniture . . . . but the host and hostess, and the look out of their eyes?<br/>
The sky up there . . . . yet here or next door or across the way?<br/>
The saints and sages in history . . . . but you yourself?<br/>
Sermons and creeds and theology . . . . but the human brain, and what is called reason, and what is called love, and what is called life?
</p>
<p>
I do not despise you priests;<br/>
My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,<br/>
Enclosing all worship ancient and modern, and all between ancient and modern,<br/>
Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years,<br/>
Waiting responses from oracles . . . . honoring the gods . . . . saluting the sun,<br/>
Making a fetish of the first rock or stump . . . . powowing with sticks in the circle of obis,<br/>
Helping the lama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,<br/>
Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession . . . . rapt and austere in the woods, a gymnosophist,<br/>
Drinking mead from the skull-cup . . . . to shasta and vedas admirant . . . . minding the koran,<br/>
Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife  &mdash;  beating the serpent-skin drum;<br/>
Accepting the gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine,<br/>
To the mass kneeling  &mdash;  to the puritan's prayer rising  &mdash;  sitting patiently in a pew,<br/>
Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis  &mdash;  waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me;<br/>
Looking forth on pavement and land, and outside of pavement and land,<br/>
Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.
</p>
<p>
One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang,<br/>
I turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a journey.
</p>
<p>
Down-hearted doubters, dull and excluded,<br/>
Frivolous sullen moping angry affected disheartened atheistical,<br/>
I know every one of you, and know the unspoken interrogatories,<br/>
By experience I know them.
</p>
<p>
How the flukes splash!<br/>
How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of blood!
</p>
<p>
Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,<br/>
I take my place among you as much as among any;<br/>
The past is the push of you and me and all precisely the same,<br/>
And the night is for you and me and all,<br/>
And what is yet untried and afterward is for you and me and all.
</p>
<p>
I do not know what is untried and afterward,<br/>
But I know it is sure and alive, and sufficient.
</p>
<p>
Each who passes is considered, and each who stops is considered, and not a single one can it fail.
</p>
<p>
It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,<br/>
Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,<br/>
Nor the little child that peeped in at the door and then drew back and was never seen again,<br/>
Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall,<br/>
Nor him in the poorhouse tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,<br/>
Nor the numberless slaughtered and wrecked . . . . nor the brutish koboo, called the ordure of humanity,<br/>
Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in,<br/>
Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth,<br/>
Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor one of the myriads of myriads that inhabit them,<br/>
Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.
</p>
<p>
It is time to explain myself . . . . let us stand up.
</p>
<p>
What is known I strip away . . . . I launch all men and women forward with me into the unknown.
</p>
<p>
The clock indicates the moment . . . . but what does eternity indicate?
</p>
<p>
Eternity lies in bottomless reservoirs . . . . its buckets are rising forever and ever,<br/>
They pour and they pour and they exhale away.
</p>
<p>
We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers;<br/>
There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.
</p>
<p>
Births have brought us richness and variety,<br/>
And other births will bring us richness and variety.
</p>
<p>
I do not call one greater and one smaller,<br/>
That which fills its period and place is equal to any.
</p>
<p>
Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you my brother or my sister?<br/>
I am sorry for you . . . . they are not murderous or jealous upon me;<br/>
All has been gentle with me . . . . . . I keep no account with lamentation;<br/>
What have I to do with lamentation?
</p>
<p>
I am an acme of things accomplished, and I an encloser of things to be.
</p>
<p>
My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,<br/>
On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps,<br/>
All below duly traveled  &mdash;  and still I mount and mount.
</p>
<p>
Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,<br/>
Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, the vapor from the nostrils of death,<br/>
I know I was even there . . . . I waited unseen and always,<br/>
And slept while God carried me through the lethargic mist,<br/>
And took my time . . . . and took no hurt from the foetid carbon.
</p>
<p>
Long I was hugged close . . . . long and long.
</p>
<p>
Immense have been the preparations for me,<br/>
Faithful and friendly the arms that have helped me.
</p>
<p>
Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen;<br/>
For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,<br/>
They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.
</p>
<p>
Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,<br/>
My embryo has never been torpid . . . . nothing could overlay it;<br/>
For it the nebula cohered to an orb . . . . the long slow strata piled to rest it on . . . . vast vegetables gave it sustenance,<br/>
Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care.
</p>
<p>
All forces have been steadily employed to complete and delight me,<br/>
Now I stand on this spot with my soul.
</p>
<p>
Span of youth! Ever-pushed elasticity! Manhood balanced and florid and full!
</p>
<p>
My lovers suffocate me!<br/>
Crowding my lips, and thick in the pores of my skin,<br/>
Jostling me through streets and public halls . . . . coming naked to me at night,<br/>
Crying by day Ahoy from the rocks of the river . . . . swinging and chirping over my head,<br/>
Calling my name from flowerbeds or vines or tangled underbrush,<br/>
Or while I swim in the bath . . . . or drink from the pump at the corner . . . . or the curtain is down at the opera . . . . or I glimpse at a woman's face in the railroad car;<br/>
Lighting on every moment of my life,<br/>
Bussing my body with soft and balsamic busses,<br/>
Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.
</p>
<p>
Old age superbly rising! Ineffable grace of dying days!
</p>
<p>
Every condition promulges not only itself . . . . it promulges what grows after and out of itself,<br/>
And the dark hush promulges as much as any.
</p>
<p>
I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,<br/>
And all I see, multiplied as high as I can cipher, edge but the rim of the farther systems.<br/>
Wider and wider they spread, expanding and always expanding,<br/>
Outward and outward and forever outward.
</p>
<p>
My sun has his sun, and round him obediently wheels,<br/>
He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,<br/>
And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.
</p>
<p>
There is no stoppage, and never can be stoppage;<br/>
If I and you and the worlds and all beneath or upon their surfaces, and all the palpable life, were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long run,<br/>
We should surely bring up again where we now stand,<br/>
And as surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.
</p>
<p>
A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span, or make it impatient,<br/>
They are but parts . . . . any thing is but a part.
</p>
<p>
See ever so far . . . . there is limitless space outside of that,<br/>
Count ever so much . . . . there is limitless time around that.<br/>
Our rendezvous is fitly appointed . . . . God will be there and wait till we come.
</p>
<p>
I know I have the best of time and space  &mdash;  and that I was never measured, and never will be measured.
</p>
<p>
I tramp a perpetual journey,<br/>
My signs are a rain-proof coat and good shoes and a staff cut from the woods;<br/>
No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,<br/>
I have no chair, nor church nor philosophy;<br/>
I lead no man to a dinner-table or library or exchange,<br/>
But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,<br/>
My left hand hooks you round the waist,<br/>
My right hand points to landscapes of continents, and a plain public road.
</p>
<p>
Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,<br/>
You must travel it for yourself.
</p>
<p>
It is not far . . . . it is within reach,<br/>
Perhaps you have been on it since you were born, and did not know,<br/>
Perhaps it is every where on water and on land.
</p>
<p>
Shoulder your duds, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth;<br/>
Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.
</p>
<p>
If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip,<br/>
And in due time you shall repay the same service to me;<br/>
For after we start we never lie by again.
</p>
<p>
This day before dawn I ascended a hill and looked at the crowded heaven,<br/>
And I said to my spirit, When we become the enfolders of those orbs and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we be filled and satisfied then?<br/>
And my spirit said No, we level that lift to pass and continue beyond.
</p>
<p>
You are also asking me questions, and I hear you;<br/>
I answer that I cannot answer . . . . you must find out for yourself.
</p>
<p>
Sit awhile wayfarer,<br/>
Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,<br/>
But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes I will certainly kiss you with my goodbye kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.
</p>
<p>
Long enough have you dreamed contemptible dreams,<br/>
Now I wash the gum from your eyes,<br/>
You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life
</p>
<p>
Long have you timidly waded, holding a plank by the shore,<br/>
Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,<br/>
To jump off in the midst of the sea, and rise again and nod to me and shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.
</p>
<p>
I am the teacher of athletes,<br/>
He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,<br/>
He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.
</p>
<p>
The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power but in his own right,<br/>
Wicked, rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,<br/>
Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,<br/>
Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than a wound cuts,<br/>
First rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo,<br/>
Preferring scars and faces pitted with smallpox over all latherers and those that keep out of the sun.
</p>
<p>
I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?<br/>
I follow you whoever you are from the present hour;<br/>
My words itch at your ears till you understand them.
</p>
<p>
I do not say these things for a dollar, or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat;<br/>
It is you talking just as much as myself . . . . I act as the tongue of you,<br/>
It was tied in your mouth . . . . in mine it begins to be loosened.
</p>
<p>
I swear I will never mention love or death inside a house,<br/>
And I swear I never will translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air.
</p>
<p>
If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore,<br/>
The nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop or the motion of waves a key,<br/>
The maul the oar and the handsaw second my words.
</p>
<p>
No shuttered room or school can commune with me,<br/>
But roughs and little children better than they.
</p>
<p>
The young mechanic is closest to me . . . . he knows me pretty well,<br/>
The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day,<br/>
The farmboy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,<br/>
In vessels that sail my words must sail . . . . I go with fishermen and seamen, and love them,<br/>
My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in his blanket,<br/>
The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,<br/>
The young mother and old mother shall comprehend me,<br/>
The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,<br/>
They and all would resume what I have told them.
</p>
<p>
I have said that the soul is not more than the body,<br/>
And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,<br/>
And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's-self is,<br/>
And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral, dressed in his shroud,<br/>
And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,<br/>
And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times,<br/>
And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero,<br/>
And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheeled universe,<br/>
And any man or woman shall stand cool and supercilious before a million universes.
</p>
<p>
And I call to mankind, Be not curious about God,<br/>
For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,<br/>
No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death.<br/>
I hear and behold God in every object, yet I understand God not in the least,<br/>
Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.
</p>
<p>
Why should I wish to see God better than this day?<br/>
I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,<br/>
In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass;<br/>
I find letters from God dropped in the street, and every one is signed by God's name,<br/>
And I leave them where they are, for I know that others will punctually come forever and ever.
</p>
<p>
And as to you death, and you bitter hug of mortality . . . . it is idle to try to alarm me.
</p>
<p>
To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,<br/>
I see the elderhand pressing receiving supporting,<br/>
I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors . . . . and mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.
</p>
<p>
And as to you corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not offend me,<br/>
I smell the white roses sweetscented and growing,<br/>
I reach to the leafy lips . . . . I reach to the polished breasts of melons.
</p>
<p>
And as to you life, I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,<br/>
No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.
</p>
<p>
I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,<br/>
O suns . . . . O grass of graves . . . . O perpetual transfers and promotions . . . . if you do not say anything how can I say anything?
</p>
<p>
Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,<br/>
Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,<br/>
Toss, sparkles of day and dusk . . . . toss on the black stems that decay in the muck,<br/>
Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.
</p>
<p>
I ascend from the moon . . . . I ascend from the night,<br/>
And perceive of the ghastly glitter the sunbeams reflected,<br/>
And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.
</p>
<p>
There is that in me . . . . I do not know what it is . . . . but I know it is in me.
</p>
<p>
Wrenched and sweaty . . . . calm and cool then my body becomes;<br/>
I sleep . . . . I sleep long.
</p>
<p>
I do not know it . . . . it is without name . . . . it is a word unsaid,<br/>
It is not in any dictionary or utterance or symbol.
</p>
<p>
Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,<br/>
To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I might tell more . . . . Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.
</p>
<p>
Do you see O my brothers and sisters?<br/>
It is not chaos or death . . . . it is form and union and plan . . . . it is eternal life . . . . it is happiness.
</p>
<p>
The past and present wilt . . . . I have filled them and emptied them,<br/>
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.
</p>
<p>
Listener up there! Here you . . . . what have you to confide to me?<br/>
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,<br/>
Talk honestly, for no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.
</p>
<p>
Do I contradict myself?<br/>
Very well then . . . . I contradict myself;<br/>
I am large . . . . I contain multitudes.
</p>
<p>
I concentrate toward them that are nigh . . . . I wait on the door-slab.
</p>
<p>
Who has done his day's work and will soonest be through with his supper?<br/>
Who wishes to walk with me?
</p>
<p>
Will you speak before I am gone? Will you prove already too late?
</p>
<p>
The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me . . . . he complains of my gab and my loitering.
</p>
<p>
I too am not a bit tamed . . . . I too am untranslatable,<br/>
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.
</p>
<p>
The last scud of day holds back for me,<br/>
It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadowed wilds,<br/>
It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.
</p>
<p>
I depart as air . . . . I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,<br/>
I effuse my flesh in eddies and drift it in lacy jags.<br/>
I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,<br/>
If you want me again look for me under your bootsoles.
</p>
<p>
You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,<br/>
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,<br/>
And filter and fibre your blood.
</p>
<p>
Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,<br/>
Missing me one place search another,<br/>
I stop some where waiting for you.

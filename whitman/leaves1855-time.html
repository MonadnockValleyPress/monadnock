<h1>Leaves of Grass</h1>
<h2>(1855 Edition)</h2>
<h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
<h3>To Think of Time</h3>
<p>
To think of time . . . . to think through the retrospection,<br/>
To think of today . . and the ages continued henceforward.
</p>
<p>
Have you guessed you yourself would not continue? Have you dreaded those earth-beetles?<br/>
Have you feared the future would be nothing to you?
</p>
<p>
Is today nothing? Is the beginningless past nothing?<br/>
If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing.
</p>
<p>
To think that the sun rose in the east . . . . that men and women were flexible and real and alive . . . . that every thing was real and alive;<br/>
To think that you and I did not see feel think nor bear our part,<br/>
To think that we are now here and bear our part.
</p>
<p>
Not a day passes . . not a minute or second without an accouchement;<br/>
Not a day passes . . not a minute or second without a corpse.
</p>
<p>
When the dull nights are over, and the dull days also,<br/>
When the soreness of lying so much in bed is over,<br/>
When the physician, after long putting off, gives the silent and terrible look for an answer,<br/>
When the children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters have been sent for,<br/>
When medicines stand unused on the shelf, and the camphor-smell has pervaded the rooms,<br/>
When the faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying,<br/>
When the twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,<br/>
When the breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases,<br/>
Then the corpse-limbs stretch on the bed, and the living look upon them,<br/>
They are palpable as the living are palpable.
</p>
<p>
The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,<br/>
But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously on the corpse.
</p>
<p>
To think that the rivers will come to flow, and the snow fall, and fruits ripen . . and act upon others as upon us now . . . . yet not act upon us;<br/>
To think of all these wonders of city and country . . and others taking great interest in them . . and we taking small interest in them.
</p>
<p>
To think how eager we are in building our houses,<br/>
To think others shall be just as eager . . and we quite indifferent.
</p>
<p>
I see one building the house that serves him a few years . . . . or seventy or eighty years at most;<br/>
I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.
</p>
<p>
Slowmoving and black lines creep over the whole earth . . . . they never cease . . . . they are the burial lines,<br/>
He that was President was buried, and he that is now President shall surely be buried.
</p>
<p>
Cold dash of waves at the ferrywharf,<br/>
Posh and ice in the river . . . . half-frozen mud in the streets,<br/>
A gray discouraged sky overhead . . . . the short last daylight of December,<br/>
A hearse and stages . . . . other vehicles give place,<br/>
The funeral of an old stagedriver . . . . the cortege mostly drivers.
</p>
<p>
Rapid the trot to the cemetery,<br/>
Duly rattles the deathbell . . . . the gate is passed . . . . the grave is halted at . . . . the living alight . . . . the hearse uncloses,<br/>
The coffin is lowered and settled . . . . the whip is laid on the coffin,<br/>
The earth is swiftly shovelled in . . . . a minute . . no one moves or speaks . . . . it is done,<br/>
He is decently put away . . . . is there anything more?
</p>
<p>
He was a goodfellow,<br/>
Freemouthed, quicktempered, not badlooking, able to take his own part,<br/>
Witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with life or death for a friend,<br/>
Fond of women, . . played some . . eat hearty and drank hearty,<br/>
Had known what it was to be flush . . grew lowspirited toward the last . . sickened . . was helped by a contribution,<br/>
Died aged forty-one years . . and that was his funeral.
</p>
<p>
Thumb extended or finger uplifted,<br/>
Apron, cape, gloves, strap . . . . wetweather clothes . . . . whip carefully chosen . . . . boss, spotter, starter, and hostler,<br/>
Somebody loafing on you, or you loafing on somebody . . . . headway . . . . man before and man behind,<br/>
Good day's work or bad day's work . . . . pet stock or mean stock . . . . first out or last out . . . . turning in at night,<br/>
To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers . . and he there takes no interest in them.
</p>
<p>
The markets, the government, the workingman's wages . . . . to think what account they are through our nights and days;<br/>
To think that other workingmen will make just as great account of them . . yet we make little or no account.
</p>
<p>
The vulgar and the refined . . . . what you call sin and what you call goodness . . to think how wide a difference;<br/>
To think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie beyond the difference.
</p>
<p>
To think how much pleasure there is!<br/>
Have you pleasure from looking at the sky? Have you pleasure from poems?<br/>
Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or planning a nomination and election? or with your wife and family?<br/>
Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the beautiful maternal cares?
</p>
<p>
These also flow onward to others . . . . you and I flow onward;<br/>
But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them.
</p>
<p>
Your farm and profits and crops . . . . to think how engrossed you are;<br/>
To think there will still be farms and profits and crops . . yet for you of what avail?
</p>
<p>
What will be will be well  &mdash;  for what is is well,<br/>
To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well.
</p>
<p>
The sky continues beautiful . . . . the pleasure of men with women shall never be sated . . nor the pleasure of women with men . . nor the pleasure from poems;<br/>
The domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of houses  &mdash;  they are not phantasms . . they have weight and form and location;<br/>
The farms and profits and crops . . the markets and wages and government . . they also are not phantasms;<br/>
The difference between sin and goodness is no apparition;<br/>
The earth is not an echo . . . . man and his life and all the things of his life are well-considered.
</p>
<p>
You are not thrown to the winds . . you gather certainly and safely around yourself,<br/>
Yourself! Yourself! Yourself forever and ever!<br/>
It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and father  &mdash;  it is to identify you,<br/>
It is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be decided;<br/>
Something long preparing and formless is arrived and formed in you,<br/>
You are thenceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.
</p>
<p>
The threads that were spun are gathered . . . . the weft crosses the warp . . . . the pattern is systematic.
</p>
<p>
The preparations have every one been justified;<br/>
The orchestra have tuned their instruments sufficiently . . . . the baton has given the signal.
</p>
<p>
The guest that was coming . . . . he waited long for reasons . . . . he is now housed,<br/>
He is one of those who are beautiful and happy . . . . he is one of those that to look upon and be with is enough.
</p>
<p>
The law of the past cannot be eluded.<br/>
The law of the present and future cannot be eluded,<br/>
The law of the living cannot be eluded . . . . it is eternal,<br/>
The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,<br/>
The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,<br/>
The law of drunkards and informers and mean persons cannot be eluded.
</p>
<p>
Slowmoving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,<br/>
Northerner goes carried and southerner goes carried . . . . and they on the Atlantic side and they on the Pacific, and they between, and all through the Mississippi country . . . . and all over the earth.
</p>
<p>
The great masters and kosmos are well as they go . . . . the heroes and good-doers are well,<br/>
The known leaders and inventors and the rich owners and pious and distinguished may be well,<br/>
But there is more account than that . . . . there is strict account of all.
</p>
<p>
The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,<br/>
The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,<br/>
The common people of Europe are not nothing . . . . the American aborigines are not nothing,<br/>
A zambo or a foreheadless Crowfoot or a Camanche is not nothing,<br/>
The infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothing . . . . the murderer or mean person is not nothing,<br/>
The perpetual succession of shallow people are not nothing as they go,<br/>
The prostitute is not nothing . . . . the mocker of religion is not nothing as he goes.
</p>
<p>
I shall go with the rest . . . . we have satisfaction:<br/>
I have dreamed that we are not to be changed so much . . . . nor the law of us changed;<br/>
I have dreamed that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present and past law,<br/>
And that murderers and drunkards and liars shall be under the present and past law;<br/>
For I have dreamed that the law they are under now is enough.
</p>
<p>
And I have dreamed that the satisfaction is not so much changed . . . . and that there is no life without satisfaction;<br/>
What is the earth? what are body and soul without satisfaction?
</p>
<p>
I shall go with the rest,<br/>
We cannot be stopped at a given point . . . . that is no satisfaction;<br/>
To show us a good thing or a few good things for a space of time  &mdash;  that is no satisfaction;<br/>
We must have the indestructible breed of the best, regardless of time.<br/>
If otherwise, all these things came but to ashes of dung;<br/>
If maggots and rats ended us, then suspicion and treachery and death.
</p>
<p>
Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect death I should die now,<br/>
Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation?
</p>
<p>
Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,<br/>
Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,<br/>
The whole universe indicates that it is good,<br/>
The past and the present indicate that it is good.
</p>
<p>
How beautiful and perfect are the animals! How perfect is my soul!<br/>
How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!<br/>
What is called good is perfect, and what is called sin is just as perfect;<br/>
The vegetables and minerals are all perfect . . and the imponderable fluids are perfect;<br/>
Slowly and surely they have passed on to this, and slowly and surely they will yet pass on.
</p>
<p>
O my soul! if I realize you I have satisfaction,<br/>
Animals and vegetables! if I realize you I have satisfaction,<br/>
Laws of the earth and air! if I realize you I have satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
I cannot define my satisfaction . . yet it is so,<br/>
I cannot define my life . . yet it is so.
</p>
<p>
I swear I see now that every thing has an eternal soul!<br/>
The trees have, rooted in the ground . . . . the weeds of the sea have . . . . the animals.
</p>
<p>
I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!<br/>
That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and the cohering is for it,<br/>
And all preparation is for it . . and identity is for it . . and life and death are for it.

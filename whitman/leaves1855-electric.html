<h1>Leaves of Grass</h1>
<h2>(1855 Edition)</h2>
<h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
<h3>I Sing the Body Electric</h3>
<p>
The bodies of men and women engirth me, and I engirth them,<br/>
They will not let me off nor I them till I go with them and respond to them and love them.
</p>
<p>
Was it dreamed whether those who corrupted their own live bodies could conceal themselves?<br/>
And whether those who defiled the living were as bad as they who defiled the dead?
</p>
<p>
The expression of the body of man or woman balks account,<br/>
The male is perfect and that of the female is perfect.
</p>
<p>
The expression of a wellmade man appears not only in his face,<br/>
It is in his limbs and joints also . . . . it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists,<br/>
It is in his walk . . the carriage of his neck . . the flex of his waist and knees . . . . dress does not hide him,<br/>
The strong sweet supple quality he has strikes through the cotton and flannel;<br/>
To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem . . perhaps more,<br/>
You linger to see his back and the back of his neck and shoulderside.
</p>
<p>
The sprawl and fulness of babes . . . . the bosoms and heads of women . . . . the folds of their dress . . . . their style as we pass in the street . . . . the contour of their shape downwards;<br/>
The swimmer naked in the swimmingbath . . seen as he swims through the salt transparent greenshine, or lies on his back and rolls silently with the heave of the water;<br/>
Framers bare-armed framing a house . . hoisting the beams in their places . . or using the mallet and mortising-chisel,<br/>
The bending forward and backward of rowers in rowboats . . . . the horseman in his saddle;<br/>
Girls and mothers and housekeepers in all their exquisite offices,<br/>
The group of laborers seated at noontime with their open dinnerkettles, and their wives waiting,<br/>
The female soothing a child . . . . the farmer's daughter in the garden or cowyard,<br/>
The woodman rapidly swinging his axe in the woods . . . . the young fellow hoeing corn . . . . the sleighdriver guiding his six horses through the crowd,<br/>
The wrestle of wrestlers . . two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, goodnatured, nativeborn, out on the vacant lot at sundown after work,<br/>
The coats vests and caps thrown down . . the embrace of love and resistance,<br/>
The upperhold and underhold  &mdash;  the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;<br/>
The march of firemen in their own costumes  &mdash;  the play of the masculine muscle through cleansetting trowsers and waistbands,<br/>
The slow return from the fire . . . . the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again  &mdash;  the listening on the alert,<br/>
The natural perfect and varied attitudes . . . . the bent head, the curved neck, the counting:<br/>
Suchlike I love . . . . I loosen myself and pass freely . . . . and am at the mother's breast with the little child,<br/>
And swim with the swimmer, and wrestle with wrestlers, and march in line with the firemen, and pause and listen and count.
</p>
<p>
I knew a man . . . . he was a common farmer . . . . he was the father of five sons . . . and in them were the fathers of sons . . . and in them were the fathers of sons.
</p>
<p>
This man was of wonderful vigor and calmness and beauty of person;<br/>
The shape of his head, the richness and breadth of his<br/>

manners, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes,<br/>
These I used to go and visit him to see . . . . He was wise also,<br/>
He was six feet tall . . . . he was over eighty years old . . . . his sons were massive clean bearded tanfaced and handsome,<br/>
They and his daughters loved him . . . all who saw him loved him . . . they did not love him by allowance . . . they loved him with personal love;<br/>
He drank water only . . . . the blood showed like scarlet through the clear brown skin of his face;<br/>
He was a frequent gunner and fisher . . . he sailed his boat himself . . . he had a fine one presented to him by a shipjoiner . . . . he had fowling-pieces, presented to him by men that loved him;<br/>
When he went with his five sons and many grandsons to hunt or fish you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,<br/>
You would wish long and long to be with him . . . . you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.
</p>
<p>
I have perceived that to be with those I like is enough,<br/>
To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,<br/>
To be surrounded by beautiful curious breathing laughing flesh is enough,<br/>
To pass among them . . to touch any one . . . . to rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment . . . . what is this then?<br/>
I do not ask any more delight . . . . I swim in it as in a sea.
</p>
<p>
There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them and in the contact and odor of them that pleases the soul well,<br/>
All things please the soul, but these please the soul well.
</p>
<p>
This is the female form,<br/>
A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,<br/>
It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction,<br/>
I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor . . . . all falls aside but myself and it,<br/>
Books, art, religion, time . . the visible and solid earth . . the atmosphere and the fringed clouds . . what was expected of heaven or feared of hell are now consumed,<br/>
Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it . . the response likewise ungovernable,<br/>
Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands   &mdash;  all diffused . . . . mine too diffused,<br/>
Ebb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb . . . . loveflesh swelling and deliciously aching,<br/>
Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous . . . . quivering jelly of love . . . white-blow and delirious juice,<br/>
Bridegroom-night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn,<br/>
Undulating into the willing and yielding day,<br/>
Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweetfleshed day.
</p>
<p>
This is the nucleus . . . after the child is born of woman the man is born of woman,<br/>
This is the bath of birth . . . this is the merge of small and large and the outlet again.
</p>
<p>
Be not ashamed women . . your privilege encloses the rest . . it is the exit of the rest,<br/>
You are the gates of the body and you are the gates of the soul.
</p>
<p>
The female contains all qualities and tempers them . . . . she is in her place . . . . she moves with perfect balance,<br/>
She is all things duly veiled . . . . she is both passive and active . . . . she is to conceive daughters as well as sons and sons as well as daughters.
</p>
<p>
As I see my soul reflected in nature . . . . as I see through a mist one with inexpressible completeness and beauty . . . . see the bent head and arms folded over the breast . . . . the female I see,<br/>
I see the bearer of the great fruit which is immortality . . . . the good thereof is not tasted by roues, and never can be.
</p>
<p>
The male is not less the soul, nor more . . . . he too is in his place,<br/>
He too is all qualities . . . . he is action and power . . . . the flush of the known universe is in him,<br/>
Scorn becomes him well and appetite and defiance become him well,<br/>
The fiercest largest passions . . bliss that is utmost and sorrow that is utmost become him well . . . . pride is for him,<br/>
The fullspread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul;<br/>
Knowledge becomes him . . . . he likes it always . . . . he brings everything to the test of himself,<br/>
Whatever the survey . . whatever the sea and the sail, he strikes soundings at last only here,<br/>
Where else does he strike soundings except here?
</p>
<p>
The man's body is sacred and the woman's body is sacred . . . . it is no matter who,<br/>
Is it a slave? Is it one of the dullfaced immigrants just landed on the wharf?
</p>
<p>
Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the welloff . . . . just as much as you,<br/>
Each has his or her place in the procession.
</p>
<p>
All is a procession,<br/>
The universe is a procession with measured and beautiful motion.
</p>
<p>
Do you know so much that you call the slave or the dullface ignorant?<br/>
Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight . . . and he or she has no right to a sight?<br/>
Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffused float, and the soil is on the surface and water runs and vegetation sprouts for you . . and not for him and her?
</p>
<p>
A slave at auction!<br/>
I help the auctioneer . . . . the sloven does not half know his business.
</p>
<p>
Gentlemen look on this curious creature,<br/>
Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for him,<br/>
For him the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant,<br/>
For him the revolving cycles truly and steadily rolled.
</p>
<p>
In that head the allbaffling brain,<br/>
In it and below it the making of the attributes of heroes.
</p>
<p>
Examine these limbs, red black or white . . . . they are very cunning in tendon and nerve;<br/>
They shall be stript that you may see them.
</p>
<p>
Exquisite senses, lifelit eyes, pluck, volition,<br/>
Flakes of breastmuscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, goodsized arms and legs,<br/>
And wonders within there yet.
</p>
<p>
Within there runs his blood . . . . the same old blood . . the same red running blood;<br/>
There swells and jets his heart . . . . There all passions and desires . . all reachings and aspirations:<br/>
Do you think they are not there because they are not expressed in parlors and lecture-rooms?
</p>
<p>
This is not only one man . . . . he is the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns,<br/>
In him the start of populous states and rich republics,<br/>
Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.
</p>
<p>
How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries?<br/>
Who might you find you have come from yourself if you could trace back through the centuries?
</p>
<p>
A woman at auction,<br/>
She too is not only herself . . . . she is the teeming mother of mothers,<br/>
She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers.
</p>
<p>
Her daughters or their daughters' daughters . . who knows who shall mate with them?<br/>
Who knows through the centuries what heroes may come from them?
</p>
<p>
In them and of them natal love . . . . in them the divine mystery . . . . the same old beautiful mystery.
</p>
<p>
Have you ever loved a woman?<br/>
Your mother . . . . is she living? . . . . Have you been much with her? and has she been much with you?<br/>
Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth?
</p>
<p>
If life and the soul are sacred the human body is sacred;<br/>
And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted,<br/>
And in man or woman a clean strong firmfibred body is beautiful as the most beautiful face.
</p>
<p>
Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body?<br/>
For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.
</p>
<p>
Who degrades or defiles the living human body is cursed,<br/>
Who degrades or defiles the body of the dead is not more<br/>
cursed.

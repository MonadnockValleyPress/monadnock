<h1>Leaves of Grass</h1>
<h2>(1855 Edition)</h2>
<h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
<h3>Great Are the Myths</h3>
<p>
Great are the myths . . . . I too delight in them,<br/>
Great are Adam and Eve . . . . I too look back and accept them;<br/>
Great the risen and fallen nations, and their poets, women, sages, inventors, rulers, warriors and priests.
</p>
<p>
Great is liberty! Great is equality! I am their follower,<br/>
Helmsmen of nations, choose your craft . . . . where you sail I sail,<br/>
Yours is the muscle of life or death . . . . yours is the perfect science . . . . in you I have absolute faith.
</p>
<p>
Great is today, and beautiful,<br/>
It is good to live in this age . . . . there never was any better.
</p>
<p>
Great are the plunges and throes and triumphs and falls of democracy,<br/>
Great the reformers with their lapses and screams,<br/>
Great the daring and venture of sailors on new explorations.
</p>
<p>
Great are yourself and myself,<br/>
We are just as good and bad as the oldest and youngest or any,<br/>
What the best and worst did we could do,<br/>
What they felt . . do not we feel it in ourselves?<br/>
What they wished . . do we not wish the same?
</p>
<p>
Great is youth, and equally great is old age . . . . great are the day and night;<br/>
Great is wealth and great is poverty . . . . great is expression and great is silence.
</p>
<p>
Youth large lusty and loving . . . . youth full of grace and force and fascination,<br/>
Do you know that old age may come after you with equal grace and force and fascination?
</p>
<p>
Day fullblown and splendid . . . . day of the immense sun, and action and ambition and laughter,<br/>
The night follows close, with millions of suns, and sleep and restoring darkness.
</p>
<p>
Wealth with the flush hand and fine clothes and hospitality:<br/>
But then the soul's wealth  &mdash;  which is candor and knowledge and pride and enfolding love:<br/>
Who goes for men and women showing poverty richer than wealth?
</p>
<p>
Expression of speech . . in what is written or said forget not that silence is also expressive,<br/>
That anguish as hot as the hottest and contempt as cold as the coldest may be without words,<br/>
That the true adoration is likewise without words and without kneeling.
</p>
<p>
Great is the greatest nation . . the nation of clusters of equal nations.
</p>
<p>
Great is the earth, and the way it became what it is,<br/>
Do you imagine it is stopped at this? . . . . and the increase abandoned?<br/>
Understand then that it goes as far onward from this as this is from the times when it lay in covering waters and gases.
</p>
<p>
Great is the quality of truth in man,<br/>
The quality of truth in man supports itself through all changes,<br/>
It is inevitably in the man . . . . He and it are in love, and never leave each other.<br/>
The truth in man is no dictum . . . . it is vital as eyesight,<br/>
If there be any soul there is truth . . . . if there be man or woman there is truth . . . . If there be physical or moral there is truth,<br/>
If there be equilibrium or volition there is truth . . . . if there be things at all upon the earth there is truth.
</p>
<p>
O truth of the earth! O truth of things! I am determined to press the whole way toward you,<br/>
Sound your voice! I scale mountains or dive in the sea after you.
</p>
<p>
Great is language . . . . it is the mightiest of the sciences,<br/>
It is the fulness and color and form and diversity of the earth . . . . and of men and women . . . . and of all qualities and processes;<br/>
It is greater than wealth . . . . it is greater than buildings or ships or religions or paintings or music.
</p>
<p>
Great is the English speech . . . . What speech is so great as the English?<br/>
Great is the English brood . . . . What brood has so vast a destiny as the English?<br/>
It is the mother of the brood that must rule the earth with the new rule,<br/>
The new rule shall rule as the soul rules, and as the love and justice and equality that are in the soul rule.
</p>
<p>
Great is the law . . . . Great are the old few landmarks of the law . . . . they are the same in all times and shall not be disturbed.
</p>
<p>
Great are marriage, commerce, newspapers, books, freetrade, railroads, steamers, international mails and telegraphs and exchanges.
</p>
<p>
Great is Justice;<br/>
Justice is not settled by legislators and laws . . . . it is in the soul,<br/>
It cannot be varied by statutes any more than love or pride or the attraction of gravity can,<br/>
It is immutable . . it does not depend on majorities . . . . majorities or what not come at last before the same passionless and exact tribunal.
</p>
<p>
For justice are the grand natural lawyers and perfect judges . . . . it is in their souls,<br/>
It is well assorted . . . . they have not studied for nothing . . . . the great includes the less,<br/>
They rule on the highest grounds . . . . they oversee all eras and states and administrations.
</p>
<p>
The perfect judge fears nothing . . . . he could go front to front before God,<br/>
Before the perfect judge all shall stand back . . . . life and death shall stand back . . . . heaven and hell shall stand back.
</p>
<p>
Great is goodness;<br/>
I do not know what it is any more than I know what health is . . . . but I know it is great.
</p>
<p>
Great is wickedness . . . . I find I often admire it just as much as I admire goodness:<br/>
Do you call that a paradox? It certainly is a paradox.
</p>
<p>
The eternal equilibrium of things is great, and the eternal overthrow of things is great,<br/>
And there is another paradox.
</p>
<p>
Great is life . . and real and mystical . . wherever and whoever,<br/>
Great is death . . . . Sure as life holds all parts together, death holds all parts together;<br/>
Sure as the stars return again after they merge in the light, death is great as life.
</p>

<h1>Leaves of Grass</h1>
<h2>(1855 Edition)</h2>
<h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
<h3>There Was a Child Went Forth</h3>
<p>
There was a child went forth every day,<br/>
And the first object he looked upon and received with wonder or pity or love or dread, that object he became,<br/>
And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day . . . . or for many years or stretching cycles of years.
</p>
<p>
The early lilacs became part of this child,<br/>
And grass, and white and red morningglories, and white and red clover, and the song of the phoebe-bird,<br/>
And the March-born lambs, and the sow's pink-faint litter, and the mare's foal, and the cow's calf, and the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pond-side . . and the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there . . and the beautiful curious liquid . . and the water-plants with their graceful flat heads . . all became part of him.
</p>
<p>
And the field-sprouts of April and May became part of him . . . . wintergrain sprouts, and those of the light-yellow corn, and of the esculent roots of the garden,<br/>
And the appletrees covered with blossoms, and the fruit afterward . . . . and woodberries . . and the commonest weeds by the road;<br/>
And the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the tavern whence he had lately risen,<br/>
And the schoolmistress that passed on her way to the school . . and the friendly boys that passed . . and the quarrelsome boys . . and the tidy and freshcheeked girls . . and the barefoot negro boy and girl,<br/>
And all the changes of city and country wherever he went.
</p>
<p>
His own parents . . he that had propelled the fatherstuff at night, and fathered him . . and she that conceived him in her womb and birthed him . . . . they gave this child more of themselves than that,<br/>
They gave him afterward every day . . . . they and of them became part of him.<br/>
The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the suppertable,<br/>
The mother with mild words . . . . clean her cap and gown . . . . a wholesome odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by:<br/>
The father, strong, selfsufficient, manly, mean, angered, unjust,<br/>
The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure,<br/>
The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture . . . . the yearning and swelling heart,<br/>
Affection that will not be gainsayed . . . . The sense of what is real . . . . the thought if after all it should prove unreal,<br/>
The doubts of daytime and the doubts of nighttime . . . the curious whether and how,<br/>
Whether that which appears so is so . . . . Or is it all flashes and specks?<br/>
Men and women crowding fast in the streets . . if they are not flashes and specks what are they?<br/>
The streets themselves, and the facades of houses . . . . the goods in the windows,<br/>
Vehicles . . teams . . the tiered wharves, and the huge crossing at the ferries;<br/>
The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset . . . . the river between,<br/>
Shadows . . aureola and mist . . light falling on roofs and gables of white or brown, three miles off,<br/>
The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide . . the little boat slacktowed astern,<br/>
The hurrying tumbling waves and quickbroken crests and slapping;<br/>
The strata of colored clouds . . . . the long bar of maroontint away solitary by itself . . . . the spread of purity it lies motionless in,<br/>
The horizon's edge, the flying seacrow, the fragrance of saltmarsh and shoremud;<br/>
These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who now goes and will always go forth every day,<br/>
And these become of him or her that peruses them now.

<h3>A Boston Ballad</h3>
<p>
Clear the way there Jonathan!<br/>
Way for the President's marshal! Way for the government cannon!<br/>
Way for the federal foot and dragoons . . . . and the phantoms afterward.
</p>
<p>
I rose this morning early to get betimes in Boston town;<br/>
Here's a good place at the corner . . . . I must stand and see the show.
</p>
<p>
I love to look on the stars and stripes . . . . I hope the fifes will play Yankee Doodle.
</p>
<p>
How bright shine the foremost with cutlasses,<br/>
Every man holds his revolver . . . . marching stiff through Boston town.
</p>
<p>
A fog follows . . . . antiques of the same come limping,<br/>
Some appear wooden-legged and some appear bandaged and bloodless.
</p>
<p>
Why this is a show! It has called the dead out of the earth,<br/>
The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see;<br/>
Uncountable phantoms gather by flank and rear of it,<br/>
Cocked hats of mothy mould and crutches made of mist,<br/>
Arms in slings and old men leaning on young men's shoulders.
</p>
<p>
What troubles you, Yankee phantoms? What is all this chattering of bare gums?<br/>
Does the ague convulse your limbs? Do you mistake your crutches for firelocks, and level them?
</p>
<p>
If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President's marshal,<br/>
If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon.
</p>
<p>
For shame old maniacs! . . . . Bring down those tossed arms, and let your white hair be;<br/>
Here gape your smart grandsons . . . . their wives gaze at them from the windows,<br/>
See how well-dressed . . . . see how orderly they conduct themselves.
</p>
<p>
Worse and worse . . . . Can't you stand it? Are you retreating?<br/>
Is this hour with the living too dead for you?
</p>
<p>
Retreat then! Pell-mell! . . . . Back to the hills, old limpers!<br/>
I do not think you belong here anyhow.<br/>
But there is one thing that belongs here . . . . Shall I tell you what it is, gentlemen of Boston?
</p>
<p>
I will whisper it to the Mayor . . . . he shall send a committee to England,<br/>
They shall get a grant from the Parliament, and go with a cart to the royal vault,<br/>
Dig out King George's coffin . . . . unwrap him quick from the graveclothes . . . . box up his bones for a journey:<br/>
Find a swift Yankee clipper . . . . here is freight for you blackbellied clipper,<br/>
Up with your anchor! shake out your sails! . . . . steer straight toward Boston bay.
</p>
<p>
Now call the President's marshal again, and bring out the government cannon,<br/>
And fetch home the roarers from Congress, and make another procession and guard it with foot and dragoons.
</p>
<p>
Here is a centrepiece for them:<br/>
Look! all orderly citizens . . . . look from the windows women.
</p>
<p>
The committee open the box and set up the regal ribs and glue those that will not stay,<br/>
And clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull.
</p>
<p>
You have got your revenge old buster! . . . . The crown is come to its own and more than its own.
</p>
<p>
Stick your hands in your pockets Jonathan . . . . you are a made man from this day,<br/>
You are mighty cute . . . . and here is one of your bargains.

<h1>Leaves of Grass</h1>
<h2>(1855 Edition)</h2>
<h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
<h3>Europe the 72d and 73d Years of These States</h3>
<p>
Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,<br/>
Like lightning Europe le'pt forth . . . . half startled at itself,<br/>
Its feet upon the ashes and the rags . . . . Its hands tight to the throats of kings.
</p>
<p>
O hope and faith! O aching close of lives! O many a sickened heart!<br/>
Turn back unto this day, and make yourselves afresh.
</p>
<p>
And you, paid to defile the People . . . . you liars mark:<br/>
Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,<br/>
For court thieving in its manifold mean forms,<br/>
Worming from his simplicity the poor man's wages;<br/>
For many a promise sworn by royal lips, And broken, and laughed at in the breaking,<br/>
Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike of personal revenge . . or the heads of the nobles fall;<br/>
The People scorned the ferocity of kings.
</p>
<p>
But the sweetness of mercy brewed bitter destruction, and the frightened rulers come back:<br/>
Each comes in state with his train . . . . hangman, priest and tax-gatherer . . . . soldier, lawyer, jailer and sycophant.
</p>
<p>
Yet behind all, lo, a Shape,<br/>
Vague as the night, draped interminably, head front and form in scarlet folds,<br/>
Whose face and eyes none may see,<br/>
Out of its robes only this . . . . the red robes, lifted by the arm,<br/>
One finger pointed high over the top, like the head of a snake appears.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves . . . . bloody corpses of young men:<br/>
The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily . . . . the bullets of princes are flying . . . . the creatures of power laugh aloud,<br/>
And all these things bear fruits . . . . and they are good.
</p>
<p>
Those corpses of young men,<br/>
Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets . . . those hearts pierced by the gray lead,<br/>
Cold and motionless as they seem . . live elsewhere with unslaughter'd vitality.
</p>
<p>
They live in other young men, O kings,<br/>
They live in brothers, again ready to defy you:<br/>
They were purified by death . . . . They were taught and exalted.
</p>
<p>
Not a grave of the murdered for freedom but grows seed for freedom . . . . in its turn to bear seed,<br/>
Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the snows nourish.
</p>
<p>
Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,<br/>
But it stalks invisibly over the earth . . whispering counseling cautioning.
</p>
<p>
Liberty let others despair of you . . . . I never despair of you.
</p>
<p>
Is the house shut? Is the master away?<br/>
Nevertheless be ready . . . . be not weary of watching,<br/>
He will soon return . . . . his messengers come anon.

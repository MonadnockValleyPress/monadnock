<h1>Leaves of Grass</h1>
<h2>(1855 Edition)</h2>
<h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
<h3>The Sleepers</h3>
<p>
I wander all night in my vision,<br/>
Stepping with light feet . . . . swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping,<br/>
Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers;<br/>
Wandering and confused . . . . lost to myself . . . . ill-assorted . . . . contradictory,<br/>
Pausing and gazing and bending and stopping.
</p>
<p>
How solemn they look there, stretched and still;<br/>
How quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles.
</p>
<p>
The wretched features of ennuyees, the white features of corpses, the livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of onanists,<br/>
The gashed bodies on battlefields, the insane in their strong-doored rooms, the sacred idiots,<br/>
The newborn emerging from gates and the dying emerging from gates,<br/>
The night pervades them and enfolds them.
</p>
<p>
The married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his palm on the hip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of the husband,<br/>
The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,<br/>
The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,<br/>
And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapped.
</p>
<p>
The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,<br/>
The prisoner sleeps well in the prison . . . . the runaway son sleeps,<br/>
The murderer that is to be hung next day . . . . how does he sleep?<br/>
And the murdered person . . . . how does he sleep?
</p>
<p>
The female that loves unrequited sleeps,<br/>
And the male that loves unrequited sleeps;<br/>
The head of the moneymaker that plotted all day sleeps,<br/>
And the enraged and treacherous dispositions sleep.
</p>
<p>
I stand with drooping eyes by the worstsuffering and restless,<br/>
I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them;<br/>
The restless sink in their beds . . . . they fitfully sleep.
</p>
<p>
The earth recedes from me into the night,<br/>
I saw that it was beautiful . . . . and I see that what is not the earth is beautiful.
</p>
<p>
I go from bedside to bedside . . . . I sleep close with the other sleepers, each in turn;<br/>
I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,<br/>
And I become the other dreamers.
</p>
<p>
I am a dance . . . . Play up there! the fit is whirling me fast.
</p>
<p>
I am the everlaughing . . . . it is new moon and twilight,<br/>
I see the hiding of douceurs . . . . I see nimble ghosts whichever way I look,<br/>
Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where it is neither ground or sea.<br/>
Well do they do their jobs, those journeymen divine,<br/>
Only from me can they hide nothing and would not if they could;<br/>
I reckon I am their boss, and they make me a pet besides,<br/>
And surround me, and lead me and run ahead when I walk,<br/>
And lift their cunning covers and signify me with stretched arms, and resume the way;<br/>
Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards with mirthshouting music and wildflapping pennants of joy.
</p>
<p>
I am the actor and the actress . . . . the voter . . the politician,<br/>
The emigrant and the exile . . the criminal that stood in the box,<br/>
He who has been famous, and he who shall be famous after today,<br/>
The stammerer . . . . the wellformed person . . the wasted or feeble person.
</p>
<p>
I am she who adorned herself and folded her hair expectantly,<br/>
My truant lover has come and it is dark.
</p>
<p>
Double yourself and receive me darkness,<br/>
Receive me and my lover too . . . . he will not let me go without him.
</p>
<p>
I roll myself upon you as upon a bed . . . . I resign myself to the dusk.
</p>
<p>
He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover,<br/>
He rises with me silently from the bed.
</p>
<p>
Darkness you are gentler than my lover . . . . his flesh was sweaty and panting,<br/>
I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.
</p>
<p>
My hands are spread forth . . I pass them in all directions,<br/>
I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.
</p>
<p>
Be careful, darkness . . . . already, what was it touched me?<br/>
I thought my lover had gone . . . . else darkness and he are one,<br/>
I hear the heart-beat . . . . I follow . . I fade away.
</p>
<p>
O hotcheeked and blushing! O foolish hectic!<br/>
O for pity's sake, no one must see me now! . . . . my clothes were stolen while I was abed,<br/>
Now I am thrust forth, where shall I run?
</p>
<p>
Pier that I saw dimly last night when I looked from the windows,<br/>
Pier out from the main, let me catch myself with you and stay . . . . I will not chafe you;<br/>
I feel ashamed to go naked about the world,<br/>
And am curious to know where my feet stand . . . . and what is this flooding me, childhood or manhood . . . . and the hunger that crosses the bridge between.
</p>
<p>
The cloth laps a first sweet eating and drinking,<br/>
Laps life-swelling yolks . . . . laps ear of rose-corn, milky and just ripened:<br/>
The white teeth stay, and the boss-tooth advances in darkness,<br/>
And liquor is spilled on lips and bosoms by touching glasses, and the best liquor afterward.
</p>
<p>
I descend my western course . . . . my sinews are flaccid,<br/>
Perfume and youth course through me, and I am their wake.
</p>
<p>
It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman's,<br/>
I sit low in a strawbottom chair and carefully darn my grandson's stockings.
</p>
<p>
It is I too . . . . the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight,<br/>
I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.
</p>
<p>
A shroud I see  &mdash;  and I am the shroud . . . . I wrap a body and lie in the coffin;<br/>
It is dark here underground . . . . it is not evil or pain here . . . . it is blank here, for reasons.
</p>
<p>
It seems to me that everything in the light and air ought to be happy;<br/>
Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave, let him know he has enough.
</p>
<p>
I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies of the sea,<br/>
His brown hair lies close and even to his head . . . . he strikes out with courageous arms . . . . he urges himself with his legs.<br/>
I see his white body . . . . I see his undaunted eyes;<br/>
I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him headforemost on the rocks.
</p>
<p>
What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?<br/>
Will you kill the courageous giant? Will you kill him in the prime of his middle age?
</p>
<p>
Steady and long he struggles;<br/>
He is baffled and banged and bruised . . . . he holds out while his strength holds out,<br/>
The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood . . . . they bear him away . . . . they roll him and swing him and turn him:<br/>
His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies . . . . it is continually bruised on rocks,<br/>
Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.
</p>
<p>
I turn but do not extricate myself;<br/>
Confused . . . . a pastreading . . . . another, but with darkness yet.
</p>
<p>
The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind . . . . the wreck-guns sound,<br/>
The tempest lulls and the moon comes floundering through the drifts.
</p>
<p>
I look where the ship helplessly heads end on . . . . I hear the burst as she strikes . . I hear the howls of dismay . . . . they grow fainter and fainter.
</p>
<p>
I cannot aid with my wringing fingers;<br/>
I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me.
</p>
<p>
I search with the crowd . . . . not one of the company is washed to us alive;<br/>
In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.
</p>
<p>
Now of the old war-days . . the defeat at Brooklyn;<br/>
Washington stands inside the lines . . he stands on the entrenched hills amid a crowd of officers,<br/>
His face is cold and damp . . . . he cannot repress the weeping drops . . . . he lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes . . . . the color is blanched from his cheeks,<br/>
He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by their parents.
</p>
<p>
The same at last and at last when peace is declared,<br/>
He stands in the room of the old tavern . . . . the wellbeloved soldiers all pass through,<br/>
The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,<br/>
The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek,<br/>
He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another . . . . he shakes hands and bids goodbye to the army.
</p>
<p>
Now I tell what my mother told me today as we sat at dinner together,<br/>
Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on the old homestead.
</p>
<p>
A red squaw came one breakfasttime to the old homestead,<br/>
On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rushbottoming chairs;<br/>
Her hair straight shiny coarse black and profuse halfenveloped her face,<br/>
Her step was free and elastic . . . . her voice sounded exquisitely as she spoke.<br/>
My mother looked in delight and amazement at the stranger,<br/>
She looked at the beauty of her tallborne face and full and pliant limbs,<br/>
The more she looked upon her she loved her,<br/>
Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity;<br/>
She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace . . . . she cooked food for her,<br/>
She had no work to give her but she gave her remembrance and fondness.
</p>
<p>
The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the afternoon she went away;<br/>
O my mother was loth to have her go away,<br/>
All the week she thought of her . . . . she watched for her many a month,<br/>
She remembered her many a winter and many a summer,<br/>
But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.
</p>
<p>
Now Lucifer was not dead . . . . or if he was I am his sorrowful terrible heir;<br/>
I have been wronged . . . . I am oppressed . . . . I hate him that oppresses me,<br/>
I will either destroy him, or he shall release me.
</p>
<p>
Damn him! how he does defile me,<br/>
How he informs against my brother and sister and takes pay for their blood,<br/>
How he laughs when I look down the bend after the steamboat that carries away my woman.
</p>
<p>
Now the vast dusk bulk that is the whale's bulk . . . . it seems mine,<br/>
Warily, sportsman! though I lie so sleepy and sluggish, my tap is death.
</p>
<p>
A show of the summer softness . . . . a contact of something unseen . . . . an amour of the light and air;<br/>
I am jealous and overwhelmed with friendliness,<br/>
And will go gallivant with the light and the air myself,<br/>
And have an unseen something to be in contact with them also.
</p>
<p>
O love and summer! you are in the dreams and in me,<br/>
Autumn and winter are in the dreams . . . . the farmer goes with his thrift,<br/>
The droves and crops increase . . . . the barns are wellfilled.
</p>
<p>
Elements merge in the night . . . . ships make tacks in the dreams . . . . the sailor sails . . . . the exile returns home,<br/>
The fugitive returns unharmed . . . . the immigrant is back beyond months and years;<br/>
The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood, with the wellknown neighbors and faces,<br/>
They warmly welcome him . . . . he is barefoot again . . . . he forgets he is welloff;<br/>
The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and Welchman voyage home . . and the native of the Mediterranean voyages home;<br/>
To every port of England and France and Spain enter wellfilled ships;<br/>
The Swiss foots it toward his hills . . . . the Prussian goes his way, and the Hungarian his way, and the Pole goes his way,<br/>
The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return.
</p>
<p>
The homeward bound and the outward bound,<br/>
The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuyee, the onanist, the female that loves unrequited, the moneymaker,<br/>
The actor and actress . . those through with their parts and those waiting to commence,<br/>
The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee that is chosen and the nominee that has failed,<br/>
The great already known, and the great anytime after to day,<br/>
The stammerer, the sick, the perfectformed, the homely,<br/>
The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and sentenced him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the audience,<br/>
The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red squaw,<br/>
The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he that is wronged,<br/>
The antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark,<br/>
I swear they are averaged now . . . . one is no better than the other,<br/>
The night and sleep have likened them and restored them.
</p>
<p>
I swear they are all beautiful,<br/>
Every one that sleeps is beautiful . . . . every thing in the dim night is beautiful,<br/>
The wildest and bloodiest is over and all is peace.
</p>
<p>
Peace is always beautiful,<br/>
The myth of heaven indicates peace and night.
</p>
<p>
The myth of heaven indicates the soul;<br/>
The soul is always beautiful . . . . it appears more or it appears less . . . . it comes or lags behind,<br/>
It comes from its embowered garden and looks pleasantly on itself and encloses the world;<br/>
Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting, and perfect and clean the womb cohering,<br/>
The head wellgrown and proportioned and plumb, and the bowels and joints proportioned and plumb.
</p>
<p>
The soul is always beautiful,<br/>
The universe is duly in order . . . . every thing is in its place,<br/>
What is arrived is in its place, and what waits is in its place;<br/>
The twisted skull waits . . . . the watery or rotten blood waits,<br/>
The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits long,<br/>
The sleepers that lived and died wait . . . . the far advanced are to go on in their turns, and the far behind are to go on in their turns,<br/>
The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite . . . . they unite now.
</p>
<p>
The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,<br/>
They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to west as they lie unclothed;<br/>
The Asiatic and African are hand in hand . . . . the European and American are hand in hand,<br/>
Learned and unlearned are hand in hand . . and male and female are hand in hand;<br/>
The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover . . . . they press close without lust . . . . his lips press her neck,<br/>
The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with measureless love . . . . and the son holds the father in his arms with measureless love,<br/>
The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter,<br/>
The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man . . . . friend is inarmed by friend,<br/>
The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the scholar . . . . the wronged is made right,<br/>
The call of the slave is one with the master's call . . and the master salutes the slave,<br/>
The felon steps forth from the prison . . . . the insane becomes sane . . . . the suffering of sick persons is relieved,<br/>
The sweatings and fevers stop . . the throat that was unsound is sound . . the lungs of the consumptive are resumed . . the poor distressed head is free,<br/>
The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother than ever,<br/>
Stiflings and passages open . . . . the paralysed become supple,<br/>
The swelled and convulsed and congested awake to themselves in condition,<br/>
They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of the night and awake.
</p>
<p>
I too pass from the night;<br/>
I stay awhile away O night, but I return to you again and love you;<br/>
Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you?<br/>
I am not afraid . . . . I have been well brought forward by you;<br/>
I love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I lay so long;<br/>
I know not how I came of you, and I know not where I go with you . . . . but I know I came well and shall go well.
</p>
<p>
I will stop only a time with the night . . . . and rise betimes.
</p>
<p>
I will duly pass the day O my mother and duly return to you;<br/>
Not you will yield forth the dawn again more surely than you will yield forth me again,<br/>
Not the womb yields the babe in its time more surely than I shall be yielded from you in my time.

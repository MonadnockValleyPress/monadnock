<h1>Leaves of Grass</h1>
<h2>(1855 Edition)</h2>
<h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
<h3>Who Learns My Lesson Complete?</h3>
<p>
Who learns my lesson complete?<br/>
Boss and journeyman and apprentice? . . . . churchman and atheist?<br/>
The stupid and the wise thinker . . . . parents and offspring . . . . merchant and clerk and porter and customer . . . . editor, author, artist and schoolboy?
</p>
<p>
Draw nigh and commence,<br/>
It is no lesson . . . . it lets down the bars to a good lesson,<br/>
And that to another . . . . and every one to another still.
</p>
<p>
The great laws take and effuse without argument,<br/>
I am of the same style, for I am their friend,<br/>
I love them quits and quits . . . . I do not halt and make salaams.
</p>
<p>
I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons of things,<br/>
They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.
</p>
<p>
I cannot say to any person what I hear . . . . I cannot say it to myself . . . . it is very wonderful.
</p>
<p>
It is no little matter, this round and delicious globe, moving so exactly in its orbit forever and ever, without one jolt or the untruth of a single second;<br/>
I do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years, nor ten decillions of years,<br/>
Nor planned and built one thing after another, as an architect plans and builds a house.
</p>
<p>
I do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman,<br/>
Nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman,<br/>
Nor that years will ever stop the existence of me or any one else.
</p>
<p>
Is it wonderful that I should be immortal? as every one is immortal,<br/>
I know it is wonderful . . . . but my eyesight is equally wonderful . . . . and how I was conceived in my mother's womb is equally wonderful,<br/>
And how I was not palpable once but am now . . . . and was born on the last day of May 1819 . . . . and passed from a babe in the creeping trance of three summers and three winters to articulate and walk . . . . are all equally wonderful.
</p>
<p>
And that I grew six feet high . . . . and that I have become a man thirty-six years old in 1855 . . . . and that I am here anyhow  &mdash;  are all equally wonderful;<br/>
And that my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see each other, is every bit as wonderful:<br/>
And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful,<br/>
And that I can remind you, and you think them and know them to be true is just as wonderful,<br/>
And that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth is equally wonderful,<br/>
And that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally wonderful.
</p>
<p>
Come I should like to hear you tell me what there is in yourself that is not just as wonderful,<br/>
And I should like to hear the name of anything between Sunday morning and Saturday night that is not just as wonderful.

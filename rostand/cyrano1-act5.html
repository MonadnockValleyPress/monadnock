<h1>Cyrano de Bergerac</h1>
<h2>by Edmond Rostand</h2>
<h3>Translated by Gladys Thomas and Mary F. Guillemard</h3>
<h3>ACT V</h3>
<p>Cyrano's Gazette.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, in 1655. Park of the Sisters of the Holy
Cross in Paris. Magnificent trees. On the left the house: broad
steps on to which open several doors. An enormous plane tree in
the middle of the stage, standing alone. On the right, among big
boxwood trees, a semicircular stone bench.</p>
<p>The whole background of the stage is crossed by an alley of
chestnut trees leading on the right hand to the door of a chapel
seen through the branches. Through the double row of trees of
this alley are seen lawns, other alleys, clusters of trees,
winding of the park, the sky.</p>
<p>The chapel opens by a little side door on to a colonnade which
is wreathed with autumn leaves, and is lost to view a little
farther on in the right-hand foreground behind the boxwood.</p>
<p>It is autumn. All the foliage is red against the fresh green
of the lawns. The green boxwood and yews stand out dark.</p>
<p>Under each tree a patch of yellow leaves.</p>
<p>The stage is strewn with dead leaves, which rustle under foot
in the alleys, and half cover the steps and benches.</p>
<p>Between the benches on the right hand and the tree a large
embroidery frame, in front of which a little chair has been
set.</p>
<p>Baskets full of skeins and balls of wool. A tapestry
begun.</p>
<p>At the rising of the curtains nuns are walking to and fro in
the park; some are seated on the bench around an older
Sister.</p>
<p>The leaves are falling.</p>
<h3>Scene 5.I.</h3>
<p>Mother Marguerite, Sister Martha, Sister Claire, other sisters.</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA (to Mother Marguerite):<br/>
 Sister Claire glanced in the mirror, once&#151;nay, twice, to see if
her coif<br/>
suited.</p>
<p>MOTHER MARGUERITE (to Sister Claire):<br/>
 'Tis not well.</p>
<p>SISTER CLAIRE:<br/>
 But I saw Sister Martha take a plum<br/>
 Out of the tart.</p>
<p>MOTHER MARGUERITE (to Sister Martha):<br/>
 That was ill done, my sister.</p>
<p>SISTER CLAIRE:<br/>
 A little glance!</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 And such a little plum!</p>
<p>MOTHER MARGUERITE:<br/>
 I shall tell this to Monsieur Cyrano.</p>
<p>SISTER CLAIRE:<br/>
 Nay, prithee do not!&#151;he will mock!</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 He'll say we nuns are vain!</p>
<p>SISTER CLAIRE:<br/>
 And greedy!</p>
<p>MOTHER MARGUERITE (smiling):<br/>
 Ay, and kind!</p>
<p>SISTER CLAIRE:<br/>
 Is it not true, pray, Mother Marguerite,<br/>
 That he has come, each week, on Saturday<br/>
 For ten years, to the convent?</p>
<p>MOTHER MARGUERITE:<br/>
 Ay! and more!<br/>
 Ever since&#151;fourteen years ago&#151;the day<br/>
 His cousin brought here, 'midst our woolen coifs,<br/>
 The worldly mourning of her widow's veil,<br/>
 Like a blackbird's wing among the convent doves!</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 He only has the skill to turn her mind<br/>
 From grief&#151;unsoftened yet by Time&#151;unhealed!</p>
<p>ALL THE SISTERS:<br/>
 He is so droll!&#151;It's cheerful when he comes!&#151;<br/>
 He teases us!&#151;But we all like him well!&#151;<br/>
 &#151;We make him pasties of angelica!</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 But, he is not a faithful Catholic!</p>
<p>SISTER CLAIRE:<br/>
 We will convert him!</p>
<p>THE SISTERS:<br/>
 Yes! Yes!</p>
<p>MOTHER MARGUERITE:<br/>
 I forbid,<br/>
 My daughters, you attempt that subject. Nay,<br/>
 Weary him not&#151;he might less oft come here!</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 But. . .God. . .</p>
<p>MOTHER MARGUERITE:<br/>
 Nay, never fear! God knows him well!</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 But&#151;every Saturday, when he arrives,<br/>
 He tells me, 'Sister, I eat meat on Friday!'</p>
<p>MOTHER MARGUERITE:<br/>
 Ah! says he so? Well, the last time he came<br/>
 Food had not passed his lips for two whole days!</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 Mother!</p>
<p>MOTHER MARGUERITE:<br/>
 He's poor.</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 Who told you so, dear Mother?</p>
<p>MOTHER MARGUERITE:<br/>
 Monsieur Le Bret.</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 None help him?</p>
<p>MOTHER MARGUERITE:<br/>
 He permits not.<br/>
(In an alley at the back Roxane appears, dressed in black, with a
widow's coif and veil. De Guiche, imposing-looking and visibly
aged, walks by her side. They saunter slowly. Mother Marguerite
rises):<br/>
 'Tis time we go in; Madame Madeleine<br/>
 Walks in the garden with a visitor.</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA (to Sister Claire, in a low voice):<br/>
 The Marshal of Grammont?</p>
<p>SISTER CLAIRE (looking at him):<br/>
 'Tis he, I think.</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 'Tis many months now since he came to see her.</p>
<p>THE SISTERS:<br/>
 He is so busy!&#151;The Court,&#151;the camp!. . .</p>
<p>SISTER CLAIRE:<br/>
 The world!</p>
<p>(They go out. De Guiche and Roxane come forward in silence,
and stop close to the embroidery frame.)</p>
<h3>Scene 5.II.</h3>
<p>Roxane; the Duke de Grammont, formerly Count de Guiche. Then Le Bret and Ragueneau.</p>
<p>THE DUKE:<br/>
 And you stay here still&#151;ever vainly fair,<br/>
 Ever in weeds?</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Ever.</p>
<p>THE DUKE:<br/>
 Still faithful?</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Still.</p>
<p>THE DUKE (after a pause):<br/>
 Am I forgiven?</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Ay, since I am here.</p>
<p>(Another pause.)</p>
<p>THE DUKE:<br/>
 His was a soul, you say?. . .</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Ah!&#151;when you knew him!</p>
<p>THE DUKE:<br/>
 Ah, may be!. . .I, perchance, too little knew him!<br/>
 . . .And his last letter, ever next your heart?</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Hung from this chain, a gentle scapulary.</p>
<p>THE DUKE:<br/>
 And, dead, you love him still?</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 At times,&#151;meseems<br/>
 He is but partly dead&#151;our hearts still speak,<br/>
 As if his love, still living, wrapped me round!</p>
<p>THE DUKE (after another pause):<br/>
 Cyrano comes to see you?</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Often, ay.<br/>
 Dear, kind old friend! We call him my 'Gazette.'<br/>
 He never fails to come: beneath this tree<br/>
 They place his chair, if it be fine:&#151;I wait,<br/>
 I broider;&#151;the clock strikes;&#151;at the last stroke<br/>
 I hear,&#151;for now I never turn to look&#151;<br/>
 Too sure to hear his cane tap down the steps;<br/>
 He seats himself:&#151;with gentle raillery<br/>
 He mocks my tapestry that's never done;<br/>
 He tells me all the gossip of the week. . .<br/>
(Le Bret appears on the steps):<br/>
 Why, here's Le Bret!<br/>
(Le Bret descends):<br/>
 How goes it with our friend?</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 Ill!&#151;very ill.</p>
<p>THE DUKE:<br/>
 How?</p>
<p>ROXANE (to the Duke):<br/>
 He exaggerates!</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 All that I prophesied: desertion, want!. . .<br/>
 His letters now make him fresh enemies!&#151;<br/>
 Attacking the sham nobles, sham devout,<br/>
 Sham brave,&#151;the thieving authors,&#151;all the world!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Ah! but his sword still holds them all in check;<br/>
 None get the better of him.</p>
<p>THE DUKE (shaking his head):<br/>
 Time will show!</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 Ah, but I fear for him&#151;not man's attack,&#151;<br/>
 Solitude&#151;hunger&#151;cold December days,<br/>
 That wolf-like steal into his chamber drear:&#151;<br/>
 Lo! the assassins that I fear for him!<br/>
 Each day he tightens by one hole his belt:<br/>
 That poor nose&#151;tinted like old ivory:<br/>
 He has retained one shabby suit of serge.</p>
<p>THE DUKE:<br/>
 Ay, there is one who has no prize of Fortune!&#151;<br/>
 Yet is not to be pitied!</p>
<p>LE BRET (with a bitter smile):<br/>
 My Lord Marshal!. . .</p>
<p>THE DUKE:<br/>
 Pity him not! He has lived out his vows,<br/>
 Free in his thoughts, as in his actions free!</p>
<p>LE BRET (in the same tone):<br/>
 My Lord!. . .</p>
<p>THE DUKE (haughtily):<br/>
 True! I have all, and he has naught;. . .<br/>
 Yet I were proud to take his hand!<br/>
(Bowing to Roxane):<br/>
 Adieu!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 I go with you.</p>
<p>(The Duke bows to Le Bret, and goes with Roxane toward the
steps.)</p>
<p>THE DUKE (pausing, while she goes up):<br/>
 Ay, true,&#151;I envy him.<br/>
 Look you, when life is brimful of success<br/>
 &#151;Though the past hold no action foul&#151;one feels<br/>
 A thousand self-disgusts, of which the sum<br/>
 Is not remorse, but a dim, vague unrest;<br/>
 And, as one mounts the steps of worldly fame,<br/>
 The Duke's furred mantles trail within their folds<br/>
 A sound of dead illusions, vain regrets,<br/>
 A rustle&#151;scarce a whisper&#151;like as when,<br/>
 Mounting the terrace steps, by your mourning robe<br/>
 Sweeps in its train the dying autumn leaves.</p>
<p>ROXANE (ironically):<br/>
 You are pensive?</p>
<p>THE DUKE:<br/>
 True! I am!<br/>
(As he is going out, suddenly):<br/>
 Monsieur Le Bret!<br/>
(To Roxane):<br/>
 A word, with your permission?<br/>
(He goes to Le Bret, and in a low voice):<br/>
 True, that none<br/>
 Dare to attack your friend;&#151;but many hate him;<br/>
 Yesterday, at the Queen's card-play, 'twas said<br/>
 'That Cyrano may die&#151;by accident!'<br/>
 Let him stay in&#151;be prudent!</p>
<p>LE BRET (raising his arms to heaven):<br/>
 Prudent! He!. . .<br/>
 He's coming here. I'll warn him&#151;but!. . .</p>
<p>ROXANE (who has stayed on the steps, to a sister who comes
toward her):<br/>
 What is it?</p>
<p>THE SISTER:<br/>
 Ragueneau would see you, Madame.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Let him come.<br/>
(To the Duke and Le Bret):<br/>
 He comes to tell his troubles. Having been<br/>
 An author (save the mark!)&#151;poor fellow&#151;now<br/>
 By turns he's singer. . .</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 Bathing-man. . .</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Then actor. . .</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 Beadle. . .</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Wig-maker. . .</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 Teacher of the lute. . .</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 What will he be to-day, by chance?</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU (entering hurriedly):<br/>
 Ah! Madame!<br/>
(He sees Le Bret):<br/>
 Ah! you here, Sir!</p>
<p>ROXANE (smiling):<br/>
 Tell all your miseries<br/>
 To him; I will return anon.</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU:<br/>
 But, Madame. . .</p>
<p>(Roxane goes out with the Duke. Ragueneau goes toward Le
Bret.)</p>
<h3>Scene 5.III.</h3>
<p>Le Bret, Ragueneau.</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU:<br/>
 Since you are here, 'tis best she should not know!<br/>
 I was going to your friend just now&#151;was but<br/>
 A few steps from the house, when I saw him<br/>
 Go out. I hurried to him. Saw him turn<br/>
 The corner. . .suddenly, from out a window<br/>
 Where he was passing&#151;was it chance?. . .may be!<br/>
 A lackey let fall a large piece of wood.</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 Cowards! O Cyrano!</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU:<br/>
 I ran&#151;I saw. . .</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 'Tis hideous!</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU:<br/>
 Saw our poet, Sir&#151;our friend&#151;<br/>
 Struck to the ground&#151;a large wound in his head!</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 He's dead?</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU:<br/>
 No&#151;but&#151;I bore him to his room. . .<br/>
 Ah! his room! What a thing to see!&#151;that garret!</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 He suffers?</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU:<br/>
 No, his consciousness has flown.</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 Saw you a doctor?</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU:<br/>
 One was kind&#151;he came.</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 My poor Cyrano!&#151;We must not tell this<br/>
 To Roxane suddenly.&#151;What said this leech?&#151;</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU:<br/>
 Said,&#151;what, I know not&#151;fever, meningitis!&#151;<br/>
 Ah! could you see him&#151;all his head bound up!&#151;<br/>
 But let us haste!&#151;There's no one by his bed!&#151;<br/>
 And if he try to rise, Sir, he might die!</p>
<p>LE BRET (dragging him toward the right):<br/>
 Come! Through the chapel! 'Tis the quickest way!</p>
<p>ROXANE (appearing on the steps, and seeing Le Bret go away by
the colonnade leading to the chapel door):<br/>
 Monsieur le Bret!<br/>
(Le Bret and Ragueneau disappear without answering):<br/>
 Le Bret goes&#151;when I call!<br/>
'Tis some new trouble of good Ragueneau's.</p>
<p>(She descends the steps.)</p>
<h3>Scene 5.IV.</h3>
<p>Roxane alone. Two sisters, for a moment.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Ah! what a beauty in September's close!<br/>
 My sorrow's eased. April's joy dazzled it,<br/>
 But autumn wins it with her dying calm.<br/>
(She seats herself at the embroidery frame. Two sisters come out
of the<br/>
house, and bring a large armchair under the tree):<br/>
 There comes the famous armchair where he sits,<br/>
 Dear faithful friend!</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 It is the parlor's best!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Thanks, sister.<br/>
(The sisters go):<br/>
 He'll be here now.<br/>
(She seats herself. A clock strikes):<br/>
 The hour strikes.<br/>
 &#151;My silks?&#151;Why, now, the hour's struck!<br/>
 How strange<br/>
 To be behind his time, at last, to-day!<br/>
 Perhaps the portress&#151;where's my thimble?. . .<br/>
 Here!&#151;Is preaching to him.<br/>
(A pause):<br/>
 Yes, she must be preaching!<br/>
 Surely he must come soon!&#151;Ah, a dead leaf!&#151;<br/>
(She brushes off the leaf from her work):<br/>
 Nothing, besides, could&#151;scissors?&#151;In my bag!<br/>
 &#151;Could hinder him. . .</p>
<p>A SISTER (coming to the steps):<br/>
 Monsieur de Bergerac.</p>
<h3>Scene 5.V.</h3>
<p>Roxane, Cyrano and, for a moment, Sister Martha.</p>
<p>ROXANE (without turning round):<br/>
 What was I saying?. . .<br/>
(She embroiders. Cyrano, very pale, his hat pulled down over his
eyes, appears. The sister who had announced him retires. He
descends the steps slowly, with a visible difficulty in holding
himself upright, bearing heavily on his cane. Roxane still works
at her tapestry):<br/>
 Time has dimmed the tints. . .<br/>
 How harmonize them now?<br/>
(To Cyrano, with playful reproach):<br/>
 For the first time<br/>
 Late!&#151;For the first time, all these fourteen years!<br/>
</p>
<p>CYRANO (who has succeeded in reaching the chair, and has seated
himself&#151;in a lively voice, which is in great contrast with his
pale face):<br/>
 Ay! It is villainous! I raged&#151;was stayed. . .</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 By?. . .</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 By a bold, unwelcome visitor.</p>
<p>ROXANE (absently, working):<br/>
 Some creditor?</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Ay, cousin,&#151;the last creditor<br/>
 Who has a debt to claim from me.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 And you<br/>
 Have paid it?</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 No, not yet! I put it off;<br/>
 &#151;Said, 'Cry you mercy; this is Saturday,<br/>
 When I have get a standing rendezvous<br/>
 That naught defers. Call in an hour's time!'</p>
<p>ROXANE (carelessly):<br/>
 Oh, well, a creditor can always wait!<br/>
 I shall not let you go ere twilight falls.</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Haply, perforce, I quit you ere it falls!</p>
<p>(He shuts his eyes, and is silent for a moment. Sister Martha
crosses the park from the chapel to the flight of steps. Roxane,
seeing her, signs to her to approach.)</p>
<p>ROXANE (to Cyrano):<br/>
 How now? You have not teased the Sister?</p>
<p>CYRANO (hastily opening his eyes):<br/>
 True!<br/>
(In a comically loud voice):<br/>
 Sister! come here!<br/>
(The sister glides up to him):<br/>
 Ha! ha! What? Those bright eyes<br/>
 Bent ever on the ground?</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA (who makes a movement of astonishment on seeing
his face):<br/>
 Oh!</p>
<p>CYRANO (in a whisper, pointing to Roxane):<br/>
 Hush! 'tis naught!&#151;<br/>
(Loudly, in a blustering voice):<br/>
 I broke fast yesterday!</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA (aside):<br/>
 I know, I know!<br/>
 That's how he is so pale! Come presently<br/>
 To the refectory, I'll make you drink<br/>
 A famous bowl of soup. . .You'll come?</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Ay, ay!</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 There, see! You are more reasonable to-day!</p>
<p>ROXANE (who hears them whispering):<br/>
 The Sister would convert you?</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA:<br/>
 Nay, not I!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Hold! but it's true! You preach to me no more,<br/>
 You, once so glib with holy words! I am<br/>
 Astonished!. . .<br/>
(With burlesque fury):<br/>
 Stay, I will surprise you too!<br/>
 Hark! I permit you. . .<br/>
(He pretends to be seeking for something to tease her with, and
to have found it):<br/>
 . . .It is something new!&#151;<br/>
 To&#151;pray for me, to-night, at chapel-time!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Oh! oh!</p>
<p>CYRANO (laughing):<br/>
 Good Sister Martha is struck dumb!</p>
<p>SISTER MARTHA (gently):<br/>
 I did not wait your leave to pray for you.</p>
<p>(She goes out.)</p>
<p>CYRANO (turning to Roxane, who is still bending over her
work):<br/>
 That tapestry! Beshrew me if my eyes<br/>
 Will ever see it finished!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 I was sure<br/>
 To hear that well-known jest!</p>
<p>(A light breeze causes the leaves to fall.)</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 The autumn leaves!</p>
<p>ROXANE (lifting her head, and looking down the distant
alley):<br/>
 Soft golden brown, like a Venetian's hair.<br/>
 &#151;See how they fall!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Ay, see how brave they fall,<br/>
 In their last journey downward from the bough,<br/>
 To rot within the clay; yet, lovely still,<br/>
 Hiding the horror of the last decay,<br/>
 With all the wayward grace of careless flight!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 What, melancholy&#151;you?</p>
<p>CYRANO (collecting himself):<br/>
 Nay, nay, Roxane!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Then let the dead leaves fall the way they will. . .<br/>
 And chat. What, have you nothing new to tell,<br/>
 My Court Gazette?</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Listen.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Ah!</p>
<p>CYRANO (growing whiter and whiter):<br/>
 Saturday<br/>
 The nineteenth: having eaten to excess<br/>
 Of pear-conserve, the King felt feverish;<br/>
 The lancet quelled this treasonable revolt,<br/>
 And the august pulse beats at normal pace.<br/>
 At the Queen's ball on Sunday thirty score<br/>
 Of best white waxen tapers were consumed.<br/>
 Our troops, they say, have chased the Austrians.<br/>
 Four sorcerers were hanged. The little dog<br/>
 Of Madame d'Athis took a dose. . .</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 I bid<br/>
 You hold your tongue, Monsieur de Bergerac!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Monday&#151;not much&#151;Claire changed protector.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Oh!</p>
<p>CYRANO (whose face changes more and more):<br/>
 Tuesday, the Court repaired to Fontainebleau.<br/>
 Wednesday, the Montglat said to Comte de Fiesque. . .<br/>
 No! Thursday&#151;Mancini, Queen of France! (almost!)<br/>
 Friday, the Monglat to Count Fiesque said&#151;'Yes!'<br/>
 And Saturday the twenty-sixth. . .</p>
<p>(He closes his eyes. His head falls forward. Silence.)</p>
<p>ROXANE (surprised at his voice ceasing, turns round, looks at
him, and rising, terrified):<br/>
 He swoons!<br/>
(She runs toward him crying):<br/>
 Cyrano!</p>
<p>CYRANO (opening his eyes, in an unconcerned voice):<br/>
 What is this?<br/>
(He sees Roxane bending over him, and, hastily pressing his hat
on his head, and shrinking back in his chair):<br/>
 Nay, on my word<br/>
 'Tis nothing! Let me be!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 But. . .</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 That old wound<br/>
 Of Arras, sometimes,&#151;as you know. . .</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Dear friend!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 'Tis nothing, 'twill pass soon;<br/>
(He smiles with an effort):<br/>
 See!&#151;it has passed!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Each of us has his wound; ay, I have mine,&#151;<br/>
 Never healed up&#151;not healed yet, my old wound!<br/>
(She puts her hand on her breast):<br/>
 'Tis here, beneath this letter brown with age,<br/>
 All stained with tear-drops, and still stained with blood.</p>
<p>(Twilight begins to fall.)</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 His letter! Ah! you promised me one day<br/>
 That I should read it.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 What would you?&#151;His letter?</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Yes, I would fain,&#151;to-day. . .</p>
<p>ROXANE (giving the bag hung at her neck):<br/>
 See! here it is!</p>
<p>CYRANO (taking it):<br/>
 Have I your leave to open?</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Open&#151;read!</p>
<p>(She comes back to her tapestry frame, folds it up, sorts her
wools.)</p>
<p>CYRANO (reading):<br/>
 'Roxane, adieu! I soon must die!<br/>
 This very night, beloved; and I<br/>
 Feel my soul heavy with love untold.<br/>
 I die! No more, as in days of old,<br/>
 My loving, longing eyes will feast<br/>
 On your least gesture&#151;ay, the least!<br/>
 I mind me the way you touch your cheek<br/>
 With your finger, softly, as you speak!<br/>
 Ah me! I know that gesture well!<br/>
 My heart cries out!&#151;I cry "Farewell"!'</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 But how you read that letter! One would think. . .</p>
<p>CYRANO (continuing to read):<br/>
 'My life, my love, my jewel, my sweet,<br/>
 My heart has been yours in every beat!'</p>
<p>(The shades of evening fall imperceptibly.)</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 You read in such a voice&#151;so strange&#151;and yet&#151;<br/>
 It is not the first time I hear that voice!</p>
<p>(She comes nearer very softly, without his perceiving it,
passes behind his chair, and, noiselessly leaning over him, looks
at the letter. The darkness deepens.)</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 'Here, dying, and there, in the land on high,<br/>
 I am he who loved, who loves you,&#151;I. . .'</p>
<p>ROXANE (putting her hand on his shoulder):<br/>
 How can you read? It is too dark to see!<br/>
(He starts, turns, sees her close to him. Suddenly alarmed, he
holds his head down. Then in the dusk, which has now completely
enfolded them, she says, very slowly, with clasped hands):<br/>
 And, fourteen years long, he has played this part<br/>
 Of the kind old friend who comes to laugh and chat.</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Roxane!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 'Twas you!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 No, never; Roxane, no!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 I should have guessed, each time he said my name!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 No, it was not I!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 It was you!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 I swear!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 I see through all the generous counterfeit&#151;<br/>
 The letters&#151;you!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 No.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 The sweet, mad love-words!<br/>
 You!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 No!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 The voice that thrilled the night&#151;you, you!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 I swear you err.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 The soul&#151;it was your soul!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 I loved you not.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 You loved me not?</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 'Twas he!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 You loved me!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 No!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 See! how you falter now!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 No, my sweet love, I never loved you!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Ah!<br/>
 Things dead, long dead, see! how they rise again!<br/>
 &#151;Why, why keep silence all these fourteen years,<br/>
 When, on this letter, which he never wrote,<br/>
 The tears were your tears?</p>
<p>CYRANO (holding out the letter to her):<br/>
 The bloodstains were his.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Why, then, that noble silence,&#151;kept so long&#151;<br/>
 Broken to-day for the first time&#151;why?</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Why?. . .</p>
<p>(Le Bret and Ragueneau enter running.)</p>
<h3>Scene 5.VI.</h3>
<p>The same. Le Bret and Ragueneau.</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 What madness! Here? I knew it well!</p>
<p>CYRANO (smiling and sitting up):<br/>
 What now?</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 He has brought his death by coming, Madame.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 God!<br/>
 Ah, then! that faintness of a moment since. . .?</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Why, true! It interrupted the 'Gazette:'<br/>
 . . .Saturday, twenty-sixth, at dinner-time,<br/>
 Assassination of De Bergerac.</p>
<p>(He takes off his hat; they see his head bandaged.)</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 What says he? Cyrano!&#151;His head all bound!<br/>
 Ah, what has chanced? How?&#151;Who?. . .</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 'To be struck down,<br/>
 Pierced by sword i' the heart, from a hero's hand!'<br/>
 That I had dreamed. O mockery of Fate!<br/>
 &#151;Killed, I! of all men&#151;in an ambuscade!<br/>
 Struck from behind, and by a lackey's hand!<br/>
 'Tis very well. I am foiled, foiled in all,<br/>
 Even in my death.</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU:<br/>
 Ah, Monsieur!. . .</p>
<p>CYRANO (holding out his hand to him):<br/>
 Ragueneau,<br/>
 Weep not so bitterly!. . .What do you now,<br/>
 Old comrade?</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU (amid his tears):<br/>
 Trim the lights for Moliere's stage.</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Moliere!</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU:<br/>
 Yes; but I shall leave to-morrow.<br/>
 I cannot bear it!&#151;Yesterday, they played<br/>
 'Scapin'&#151;I saw he'd thieved a scene from you!</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 What! a whole scene?</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU:<br/>
 Oh, yes, indeed, Monsieur,<br/>
 The famous one, 'Que Diable allait-il faire?'</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 Moliere has stolen that?</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Tut! He did well!. . .<br/>
(to Ragueneau):<br/>
 How went the scene? It told&#151;I think it told?</p>
<p>RAGUENEAU (sobbing):<br/>
 Ah! how they laughed!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Look you, it was my life<br/>
 To be the prompter every one forgets!<br/>
(To Roxane):<br/>
 That night when 'neath your window Christian spoke<br/>
 &#151;Under your balcony, you remember? Well!<br/>
 There was the allegory of my whole life:<br/>
 I, in the shadow, at the ladder's foot,<br/>
 While others lightly mount to Love and Fame!<br/>
 Just! very just! Here on the threshold drear<br/>
 Of death, I pay my tribute with the rest,<br/>
 To Moliere's genius,&#151;Christian's fair face!<br/>
(The chapel-bell chimes. The nuns are seen passing down the alley
at the back, to say their office):<br/>
 Let them go pray, go pray, when the bell rings!</p>
<p>ROXANE (rising and calling):<br/>
 Sister! Sister!</p>
<p>CYRANO (holding her fast):<br/>
 Call no one. Leave me not;<br/>
 When you come back, I should be gone for aye.<br/>
(The nuns have all entered the chapel. The organ sounds):<br/>
 I was somewhat fain for music&#151;hark! 'tis come.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Live, for I love you!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 No, In fairy tales<br/>
 When to the ill-starred Prince the lady says<br/>
 'I love you!' all his ugliness fades fast&#151;<br/>
 But I remain the same, up to the last!</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 I have marred your life&#151;I, I!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 You blessed my life!<br/>
 Never on me had rested woman's love.<br/>
 My mother even could not find me fair:<br/>
 I had no sister; and, when grown a man,<br/>
 I feared the mistress who would mock at me.<br/>
 But I have had your friendship&#151;grace to you<br/>
 A woman's charm has passed across my path.</p>
<p>LE BRET (pointing to the moon, which is seen between the
trees):<br/>
 Your other lady-love is come.</p>
<p>CYRANO (smiling):<br/>
 I see.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 I loved but once, yet twice I lose my love!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Hark you, Le Bret! I soon shall reach the moon.<br/>
 To-night, alone, with no projectile's aid!. . .</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 What are you saying?</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 I tell you, it is there,<br/>
 There, that they send me for my Paradise,<br/>
 There I shall find at last the souls I love,<br/>
 In exile,&#151;Galileo&#151;Socrates!</p>
<p>LE BRET (rebelliously):<br/>
 No, no! It is too clumsy, too unjust!<br/>
 So great a heart! So great a poet! Die<br/>
 Like this? what, die. . .?</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Hark to Le Bret, who scolds!</p>
<p>LE BRET (weeping):<br/>
 Dear friend. . .</p>
<p>CYRANO (starting up, his eyes wild):<br/>
 What ho! Cadets of Gascony!<br/>
 The elemental mass&#151;ah yes! The hic. . .</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 His science still&#151;he raves!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Copernicus<br/>
 Said. . .</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 Oh!</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Mais que diable allait-il faire,<br/>
 Mais que diable allait-il faire dans cette galere?. . .<br/>
 Philosopher, metaphysician,<br/>
 Rhymer, brawler, and musician,<br/>
 Famed for his lunar expedition,<br/>
 And the unnumbered duels he fought,&#151;<br/>
 And lover also,&#151;by interposition!&#151;<br/>
 Here lies Hercule Savinien<br/>
 De Cyrano de Bergerac,<br/>
 Who was everything, yet was naught.<br/>
 I cry you pardon, but I may not stay;<br/>
 See, the moon-ray that comes to call me hence!<br/>
(He has fallen back in his chair; the sobs of Roxane recall him
to reality; he looks long at her, and, touching her veil):<br/>
 I would not bid you mourn less faithfully<br/>
 That good, brave Christian: I would only ask<br/>
 That when my body shall be cold in clay<br/>
 You wear those sable mourning weeds for two,<br/>
 And mourn awhile for me, in mourning him.</p>
<p>ROXANE:<br/>
 I swear it you!. . .</p>
<p>CYRANO (shivering violently, then suddenly rising):<br/>
 Not there! what, seated?&#151;no!<br/>
(They spring toward him):<br/>
 Let no one hold me up&#151;<br/>
(He props himself against the tree):<br/>
 Only the tree!<br/>
(Silence):<br/>
 It comes. E'en now my feet have turned to stone,<br/>
 My hands are gloved with lead!<br/>
(He stands erect):<br/>
 But since Death comes,<br/>
 I meet him still afoot,<br/>
(He draws his sword):<br/>
 And sword in hand!</p>
<p>LE BRET:<br/>
 Cyrano!</p>
<p>ROXANE (half fainting):<br/>
 Cyrano!</p>
<p>(All shrink back in terror.)</p>
<p>CYRANO:<br/>
 Why, I well believe<br/>
 He dares to mock my nose? Ho! insolent!<br/>
(He raises his sword):<br/>
 What say you? It is useless? Ay, I know<br/>
 But who fights ever hoping for success?<br/>
 I fought for lost cause, and for fruitless quest!<br/>
 You there, who are you!&#151;You are thousands!<br/>
 Ah!<br/>
 I know you now, old enemies of mine!<br/>
 Falsehood!<br/>
(He strikes in air with his sword):<br/>
 Have at you! Ha! and Compromise!<br/>
 Prejudice, Treachery!. . .<br/>
(He strikes):<br/>
 Surrender, I?<br/>
 Parley? No, never! You too, Folly,&#151;you?<br/>
 I know that you will lay me low at last;<br/>
 Let be! Yet I fall fighting, fighting still!<br/>
(He makes passes in the air, and stops, breathless):<br/>
 You strip from me the laurel and the rose!<br/>
 Take all! Despite you there is yet one thing<br/>
 I hold against you all, and when, to-night,<br/>
 I enter Christ's fair courts, and, lowly bowed,<br/>
 Sweep with doffed casque the heavens' threshold blue,<br/>
 One thing is left, that, void of stain or smutch,<br/>
 I bear away despite you.</p>
<p>(He springs forward, his sword raised; it falls from his hand;
he staggers, falls back into the arms of Le Bret and
Ragueneau.)</p>
<p>ROXANE (bending and kissing his forehead):<br/>
 'Tis?. . .</p>
<p>CYRANO (opening his eyes, recognizing her, and smiling):<br/>
 MY PANACHE.</p>
<p>Curtain.</p>
<p>THE END</p>

<h1>Cyrano de Bergerac</h1>
<h2>by Edmond Rostand</h2>
<h3>Translated by Brian Hooker</h3>
<h2>THE SECOND ACT</h2>
<h3>The Bakery of the Poets</h3>
<p>The Shop of Ragueneau, Baker and Pastrycook: a spacious affair at the corner of the Rue St.-Honoré and the Rue de l'Arbre Sec. The street, seen vaguely through the glass panes in the door at the back, is gray in the first light of dawn.  </p>
<p>In the foreground, at the Left, a Counter is surmounted by a Canopy of wrought iron from which are hanging ducks, geese, and white peacocks. Great crockery jars hold bouquets of common flowers, yellow sunflowers in particular. On the same side farther back, a huge fireplace; in front of it, between great andirons, of which each one supports a little saucepan, roast fowls revolve and weep into their dripping-pans. To the Right at the First Entrance, a door. Beyond it, Second Entrance, a staircase leads up to a little dining-room under the eaves, its interior visible through open shutters. A table is set there and a tiny Flemish candlestick is lighted; there one may retire to eat and drink in private. A wooden gallery, extending from the head of the stairway, seems to lead to other little dining-rooms.  </p>
<p>In the centre of the shop, an iron ring hangs by a rope over a pulley so that it can be raised or lowered; adorned with game of various kinds hung from it by hooks, it has the appearance of a sort of gastronomic chandelier.  </p>
<p>In the shadow under the staircase, ovens are glowing. The spits revolve; the copper pots and pans gleam ruddily. Pastries in pyramids. Hams hanging from the rafters. The morning baking is in progress: a bustle of tall cooks and timid scullions and scurrying apprentices; a blossoming of white caps adorned with cock's, feathers or the wings of guinea fowl. On wicker trays or on great metal platters they bring in rows of pastries and fancy dishes of various kinds.  </p>
<p>Tables are covered with trays of cakes and rolls; others with chairs placed about them are set for guests.  </p>
<p>One little table in a corner disappears under a heap of papers. At the Curtain Rise Ragueneau is seated there. He is writing poetry.  </p>
<h3>[Scene I]</h3>
<p>A Pastrycook</p>
<p>(Brings in a dish.)</p>
<p>Fruits en gelée!</p>
<p>Second Pastrycook</p>
<p>(Brings dish.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Custard!</p>
<p>Third Pastrycook</p>
<p>(Brings roast peacock ornamented with feathers.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peacock rôti!</p>
<p>Fourth Pastrycook</p>
<p>(Brings tray of cakes.)</p>
<p>Cakes and confections!</p>
<p>Fifth Pastrycook</p>
<p>(Brings earthen dish.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beef en casserole!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Raises his head; returns to mere earth.)</p>
<p>Over the coppers of my kitchen flows<br/>
The frosted-silver dawn. Silence awhile<br/>
The god who sings within thee, Ragueneau!<br/>
Lay down the lute&mdash;the oven calls for thee!</p>
<p>(Rises; goes to one of the cooks.)</p>
<p>Here's a hiatus in your sauce; fill up<br/>
The measure.</p>
<p>The Cook</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Measures on his finger.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more dactyl.</p>
<p>The Cook</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh? ...</p>
<p>First Pastrycook</p>
<p>Rolls!</p>
<p>Second Pastrycook</p>
<p>&nbsp;Roulades!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Before the fireplace)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veil, O Muse, thy virgin eyes<br/>
From the lewd gleam of these terrestrial fires!</p>
<p>(To First Pastrycook)</p>
<p>Your rolls lack balance. Here's the proper form&mdash;<br/>
An equal hemistich on either side,<br/>
And the caesura in between.</p>
<p>(To another, pointing out an unfinished pie)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your house<br/>
Of crust should have a roof upon it.</p>
<p>(To another, who is seated on the hearth, placing poultry on a spit)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&mdash;<br/>
Along the interminable spit, arrange<br/>
The modest pullet and the lordly Turk<br/>
Alternately, my son&mdash;as great Malherbe<br/>
Alternates male and female rimes. Remember,<br/>
A couplet, or a roast, should be well turned.</p>
<p>An Apprentice</p>
<p>(Advances with a dish covered by a napkin.)</p>
<p>Master, I thought of you when I designed<br/>
This, hoping it might please you.</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! A lyre&mdash;</p>
<p>The Apprentice</p>
<p>In puff-paste&mdash;</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the jewels&mdash;candied fruit!</p>
<p>The Apprentice</p>
<p>And the strings, barley-sugar!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Gives him money.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and drink<br/>
My health.</p>
<p>(Lise enters.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;St!&mdash;My wife&mdash; Circulate, and hide<br/>
That money!</p>
<p>(Shows the lyre to Lise, with a languid air.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graceful&mdash;yes?</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridiculous!</p>
<p>(She places on the counter a pile of paper bags.)</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>Paper bags? Thank you ...</p>
<p>(He looks at them.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ciel! My manuscripts!<br/>
The sacred verses of my poets&mdash;rent<br/>
Asunder, limb from limb&mdash;butchered to make<br/>
Base packages of pastry! Ah, you are one<br/>
Of those insane Bacchantes who destroyed<br/>
Orpheus!</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your dirty poets left them here<br/>
To pay for eating half our stock-in-trade:<br/>
We ought to make some profit out of them!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>Ant! Would you blame the locust for his song?</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>I blame the locust for his appetite!<br/>
There used to be a time&mdash;before you had<br/>
Your hungry friends&mdash;you never called me Ants&mdash;<br/>
No, nor Bacchantes!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a way to use<br/>
Poetry!</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what is the use of it?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>But, my dear girl, what would you do with prose?</p>
<h3>[Scene II]</h3>
<p>(Two children enter.)</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>Well, dears?</p>
<p>A Child</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Three little patties.</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Serves them.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There we are!<br/>
All hot and brown,</p>
<p>The Child</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you mind wrapping them?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>One of my paper bags!...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, certainly.</p>
<p>(Reads from the bag, as he is about to wrap the patties in it.)</p>
<p>"Ulysses, when he left Penelope"&mdash;<br/>
Not that one!</p>
<p>(Takes another bag; reads.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Phoebus, golden-crowned"&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that one.</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>Well? They are waiting!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very well, very well!&mdash;<br/>
The Sonnet to Phyllis ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet&mdash;it does seem hard ... </p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>Made up your mind&mdash;at last! Mph!&mdash;Jack-o'-Dreams!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(As her back is turned, calls back the children, who are already at the door.)</p>
<p>Pst!&mdash;Children&mdash; Give me back the bag. Instead<br/>
Of three patties, you shall have six of them!</p>
<p>(Makes the exchange. The children go out. He reads from the bag, as he smooths it out tenderly.)</p>
<p>"Phyllis"&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A spot of butter on her name!&mdash;
"Phyllis"&mdash;</p>
<h3>[Scene III]</h3>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Enters hurriedly.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the time?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six o'clock.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One<br/>
Hour more ...</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Felicitations!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for what?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>Your victory! I saw it all&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which one?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>At the Hôtel de Bourgogne.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh&mdash;the duel!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>The duel in Rime!</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks of nothing else.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Nonsense!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Fencing and foining with a spit, which he snatches up from the hearth.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, as I end the refrain, thrust home!"<br/>
"Then, as I end the refrain"&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods! What a line!<br/>
"Then, as I end"&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time now, Ragueneau?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Petrified at the full extent of a lunge, while he looks at the clock.)</p>
<p>Five after six&mdash;</p>
<p>(Recovers)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&mdash;thrust home!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Ballade, too!</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>(To Cyrano, who in passing has mechanically shaken hands with her)</p>
<p>Your hand&mdash;what have you done?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my hand?&mdash;Nothing.</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>What danger now&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No danger.</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe<br/>
He is lying.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Was I looking down my nose?<br/>
That must have been a devil of a lie!</p>
<p>(Changing his tone; to Ragueneau)</p>
<p>I expect someone. Leave us here alone,<br/>
When the times comes.</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I? In a moment,<br/>
My poets will be here.</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To break their ... fast!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Take them away, then, when I give the sign.<br/>
&mdash;What time?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes after.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you a pen?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Offers him a pen.)</p>
<p>An eagle's feather!</p>
<p>A Musketeer</p>
<p>(Enters, and speaks to Lise in a stentorian voice.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greeting!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(To Ragueneau)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is this?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>My wife's friend. A terrific warrior,<br/>
So he says.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah&mdash; I see.</p>
<p>(Takes up the pen; waves Ragueneau away.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to write&mdash;<br/>
To fold&mdash; To give it to her&mdash;and to go ...</p>
<p>(Throws down the pen.)</p>
<p>Coward! And yet&mdash;the Devil take my soul<br/>
If I dare speak one word to her ...</p>
<p>(To Ragueneau)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time now?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>A quarter after six.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Striking his breast)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;One little word<br/>
Of all the many thousand I have here!<br/>
Whereas in writing ...</p>
<p>(Takes up the pen.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, I'll write to her<br/>
That letter I have written on my heart.<br/>
Torn up, and written over many times&mdash;<br/>
So many times ... that all I have to do<br/>
Is to remember, and to write it down.</p>
<p>(He writes. Through the glass of the door appear vague and hesitating shadows. The Poets enter, clothed in rusty black and spotted with mud.)</p>
<h3>[Scene IV]</h3>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>(To Ragueneau)</p>
<p>Here come your scarecrows!</p>
<p>First Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comrade!</p>
<p>Second Poet</p>
<p>(Takes both Ragueneau's hands.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear brother!</p>
<p>Third Poet</p>
<p>(Sniffing)</p>
<p>O Lord of Roasts, how sweet thy dwellings are!</p>
<p>Fourth Poet</p>
<p>Phoebus Apollo of the Silver Spoon!</p>
<p>Fifth Poet</p>
<p>Cupid of Cookery!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Surrounded, embraced, beaten on the back.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These geniuses,<br/>
They put one at one's ease!</p>
<p>First Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were delayed<br/>
By the crowd at the Porte de Nesle.</p>
<p>Second Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead men<br/>
All scarred and gory, scattered on the stones,<br/>
Villainous-looking scoundrels&mdash;eight of them.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Looks up an instant.)</p>
<p>Eight? I thought only seven&mdash;</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know<br/>
The hero of this hecatomb?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I? ... No.</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>(To the Musketeer)</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>The Musketeer</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm&mdash;perhaps!</p>
<p>First Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say one man alone<br/>
Put to flight all this crowd.</p>
<p>Second Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere lay<br/>
Swords, daggers, pikes, bludgeons&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Writing)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your eyes ..."</p>
<p>Third Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far<br/>
As the Quai des Orfevres, hats and cloaks&mdash;</p>
<p>First Poet</p>
<p>Why, that man must have been the devil!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your lips .. "</p>
<p>First Poet</p>
<p>Some savage monster might have done this thing!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>"Looking upon you, I grow faint with fear ..."</p>
<p>Second Poet</p>
<p>What have you written lately, Ragueneau?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>"Your Friend&mdash; Who loves you ..."<p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So. No signature;<br/>
I'll give it to her myself.</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>A Recipe<br/>
In Rime.</p>
<p>Third Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Read us your rimes!</p>
<p>Fourth Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a brioche<br/>
Cocking its hat at me.</p>
<p>(He bites off the top of it.)</p>
<p>First Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look how those buns<br/>
Follow the hungry poet with their eyes&mdash;<br/>
Those almond eyes!</p>
<p>Second Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are listening&mdash;</p>
<p>Third Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See this cream-puff&mdash;<br/>
Fat little baby, drooling while it smiles!</p>
<p>Second Poet</p>
<p>(Nibbling at the pastry lyre.)</p>
<p>For the first time, the lyre is my support.</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Coughs, adjusts his cap, strikes an
attitude.)</p>
<p>A Recipe in Rime&mdash;</p>
<p>Second Poet</p>
<p>(Gives First Poet a dig with his elbow.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your breakfast?</p>
<p>First Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Declaims)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="stanza">A Recipe for Making Almond Tarts</p>
<p class="stanza">Beat your eggs, the yolk and white<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very light;<br/>
Mingle with their creamy fluff<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drops of lime-juice, cool and green;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then pour in<br/>
Milk of Almonds, just enough.</p>
<p class="stanza">Dainty patty-pans, embraced<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In puff-paste&mdash;<br/>
Have these ready within reach;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your thumb and finger, pinch<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half an inch<br/>
Up around the edge of each&mdash;</p>
<p class="stanza">Into these, a score or more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly pour<br/>
All your store of custard; so<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take them, bake them golden-brown&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now sit down! ...<br/>
Almond tartlets, Ragueneau!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Poets</p>
<p>Delicious! Melting!</p>
<p>A Poet</p>
<p>(Chokes)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humph!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(To Ragueneau)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you not see<br/>
Those fellows fattening themselves?&mdash;</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know.<br/>
I would not look&mdash;it might embarrass them&mdash;<br/>
You see, I love a friendly audience.<br/>
Besides&mdash;another vanity&mdash;I am pleased<br/>
When they enjoy my cooking.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Slaps him on the back,)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be off with you!&mdash;</p>
<p>(Ragueneau goes upstage.)</p>
<p>Good little soul!</p>
<p>(Calls to Lise)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madame!&mdash;</p>
<p>(She leaves the Musketeer and comes down to him.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This musketeer&mdash;<br/>
He is making love to you?</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>(Haughtily)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any man<br/>
Offends my virtue&mdash;all I have to do<br/>
Is look at him&mdash;once!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Looks at her gravely; she drops her eyes.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not find<br/>
Those eyes of yours unconquerable.</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>(Panting)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Ah!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Raising his voice a little.)</p>
<p>Now listen&mdash; I am fond of Ragueneau;<br/>
I allow no one&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;<br/>
To ... take his name in vain!</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Ironic emphasis)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think<br/>
I interrupt you.</p>
<p>(He salutes the Musketeer, who has heard without daring to resent the warning. Lise goes to the Musketeer as he returns Cyrano's salute.)</p>
<p>Lise</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&mdash;you swallow that?&mdash;<br/>
You ought to have pulled his nose!</p>
<p>The Musketeer</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His nose?&mdash;His nose! ...</p>
<p>(He goes out hurriedly. Roxane and the Duenna appear outside the door.)</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Nods to Ragueneau.)</p>
<p>Pst!&mdash;</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(To the Poets)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Come inside&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Impatient)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pst! ... Pst! ...</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall be more<br/>
Comfortable ...</p>
<p>(He leads the Poets into inner room.)</p>
<p>First Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cakes!</p>
<p>Second Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring them along!</p>
<p>(They go out.)</p>
<h3>[Scene V]</h3>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>If I can see the faintest spark of hope,<br/>
Then&mdash;</p>
<p>(Throws door open &mdash; bows.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Welcome!</p>
<p>(Roxane enters, followed by the Duenna, whom Cyrano detains.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pardon me&mdash;one word&mdash;</p>
<p>The Duenna</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take two.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Have you a good digestion?</p>
<p>The Duenna</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Good. Here are two sonnets, by Benserade&mdash;</p>
<p>The Duenna</p>
<p>Euh?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;Which I fill for you with eclairs.</p>
<p>The Duenna</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooo!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Do you like cream-puffs?</p>
<p>The Duenna</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only with whipped cream,</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Here are three ... six&mdash;embosomed in a poem<br/>
By Saint-Amant. This ode of Chapelin<br/>
Looks deep enough to hold&mdash;a jelly roll.<br/>
&mdash;Do you love Nature?</p>
<p>The Duenna</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mad about it.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then<br/>
Go out and eat these in the street. Do not<br/>
Return&mdash;</p>
<p>The Duenna</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, but&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until you finish them.</p>
<h3>[Scene VI]</h3>
<p>(Down to Roxane)</p>
<p>Blessed above all others be the hour<br/>
When you remembered to remember me,<br/>
And came to tell me ... what?</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>(Takes off her mask.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First let me thank you<br/>
Because ... That man ... that creature, whom your sword<br/>
Made sport of yesterday&mdash; His patron, one&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>De Guiche?&mdash;</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;who thinks himself in love with me<br/>
Would have forced that man upon me for&mdash; a husband&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>I understand&mdash;so much the better then!<br/>
I fought, not for my nose, but your bright eyes.</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>And then, to tell you&mdash;but before I can<br/>
Tell you&mdash; Are you, I wonder, still the same<br/>
Big brother&mdash;almost&mdash;that you used to be<br/>
When we were children, playing by the pond<br/>
In the old garden down there&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember&mdash;<br/>
Every summer you came to Bergerac! ...</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>You used to make swords out of bulrushes&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Your dandelion-dolls with golden hair&mdash;</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>And those green plums&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those black mulberries&mdash;</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>In those days, you did everything I wished!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Roxane, in short skirts, was called Madeleine.</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>Was I pretty?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh&mdash;not too plain!</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes<br/>
When you had hurt your hand you used to come<br/>
Running to me&mdash;and I would be your mother,<br/>
And say&mdash; Oh, in a very grown-up voice:</p>
<p>(She takes his hand.)</p>
<p>"Now, what have you been doing to yourself?<br/>
Let me see&mdash;"</p>
<p>(She sees the hand &mdash; starts.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh!&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait&mdash; I said, "Let me see!"<br/>
Still&mdash;at your age! How did you do that?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing<br/>
With the big boys, down by the Porte de Nesle.</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>(Sits at a table and wets her handkerchief in a glass of water.)</p>
<p>Come here to me.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Such a wise little mother!</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>And tell me, while I wash this blood away,<br/>
How many you&mdash;played with?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, about a hundred.</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>Tell me.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Let me go. Tell me what you<br/>
Were going to tell me&mdash;if you dared?</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>(Still holding his hand)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think<br/>
I do dare&mdash;now. It seems like long ago<br/>
When I could tell you things. Yes&mdash;I dare ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen:<br/>
I ... love someone.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! ...</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone who does not know.</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;At least&mdash;not yet</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah!...</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he will know<br/>
Some day.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! ...</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big boy who loves me too,<br/>
And is afraid of me, and keeps away,<br/>
And never says one word.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! ...</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me have<br/>
Your hand a moment&mdash;why how hot it is!&mdash;<br/>
I know. I see him trying ...</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! ...</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There now!<br/>
Is that better?&mdash;</p>
<p>(She finishes bandaging the hand with her handkerchief.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides&mdash;only to think&mdash;<br/>
(This is a secret.) He is a soldier too,<br/>
In your own regiment&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! ...</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, in the Guards,<br/>
Your company too.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! ...</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such a man!&mdash;<br/>
He is proud&mdash;noble&mdash;young&mdash;brave&mdash;beautiful&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Turns pale; rises.)</p>
<p>Beautiful!&mdash;</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's the matter?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Smiling)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing&mdash;this&mdash;<br/>
My sore hand!</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I love him. That is all.<br/>
Oh&mdash;and I never saw him anywhere<br/>
Except the <em>Comedie</em>.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have never spoken?&mdash;</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>Only our eyes ...</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, then&mdash; How do you know?&mdash;</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>People talk about people; and I hear<br/>
Things ... and I know.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You say he is in the Guards:<br/>
His name?</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron Christian de Neuvillette.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>He is not in the Guards.</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Since this morning.<br/>
Captain Carbon de Castel-Jaloux.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So soon!<br/>
So soon we lose our hearts!&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, my dear child,&mdash;</p>
<p>The Duenna</p>
<p>(Opens the door.)</p>
<p>I have eaten the cakes, Monsieur de Bergerac!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Good! Now go out and read the poetry!</p>
<p>(The Duenna disappears.)</p>
<p>&mdash;But, my dear child! You, who love only words,<br/>
Wit, the grand manner&mdash; Why, for all you know,<br/>
The man may be a savage, or a fool.</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>His curls are like a hero from D'Urfé.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>His mind may be as curly as his hair.</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>Not with such eyes. I read his soul in them.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Yes, all our souls are written in our eyes!<br/>
But&mdash;if he be a bungler?</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I shall die&mdash;<br/>
There!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(After a pause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;And you brought me here to tell me this?<br/>
I do not yet quite understand, Madame,<br/>
The reason for your confidence.</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say<br/>
That in your company&mdash; It frightens me&mdash;<br/>
You are all Gascons ...</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we pick a quarrel<br/>
With any flat-foot who intrudes himself<br/>
Whose blood is not pure Gascon like our own?<br/>
Is this what you have heard?</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so afraid<br/>
For him!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Between his teeth)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not without reason!&mdash;</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I thought<br/>
You ... You were so brave, so invincible<br/>
Yesterday, against all those brutes!&mdash;If you,<br/>
Whom they all fear&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh well&mdash; I will defend<br/>
Your little Baron.</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you? Just for me?<br/>
Because I have always been&mdash;your friend!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course ...</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>Will you be <em>his</em> friend?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be his friend.</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>And never let him fight a duel?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&mdash;never.</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>Oh, but you are a darling!&mdash;I must go&mdash;<br/>
You never told me about last night&mdash; Why,<br/>
You must have been a hero! Have him write<br/>
And tell me all about it&mdash;will you?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course...</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>(Kisses her hand.)</p>
<p>I always did love you!&mdash; A hundred men<br/>
Against one&mdash; Well.... Adieu. We are great friends,<br/>
Are we not?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course ...</p>
<p>Roxane</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He <em>must</em> write to me&mdash;<br/>
A hundred&mdash; You shall tell me the whole story<br/>
Some day, when I have time. A hundred men&mdash;<br/>
What courage&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Salutes as she goes out.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh ... I have done better since!</p>
<p>(The door closes after her. Cyrano remains motionless, his eyes on the ground. Pause. The other door opens; Ragueneau puts in his head.)</p>
<h3>[Scene VII]</h3>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>May I come in?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Without moving)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes ...</p>
<p>(Ragueneau and his friends re-enter. At the same time, Carbon de Castel-Jaloux appears at the street door in uniform as Captain of the Guards; recognizes Cyrano with a sweeping gesture.)</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here he is!&mdash;Our hero!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Raises his head and salutes.)</p>
<p>Our Captain!</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know! All our company<br/>
Are here&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Recoils)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;No&mdash;</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come! They are waiting for you.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No!</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>(Tries to lead him out.)</p>
<p>Only across the street&mdash; Come!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please&mdash;</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>(Goes to the door and shouts in a voice of thunder.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our champion<br/>
Refuses! He is not feeling well to-day!</p>
<p>A Voice Outside</p>
<p>Ah! Sandious!</p>
<p>(Noise outside of swords and trampling feet approaching.)</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here they come now!</p>
<p>The Cadets</p>
<p>(Entering the shop)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mille dious!&mdash;<br/>
Mordious!&mdash;Capdedious!&mdash;Pocapdedious!</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(In astonishment)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentlemen&mdash;<br/>
You are all Gascons?</p>
<p>The Cadets</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All!</p>
<p>First Cadet</p>
<p>(To Cyrano)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bravo!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron!</p>
<p>Another Cadet</p>
<p>(Takes both his hands.)</p>
<p>Vivat!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron!</p>
<p>Third Cadet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to my arms!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron!</p>
<p>Others</p>
<p>To mine!&mdash;To mine!.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron ... Baron ... Have mercy&mdash;</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>You are all Barons too?</p>
<p>The Cadets</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Are</em> we?</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they?</p>
<p>First Cadet</p>
<p>Our coronets would star the midnight sky!</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>(Enters: Hurries to Cyrano.)</p>
<p>The whole town's looking for you! Raving mad&mdash;<br/>
A triumph! Those who saw the fight&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope<br/>
You have not told them where I&mdash;</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>(Rubbing his hands)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly<br/>
I told them!</p>
<p>Citizen</p>
<p>(Enters, followed by a group.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen! Shut the door!&mdash;Here comes<br/>
All Paris!</p>
<p>(The street outside fills with a shouting crowd. Chairs and carriages stop at the door.)</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>(Aside to Cyrano, smiling)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roxane?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Quickly)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush!</p>
<p>The Crowd Outside</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyrano!</p>
<p>(A mob bursts into the shop. Shouts, acclamations, general disturbance.)</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>(Standing on a table.)</p>
<p>My shop invaded&mdash; They'll break everything&mdash;<br/>
Glorious!</p>
<p>Several Men</p>
<p>(Crowding about Cyrano)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend! ... My friend! ...</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, yesterday<br/>
I did not have so many friends!</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success<br/>
At last!</p>
<p>A Marquis</p>
<p>(Runs to Cyrano, with outstretched hands)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear&mdash;really!&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Coldly)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So? And how long<br/>
Have I been dear to you?</p>
<p>Another Marquis</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One moment&mdash;pray!<br/>
I have two ladies in my carriage here;<br/>
Let me present you&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly! And first,<br/>
Who will present you, sir,&mdash;to me?</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>(Astounded)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, what<br/>
The devil?&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush!</p>
<p>A Man of Letters</p>
<p>(With a portfolio)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I have the details? ...</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>You may not.</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>(Plucking Cyrano's sleeve)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theophraste Renaudot!&mdash;Editor<br/>
Of the <em>Gazette</em>&mdash;your reputation! ...</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No!</p>
<p>A Poet</p>
<p>(Advances)</p>
<p>Monsieur&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well?</p>
<p>The Poet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your full name? I will compose<br/>
A pentacrostic&mdash;</p>
<p>Another</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monsieur&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will do!</p>
<p>(Movement. The crowd arranges itself. De Guiche appears, escorted by Cuigy, Brissaille, and the other officers who were with Cyrano at the close of the First Act.)</p>
<p>Cuigy</p>
<p>(Goes to Cyrano.)</p>
<p>Monsieur de Guiche!&mdash;</p>
<p>(Murmur. Everyone moves.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A message from the Marshal<br/>
De Gassion&mdash;</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>(Saluting Cyrano)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wishes to express<br/>
Through me his admiration. He has heard<br/>
Of your affair&mdash;</p>
<p>The Crowd</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bravo!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Bowing)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal speaks<br/>
As an authority.</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said just now<br/>
The story would have been incredible<br/>
Were it not for the witness&mdash;</p>
<p>Cuigy</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our eyes!</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>(Aside to Cyrano)</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush!&mdash;</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something is wrong with you;<br/>
Are you in pain?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Recovering himself)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pain? Before this crowd?</p>
<p>(His moustache bristles. He throws out his chest.)</p>
<p>I? In pain? You shall see!</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>(To whom Cuigy has been whispering.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your name is known<br/>
Already as a soldier. You are one<br/>
Of those wild Gascons, are you not?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guards,<br/>
Yes. A Cadet.</p>
<p>A Cadet</p>
<p>(In a voice of thunder)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of ourselves!</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! So&mdash;<br/>
Then all these gentlemen with the haughty air,<br/>
These are the famous&mdash;</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyrano!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain?</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>Our troop being all present, be so kind<br/>
As to present them to the Comte de Guiche!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(With a gesture presenting the Cadets to De Guiche, declaims:)</p>

<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>(Languidly, sitting in a chair)</p>
<p>Poets are fashionable nowadays<br/>
To have about one. Would you care to join<br/>
My following?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, sir. I do not follow.</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>Your duel yesterday amused my uncle<br/>
The Cardinal. I might help you there.</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand Dieu!</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>I suppose you have written a tragedy&mdash;<br/>
They all have.</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>(Aside to Cyrano)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at last you'll have it played&mdash;<br/>
Your "Agrippine"!</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not? Take it to him.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Tempted)</p>
<p>Really&mdash;</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;He is himself a dramatist;<br/>
Let him rewrite a few lines here and there,<br/>
And he'll approve the rest.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(His face falls again.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible.<br/>
My blood curdles to think of altering<br/>
One comma.</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, but when he likes a thing<br/>
He pays well.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&mdash;but not so well as I&mdash;<br/>
When I have made a line that sings itself<br/>
So that I love the sound of it&mdash;I pay<br/>
Myself a hundred times.</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are proud, my friend.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>You have observed that?</p>
<p>A Cadet</p>
<p>(Enters with a drawn sword, along the whole blade of which is transfixed a collection of disreputable hats, their plumes draggled, their crowns cut and torn.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyrano! See here&mdash;<br/>
Look what we found this morning in the street&mdash;<br/>
The plumes dropped in their flight by those fine birds<br/>
Who showed the white feather!</p>

Those rascals, he must be an angry man<br/>
To-day!</p>
<p>Brissaille</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was it? Do you know?</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself!&mdash;</p>
<p>(The laughter ceases.)</p>
<p>I hired them to do the sort of work<br/>
We do not soil our hands with&mdash;punishing<br/>
A drunken poet ...</p>
<p>(Uncomfortable silence)</p>
<p>The Cadet</p>
<p>(To Cyrano)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall we do with them?<br/>
They ought to be preserved before they spoil&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Takes the sword, and in the gesture of saluting De Guiche with it, makes all the hats slide off at his feet.)</p>
<p>Sir, will you not return these to your friends?</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>My chair&mdash;my porters here&mdash;immediately!</p>
<p>(To Cyrano violently)</p>
<p>&mdash;As for you, sir!&mdash;</p>
<p>A Voice</p>
<p>(In the street)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair of Monseigneur<br/>
Le Comte de Guiche!&mdash;</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>(Who has recovered his self-control; smiling)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you read <em>Don Quixote</em>?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>I have&mdash;and found myself the hero.</p>
<p>A Porter</p>
<p>(Appears at the door.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chair<br/>
Ready!</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Be so good as to read once more<br/>
The chapter of the windmills.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Gravely)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter Thirteen.</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>Windmills, remember, if you fight with them&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>My enemies change, then, with every wind?</p>
<p>de Guiche</p>
<p>&mdash;May swing round their huge arms and cast you down<br/>
Into the mire.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or up&mdash;among the stars!</p>
<p>(De Guiche goes out. We see him get into the chair. The Officers follow murmuring among themselves. Le Bret goes up with them. The crowd goes out.)</p>
<h3>[Scene VIII]</h3>
<p>(Saluting with burlesque politeness, those who go out without daring to take leave of him.)</p>
<p>Gentlemen.... Gentlemen....</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>(As the door closes, comes down, shaking his clenched hands to heaven.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have done it now&mdash;<br/>
You have made your fortune!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you go again,<br/>
Growling!&mdash;</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;At least this latest pose of yours&mdash;<br/>
Ruining every chance that comes your way&mdash;<br/>
Becomes exaggerated&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very well,<br/>
Then I exaggerate!</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>(Triumphantly)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you do!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes;<br/>
On principle. There are things in this world<br/>
A man does well to carry to extremes.</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>Stop trying to be Three Musketeers in one!<br/>
Fortune and glory&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would you have me do?<br/>
Seek for the patronage of some great man,<br/>
And like a creeping vine on a tall tree<br/>
Crawl upward, where I cannot stand alone?<br/>
No thank you! Dedicate, as others do,<br/>
Poems to pawnbrokers? Be a buffoon<br/>
In the vile hope of teasing out a smile<br/>
On some cold face? No thank you! Eat a toad<br/>
For breakfast every morning? Make my knees<br/>
Callous, and cultivate a supple spine,&mdash;<br/>
Wear out my belly grovelling in the dust?<br/>
No thank you! Scratch the back of any swine<br/>
That roots up gold for me? Tickle the horns<br/>
Of Mammon with my left hand, while my right<br/>
Too proud to know his partner's business,<br/>
Takes in the fee? No thank you! Use the fire<br/>
God gave me to burn incense all day long<br/>
Under the nose of wood and stone? No thank you!<br/>
Shall I go leaping into ladies' laps<br/>
And licking fingers?&mdash;or&mdash;to change the form&mdash;<br/>
Navigating with madrigals for oars,<br/>
My sails full of the sighs of dowagers?<br/>
No thank you! Publish verses at my own<br/>
Expense? No thank you! Be the patron saint<br/>
Of a small group of literary souls<br/>
Who dine together every Tuesday? No<br/>
I thank you! Shall I labor night and day<br/>
To build a reputation on one song,<br/>
And never write another? Shall I find<br/>
True genius only among Geniuses,<br/>
Palpitate over little paragraphs,<br/>
And struggle to insinuate my name<br/>
In the columns of the <em>Mercury?</em><br/>
No thank you! Calculate, scheme, be afraid,<br/>
Love more to make a visit than a poem,<br/>
Seek introductions, favors, influences?&mdash;<br/>
No thank you! No, I thank you! And again<br/>
I thank you!&mdash;But...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sing, to laugh, to dream,<br/>
To walk in my own way and be alone,<br/>
Free, with an eye to see things as they are,<br/>
A voice that means manhood&mdash;to cock my hat<br/>
Where I choose&mdash; At a word, a <em>Yes</em>, a <em>No</em>,<br/>
To fight&mdash;or write. To travel any road<br/>
Under the sun, under the stars, nor doubt<br/>
If fame or fortune lie beyond the bourne&mdash;<br/>
Never to make a line I have not heard<br/>
In my own heart; yet, with all modesty<br/>
To say: "My soul, be satisfied with flowers,<br/>
With fruit, with weeds even; but gather them<br/>
In the one garden you may call your own."<br/>
So, when I win some triumph, by some chance,<br/>
Render no share to Caesar&mdash;in a word,<br/>
I am too proud to be a parasite,<br/>
And if my nature wants the germ that grows<br/>
Towering to heaven like the mountain pine,<br/>
Or like the oak, sheltering multitudes&mdash;<br/>
I stand, not high it may be&mdash;but alone!</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>Alone, yes!&mdash;But why stand against the world?<br/>
What devil has possessed you now, to go<br/>
Everywhere making yourself enemies?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Watching you other people making friends<br/>
Everywhere&mdash;as a dog makes friends! I mark<br/>
The manner of these canine courtesies<br/>
And think: "My friends are of a cleaner breed;<br/>
Here comes&mdash;thank God!&mdash;another enemy!"</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>But this is madness!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method, let us say.<br/>
It is my pleasure to displease. I love<br/>
Hatred. Imagine how it feels to face<br/>
The volley of a thousand angry eyes&mdash;<br/>
The bile of envy and the froth of fear<br/>
Spattering little drops about me&mdash; You&mdash;<br/>
Good nature all around you, soft and warm&mdash;<br/>
You are like those Italians, in great cowls<br/>
Comfortable and loose&mdash; Your chin sinks down<br/>
Into the folds, your shoulders droop. But I&mdash;<br/>
The Spanish ruff I wear around my throat<br/>
Is like a ring of enemies; hard, proud,<br/>
Each point another pride, another thorn&mdash;<br/>
So that I hold myself erect perforce<br/>
Wearing the hatred of the common herd<br/>
Haughtily, the harsh collar of Old Spain,<br/>
At once a fetter and&mdash;a halo!</p>
<p>Le Bret</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes...</p>
<p>(After a silence, draws Cyrano's arm through his own.)</p>
<p>Tell this to all the world&mdash; And then to me<br/>
Say very softly that ... She loves you not.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Quickly)</p>
<p>Hush!</p>
<p>(A moment since, Christian has entered and mingled with the Cadets, who do not offer to speak to him. Finally, he sits down alone at a small table, where he is served by Lise.)</p>
<h3>[Scene IX]</h3>
<p>A Cadet</p>
<p>(Rises from a table up stage, his glass in his hand.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cyrano!&mdash;Your story!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently ... </p>
<p>(He goes up, on the arm of Le Bret, talking to him. The Cadet comes down stage.)</p>
<p>The Cadet</p>
<p>The story of the combat! An example<br/>
For&mdash;</p>
<p>(He stops by the table where Christian is sitting.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&mdash;this young tadpole here.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>(Looks up)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tadpole?</p>
<p>Another Cadet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you!&mdash;<br/>
You narrow-gutted Northerner!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir?</p>
<p>First Cadet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark ye,<br/>
Monsieur de Neuvillette: You are to know<br/>
There is a certain subject&mdash;I would say,<br/>
A certain object&mdash;never to be named<br/>
Among us: utterly unmentionable!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>And that is?</p>
<p>Third Cadet</p>
<p>(In an awful voice)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at me! ...</p>
<p>(He strikes his nose three times with his finger, mysteriously.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You understand?</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>Why, yes; the&mdash;</p>
<p>Fourth Cadet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sh! ... We never speak that word&mdash;
<p>(Indicating Cyrano by a gesture)</p>
<p>To breathe it is to have to do with HIM!</p>
<p>Fifth Cadet</p>
<p>(Speaks through his nose.)</p>
<p>He has exterminated several<br/>
Whose tone of voice suggested ...</p>
<p>Sixth Cadet</p>
<p>(In a hollow tone; rising from under the table on all fours.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you die<br/>
Before your time? Just mention anything<br/>
Convex &mdash; or cartilaginous </p>
<p>Seventh Cadet</p>
<p>(His hand on Christian's shoulder)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One word&mdash;<br/>
One syllable&mdash;one gesture&mdash;nay, one sneeze&mdash;<br/>
Your handkerchief becomes your winding-sheet!</p>
<p>(Silence. In a circle around Christian, arms crossed, they regard him expectantly.)</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>(Rises and goes to Carbon, who is conversing with an officer, and pretending not to see what is taking place.)</p>
<p>Captain!</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>(Turns, and looks him over.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir?</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the proper thing to do<br/>
When Gascons grow too boastful?</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prove to them<br/>
That one may be a Norman, and have courage.</p>
<p>(Turns his back.)</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>I thank you.</p>
<p>First Cadet</p>
<p>(To Cyrano)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come&mdash;the story!</p>
<p>All</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Come down.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,<br/>
My story? Well ...</p>
<p>(They all draw up their stools and group themselves around him, eagerly. Christian places himself astride of a chair, his arms on the back of it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I marched on, all alone<br/>
To meet those devils. Overhead, the moon<br/>
Hung like a gold watch at the fob of heaven,<br/>
Till suddenly some Angel rubbed a cloud,<br/>
As it might be his handkerchief, across<br/>
The shining crystal, and&mdash;the night came down.<br/>
No lamps in those back streets&mdash; It was so dark&mdash;<br/>
Mordious! You could not see beyond&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your nose.</p>
<p>(Silence. Every man slowly rises to his feet. They look at Cyrano almost with terror. He has stopped short, utterly astonished. Pause.)</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Who is that man there?</p>
<p>A Cadet</p>
<p>(In a low voice)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recruit&mdash;arrived<br/>
This morning.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Takes a step toward Christian.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recruit&mdash;</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>(In a low voice)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name is Christian<br/>
De Neuvil&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Suddenly motionless)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh...</p>
<p>(He turns pale, flushes, makes a movement as if to throw himself upon Christian.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&mdash;</p>
<p>(Controls himself, and goes on in a choking voice.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see. Very well,<br/>
As I was saying&mdash;</p>
<p>(With a sudden burst of rage)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mordious! ...</p>
<p>(He goes on in a natural tone.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It grew dark,<br/>
You could not see your hand before your eyes.<br/>
I marched on, thinking how, all for the sake<br/>
Of one old souse</p>
<p>(They slowly sit down, watching him.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who wrote a bawdy song<br/>
Whenever he took&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noseful&mdash;</p>
<p>(Everyone rises. Christian balances himself on two legs of his chair.)</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Half strangled)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Took a notion.<br/>
Whenever he took a notion&mdash; For his sake,<br/>
I might antagonize some dangerous man,<br/>
One powerful enough to make me pay&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>Through the nose&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Wipes the sweat front his forehead.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Pay the Piper. After all,<br/>
I thought, why am I putting in my&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nose&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&mdash;My oar ... Why am I putting in my oar?<br/>
The quarrel's none of mine. However&mdash;now<br/>
I am here, I may as well go through with it.<br/>
Come Gascon&mdash;do your duty!&mdash;Suddenly<br/>
A sword flashed in the dark. I caught it fair&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>On the nose&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my blade. Before I knew it,<br/>
There I was&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubbing noses&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Pale and smiling)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing swords<br/>
With half a score at once. I handed one&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>A nosegay&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Leaping at him)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ventre-Saint-Gris! ... </p>
<p>(The Gascons tumble over each other to get a good view. Arrived in front of Christian, who has not moved an inch, Cyrano masters himself again, and continues.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went down;<br/>
The rest gave way; I charged&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nose in the air&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>I skewered two of them&mdash;disarmed a third&mdash;<br/>
Another lunged&mdash; Paf! And I countered&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pif!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Bellowing)</p>
<p>TONNERRE!  Out of here!&mdash;All of you!</p>
<p>(All the Cadets rush for the door.)</p>
<p>First Cadet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last&mdash;<br/>
The old lion wakes!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of you! Leave me here<br/>
Alone with that man!</p>
<p>(The lines following are heard brokenly in the confusion of getting through the door.)</p>
<p>Second Cadet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bigre! He'll have the fellow<br/>
Chopped into sausage&mdash;</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sausage?&mdash;</p>
<p>Third Cadet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mince-meat, then&mdash;<br/>
One of your pies!&mdash;</p>
<p>Ragueneau</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I pale? You look white<br/>
As a fresh napkin&mdash;</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>(At the door)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come!</p>
<p>Fourth Cadet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll never leave<br/>
Enough of him to&mdash;</p>
<p>Fifth Cadet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, it frightens me<br/>
To think of what will&mdash;</p>
<p>Sixth Cadet</p>
<p>(Closing the door)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something horrible<br/>
Beyond imagination ...</p>
<p>(They are all gone: some through the street door, some by the inner doors to right and left. A few disappear up the staircase. Cyrano and Christian stand face to face a moment, and look at each other.)</p>
<h3>[Scene X]</h3>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my arms!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>Sir?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;You have courage!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, that! ...</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are brave&mdash;<br/>
That pleases me.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean? ...</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you not know<br/>
I am her brother? Come!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose?&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hers&mdash;Roxane!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>Her ... brother? You?</p>
<p>(Hurries to him.)</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cousin. Much the same.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>And she has told you? ...</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loves me?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>(Takes both his hands.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear sir&mdash;more than I can say,<br/>
I am honored&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is rather sudden.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please<br/>
Forgive me&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Holds him at arm's length, looking at him.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, he is a handsome devil.<br/>
This fellow!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my honor&mdash;if you knew<br/>
How much I have admired&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes&mdash;and all<br/>
Those Noses which&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please! I apologize.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Change of tone)</p>
<p>Roxane expects a letter&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not from me?&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Yes. Why not?</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I write, that ruins all!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because ... because I am a fool!<br/>
Stupid enough to hang myself!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no&mdash;<br/>
You are no fool; you call yourself a fool,<br/>
There's proof enough in that. Besides, you did not<br/>
Attack me like a fool.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bah! Any one<br/>
Can pick a quarrel. Yes, I have a sort<br/>
Of rough and ready soldier's tongue. I know<br/>
That. But with any woman&mdash;paralyzed,<br/>
Speechless, dumb. I can only look at them.<br/>
Yet sometimes, when I go away, their eyes ...</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Why not their hearts, if you should wait and see?</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>No. I am one of those&mdash; I know&mdash;those men<br/>
Who never can make love.</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange.... Now it seems<br/>
I, if I gave my mind to it, I might<br/>
Perhaps make love well.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, if I had words<br/>
To say what I have here!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could be<br/>
A handsome little Musketeer with eyes!&mdash;</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>Besides&mdash;you know Roxane&mdash;how sensitive&mdash;<br/>
One rough word, and the sweet illusion&mdash;gone!</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>I wish you might be my interpreter.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>I wish I had your wit&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrow it, then!&mdash;<br/>
Your beautiful young manhood&mdash;lend me that,<br/>
And we two make one hero of romance!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;Would you dare repeat to her the words<br/>
I gave you, day by day?</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean<br/>
Roxane shall have no disillusionment!<br/>
Come, shall we win her both together? Take<br/>
The soul within this learthern jack of mine,<br/>
And breathe it into you?</p>
<p>(Touches hint on the breast)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So&mdash;there's my heart<br/>
Under your velvet, now!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&mdash; Cyrano!&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>But&mdash; Christian, why not?</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know&mdash;<br/>
Afraid that when you have her all alone,<br/>
You lose all. Have no fear. It is yourself<br/>
She loves&mdash;give her yourself put into words&mdash;<br/>
My words, upon your lips!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... but your eyes! ...<br/>
They burn like&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you?... Will you?</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it mean<br/>
So much to you?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Beside himself)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It means&mdash;</p>
<p>(Recovers, changes tone.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Comedy,<br/>
A situation for a poet! Come.<br/>
Shall we collaborate? I'll be your cloak<br/>
Of darkness, your enchanted sword, your ring<br/>
To charm the fairy Princess!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the letter&mdash; I cannot write&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes, the letter.</p>
<p>(He takes from his pocket the letter which he has written.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All there; all but the address.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>I&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you may send it. It will serve.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why<br/>
Have you done this?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have amused myself<br/>
As we all do, we poets&mdash;writing vows<br/>
To Chloris, Phyllis&mdash;any pretty name&mdash;<br/>
You might have had a pocketful of them!<br/>
Take it, and turn to facts my fantasies&mdash;<br/>
I loosed these loves like doves into the air;<br/>
Give them a habitation and a home.<br/>
Here, take it&mdash; You will find me all the more<br/>
Eloquent, being insincere! Come!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First,<br/>
There must be a few changes here and there&mdash;<br/>
Written at random, can it fit Roxane?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>Like her own glove.</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, but&mdash;</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My son, have faith&mdash;<br/>
Faith in the love of women for themselves&mdash;<br/>
Roxane will know this letter for her own!</p>
<p>Christian</p>
<p>(Throws himself into the arms of Cyrano. They stand embraced.)</p>
<p>My friend!</p>
<h3>[Scene XI]</h3>
<p>(The door up stage opens a little. A Cadet steals in.)</p>
<p>The Cadet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing. A silence like the tomb ...<br/>
I hardly dare look&mdash;</p>
<p>(He sees the two.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wha-at?</p>
<p>(The other Cadets crowd in behind him and see.)</p>
<p>The Cadets</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No!&mdash;No!</p>
<p>Second Cadet</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mon dieu!</p>
<p>The Musketeer</p>
<p>(Slaps his knee.)</p>
<p>Well, well, well!</p>
<p>Carbon</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's our devil ... Christianized!<br/>
Offend one nostril, and he turns the other.</p>
<p>The Musketeer</p>
<p>Now we are allowed to talk about his nose!</p>
<p>(Calls)</p>
<p>Hey, Lise! Come here&mdash;</p>
<p>(Affectedly)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snf! What a horrid smell!<br/>
What is it? ...</p>
<p>(Plants himself in front of Cyrano, and looks at his nose in an impolite manner.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You ought to know about such things;<br/>
What seems to have died around here?</p>
<p>Cyrano</p>
<p>(Knocks him backward over a bench.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabbage-heads!</p>
<p>(Joy. The Cadets have found their old Cyrano again. General disturbance.)</p>
<p>(Curtain)</p>

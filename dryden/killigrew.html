<h1>To the Pious Memory of the Accomplished Young Lady Mrs Anne Killigrew, Excellent in the Two Sister Arts of Poesy and Painting</h1>
<h2>by John Dryden</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
Thou youngest virgin-daughter of the skies,<br/>
Made in the last promotion of the blest;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose palms, new pluck'd from Paradise,<br/>
In spreading branches more sublimely rise,<br/>
Rich with immortal green above the rest:<br/>
Whether, adopted to some neighbouring star,<br/>
Thou roll'st above us, in thy wandering race,<br/>
Or, in procession fix'd and regular,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mov'st with the heavens' majestic pace;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, call'd to more superior bliss,<br/>
Thou tread'st, with seraphims, the vast abyss:<br/>
Whatever happy region is thy place,<br/>
Cease thy celestial song a little space;<br/>
Thou wilt have time enough for hymns divine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Heaven's eternal year is thine.<br/>
Hear then a mortal Muse thy praise rehearse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no ignoble verse;<br/>
But such as thy own voice did practise here,<br/>
When thy first fruits of Poesy were given;<br/>
To make thyself a welcome inmate there:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  While yet a young probationer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And candidate of heaven.<br/>
</p>
<h3>  II.</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If by traduction came thy mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our wonder is the less to find<br/>
A soul so charming from a stock so good;<br/>
Thy father was transfused into thy blood:<br/>
So wert thou born into a tuneful strain,<br/>
An early, rich, and inexhausted vein.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But if thy pre-existing soul<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was form'd, at first, with myriads more,<br/>
It did through all the mighty poets roll,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who Greek or Latin laurels wore,<br/>
And was that Sappho last, which once it was before.<br/>
If so, then cease thy flight, O heaven-born mind!<br/>
Thou hast no dross to purge from thy rich ore:<br/>
Nor can thy soul a fairer mansion find,<br/>
Than was the beauteous frame she left behind:<br/>
Return to fill or mend the choir of thy celestial kind.<br/>
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
May we presume to say, that, at thy birth,<br/>
New joy was sprung in heaven, as well as here on earth?<br/>
For sure the milder planets did combine<br/>
On thy auspicious horoscope to shine,<br/>
And even the most malicious were in trine.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy brother angels at thy birth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strung each his lyre, and tuned it high,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That all the people of the sky<br/>
Might know a poetess was born on earth.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, if ever, mortal ears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had heard the music of the spheres,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if no clustering swarm of bees<br/>
On thy sweet mouth distill'd their golden dew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas that such vulgar miracles<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven had not leisure to renew:<br/>
For all thy blest fraternity of love<br/>
Solemnized there thy birth, and kept thy holiday above.<br/>
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O gracious God! how far have we<br/>
Profaned thy heavenly gift of Poesy!<br/>
Made prostitute and profligate the Muse,<br/>
Debased to each obscene and impious use,<br/>
Whose harmony was first ordain'd above<br/>
For tongues of angels, and for hymns of love!<br/>
O wretched we! why were we hurried down<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This lubrique and adulterate age,<br/>
(Nay added fat pollutions of our own,)<br/>
To increase the streaming ordures of the stage?<br/>
What can we say to excuse our second fall?<br/>
Let this thy vestal, Heaven, atone for all:<br/>
Her Arethusian stream remains unsoil'd,<br/>
Unmix'd with foreign filth, and undefiled:<br/>
Her wit was more than man, her innocence a child.<br/>
</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Art she had none, yet wanted none;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For nature did that want supply:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So rich in treasures of her own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She might our boasted stores defy:<br/>
Such noble vigour did her verse adorn,<br/>
That it seem'd borrow'd where 'twas only born.<br/>
Her morals too were in her bosom bred.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By great examples daily fed,<br/>
What in the best of books, her father's life, she read:<br/>
And to be read herself she need not fear;<br/>
Each test, and every light, her Muse will bear,<br/>
Though Epictetus with his lamp were there.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even love (for love sometimes her Muse express'd)<br/>
Was but a lambent flame which play'd about her breast:<br/>
Light as the vapours of a morning dream,<br/>
So cold herself, whilst she such warmth express'd,<br/>
'Twas Cupid bathing in Diana's stream.<br/>
</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p>
Born to the spacious empire of the Nine,<br/>
One would have thought she should have been content<br/>
To manage well that mighty government;<br/>
But what can young ambitious souls confine?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the next realm she stretch'd her sway,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Painture near adjoining lay,<br/>
A plenteous province, and alluring prey.<br/>
A Chamber of Dependencies was framed,<br/>
(As conquerors will never want pretence,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When arm'd, to justify the offence)<br/>
And the whole fief, in right of poetry, she claim'd.<br/>
The country open lay without defence:<br/>
For poets frequent inroads there had made,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And perfectly could represent<br/>
The shape, the face, with every lineament,<br/>
And all the large domains which the Dumb Sister sway'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All bow'd beneath her government,<br/>
Received in triumph wheresoe'er she went.<br/>
Her pencil drew whate'er her soul design'd,<br/>
And oft the happy draft surpass'd the image in her mind.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sylvan scenes of herds and flocks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fruitful plains and barren rocks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shallow brooks that flow'd so clear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom did the top appear:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of deeper, too, and ampler floods,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, as in mirrors, show'd the woods;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lofty trees, with sacred shades,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pérspectives of pleasant glades,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where nymphs of brightest form appear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shaggy satyrs standing near,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which them at once admire and fear.<br/>
The ruins, too, of some majestic piece,<br/>
Boasting the power of ancient Rome or Greece,<br/>
Whose statues, friezes, columns broken lie,<br/>
And, though defaced, the wonder of the eye;<br/>
What nature, art, bold fiction e'er durst frame,<br/>
Her forming hand gave feature to the name.<br/>
So strange a concourse ne'er was seen before,<br/>
But when the peopled ark the whole creation bore.<br/>
</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>
The scene then changed: with bold erected look<br/>
Our martial king the sight with reverence strook:<br/>
For not content to express his outward part,<br/>
Her hand call'd out the image of his heart:<br/>
His warlike mind, his soul devoid of fear,<br/>
His high-designing thoughts were figured there,<br/>
As when, by magic, ghosts are made appear.<br/>
Our phoenix queen was portray'd too so bright,<br/>
Beauty alone could beauty take so right;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dress, her shape, her matchless grace,<br/>
Were all observed, as well as heavenly face.<br/>
With such a peerless majesty she stands,<br/>
As in that day she took the crown from sacred hands:<br/>
Before a train of heroines was seen,<br/>
In beauty foremost, as in rank, the queen.<br/>
Thus nothing to her genius was denied,<br/>
But like a ball of fire the further thrown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still with a greater blaze she shone,<br/>
And her bright soul broke out on every side.<br/>
What next she had design'd Heaven only knows:<br/>
To such immoderate growth her conquest rose,<br/>
That fate alone its progress could oppose.<br/>
</p>
<h3>VIII.</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all those charms, that blooming grace,<br/>
The well-proportion'd shape, and beauteous face,<br/>
Shall never more be seen by mortal eyes;<br/>
In earth the much lamented virgin lies.<br/>
Not wit, nor piety could Fate prevent;<br/>
Nor was the cruel destiny content<br/>
To finish all the murder at a blow,<br/>
To sweep at once her life, and beauty too;<br/>
But, like a harden'd felon, took a pride<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To work more mischievously slow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And plunder'd first, and then destroy'd.<br/>
Oh, double sacrilege on things divine,<br/>
To rob the relic, and deface the shrine!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thus Orinda died:<br/>
Heaven, by the same disease, did both translate:<br/>
As equal were their souls, so equal was their fate.<br/>
</p>
<h3>IX.</h3>
<p>
Meantime her warlike brother on the seas<br/>
His waving streamers to the wind displays,<br/>
And vows for his return, with vain devotion, pays.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, generous youth! that wish forbear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The winds too soon will waft thee here:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Slack all thy sails, and fear to come,<br/>
Alas, thou know'st not thou art wreck'd at home!<br/>
No more shalt thou behold thy sister's face,<br/>
Thou hast already had her last embrace.<br/>
But look aloft, and if thou ken'st from far<br/>
Among the Pleiads a new-kindled star,<br/>
If any sparkles than the rest more bright,<br/>
'Tis she that shines in that propitious light.<br/>
</p>
<h3>X.</h3>
<p>
When in mid-air the golden trump shall sound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise the nations under ground:<br/>
When in the Valley of Jehoshaphat,<br/>
The judging God shall close the book of fate:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there the last assizes keep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who wake, and those who sleep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When rattling bones together fly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the four corners of the sky;<br/>
When sinews o'er the skeletons are spread,<br/>
Those clothed with flesh, and life inspires the dead;<br/>
The sacred poets first shall hear the sound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And foremost from the tomb shall bound,<br/>
For they are cover'd with the lightest ground;<br/>
And straight, with inborn vigour, on the wing,<br/>
Like mounting larks, to the new morning sing.<br/>
There thou, sweet saint, before the quire shalt go,<br/>
As harbinger of heaven, the way to show,<br/>
The way which thou so well hast learn'd below.<br/>

<h1>Heroic Stanzas on the Death of Oliver Cromwell</h1>
<h2>by John Dryden</h2>
<p>
And now 'tis time; for their officious haste,<br/>
Who would before have borne him to the sky,<br/>
Like eager Romans, ere all rites were past,<br/>
Did let too soon the sacred eagle fly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Though our best notes are treason to his fame,<br/>
Join'd with the loud applause of public voice;<br/>
Since Heaven, what praise we offer to his name,<br/>
Hath render'd too authentic by its choice.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Though in his praise no arts can liberal be,<br/>
Since they, whose muses have the highest flown,<br/>
Add not to his immortal memory,<br/>
But do an act of friendship to their own:<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet 'tis our duty, and our interest too,<br/>
Such monuments as we can build to raise;<br/>
Lest all the world prevent what we should do,<br/>
And claim a title in him by their praise.<br/>
</p>
<p>
How shall I then begin, or where conclude,<br/>
To draw a fame so truly circular?<br/>
For in a round what order can be show'd,<br/>
Where all the parts so equal perfect are?<br/>
</p>
<p>
His grandeur he derived from Heaven alone;<br/>
For he was great ere fortune made him so:<br/>
And wars, like mists that rise against the sun,<br/>
Made him but greater seem, not greater grow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
No borrow'd bays his temples did adorn,<br/>
But to our crown he did fresh jewels bring;<br/>
Nor was his virtue poison'd soon as born,<br/>
With the too early thoughts of being king.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fortune (that easy mistress to the young,<br/>
But to her ancient servants coy and hard),<br/>
Him at that age her favourites rank'd among,<br/>
When she her best-loved Pompey did discard.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He, private, mark'd the faults of others' sway,<br/>
And set as sea-marks for himself to shun:<br/>
Not like rash monarchs, who their youth betray<br/>
By acts their age too late would wish undone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And yet dominion was not his design;<br/>
We owe that blessing, not to him, but Heaven,<br/>
Which to fair acts unsought rewards did join;<br/>
Rewards, that less to him, than us, were given.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Our former chiefs, like sticklers of the war,<br/>
First sought to inflame the parties, then to poise:<br/>
The quarrel loved, but did the cause abhor;<br/>
And did not strike to hurt, but make a noise.<br/>
</p>
<p>
War, our consumption, was their gainful trade:<br/>
We inward bled, whilst they prolong'd our pain;<br/>
He fought to end our fighting, and essay'd<br/>
To staunch the blood by breathing of the vein.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift and resistless through the land he past,<br/>
Like that bold Greek who did the East subdue,<br/>
And made to battles such heroic haste,<br/>
As if on wings of victory he flew.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He fought secure of fortune as of fame:<br/>
Still by new maps the island might be shown,<br/>
Of conquests, which he strew'd where'er he came,<br/>
Thick as the galaxy with stars is sown.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His palms, though under weights they did not stand,<br/>
Still thrived; no winter could his laurels fade:<br/>
Heaven in his portrait show'd a workman's hand,<br/>
And drew it perfect, yet without a shade.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Peace was the prize of all his toil and care,<br/>
Which war had banish'd, and did now restore:<br/>
Bologna's walls thus mounted in the air,<br/>
To seat themselves more surely than before.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Her safety rescued Ireland to him owes;<br/>
And treacherous Scotland, to no interest true,<br/>
Yet blest that fate which did his arms dispose<br/>
Her land to civilize, as to subdue.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor was he like those stars which, only shine,<br/>
When to pale mariners they storms portend:<br/>
He had his calmer influence, and his mien<br/>
Did love and majesty together blend.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Tis true, his countenance did imprint an awe;<br/>
And naturally all souls to his did bow,<br/>
As wands of divination downward draw,<br/>
And point to beds where sovereign gold doth grow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When past all offerings to Feretrian Jove,<br/>
He Mars deposed, and arms to gowns made yield;<br/>
Successful councils did him soon approve<br/>
As fit for close intrigues, as open field.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To suppliant Holland he vouchsafed a peace,<br/>
Our once bold rival of the British main,<br/>
Now tamely glad her unjust claim to cease,<br/>
And buy our friendship with her idol, gain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Fame of the asserted sea through Europe blown,<br/>
Made France and Spain ambitious of his love;<br/>
Each knew that side must conquer he would own;<br/>
And for him fiercely, as for empire, strove.<br/>
</p>
<p>
No sooner was the Frenchman's cause embraced,<br/>
Than the light Monsieur the grave Don outweigh'd;<br/>
His fortune turn'd the scale where'er 'twas cast,<br/>
Though Indian mines were in the other laid.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When absent, yet we conquer'd in his right:<br/>
For though some meaner artist's skill were shown<br/>
In mingling colours or in placing light,<br/>
Yet still the fair designment was his own.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For from all tempers he could service draw;<br/>
The worth of each, with its alloy, he knew;<br/>
And, as the confidant of Nature, saw<br/>
How she complexions did divide and brew.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Or he their single virtues did survey,<br/>
By intuition, in his own large breast;<br/>
Where all the rich ideas of them lay;<br/>
That were the rule and measure to the rest.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When such heroic virtue Heaven sets out,<br/>
The stars, like commons, sullenly obey;<br/>
Because it drains them when it comes about,<br/>
And therefore is a tax they seldom pay.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From this high spring our foreign conquests flow,<br/>
Which yet more glorious triumphs do portend;<br/>
Since their commencement to his arms they owe,<br/>
If springs as high as fountains may ascend.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He made us freemen of the Continent,<br/>
Whom Nature did like captives treat before;<br/>
To nobler preys the English lion sent,<br/>
And taught him first in Belgian walks to roar.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That old unquestion'd pirate of the land,<br/>
Proud Rome, with dread the fate of Dunkirk heard;<br/>
And trembling wish'd behind more Alps to stand,<br/>
Although an Alexander were her guard.<br/>
</p>
<p>
By his command we boldly cross'd the line,<br/>
And bravely fought where southern stars arise;<br/>
We traced the far-fetch'd gold unto the mine,<br/>
And that which bribed our fathers made our prize.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Such was our prince; yet own'd a soul above<br/>
The highest acts it could produce to show:<br/>
Thus poor mechanic arts in public move,<br/>
Whilst the deep secrets beyond practice go.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor died he when his ebbing fame went less,<br/>
But when fresh laurels courted him to live:<br/>
He seem'd but to prevent some new success,<br/>
As if above what triumphs earth could give.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His latest victories still thickest came,<br/>
As near the centre motion doth increase;<br/>
Till he, press'd down by his own weighty name,<br/>
Did, like the vestal, under spoils decease.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But first the ocean as a tribute sent<br/>
The giant prince of all her watery herd;<br/>
And the Isle, when her protecting genius went,<br/>
Upon his obsequies loud sighs conferr'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
No civil broils have since his death arose,<br/>
But faction now by habit does obey;<br/>
And wars have that respect for his repose,<br/>
As winds for halcyons, when they breed at sea.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His ashes in a peaceful urn shall rest;<br/>
His name a great example stands, to show<br/>
How strangely high endeavours may be blest,<br/>
Where piety and valour jointly go.<br/>

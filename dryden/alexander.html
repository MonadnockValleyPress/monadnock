<h1>Alexander's Feast</h1>
<h2>by John Dryden</h2>
<p><em>A song in honour of St. Cecilia's day, 1697.</em></p>
<p>
'Twas at the royal feast for Persia won
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Philip's warlike son—
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloft in awful state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The godlike hero sate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his imperial throne;
&nbsp;&nbsp;His valiant peers were placed around,
Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;(So should desert in arms be crown'd);
The lovely Thais by his side
Sate like a blooming Eastern bride
In flower of youth and beauty's pride:—
&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy, happy, happy pair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None but the brave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None but the brave
&nbsp;&nbsp;None but the brave deserves the fair!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timotheus placed on high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the tuneful quire
With flying fingers touch'd the lyre:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trembling notes ascend the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heavenly joys inspire.
The song began from Jove
Who left his blissful seats above
Such is the power of mighty love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dragon's fiery form belied the god;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublime on radiant spires he rode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he to fair Olympia prest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while he sought her snowy breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then round her slender waist he curl'd,
And stamp'd an image of himself, a sovereign of the world.
&nbsp;&nbsp;The listening crowd admire the lofty sound;
&nbsp;&nbsp;A present deity! they shout around:
&nbsp;&nbsp;A present deity! the vaulted roofs rebound:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ravish'd ears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monarch hears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumes the god;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affects to nod,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seems to shake the spheres.
</p>
<p>
The praise of Bacchus then the sweet musician sung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jolly god in triumph comes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flush'd with a purple grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shows his honest face:
Now give the hautboys breath; he comes, he comes!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacchus, ever fair and young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking joys did first ordain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacchus' blessings are a treasure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking is the soldier's pleasure:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich the treasure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet the pleasure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet is pleasure after pain.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soothed with the sound, the king grew vain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fought all his battles o'er again,
And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master saw the madness rise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while he Heaven and Earth defied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed his hand and check'd his pride.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chose a mournful Muse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft pity to infuse:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sung Darius great and good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By too severe a fate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallen from his high estate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weltering in his blood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deserted at his utmost need
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By those his former bounty fed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bare earth exposed he lies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With not a friend to close his eyes.
With downcast looks the joyless victor sate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolving in his alter'd soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various turns of chance below;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now and then a sigh he stole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears began to flow.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty master smiled to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That love was in the next degree;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas but a kindred sound to move,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pity melts the mind to love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly sweet, in Lydian measures
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon he soothed his soul to pleasures.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War, he sung, is toil and trouble,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honour but an empty bubble;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never ending, still beginning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting still, and still destroying;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the world be worth thy winning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think, O think, it worth enjoying:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely Thais sits beside thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the good the gods provide thee!
The many rend the skies with loud applause;
So Love was crown'd, but Music won the cause.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince, unable to conceal his pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed on the fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who caused his care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sigh'd and look'd, sigh'd and look'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigh'd and look'd, and sigh'd again:
&nbsp;&nbsp;At length with love and wine at once opprest
&nbsp;&nbsp;The vanquish'd victor sunk upon her breast.
</p>
<p>
Now strike the golden lyre again:
A louder yet, and yet a louder strain!
Break his bands of sleep asunder
And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark, hark! the horrid sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has raised up his head:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As awaked from the dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And amazed he stares around.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenge, revenge, Timotheus cries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the Furies arise!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the snakes that they rear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they hiss in their hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sparkles that flash from their eyes!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold a ghastly band,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each a torch in his hand!
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are Grecian ghosts, that in battle were slain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unburied remain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inglorious on the plain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give the vengeance due
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the valiant crew!
&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold how they toss their torches on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they point to the Persian abodes
&nbsp;&nbsp;And glittering temples of their hostile gods.
&nbsp;&nbsp;The princes applaud with a furious joy:
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thais led the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To light him to his prey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;And like another Helen, fired another Troy!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, long ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere heaving bellows learn'd to blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While organs yet were mute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timotheus, to his breathing flute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sounding lyre
Could swell the soul to rage, or kindle soft desire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last divine Cecilia came.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventress of the vocal frame;
The sweet enthusiast from her sacred store
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enlarged the former narrow bounds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And added length to solemn sounds,
With Nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let old Timotheus yield the prize,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or both divide the crown;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised a mortal to the skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She drew an angel down!

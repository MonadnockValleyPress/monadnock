<h1>On the Death of Mr Purcell</h1>
<h2>by John Dryden</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark how the lark and linnet sing;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rival notes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They strain their warbling throats,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To welcome in the spring.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the close of night,<br/>
When Philomel begins her heavenly lay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cease their mutual spite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink in her music with delight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, listening, silently obey.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So ceased the rival crew, when Purcell came;<br/>
They sung no more, or only sung his fame:<br/>
Struck dumb, they all admired the godlike man:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The godlike man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! too soon retired,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he too late began.<br/>
We beg not hell our Orpheus to restore:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had he been there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sovereign's fear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had sent him back before.<br/>
The power of harmony too well they knew:<br/>
He long ere this had tuned their jarring sphere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left no hell below.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The heavenly choir, who heard his notes from high,<br/>
Let down the scale of music from the sky:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They handed him along,<br/>
And all the way he taught, and all the way they sung<br/>
Ye brethren of the lyre, and tuneful voice,<br/>
Lament his lot; but at your own rejoice:<br/>
Now live secure, and linger out your days;<br/>
The gods are pleased alone with Purcell's lays,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor know to mend their choice.<br/>

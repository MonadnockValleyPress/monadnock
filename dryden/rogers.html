<h1>Upon Young Mr Rogers of Gloucestershire</h1>
<h2>by John Dryden</h2>
<p>
Of gentle blood, his parents' only treasure,<br/>
Their lasting sorrow, and their vanish'd pleasure,<br/>
Adorn'd with features, virtues, wit, and grace,<br/>
A large provision for so short a race;<br/>
More moderate gifts might have prolong'd his date,<br/>
Too early fitted for a better state;<br/>
But, knowing heaven his home, to shun delay,<br/>
He leap'd o'er age, and took the shortest way.<br/>

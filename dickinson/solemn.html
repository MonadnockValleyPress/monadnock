<h1>A solemn thing it was I said</h1>
<h2>by Emily Dickinson</h2>
<p>
A solemn thing &mdash; it was &mdash; I said &mdash;<br/>
A woman &mdash; white &mdash; to be &mdash;<br/>
And wear &mdash; if God should count me fit &mdash;<br/>
Her hallowed mystery &mdash;
</p>
<p>
A hallowed thing &mdash; to drop a life<br/>
Into the purple well &mdash;<br/>
Too plummetless &mdash; that it return &mdash;<br/>
Eternity &mdash; until &mdash;
</p>
<p>
I pondered how the bliss would look &mdash;<br/>
And would it feel as big &mdash;<br/>
When I could take it in my hand &mdash;<br/>
As hovering &mdash; seen &mdash; through fog &mdash;
</p>
<p>
And then &mdash; the size of this "small" life &mdash;<br/>
The Sages &mdash; call it small &mdash;<br/>
Swelled &mdash; like Horizons &mdash; in my vest &mdash;<br/>
And I sneered &mdash; softly &mdash; "small"!

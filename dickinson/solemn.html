<h1>A solemn thing it was I said</h1>
<h2>by Emily Dickinson</h2>
<p>
A solemn thing - it was - I said -<br/>
A woman - white - to be -<br/>
And wear - if God should count me fit -<br/>
Her hallowed mystery -
</p>
<p>
A hallowed thing - to drop a life<br/>
Into the purple well -<br/>
Too plummetless - that it return -<br/>
Eternity - until -
</p>
<p>
I pondered how the bliss would look -<br/>
And would it feel as big -<br/>
When I could take it in my hand -<br/>
As hovering - seen - through fog -
</p>
<p>
And then - the size of this "small" life -<br/>
The Sages - call it small -<br/>
Swelled - like Horizons - in my vest -<br/>
And I sneered - softly - "small"!

<h1>A precious, mouldering pleasure 'tis</h1>
<h2>by Emily Dickinson</h2>
<p>
A precious &mdash; mouldering pleasure &mdash; 'tis &mdash;<br/>
To meet an Antique Book &mdash;<br/>
In just the Dress his Century wore &mdash;<br/>
A privilege &mdash; I think &mdash;
</p>
<p>
His venerable Hand to take &mdash;<br/>
And warming in our own &mdash;<br/>
A passage back &mdash; or two &mdash; to make &mdash;<br/>
To Times when he &mdash; was young &mdash;
</p>
<p>
His quaint opinions &mdash; to inspect &mdash;<br/>
His thought to ascertain<br/>
On Themes concern our mutual mind &mdash;<br/>
The Literature of Man &mdash;
</p>
<p>
What interested Scholars &mdash; most &mdash;<br/>
What Competitions ran &mdash;<br/>
When Plato &mdash; was a certainty &mdash;<br/>
And Sophocles &mdash; a Man &mdash;
</p>
<p>
When Sappho &mdash; was a living girl &mdash;<br/>
And Beatrice wore<br/>
The Gown that Dante &mdash; deified &mdash;<br/>
Facts Centuries before &mdash;
</p>
<p>
He traverses &mdash; familiar &mdash;<br/>
As One should come to Town &mdash;<br/>
And tell you all your Dreams &mdash; were true &mdash;<br/>
He lived &mdash; where Dreams were born
</p>
<p>
His presence is Enchantment &mdash;<br/>
You beg him not to go &mdash;<br/>
Old Volumes shake their Vellum Heads<br/>
And tantalize &mdash; just so &mdash;

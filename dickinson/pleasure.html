<h1>A precious, mouldering pleasure 'tis</h1>
<h2>by Emily Dickinson</h2>
<p>
A precious - mouldering pleasure - 'tis -<br/>
To meet an Antique Book -<br/>
In just the Dress his Century wore -<br/>
A privilege - I think -
</p>
<p>
His venerable Hand to take -<br/>
And warming in our own -<br/>
A passage back - or two - to make -<br/>
To Times when he - was young -
</p>
<p>
His quaint opinions - to inspect -<br/>
His thought to ascertain<br/>
On Themes concern our mutual mind -<br/>
The Literature of Man -
</p>
<p>
What interested Scholars - most -<br/>
What Competitions ran -<br/>
When Plato - was a certainty -<br/>
And Sophocles - a Man -
</p>
<p>
When Sappho - was a living girl -<br/>
And Beatrice wore<br/>
The Gown that Dante - deified -<br/>
Facts Centuries before -
</p>
<p>
He traverses - familiar -<br/>
As One should come to Town -<br/>
And tell you all your Dreams - were true -<br/>
He lived - where Dreams were born
</p>
<p>
His presence is Enchantment -<br/>
You beg him not to go -<br/>
Old Volumes shake their Vellum Heads<br/>
And tantalize - just so -

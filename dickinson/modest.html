<h1>I meant to have but modest needs</h1>
<h2>by Emily Dickinson</h2>
<p>
I meant to have but modest needs &mdash;<br/>
Such as Content &mdash; and Heaven &mdash;<br/>
Within my income &mdash; these could lie<br/>
And Life and I &mdash; keep even &mdash;
</p>
<p>
But since the last &mdash; included both &mdash;<br/>
It would suffice my Prayer<br/>
But just for One &mdash; to stipulate &mdash;<br/>
And Grace would grant the Pair &mdash;
</p>
<p>
And so &mdash; upon this wise &mdash; I prayed —<br/>
Great Spirit &mdash; Give to me<br/>
A Heaven not so large as yours,<br/>
But large enough &mdash; for me &mdash;
</p>
<p>
A Smile suffused Jehovah's face &mdash;<br/>
The Cherubim &mdash; withdrew &mdash;<br/>
Grave Saints stole out to look at me &mdash;<br/>
And showed their dimples &mdash; too &mdash;
</p>
<p>
I left the Place with all my might —<br/>
I threw my Prayer away &mdash;<br/>
The Quiet Ages picked it up &mdash;<br/>
And Judgment &mdash; twinkled &mdash; too &mdash;
</p>
<p>
That one so honest &mdash; be extant &mdash;<br/>
As take the Tale for true &mdash;<br/>
That "Whatsoever Ye shall ask &mdash;<br/>
Itself be given You" &mdash;
</p>
<p>
But I, grown shrewder &mdash; scan the Skies<br/>
With a suspicious Air —<br/>
As Children &mdash; swindled for the first,<br/>
All Swindlers &mdash; be &mdash; infer &mdash;

<h1>I meant to have but modest needs</h1>
<h2>by Emily Dickinson</h2>
<p>
I meant to have but modest needs -<br/>
Such as Content - and Heaven -<br/>
Within my income - these could lie<br/>
And Life and I - keep even -
</p>
<p>
But since the last - included both -<br/>
It would suffice my Prayer<br/>
But just for One - to stipulate -<br/>
And Grace would grant the Pair -
</p>
<p>
And so - upon this wise - I prayed —<br/>
Great Spirit - Give to me<br/>
A Heaven not so large as yours,<br/>
But large enough - for me -
</p>
<p>
A Smile suffused Jehovah's face -<br/>
The Cherubim - withdrew -<br/>
Grave Saints stole out to look at me -<br/>
And showed their dimples - too -
</p>
<p>
I left the Place with all my might —<br/>
I threw my Prayer away -<br/>
The Quiet Ages picked it up -<br/>
And Judgment - twinkled - too -
</p>
<p>
That one so honest - be extant -<br/>
As take the Tale for true -<br/>
That "Whatsoever Ye shall ask -<br/>
Itself be given You" -
</p>
<p>
But I, grown shrewder - scan the Skies<br/>
With a suspicious Air —<br/>
As Children - swindled for the first,<br/>
All Swindlers - be - infer -

<h1>He ate and drank the precious Words</h1>
<h2>by Emily Dickinson</h2>
<p>
He ate and drank the precious Words -<br/>
His Spirit grew robust -<br/>
He knew no more that he was poor,<br/>
Nor that his frame was Dust -
</p>
<p>
He danced along the dingy Days -<br/>
And this Bequest of Wings<br/>
Was but a Book - what liberty<br/>
A loosened spirit brings -
</p>

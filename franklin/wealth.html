<h1>The Way to Wealth</h1>
<h2>by Benjamin Franklin (1758)</h2>

<p>(From "Father Abraham's Speech," forming the preface to <em>Poor Richard's Almanac</em> for 1758.)</p>

<p>It would be thought a hard Government that should tax its People one-tenth Part of their <em>Time</em>, to be employed in its Service.  But <em>Idleness</em> taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is spent in absolute <em>Sloth</em>, or doing of nothing, with that which is spent in idle Employments or Amusements, that amount to nothing. <em>Sloth</em>, by bringing on Diseases, absolutely shortens Life. <em>Sloth, like Rust, consumes faster than Labor wears; while the used key is always bright, as Poor Richard says.  But dost thou love Life, then do not squander Time, for that's the stuff Life is made of, as Poor Richard</em> says. How much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep, forgetting that <em>The sleeping Fox catches no Poultry</em>, and that <em>There will be sleeping enough in the Grave</em>, as <em>Poor Richard</em> says.</p>

<p><em>If Time be of all Things the most precious, wasting Time must be, as Poor Richard</em> says, <em>the</em> <em>greatest Prodigality</em>; since, as he elsewhere tells us, <em>Lost Time is never found again; and what we call Time enough, always proves little enough</em>: Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the Purpose; so by Diligence shall we do more with less Perplexity.  <em>Sloth makes all Things difficult, but Industry all easy</em>, as <em>Poor Richard</em> says; and <em>He that riseth late must trot all Day, and shall scarce overtake his Business at Night; while Laziness travels so slowly, that Poverty soon overtakes him</em>, as we read in <em>Poor Richard</em>, who adds, <em>Drive thy Business, let not that drive thee</em>; and <em>Early to Bed, and early to rise, makes a Man healthy, wealthy, and wise.</em></p>

<p><em>Industry need not wish, and he that lives upon Hope will die fasting.</em></p>

<p><em>There are no Gains without Pains.</em></p>

<p><em>He that hath a Trade hath an Estate; and he that hath a Calling, hath an Office of Profit and Honor</em>; but then the <em>Trade</em> must be worked at, and the <em>Calling</em> well followed, or neither the <em>Estate</em> nor the <em>Office</em> will enable us to pay our Taxes.</p>

<p>What though you have found no Treasure, nor has any rich Relation left you a Legacy, <em>Diligence is the Mother of Good-luck</em>, as <em>Poor Richard</em> says, <em>and God gives all Things to Industry</em>.</p>

<p><em>One To-day is worth two To-morrows</em>, and farther, <em>Have you somewhat to do To-morrow, do it To-day</em>.</p>

<p>If you were a Servant, would you not be ashamed that a good Master should catch you idle? Are you then your own Master, <em>be ashamed to catch yourself idle</em>.</p>

<p>Stick to it steadily; and you will see great Effects, for <em>Constant Dropping wears away Stones</em>, and by <em>Diligence and Patience the Mouse ate in two the Cable</em>; and <em>Little Strokes fell great Oaks</em>.</p>

<p>Methinks I hear some of you say, <em>Must a Man afford himself no Leisure</em>? I will tell thee, my friend, what <em>Poor Richard</em> says, <em>Employ thy Time well, if thou meanest to gain Leisure; and, since thou art not sure of a Minute, throw not away an Hour</em>. Leisure, is Time for doing something useful; this Leisure the diligent Man will obtain, but the lazy Man never; so that, as <em>Poor Richard</em> says, <em>A Life of Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two things</em>.</p>

<p><em>Keep thy Shop, and thy Shop will keep thee</em>; and again, <em>If you would have your business done, go; if not, send.</em></p>

<p>If you would have a faithful Servant, and one that you like, serve yourself.</p>

<p><em>A little Neglect may breed great Mischief:</em> adding, <em>for want of a Nail the Shoe was lost; for want of a Shoe the Horse was lost; and for want of a Horse the Rider was lost, being overtaken and slain by the Enemy; all for the want of Care about a Horse-shoe Nail</em>.</p>

<p>So much for Industry, my Friends, and Attention to one's own Business; but to these we must add <em>Frugality</em>.</p>

<p><em>What maintains one Vice, would bring up two Children</em>. You may think perhaps, that a <em>little</em> Tea, or a <em>little</em> Punch now and then, Diet a <em>little</em> more costly, Clothes a <em>little</em> finer, and a <em>little</em> Entertainment now and then, can be no <em>great</em> Matter; but remember what <em>Poor Richard</em> says, <em>Many a Little makes a Mickle.</em></p>

<p><em>Beware of little expenses; A small Leak will sink a great Ship</em>; and again, <em>Who Dainties love, shall Beggars prove</em>; and moreover, <em>Fools make Feasts, and wise Men eat them.</em></p>

<p>Buy what thou hast no Need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy Necessaries.</p>

<p>If you would know the Value of Money, go and try to borrow some; for, he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing.</p>

<p>The second Vice is Lying, the first is running in Debt.</p>

<p><em>Lying rides upon Debt's Back</em>.</p>

<p>Poverty often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue: '<em>Tis hard for an empty Bag to stand upright</em>.</p>

<p>And now to conclude, <em>Experience keeps a dear School, but Fools will learn in no other, and scarce in that</em>; for it is true, <em>we may give Advice, but we cannot give Conduct</em>, as <em>Poor Richard</em> says: However, remember this, <em>They that won't be counseled, can't be helped</em>, as <em>Poor Richard</em> says: and farther, That <em>if you will not hear Reason, she'll surely rap your Knuckles</em>.</p>

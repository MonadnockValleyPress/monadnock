<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง16</h3>
<p>A criticism of the <em>Christian concept of God</em> leads inevitably to the same conclusion.&mdash;A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to its own god. In him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to survive, to its virtues&mdash;it projects its joy in itself, its feeling of power, into a being to whom one may offer thanks. He who is rich will give of his riches; a proud people need a god to whom they can make <em>sacrifices</em>.... Religion, within these limits, is a form of gratitude.  A man is grateful for his own existence: to that end he needs a god.&mdash;Such a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries; he must be able to play either friend or foe&mdash;he is wondered at for the good he does as well as for the evil he does. But the castration, against all nature, of such a god, making him a god of goodness alone, would be contrary to human inclination. Mankind has just as much need for an evil god as for a good god; it doesn't have to thank mere tolerance and humanitarianism for its own existence.... What would be the value of a god who knew nothing of anger, revenge, envy, scorn, cunning, violence? who had perhaps never experienced the rapturous <em>ardeurs</em> of victory and of destruction? No one would understand such a god: why should any one want him?&mdash;True enough, when a nation is on the downward path, when it feels its belief in its own future, its hope of freedom slipping from it, when it begins to see submission as a first necessity and the virtues of submission as measures of self-preservation, then it <em>must</em> overhaul its god. He then becomes a hypocrite, timorous and demure; he counsels "peace of soul," hate-no-more, leniency, "love" of friend and foe. He moralizes endlessly; he creeps into every private virtue; he becomes the god of every man; he becomes a private citizen, a cosmopolitan.... Formerly he represented a people, the strength of a people, everything aggressive and thirsty for power in the soul of a people; now he is simply <em>the good god</em>.... The truth is that there is no other alternative for gods: <em>either</em> they are the will to power&mdash;in which case they are national gods&mdash;<em>or</em> incapacity for power&mdash;in which case they have to be good....</p>

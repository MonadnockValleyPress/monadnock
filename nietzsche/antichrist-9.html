<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง9</h3>

People erect a concept of morality, of virtue, of holiness upon this false view of all things; they ground good conscience upon faulty vision; they argue that no <em>other</em> sort of vision has value any more, once they have made theirs sacrosanct with the names of "God," "salvation" and "eternity." I unearth this theological instinct in all directions: it is the most widespread and the most <em>subterranean</em> form of falsehood to be found on earth. Whatever a theologian regards as true <em>must</em> be false: there you have almost a criterion of truth. His profound instinct of self-preservation stands against truth ever coming into honour in any way, or even getting stated. Wherever the influence of theologians is felt there is a transvaluation of values, and the concepts "true" and "false" are forced to change places: whatever is most damaging to life is there called "true," and whatever exalts it, intensifies it, approves it, justifies it and makes it triumphant is there called "false."... When theologians, working through the "consciences" of princes (or of peoples&mdash;), stretch out their hands for <em>power</em>, there is never any doubt as to the fundamental issue: the will to make an end, the <em>nihilistic</em> will exerts that power....</p>

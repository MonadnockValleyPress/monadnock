<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง4</h3>
<p>Mankind surely does <em>not</em> represent an evolution toward a better or stronger or higher level, as progress is now understood. This "progress" is merely a modern idea, which is to say, a false idea. The European of today, in his essential worth, falls far below the European of the Renaissance; the process of evolution does <em>not</em> necessarily mean elevation, enhancement, strengthening.</p>
<p>True enough, it succeeds in isolated and individual cases in various parts of the earth and under the most widely different cultures, and in these cases a <em>higher</em> type certainly manifests itself; something which, compared to mankind in the mass, appears as a sort of superman. Such happy strokes of high success have always been possible, and will remain possible, perhaps, for all time to come. Even whole races, tribes and nations may occasionally represent such lucky accidents.</p>

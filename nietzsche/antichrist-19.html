<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง19</h3>
<p>The fact that the strong races of northern Europe did not repudiate this Christian god does little credit to their gift for religion&mdash;and not much more to their taste. They ought to have been able to make an end of such a moribund and worn-out product of the <em>d&eacute;cadence</em>. A curse lies upon them because they were not equal to it; they made illness, decrepitude and contradiction a part of their instincts&mdash;and since then they have not managed to <em>create</em> any more gods. Two thousand years have come and gone&mdash;and not a single new god! Instead, there still exists, and as if by some intrinsic right,&mdash;as if he were the <em>ultimatum</em> and <em>maximum</em> of the power to create gods, of the <em>creator spiritus</em> in mankind&mdash;this pitiful god of Christian monotono-theism! This hybrid image of decay, conjured up out of emptiness, contradiction and vain imagining, in which all the instincts of <em>d&eacute;cadence</em>, all the cowardices and wearinesses of the soul find their sanction!&mdash;</p>

<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง13</h3>
<p>Let us not underestimate this fact: that <em>we ourselves</em>, we free spirits, are already a "transvaluation of all values," a <em>visualized</em> declaration of war and victory against all the old concepts of "true" and "not true." The most valuable intuitions are the last to be attained; the most valuable of all are those which determine <em>methods</em>. All the methods, all the principles of the scientific spirit of today, were the targets for thousands of years of the most profound contempt; if a man inclined to them he was excluded from the society of "decent" people&mdash;he passed as "an enemy of God," as a scoffer at the truth, as one "possessed." As a man of science, he belonged to the Chandala .... We have had the whole pathetic stupidity of mankind against us&mdash;their every notion of what the truth <em>ought</em> to be, of what the service of the truth <em>ought</em> to be&mdash;their every "thou shalt" was launched against us.... Our objectives, our methods, our quiet, cautious, distrustful manner&mdash;all appeared to them as absolutely discreditable and contemptible.&mdash;Looking back, one may almost ask one's self with reason if it was not actually an <em>aesthetic</em> sense that kept men blind so long: what they demanded of the truth was picturesque effectiveness, and of the learned a strong appeal to their senses. It was our <em>modesty</em> that stood out longest against their taste.... How well they guessed that, these turkey-cocks of God!</p>

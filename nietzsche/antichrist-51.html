<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง51</h3>
<p>The fact that faith, under certain circumstances, may work for blessedness, but that this blessedness produced by an <em>id&eacute;e fixe</em> by no means makes the idea itself true, and the fact that faith actually moves no mountains, but instead <em>raises them up</em> where there were none before: all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through a <em>lunatic asylum</em>. <em>Not</em>, of course, to a priest: for his instincts prompt him to the lie that sickness is not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic asylums. Christianity finds sickness <em>necessary</em>, just as the Greek spirit had need of a superabundance of health&mdash;the actual ulterior purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is to <em>make</em> people ill. And the church itself&mdash;doesn't it set up a Catholic lunatic asylum as the ultimate ideal?&mdash;The whole earth as a madhouse?&mdash;The sort of religious man that the church <em>wants</em> is a typical <em>d&eacute;cadent</em>; the moment at which a religious crisis dominates a people is always marked by epidemics of nervous disorder; the "inner world" of the religious man is so much like the "inner world" of the overstrung and exhausted that it is difficult to distinguish between them; the "highest" states of mind, held up before mankind by Christianity as of supreme worth, are actually epileptoid in form&mdash;the church has granted the name of holy only to lunatics or to gigantic frauds <em>in majorem dei honorem</em>.... Once I ventured to designate the whole Christian system of <em>training</em> in penance and salvation (now best studied in England) as a method of producing a <em>folie circulaire</em> upon a soil already prepared for it, which is to say, a soil thoroughly unhealthy. Not every one may be a Christian: one is not "converted" to Christianity&mdash;one must first be sick enough for it.... We others, who have the <em>courage</em> for health <em>and</em> likewise for contempt,&mdash;we may well despise a religion that teaches misunderstanding of the body! that refuses to rid itself of the superstition about the soul! that makes a "virtue" of insufficient nourishment! that combats health as a sort of enemy, devil, temptation!  that persuades itself that it is possible to carry about a "perfect soul" in a cadaver of a body, and that, to this end, had to devise for itself a new concept of "perfection," a pale, sickly, idiotically ecstatic state of existence, so-called "holiness"&mdash;a holiness that is itself merely a series of symptoms of an impoverished, enervated and incurably disordered body!... The Christian movement, as a European movement, was from the start no more than a general uprising of all sorts of outcast and refuse elements (&mdash;who now, under cover of Christianity, aspire to power). It does <em>not</em> represent the decay of a race; it represents, on the contrary, a conglomeration of <em>d&eacute;cadence</em> products from all directions, crowding together and seeking one another out. It was <em>not</em>, as has been thought, the corruption of antiquity, of <em>noble</em> antiquity, which made Christianity possible; one cannot too sharply challenge the learned imbecility which today maintains that theory. At the time when the sick and rotten Chandala classes in the whole <em>imperium</em> were Christianized, the <em>contrary type</em>, the nobility, reached its finest and ripest development. The majority became master; democracy, with its Christian instincts, <em>triumphed</em>.... Christianity was not "national," it was not based on race&mdash;it appealed to all the varieties of men disinherited by life, it had its allies everywhere.  Christianity has the rancour of the sick at its very core&mdash;the instinct against the <em>healthy</em>, against <em>health</em>. Everything that is well-constituted, proud, gallant and, above all, beautiful gives offence to its ears and eyes. Again I remind you of Paul's priceless saying: "And God hath chosen the <em>weak</em> things of the world, the <em>foolish</em> things of the world, the <em>base</em> things of the world, and things which are <em>despised</em>": <em>this</em> was the formula; <em>in hoc signo</em> the <em>d&eacute;cadence</em> triumphed.&mdash;<em>God on the cross</em>&mdash;is man always to miss the frightful inner significance of this symbol?&mdash;Everything that suffers, everything that hangs on the cross, is <em>divine</em>.... We all hang on the cross, consequently <em>we</em> are divine.... We alone are divine....  Christianity was thus a victory: a nobler attitude of mind was destroyed by it&mdash;Christianity remains to this day the greatest misfortune of humanity.&mdash;</p>

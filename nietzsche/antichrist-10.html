<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง10</h3>
<p>Among Germans I am immediately understood when I say that theological blood is the ruin of philosophy. The Protestant pastor is the grandfather of German philosophy; Protestantism itself is its <em>peccatum originale</em>. Definition of Protestantism: hemiplegic paralysis of Christianity&mdash;<em>and</em> of reason.... One need only utter the words "T&uuml;bingen School" to get an understanding of what German philosophy is at bottom&mdash;a very artful form of theology.... The Suabians are the best liars in Germany; they lie innocently.... Why all the rejoicing over the appearance of Kant that went through the learned world of Germany, three-fourths of which is made up of the sons of preachers and teachers&mdash;why the German conviction still echoing, that with Kant came a change for the <em>better</em>? The theological instinct of German scholars made them see clearly just <em>what</em> had become possible again.... A backstairs leading to the old ideal stood open; the concept of the "true world," the concept of morality as the <em>essence</em> of the world (&mdash;the two most vicious errors that ever existed!), were once more, thanks to a subtle and wily scepticism, if not actually demonstrable, then <em>at least</em> no longer <em>refutable</em>.... <em>Reason</em>, the <em>prerogative</em> of reason, does not go so far.... Out of reality there had been made "appearance"; an absolutely false world, that of being, had been turned into reality.... The success of Kant is merely a theological success; he was, like Luther and Leibnitz, but one more impediment to German integrity, already far from steady.&mdash;</p>

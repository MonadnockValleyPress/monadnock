<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง37</h3>
<p>&mdash;Our age is proud of its historical sense: how, then, could it delude itself into believing that the <em>crude fable of the wonder-worker and Saviour</em> constituted the beginnings of Christianity&mdash;and that everything spiritual and symbolical in it only came later? Quite to the contrary, the whole history of Christianity&mdash;from the death on the cross onward&mdash;is the history of a progressively clumsier misunderstanding of an <em>original</em> symbolism. With every extension of Christianity among larger and ruder masses, even less capable of grasping the principles that gave birth to it, the need arose to make it more and more <em>vulgar</em> and <em>barbarous</em>&mdash;it absorbed the teachings and rites of all the <em>subterranean</em> cults of the <em>imperium Romanum</em>, and the absurdities engendered by all sorts of sickly reasoning. It was the fate of Christianity that its faith had to become as sickly, as low and as vulgar as the needs were sickly, low and vulgar to which it had to administer. A <em>sickly barbarism</em> finally lifts itself to power as the church&mdash;the church, that incarnation of deadly hostility to all honesty, to all loftiness of soul, to all discipline of the spirit, to all spontaneous and kindly humanity.&mdash;<em>Christian</em> values&mdash;<em>noble</em> values: it is only we, we <em>free</em> spirits, who have re-established this greatest of all antitheses in values!...</p>

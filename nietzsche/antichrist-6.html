<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง6</h3>
<p>It is a painful and tragic spectacle that rises before me: I have drawn back the curtain from the <em>rottenness</em> of man. This word, in my mouth, is at least free from one suspicion: that it involves a moral accusation against humanity. It is used&mdash;and I wish to emphasize the fact again&mdash;without any moral significance: and this is so far true that the rottenness I speak of is most apparent to me precisely in those quarters where there has been most aspiration, hitherto, toward "virtue" and "godliness." As you probably surmise, I understand rottenness in the sense of <em>d&eacute;cadence</em>: my argument is that all the values on which mankind now fixes its highest aspirations are <em>d&eacute;cadence</em>-values.</p>
<p>I call an animal, a species, an individual corrupt, when it loses its instincts, when it chooses, when it <em>prefers</em>, what is injurious to it.  A history of the "higher feelings," the "ideals of humanity"&mdash;and it is possible that I'll have to write it&mdash;would almost explain why man is so degenerate. Life itself appears to me as an instinct for growth, for survival, for the accumulation of forces, for <em>power</em>: whenever the will to power fails there is disaster. My contention is that all the highest values of humanity have been emptied of this will&mdash;that the values of <em>d&eacute;cadence</em>, of <em>nihilism</em>, now prevail under the holiest names.</p>

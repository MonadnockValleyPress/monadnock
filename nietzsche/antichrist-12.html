<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง12</h3>
<p>I put aside a few sceptics, the types of decency in the history of philosophy: the rest haven't the slightest conception of intellectual integrity. They behave like women, all these great enthusiasts and prodigies&mdash;they regard "beautiful feelings" as arguments, the "heaving breast" as the bellows of divine inspiration, conviction as the <em>criterion</em> of truth. In the end, with "German" innocence, Kant tried to give a scientific flavour to this form of corruption, this dearth of intellectual conscience, by calling it "practical reason." He deliberately invented a variety of reasons for use on occasions when it was desirable not to trouble with reason&mdash;that is, when morality, when the sublime command "thou shalt," was heard. When one recalls the fact that, among all peoples, the philosopher is no more than a development from the old type of priest, this inheritance from the priest, this <em>fraud upon self</em>, ceases to be remarkable. When a man feels that he has a divine mission, say to lift up, to save or to liberate mankind&mdash;when a man feels the divine spark in his heart and believes that he is the mouthpiece of supernatural imperatives&mdash;when such a mission inflames him, it is only natural that he should stand beyond all merely reasonable standards of judgment. He feels that he is <em>himself</em> sanctified by this mission, that he is himself a type of a higher order!... What has a priest to do with philosophy! He stands far above it!&mdash;And hitherto the priest has <em>ruled</em>!&mdash;He has determined the meaning of "true" and "not true"!...</p>

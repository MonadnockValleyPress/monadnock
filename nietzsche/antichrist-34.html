<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง34</h3>
<p>If I understand anything at all about this great symbolist, it is this: that he regarded only <em>subjective</em> realities as realities, as "truths"&mdash;that he saw everything else, everything natural, temporal, spatial and historical, merely as signs, as materials for parables. The concept of "the Son of God" does not connote a concrete person in history, an isolated and definite individual, but an "eternal" fact, a psychological symbol set free from the concept of time. The same thing is true, and in the highest sense, of the <em>God</em> of this typical symbolist, of the "kingdom of God," and of the "sonship of God." Nothing could be more un-Christian than the <em>crude ecclesiastical</em> notions of God as a <em>person</em>, of a "kingdom of God" that is to come, of a "kingdom of heaven" beyond, and of a "son of God" as the <em>second person</em> of the Trinity. All this&mdash;if I may be forgiven the phrase&mdash;is like thrusting one's fist into the eye (and what an eye!) of the Gospels: a disrespect for symbols amounting to <em>world-historical cynicism</em>.... But it is nevertheless obvious enough what is meant by the symbols "Father" and "Son"&mdash;not, of course, to every one&mdash;: the word "Son" expresses <em>entrance</em> into the feeling that there is a general transformation of all things (beatitude), and "Father" expresses <em>that feeling itself</em>&mdash;the sensation of eternity and of perfection.&mdash;I am ashamed to remind you of what the church has made of this symbolism: has it not set an Amphitryon story at the threshold of the Christian "faith"? And a dogma of "immaculate conception" for good measure?... <em>And thereby it has robbed conception of its immaculateness</em>&mdash;</p>
<p>The "kingdom of heaven" is a state of the heart&mdash;not something to come "beyond the world" or "after death." The whole idea of natural death is <em>absent</em> from the Gospels: death is not a bridge, not a passing; it is absent because it belongs to a quite different, a merely apparent world, useful only as a symbol. The "hour of death" is <em>not</em> a Christian idea&mdash;"hours," time, the physical life and its crises have no existence for the bearer of "glad tidings."... The "kingdom of God" is not something that men wait for: it had no yesterday and no day after tomorrow, it is not going to come at a "millennium"&mdash;it is an experience of the heart, it is everywhere and it is nowhere....</p>

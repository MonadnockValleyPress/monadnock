<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง53</h3>
<p>&mdash;It is so little true that <em>martyrs</em> offer any support to the truth of a cause that I am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything to do with the truth at all. In the very tone in which a martyr flings what he fancies to be true at the head of the world there appears so low a grade of intellectual honesty and such <em>insensibility</em> to the problem of "truth," that it is never necessary to refute him. Truth is not something that one man has and another man has not: at best, only peasants, or peasant-apostles like Luther, can think of truth in any such way. One may rest assured that the greater the degree of a man's intellectual conscience the greater will be his modesty, his <em>discretion</em>, on this point. To <em>know</em> in five cases, and to refuse, with delicacy, to know anything <em>further</em>.... "Truth," as the word is understood by every prophet, every sectarian, every free-thinker, every Socialist and every churchman, is simply a complete proof that not even a beginning has been made in the intellectual discipline and self-control that are necessary to the unearthing of even the smallest truth.&mdash;The deaths of the martyrs, it may be said in passing, have been misfortunes of history: they have <em>misled</em>.... The conclusion that all idiots, women and plebeians come to, that there must be something in a cause for which any one goes to his death (or which, as under primitive Christianity, sets off epidemics of death-seeking)&mdash;this conclusion has been an unspeakable drag upon the testing of facts, upon the whole spirit of inquiry and investigation. The martyrs have <em>damaged</em> the truth.... Even to this day the crude fact of persecution is enough to give an honourable name to the most empty sort of sectarianism.&mdash;But why? Is the worth of a cause altered by the fact that some one had laid down his life for it?&mdash;An error that becomes honourable is simply an error that has acquired one seductive charm the more: do you suppose, Messrs. Theologians, that we shall give you the chance to be martyred for your lies?&mdash;One best disposes of a cause by respectfully putting it on ice&mdash;that is also the best way to dispose of theologians.... This was precisely the world-historical stupidity of all the persecutors: that they gave the appearance of honour to the cause they opposed&mdash;that they made it a present of the fascination of martyrdom.... Women are still on their knees before an error because they have been told that some one died on the cross for it. <em>Is the cross, then, an argument?</em>&mdash;But about all these things there is one, and one only, who has said what has been needed for thousands of years&mdash;<em>Zarathustra</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They made signs in blood along the way that they went, and their folly taught them that the truth is proved by blood.</p>
<p>But blood is the worst of all testimonies to the truth; blood poisoneth even the purest teaching and turneth it into madness and hatred in the heart.</p>
<p>And when one goeth through fire for his teaching&mdash;what doth that prove?  Verily, it is more when one's teaching cometh out of one's own burning!</p>

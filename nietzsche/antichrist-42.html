<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง42</h3>
<p>One now begins to see just <em>what</em> it was that came to an end with the death on the cross: a new and thoroughly original effort to found a Buddhistic peace movement, and so establish <em>happiness on earth</em>&mdash;real, <em>not</em> merely promised. For this remains&mdash;as I have already pointed out&mdash;the essential difference between the two religions of <em>d&eacute;cadence</em>: Buddhism promises nothing, but actually fulfils; Christianity promises everything, but <em>fulfils nothing</em>.&mdash;Hard upon the heels of the "glad tidings" came the worst imaginable: those of Paul. In Paul is incarnated the very opposite of the "bearer of glad tidings"; he represents the genius for hatred, the vision of hatred, the relentless logic of hatred.  <em>What</em>, indeed, has not this dysangelist sacrificed to hatred! Above all, the Saviour: he nailed him to <em>his own</em> cross. The life, the example, the teaching, the death of Christ, the meaning and the law of the whole gospels&mdash;nothing was left of all this after that counterfeiter in hatred had reduced it to his uses. Surely <em>not</em> reality; surely <em>not</em> historical truth!... Once more the priestly instinct of the Jew perpetrated the same old master crime against history&mdash;he simply struck out the yesterday and the day before yesterday of Christianity, and <em>invented his own history of Christian beginnings</em>. Going further, he treated the history of Israel to another falsification, so that it became a mere prologue to <em>his</em> achievement: all the prophets, it now appeared, had referred to <em>his</em> "Saviour."... Later on the church even falsified the history of man in order to make it a prologue to Christianity.... The figure of the Saviour, his teaching, his way of life, his death, the meaning of his death, even the consequences of his death&mdash;nothing remained untouched, nothing remained in even remote contact with reality. Paul simply shifted the centre of gravity of that whole life to a place <em>behind</em> this existence&mdash;in the <em>lie</em> of the "risen" Jesus. At bottom, he had no use for the life of the Saviour&mdash;what he needed was the death on the cross, <em>and</em> something more. To see anything honest in such a man as Paul, whose home was at the centre of the Stoical enlightenment, when he converts an hallucination into a <em>proof</em> of the resurrection of the Saviour, or even to believe his tale that he suffered from this hallucination himself&mdash;this would be a genuine <em>niaiserie</em> in a psychologist. Paul willed the end; <em>therefore</em> he also willed the means.... What he himself didn't believe was swallowed readily enough by the idiots among whom he spread <em>his</em> teaching.&mdash;What <em>he</em> wanted was power; in Paul the priest once more reached out for power&mdash;he had use only for such concepts, teachings and symbols as served the purpose of tyrannizing over the masses and organizing mobs. <em>What</em> was the only part of Christianity that Mohammed borrowed later on? Paul's invention, his device for establishing priestly tyranny and organizing the mob: the belief in the immortality of the soul&mdash;<em>that is to say, the doctrine of "judgment"</em>....</p>

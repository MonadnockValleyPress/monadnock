<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง29</h3>
<p>What concerns <em>me</em> is the psychological type of the Saviour. This type might be depicted in the Gospels, in however mutilated a form and however much overladen with extraneous characters&mdash;that is, in <em>spite</em> of the Gospels; just as the figure of Francis of Assisi shows itself in his legends in spite of his legends. It is <em>not</em> a question of mere truthful evidence as to what he did, what he said and how he actually died; the question is, whether his type is still conceivable, whether it has been handed down to us.&mdash;All the attempts that I know of to read the <em>history</em> of a "soul" in the Gospels seem to me to reveal only a lamentable psychological levity. M. Renan, that mountebank <em>in psychologicus</em>, has contributed the two most <em>unseemly</em> notions to this business of explaining the type of Jesus: the notion of the <em>genius</em> and that of the <em>hero</em> ("<em>h&eacute;ros</em>"). But if there is anything essentially unevangelical, it is surely the concept of the hero. What the Gospels make instinctive is precisely the reverse of all heroic struggle, of all taste for conflict: the very incapacity for resistance is here converted into something moral: ("resist not evil!"&mdash;the most profound sentence in the Gospels, perhaps the true key to them), to wit, the blessedness of peace, of gentleness, the <em>inability</em> to be an enemy.  What is the meaning of "glad tidings"?&mdash;The true life, the life eternal has been found&mdash;it is not merely promised, it is here, it is in <em>you</em>; it is the life that lies in love free from all retreats and exclusions, from all keeping of distances. Every one is the child of God&mdash;Jesus claims nothing for himself alone&mdash;as the child of God each man is the equal of every other man.... Imagine making Jesus a <em>hero</em>!&mdash;And what a tremendous misunderstanding appears in the word "genius"! Our whole conception of the "spiritual," the whole conception of our civilization, could have had no meaning in the world that Jesus lived in. In the strict sense of the physiologist, a quite different word ought to be used here.... We all know that there is a morbid sensibility of the tactile nerves which causes those suffering from it to recoil from every touch, and from every effort to grasp a solid object. Brought to its logical conclusion, such a physiological <em>habitus</em> becomes an instinctive hatred of all reality, a flight into the "intangible," into the "incomprehensible"; a distaste for all formulae, for all conceptions of time and space, for everything established&mdash;customs, institutions, the church&mdash;; a feeling of being at home in a world in which no sort of reality survives, a merely "inner" world, a "true" world, an "eternal" world.... "The Kingdom of God is within <em>you</em>"....</p>

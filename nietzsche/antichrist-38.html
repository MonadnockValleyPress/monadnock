<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง38</h3>
<p>&mdash;I cannot, at this place, avoid a sigh. There are days when I am visited by a feeling blacker than the blackest melancholy&mdash;<em>contempt of man</em>. Let me leave no doubt as to <em>what</em> I despise, <em>whom</em> I despise: it is the man of today, the man with whom I am unhappily contemporaneous. The man of today&mdash;I am suffocated by his foul breath!... Toward the past, like all who understand, I am full of tolerance, which is to say, <em>generous</em> self-control: with gloomy caution I pass through whole millenniums of this madhouse of a world, call it "Christianity," "Christian faith" or the "Christian church," as you will&mdash;I take care not to hold mankind responsible for its lunacies. But my feeling changes and breaks out irresistibly the moment I enter modern times, <em>our</em> times. Our age <em>knows better</em>.... What was formerly merely sickly now becomes indecent&mdash;it is indecent to be a Christian today.  <em>And here my disgust begins.</em>&mdash;I look about me: not a word survives of what was once called "truth"; we can no longer bear to hear a priest pronounce the word. Even a man who makes the most modest pretensions to integrity <em>must</em> know that a theologian, a priest, a pope of today not only errs when he speaks, but actually <em>lies</em>&mdash;and that he no longer escapes blame for his lie through "innocence" or "ignorance." The priest knows, as every one knows, that there is no longer any "God," or any "sinner," or any "Saviour"&mdash;that "free will" and the "moral order of the world" are lies&mdash;: serious reflection, the profound self-conquest of the spirit, <em>allow</em> no man to pretend that he does <em>not</em> know it.... <em>All</em> the ideas of the church are now recognized for what they are&mdash;as the worst counterfeits in existence, invented to debase nature and all natural values; the priest himself is seen as he actually is&mdash;as the most dangerous form of parasite, as the venomous spider of creation....  We know, our <em>conscience</em> now knows&mdash;just <em>what</em> the real value of all those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and <em>what ends they have served</em>, with their debasement of humanity to a state of self-pollution, the very sight of which excites loathing,&mdash;the concepts "the other world," "the last judgment," "the immortality of the soul," the "soul" itself: they are all merely so many instruments of torture, systems of cruelty, whereby the priest becomes master and remains master.... Every one knows this, <em>but nevertheless things remain as before</em>. What has become of the last trace of decent feeling, of self-respect, when our statesmen, otherwise an unconventional class of men and thoroughly anti-Christian in their acts, now call themselves Christians and go to the communion-table?... A prince at the head of his armies, magnificent as the expression of the egoism and arrogance of his people&mdash;and yet acknowledging, <em>without</em> any shame, that he is a Christian!... Whom, then, does Christianity deny? <em>what</em> does it call "the world"? To be a <em>soldier</em>, to be a judge, to be a patriot; to defend one's self; to be careful of one's honour; to desire one's own advantage; to be <em>proud</em> ... every act of everyday, every instinct, every valuation that shows itself in a <em>deed</em>, is now anti-Christian: what a <em>monster of falsehood</em> the modern man must be to call himself nevertheless, and <em>without</em> shame, a Christian!&mdash;</p>

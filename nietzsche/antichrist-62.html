<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง62</h3>
<p>&mdash;With this I come to a conclusion and pronounce my judgment. I <em>condemn</em> Christianity; I bring against the Christian church the most terrible of all the accusations that an accuser has ever had in his mouth. It is, to me, the greatest of all imaginable corruptions; it seeks to work the ultimate corruption, the worst possible corruption.  The Christian church has left nothing untouched by its depravity; it has turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and every integrity into baseness of soul. Let any one dare to speak to me of its "humanitarian" blessings! Its deepest necessities range it against any effort to abolish distress; it lives by distress; it <em>creates</em> distress to make <em>itself</em> immortal.... For example, the worm of sin: it was the church that first enriched mankind with this misery!&mdash;The "equality of souls before God"&mdash;this fraud, this <em>pretext</em> for the <em>rancunes</em> of all the base-minded&mdash;this explosive concept, ending in revolution, the modern idea, and the notion of overthrowing the whole social order&mdash;this is <em>Christian</em> dynamite.... The "humanitarian" blessings of Christianity forsooth! To breed out of <em>humanitas</em> a self-contradiction, an art of self-pollution, a will to lie at any price, an aversion and contempt for all good and honest instincts! All this, to me, is the "humanitarianism" of Christianity!&mdash;Parasitism as the <em>only</em> practice of the church; with its an&aelig;mic and "holy" ideals, sucking all the blood, all the love, all the hope out of life; the beyond as the will to deny all reality; the cross as the distinguishing mark of the most subterranean conspiracy ever heard of,&mdash;against health, beauty, well-being, intellect, <em>kindness</em> of soul&mdash;<em>against life itself</em>....</p> 
<p>This eternal accusation against Christianity I shall write upon all walls, wherever walls are to be found&mdash;I have letters that even the blind will be able to see.... I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and <em>small</em> enough,&mdash;I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race....</p> 
<p>And mankind reckons <em>time</em> from the <em>dies nefastus</em> when this fatality befell&mdash;from the <em>first</em> day of Christianity!&mdash;<em>Why not rather from its last?</em>&mdash;<em>From today?</em>&mdash;The transvaluation of all values!...</p>
<p>THE END</p>

<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง35</h3>
<p>This "bearer of glad tidings" died as he lived and <em>taught</em>&mdash;<em>not</em> to "save mankind," but to show mankind how to live. It was a <em>way of life</em> that he bequeathed to man: his demeanour before the judges, before the officers, before his accusers&mdash;his demeanour on the <em>cross</em>. He does not resist; he does not defend his rights; he makes no effort to ward off the most extreme penalty&mdash;more, <em>he invites it</em>.... And he prays, suffers and loves <em>with</em> those, <em>in</em> those, who do him evil.... <em>Not</em> to defend one's self, <em>not</em> to show anger, <em>not</em> to lay blames.... On the contrary, to submit even to the Evil One&mdash;to <em>love</em> him....</p>

<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง48</h3>
<p>&mdash;Has any one ever clearly understood the celebrated story at the beginning of the Bible&mdash;of God's mortal terror of <em>science</em>?... No one, in fact, has understood it. This priest-book <em>par excellence</em> opens, as is fitting, with the great inner difficulty of the priest: <em>he</em> faces only one great danger; <em>ergo</em>, "God" faces only one great danger.&mdash;</p>
<p>The old God, wholly "spirit," wholly the high-priest, wholly perfect, is promenading his garden: he is bored and trying to kill time. Against boredom even gods struggle in vain. What does he do? He creates man&mdash;man is entertaining.... But then he notices that man is also bored.  God's pity for the only form of distress that invades all paradises knows no bounds: so he forthwith creates other animals. God's first mistake: to man these other animals were not entertaining&mdash;he sought dominion over them; he did not want to be an "animal" himself.&mdash;So God created woman. In the act he brought boredom to an end&mdash;and also many other things! Woman was the <em>second</em> mistake of God.&mdash;"Woman, at bottom, is a serpent, Heva"&mdash;every priest knows that; "from woman comes every evil in the world"&mdash;every priest knows that, too. <em>Ergo</em>, she is also to blame for <em>science</em>.... It was through woman that man learned to taste of the tree of knowledge.&mdash;What happened? The old God was seized by mortal terror. Man himself had been his <em>greatest</em> blunder; he had created a rival to himself; science makes men <em>godlike</em>&mdash;it is all up with priests and gods when man becomes scientific!&mdash;<em>Moral</em>: science is the forbidden <em>per se</em>; it alone is forbidden. Science is the <em>first</em> of sins, the germ of all sins, the <em>original</em> sin. <em>This is all there is of morality.</em>&mdash;"Thou shall <em>not</em> know":&mdash;the rest follows from that.&mdash;God's mortal terror, however, did not hinder him from being shrewd. How is one to <em>protect</em> one's self against science? For a long while this was the capital problem. Answer: Out of paradise with man! Happiness, leisure, foster thought&mdash;and all thoughts are bad thoughts!&mdash;Man <em>must</em> not think.&mdash;And so the priest invents distress, death, the mortal dangers of childbirth, all sorts of misery, old age, decrepitude, above all, <em>sickness</em>&mdash;nothing but devices for making war on science! The troubles of man don't <em>allow</em> him to think.... Nevertheless&mdash;how terrible!&mdash;, the edifice of knowledge begins to tower aloft, invading heaven, shadowing the gods&mdash;what is to be done?&mdash;The old God invents <em>war</em>; he separates the peoples; he makes men destroy one another (&mdash;the priests have always had need of war....). War&mdash;among other things, a great disturber of science!&mdash;Incredible! Knowledge, <em>deliverance from the priests</em>, prospers in spite of war.&mdash;So the old God comes to his final resolution: "Man has become scientific&mdash;<em>there is no help for it: he must be drowned!</em>"...</p>

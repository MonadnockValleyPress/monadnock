<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง36</h3>
<p>&mdash;We free spirits&mdash;we are the first to have the necessary prerequisite to understanding what nineteen centuries have misunderstood&mdash;that instinct and passion for integrity which makes war upon the "holy lie" even more than upon all other lies.... Mankind was unspeakably far from our benevolent and cautious neutrality, from that discipline of the spirit which alone makes possible the solution of such strange and subtle things: what men always sought, with shameless egoism, was their <em>own</em> advantage therein; they created the <em>church</em> out of denial of the Gospels....</p>
<p>Whoever sought for signs of an ironical divinity's hand in the great drama of existence would find no small indication thereof in the <em>stupendous question-mark</em> that is called Christianity. That mankind should be on its knees before the very antithesis of what was the origin, the meaning and the <em>law</em> of the Gospels&mdash;that in the concept of the "church" the very things should be pronounced holy that the "bearer of glad tidings" regards as <em>beneath</em> him and <em>behind</em> him&mdash;it would be impossible to surpass this as a grand example of <em>world-historical irony</em>&mdash;</p>

<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง39</h3>
<p>&mdash;I shall go back a bit, and tell you the <em>authentic</em> history of Christianity.&mdash;The very word "Christianity" is a misunderstanding&mdash;at bottom there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross. The "Gospels" <em>died</em> on the cross. What, from that moment onward, was called the "Gospels" was the very reverse of what <em>he</em> had lived: "bad tidings," a <em>Dysangelium</em>. It is an error amounting to nonsensicality to see in "faith," and particularly in faith in salvation through Christ, the distinguishing mark of the Christian: only the Christian <em>way of life</em>, the life <em>lived</em> by him who died on the cross, is Christian.... To this day <em>such</em> a life is still possible, and for <em>certain</em> men even necessary: genuine, primitive Christianity will remain possible in all ages.... <em>Not</em> faith, but acts; above all, an <em>avoidance</em> of acts, a different <em>state of being</em>.... States of consciousness, faith of a sort, the acceptance, for example, of anything as true&mdash;as every psychologist knows, the value of these things is perfectly indifferent and fifth-rate compared to that of the instincts: strictly speaking, the whole concept of intellectual causality is false.  To reduce being a Christian, the state of Christianity, to an acceptance of truth, to a mere phenomenon of consciousness, is to formulate the negation of Christianity. <em>In fact, there are no Christians.</em> The "Christian"&mdash;he who for two thousand years has passed as a Christian&mdash;is simply a psychological self-delusion. Closely examined, it appears that, <em>despite</em> all his "faith," he has been ruled <em>only</em> by his instincts&mdash;and <em>what instincts</em>!&mdash;In all ages&mdash;for example, in the case of Luther&mdash;"faith" has been no more than a cloak, a pretense, a <em>curtain</em> behind which the instincts have played their game&mdash;a shrewd <em>blindness</em> to the domination of <em>certain</em> of the instincts.... I have already called "faith" the specially Christian form of <em>shrewdness</em>&mdash;people always <em>talk</em> of their "faith" and <em>act</em> according to their instincts.... In the world of ideas of the Christian there is nothing that so much as touches reality: on the contrary, one recognizes an instinctive <em>hatred</em> of reality as the motive power, the only motive power at the bottom of Christianity. What follows therefrom? That even here, in <em>psychologicis</em>, there is a radical error, which is to say one conditioning fundamentals, which is to say, one in <em>substance</em>. Take away one idea and put a genuine reality in its place&mdash;and the whole of Christianity crumbles to nothingness!&mdash;Viewed calmly, this strangest of all phenomena, a religion not only depending on errors, but inventive and ingenious <em>only</em> in devising injurious errors, poisonous to life and to the heart&mdash;this remains a <em>spectacle for the gods</em>&mdash;for those gods who are also philosophers, and whom I have encountered, for example, in the celebrated dialogues at Naxos. At the moment when their <em>disgust</em> leaves them (&mdash;and us!) they will be thankful for the spectacle afforded by the Christians: perhaps because of <em>this</em> curious exhibition alone the wretched little planet called the earth deserves a glance from omnipotence, a show of divine interest.... Therefore, let us not underestimate the Christians: the Christian, false <em>to the point of innocence</em>, is far above the ape&mdash;in its application to the Christians a well-known theory of descent becomes a mere piece of politeness....</p>

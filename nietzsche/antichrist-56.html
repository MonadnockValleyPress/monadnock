<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง56</h3>
<p>&mdash;In the last analysis it comes to this: what is the <em>end</em> of lying? The fact that, in Christianity, "holy" ends are not visible is <em>my</em> objection to the means it employs. Only <em>bad</em> ends appear: the poisoning, the calumniation, the denial of life, the despising of the body, the degradation and self-contamination of man by the concept of sin&mdash;<em>therefore</em>, its means are also bad.&mdash;I have a contrary feeling when I read the Code of Manu, an incomparably more intellectual and superior work, which it would be a sin against the <em>intelligence</em> to so much as <em>name</em> in the same breath with the Bible. It is easy to see why: there is a genuine philosophy behind it, <em>in</em> it, not merely an evil-smelling mess of Jewish rabbinism and superstition,&mdash;it gives even the most fastidious psychologist something to sink his teeth into. And, <em>not</em> to forget what is most important, it differs fundamentally from every kind of Bible: by means of it the <em>nobles</em>, the philosophers and the warriors keep the whip-hand over the majority; it is full of noble valuations, it shows a feeling of perfection, an acceptance of life, and triumphant feeling toward self and life&mdash;the <em>sun</em> shines upon the whole book.&mdash;All the things on which Christianity vents its fathomless vulgarity&mdash;for example, procreation, women and marriage&mdash;are here handled earnestly, with reverence and with love and confidence. How can any one really put into the hands of children and ladies a book which contains such vile things as this: "to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband; ... it is better to marry than to burn"? And is it <em>possible</em> to be a Christian so long as the origin of man is Christianized, which is to say, <em>befouled</em>, by the doctrine of the <em>immaculata conceptio</em>?... I know of no book in which so many delicate and kindly things are said of women as in the Code of Manu; these old grey-beards and saints have a way of being gallant to women that it would be impossible, perhaps, to surpass. "The mouth of a woman," it says in one place, "the breasts of a maiden, the prayer of a child and the smoke of sacrifice are always pure." In another place: "there is nothing purer than the light of the sun, the shadow cast by a cow, air, water, fire and the breath of a maiden." Finally, in still another place&mdash;perhaps this is also a holy lie&mdash;: "all the orifices of the body above the navel are pure, and all below are impure. Only in the maiden is the whole body pure."</p>

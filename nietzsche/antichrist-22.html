<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง22</h3>
<p>When Christianity departed from its native soil, that of the lowest orders, the <em>underworld</em> of the ancient world, and began seeking power among barbarian peoples, it no longer had to deal with <em>exhausted</em> men, but with men still inwardly savage and capable of self-torture&mdash;in brief, strong men, but bungled men. Here, unlike in the case of the Buddhists, the cause of discontent with self, suffering through self, is <em>not</em> merely a general sensitiveness and susceptibility to pain, but, on the contrary, an inordinate thirst for inflicting pain on others, a tendency to obtain subjective satisfaction in hostile deeds and ideas.  Christianity had to embrace <em>barbaric</em> concepts and valuations in order to obtain mastery over barbarians: of such sort, for example, are the sacrifices of the first-born, the drinking of blood as a sacrament, the disdain of the intellect and of culture; torture in all its forms, whether bodily or not; the whole pomp of the cult. Buddhism is a religion for peoples in a further state of development, for races that have become kind, gentle and over-spiritualized (&mdash;Europe is not yet ripe for it&mdash;): it is a summons that takes them back to peace and cheerfulness, to a careful rationing of the spirit, to a certain hardening of the body. Christianity aims at mastering <em>beasts of prey</em>; its modus operandi is to make them <em>ill</em>&mdash;to make feeble is the Christian recipe for taming, for "<em>civilizing</em>." Buddhism is a religion for the closing, over-wearied stages of civilization. Christianity appears before civilization has so much as begun&mdash;under certain circumstances it lays the very foundations thereof.</p>

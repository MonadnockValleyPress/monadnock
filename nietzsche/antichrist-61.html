<h1>The Antichrist</h1>
<h2>by Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
<h3>ยง61</h3>
<p>Here it becomes necessary to call up a memory that must be a hundred times more painful to Germans. The Germans have destroyed for Europe the last great harvest of civilization that Europe was ever to reap&mdash;the <em>Renaissance</em>. Is it understood at last, <em>will</em> it ever be understood, <em>what</em> the Renaissance was? <em>The transvaluation of Christian values</em>,&mdash;an attempt with all available means, all instincts and all the resources of genius to bring about a triumph of the <em>opposite</em> values, the more <em>noble</em> values.... This has been the one great war of the past; there has never been a more critical question than that of the Renaissance&mdash;it is <em>my</em> question too&mdash;; there has never been a form of <em>attack</em> more fundamental, more direct, or more violently delivered by a whole front upon the center of the enemy! To attack at the critical place, at the very seat of Christianity, and there enthrone the more noble values&mdash;that is to say, to <em>insinuate</em> them into the instincts, into the most fundamental needs and appetites of those sitting there....  I see before me the <em>possibility</em> of a perfectly heavenly enchantment and spectacle:&mdash;it seems to me to scintillate with all the vibrations of a fine and delicate beauty, and within it there is an art so divine, so infernally divine, that one might search in vain for thousands of years for another such possibility; I see a spectacle so rich in significance and at the same time so wonderfully full of paradox that it should arouse all the gods on Olympus to immortal laughter&mdash;<em>C&aelig;sar Borgia as pope!</em>... Am I understood?... Well then, <em>that</em> would have been the sort of triumph that <em>I</em> alone am longing for today&mdash;: by it Christianity would have been <em>swept away</em>!&mdash;What happened? A German monk, Luther, came to Rome. This monk, with all the vengeful instincts of an unsuccessful priest in him, raised a rebellion <em>against</em> the Renaissance in Rome.... Instead of grasping, with profound thanksgiving, the miracle that had taken place: the conquest of Christianity at its <em>capital</em>&mdash;instead of this, his hatred was stimulated by the spectacle. A religious man thinks only of himself.&mdash;Luther saw only the <em>depravity</em> of the papacy at the very moment when the opposite was becoming apparent: the old corruption, the <em>peccatum originale</em>, Christianity itself, no longer occupied the papal chair! Instead there was life! Instead there was the triumph of life!  Instead there was a great yea to all lofty, beautiful and daring things!... And Luther <em>restored the church</em>: he attacked it.... The Renaissance&mdash;an event without meaning, a great futility!&mdash;Ah, these Germans, what they have not cost us! <em>Futility</em>&mdash;that has always been the work of the Germans.&mdash;The Reformation; Leibnitz; Kant and so-called German philosophy; the war of "liberation"; the empire&mdash;every time a futile substitute for something that once existed, for something <em>irrecoverable</em>.... These Germans, I confess, are my enemies: I despise all their uncleanliness in concept and valuation, their cowardice before every honest yea and nay. For nearly a thousand years they have tangled and confused everything their fingers have touched; they have on their conscience all the half-way measures, all the three-eighths-way measures, that Europe is sick of,&mdash;they also have on their conscience the uncleanest variety of Christianity that exists, and the most incurable and indestructible&mdash;Protestantism.... If mankind never manages to get rid of Christianity the <em>Germans</em> will be to blame....</p>

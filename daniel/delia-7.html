<h1>The Delia Sonnets</h1>
<h2>by Samuel Daniel</h2>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p>
For had she not been fair and thus unkind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then had no finger pointed at my lightness;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world had never known what I do find,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And clouds obscure had shaded still her brightness.<br/>
Then had no censor's eye these lines surveyed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor graver brows have judged my Muse so vain;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No sun my blush and error had bewrayed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet the world had heard of such disdain.<br/>
Then had I walked with bold erected face;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No downcast look had signified my miss;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But my degraded hopes with such disgrace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did force me groan out griefs and utter this.<br/>
For being full, should I not then have spoken,<br/>
My sense oppressed had failed and heart had broken.<br/>

<h1>The Delia Sonnets</h1>
<h2>by Samuel Daniel</h2>
<h3>XLIV</h3>
<p>
Read in my face a volume of despairs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wailing Iliads of my tragic woe;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn with my blood, and painted with my cares,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrought by her hand that I have honoured so.<br/>
Who whilst I burn, she sings at my soul's wrack,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking aloft from turret of her pride;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There my soul's tyrant joys her in the sack<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her own seat, whereof I made her guide.<br/>
There do these smokes that from affliction rise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve as an incense to a cruel dame;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sacrifice thrice-grateful to her eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because their power serves to exact the same.<br/>
Thus ruins she to satisfy her will,<br/>
The temple where her name was honoured still.<br/>

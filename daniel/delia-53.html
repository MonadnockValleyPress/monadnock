<h1>The Delia Sonnets</h1>
<h2>by Samuel Daniel</h2>
<h3>LIII</h3>
<p>
As to the Roman that would free his land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His error was his honour and renown;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And more the fame of his mistaking hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than if he had the tyrant overthrown.<br/>
So Delia, hath mine error made me known,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my deceived attempt deserved more fame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than if I had the victory mine own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy hard heart had yielded up the same.<br/>
And so likewise renowned is thy blame;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy cruelty, thy glory; O strange case,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That errors should be graced that merit shame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sin of frowns bring honour to the face.<br/>
Yet happy Delia that thou wast unkind,<br/>
Though happier far, if thou would'st change thy mind.<br/>

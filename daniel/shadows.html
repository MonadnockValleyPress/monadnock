<h1>Are They Shadows</h1>
<h2>by Samuel Daniel</h2>
<p>
Are they shadows that we see?<br/>
And can shadows pleasure give?<br/>
Pleasures only shadows be<br/>
Cast by bodies we conceive<br/>
And are made the things we deem<br/>
In those figures which they seem.
</p>
<p>
But these pleasures vanish fast<br/>
Which by shadows are expressed;<br/>
Pleasures are not, if they last;<br/>
In their passing is their best.<br/>
Glory is most bright and gay<br/>
In a flash, and so away.
</p>
<p>
Feed apace then, greedy eyes,<br/>
On the wonder you behold;<br/>
Take it sudden as it flies,<br/>
Though you take it not to hold.<br/>
When your eyes have done their part,<br/>
Thought must length it in the heart.

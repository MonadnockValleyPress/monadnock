<h1>The Grassehopper</h1>
<h2>by Richard Lovelace</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
Oh thou, that swing'st upon the waving eare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some well-filled oaten beard,<br/>
Drunk ev'ry night with a delicious teare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropt thee from Heav'n, where now th'art reard.<br/>
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
The joyes of earth and ayre are thine intire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That with thy feet and wings dost hop and flye;<br/>
And when thy poppy workes, thou dost retire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To thy carv'd acorn-bed to lye.<br/>
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
Up with the day, the Sun thou welcomst then,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sportst in the guilt plats of his beames,<br/>
And all these merry dayes mak'st merry men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy selfe, and melancholy streames.<br/>
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
But ah, the sickle! golden eares are cropt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CERES and BACCHUS bid good-night;<br/>
Sharpe frosty fingers all your flowrs have topt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And what sithes spar'd, winds shave off quite.<br/>
</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>
Poore verdant foole! and now green ice, thy joys<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Large and as lasting as thy peirch of grasse,<br/>
Bid us lay in 'gainst winter raine, and poize<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their flouds with an o'erflowing glasse.<br/>
</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p>
Thou best of men and friends? we will create<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A genuine summer in each others breast;<br/>
And spite of this cold Time and frosen Fate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thaw us a warme seate to our rest.<br/>
</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>
Our sacred harthes shall burne eternally<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As vestal flames; the North-wind, he<br/>
Shall strike his frost-stretch'd winges, dissolve and flye<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This Aetna in epitome.<br/>
</p>
<h3>VIII.</h3>
<p>
Dropping December shall come weeping in,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bewayle th' usurping of his raigne;<br/>
But when in show'rs of old Greeke we beginne,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall crie, he hath his crowne againe!<br/>
</p>
<h3>IX.</h3>
<p>
Night as cleare Hesper shall our tapers whip<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the light casements, where we play,<br/>
And the darke hagge from her black mantle strip,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sticke there everlasting day.<br/>
</p>
<h3>X.</h3>
<p>
Thus richer then untempted kings are we,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That asking nothing, nothing need:<br/>
Though lord of all what seas imbrace, yet he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That wants himselfe, is poore indeed.<br/>

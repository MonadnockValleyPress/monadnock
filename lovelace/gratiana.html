<h1>Gratiana Dauncing and Singing</h1>
<h2>by Richard Lovelace</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
See! with what constant motion<br/>
Even and glorious, as the sunne,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gratiana steeres that noble frame,<br/>
Soft as her breast, sweet as her voyce,<br/>
That gave each winding law and poyze,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And swifter then the wings of Fame.<br/>
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
She beat the happy pavement<br/>
By such a starre-made firmament,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which now no more the roofe envies;<br/>
But swells up high with Atlas ev'n,<br/>
Bearing the brighter, nobler Heav'n,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in her, all the Dieties.<br/>
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
Each step trod out a lovers thought<br/>
And the ambitious hopes he brought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chain'd to her brave feet with such arts,<br/>
Such sweet command and gentle awe,<br/>
As when she ceas'd, we sighing saw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The floore lay pav'd with broken hearts.<br/>
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
So did she move: so did she sing:<br/>
Like the harmonious spheres that bring<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto their rounds their musick's ayd;<br/>
Which she performed such a way,<br/>
As all th' inamour'd world will say:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Graces daunced, and Apollo play'd.<br/>

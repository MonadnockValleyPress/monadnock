<h1>To Ellinda, Upon His Late Recovery</h1>
<h2>by Richard Lovelace</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
How I grieve that I am well!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All my health was in my sicknes,<br/>
Go then, Destiny, and tell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Very death is in this quicknes.<br/>
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
Such a fate rules over me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I glory when I languish,<br/>
And do blesse the remedy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That doth feed, not quench my anguish.<br/>
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
'Twas a gentle warmth that ceas'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vizard of a feavor;<br/>
But I feare now I am eas'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the flames, since I must leave her.<br/>
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
Joyes, though witherd, circled me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When unto her voice inurèd<br/>
Like those who, by harmony,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only can be throughly curèd.<br/>
</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>
Sweet, sure, was that malady,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the pleasant angel hover'd,<br/>
Which ceasing they are all, as I,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Angry that they are recover'd.<br/>
</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p>
And as men in hospitals,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That are maim'd, are lodg'd and dinèd;<br/>
But when once their danger fals,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah th' are healèd to be pinèd!<br/>
</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>
Fainting so, I might before<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime have the leave to hand her,<br/>
But lusty, am beat out of dore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for Love compell'd to wander.<br/>

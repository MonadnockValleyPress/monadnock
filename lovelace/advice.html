<h1>Advice to My Best Brother</h1>
<h2>by Richard Lovelace</h2>
<p>
Frank, wil't live unhandsomely? trust not too far<br/>
Thy self to waving seas: for what thy star,<br/>
Calculated by sure event, must be,<br/>
Look in the glassy-epithete, and see.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet settle here your rest, and take your state,<br/>
And in calm halcyon's nest ev'n build your fate;<br/>
Prethee lye down securely, Frank, and keep<br/>
With as much no noyse the inconstant deep<br/>
As its inhabitants; nay, stedfast stand,<br/>
As if discover'd were a New-found-land,<br/>
Fit for plantation here. Dream, dream still,<br/>
Lull'd in Dione's cradle; dream, untill<br/>
Horrour awake your sense, and you now find<br/>
Your self a bubbled pastime for the wind;<br/>
And in loose Thetis blankets torn and tost.<br/>
Frank, to undo thy self why art at cost?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor be too confident, fix'd on the shore:<br/>
For even that too borrows from the store<br/>
Of her rich neighbour, since now wisest know<br/>
(And this to Galileo's judgement ow),<br/>
The palsie earth it self is every jot<br/>
As frail, inconstant, waveing, as that blot<br/>
We lay upon the deep, that sometimes lies<br/>
Chang'd, you would think, with 's botoms properties;<br/>
But this eternal, strange Ixion's wheel<br/>
Of giddy earth ne'er whirling leaves to reel,<br/>
Till all things are inverted, till they are<br/>
Turn'd to that antick confus'd state they were.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Who loves the golden mean, doth safely want<br/>
A cobwebb'd cot and wrongs entail'd upon't;<br/>
He richly needs a pallace for to breed<br/>
Vipers and moths, that on their feeder feed;<br/>
The toy that we (too true) a mistress call,<br/>
Whose looking-glass and feather weighs up all;<br/>
And cloaths which larks would play with in the sun,<br/>
That mock him in the night, when 's course is run.<br/>
</p>
<p>
To rear an edifice by art so high,<br/>
That envy should not reach it with her eye,<br/>
Nay, with a thought come neer it. Wouldst thou know,<br/>
How such a structure should be raisd, build low.<br/>
The blust'ring winds invisible rough stroak<br/>
More often shakes the stubborn'st, prop'rest oak;<br/>
And in proud turrets we behold withal,<br/>
'Tis the imperial top declines to fall:<br/>
Nor does Heav'n's lightning strike the humble vales,<br/>
But high-aspiring mounts batters and scales.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A breast of proof defies all shocks of Fate,<br/>
Fears in the best, hopes in the worser state;<br/>
Heaven forbid that, as of old, time ever<br/>
Flourish'd in spring so contrary, now never.<br/>
That mighty breath, which blew foul Winter hither,<br/>
Can eas'ly puffe it to a fairer weather.<br/>
Why dost despair then, Frank? Aeolus has<br/>
A Zephyrus as well as Boreas.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Tis a false sequel, soloecisme 'gainst those<br/>
Precepts by fortune giv'n us, to suppose<br/>
That, 'cause it is now ill, 't will ere be so;<br/>
Apollo doth not always bend his bow;<br/>
But oft, uncrowned of his beams divine,<br/>
With his soft harp awakes the sleeping Nine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In strictest things magnanimous appear,<br/>
Greater in hope, howere thy fate, then fear:<br/>
Draw all your sails in quickly, though no storm<br/>
Threaten your ruine with a sad alarm;<br/>
For tell me how they differ, tell me, pray,<br/>
A cloudy tempest and a too fair day?<br/>

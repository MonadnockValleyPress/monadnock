<h1>The Westerner</h1>
<h2>by Badger Clark (1919)</h2>

<p>
My fathers sleep on the sunrise plains,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And each one sleeps alone.<br/>
Their trails may dim to the grass and rains,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I choose to make my own.<br/>
I lay proud claim to their blood and name,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I lean on no dead kin;<br/>
My name is mine, for the praise or scorn,<br/>
And the world began when I was born<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world is mine to win.
</p>
<p>
They built high towns on their old log sills,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the great, slow rivers gleamed,<br/>
But with new, live rock from the savage hills<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll build as they only dreamed.<br/>
The smoke scarce dies where the trail camp lies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the rails glint down the pass;<br/>
The desert springs into fruit and wheat<br/>
And I lay the stones of a solid street<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over yesterday's untrod grass.
</p>
<p>
I waste no thought on my neighbor's birth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the way he makes his prayer.<br/>
I grant him a white man's room on earth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If his game is only square.<br/>
While he plays it straight I'll call him mate;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If he cheats I drop him flat.<br/>
Old class and rank are a wornout lie,<br/>
For all clean men are as good as I,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a king is only that.
</p>
<p>
I dream no dreams of a nurse-maid state<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That will spoon me out my food.<br/>
A stout heart sings in the fray with fate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shock and sweat are good.<br/>
From noon to noon all the earthly boon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I ask my God to spare<br/>
Is a little daily bread in store,<br/>
With the room to fight the strong for more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the weak shall get their share.
</p>
<p>
The sunrise plains are a tender haze<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sunset seas are gray,<br/>
But I stand here, where the bright skies blaze<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over me and the big today.<br/>
What good to me is a vague "may be"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a mournful "might have been,"<br/>
For the sun wheels swift from morn to morn<br/>
And the world began when I was born<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world is mine to win.

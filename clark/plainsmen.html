<h1>The Plainsmen</h1>
<h2>by Badger Clark (1919)</h2>

<p>
Men of the older, gentler soil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Loving the things that their fathers wrought<br/>
Worn old fields of their fathers' toil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarred old hills where their fathers fought<br/>
Loving their land for each ancient trace,<br/>
Like a mother dear for her wrinkled face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as they never can understand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The way we have loved you, young, young land!
</p>
<p>
Born of a free, world-wandering race,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Little we yearned o'er an oft-turned sod.<br/>
What did we care for the fathers' place,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Having ours fresh from the hand of God?<br/>
Who feared the strangeness or wiles of you<br/>
When from the unreckoned miles of you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrilling the wind with a sweet command,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth unto youth called, young, young land?
</p>
<p>
North, where the hurrying seasons changed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over great gray plains where the trails lay long,<br/>
Free as the sweeping Chinook we ranged,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting our days to a saddle song.<br/>
Through the icy challenge you flung to us,<br/>
Through your shy Spring kisses that clung to us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Following far as the rainbow spanned,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiercely we wooed you, young, young land!
</p>
<p>
South, where the sullen black mountains guard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitless, shimmering lands of the sun,<br/>
Over blinding trails where the hoofs rang hard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing or cursing, we rode and won.<br/>
Drunk with the virgin white fire of you,<br/>
Hotter than thirst was desire of you;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight in our faces you burned your brand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Marking your chosen ones, young, young land.
</p>
<p>
When did we long for the sheltered gloom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the older game with its cautious odds?<br/>
Gloried we always in sun and room,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending our strength like the younger gods.<br/>
By the wild sweet ardor that ran in us,<br/>
By the pain that tested the man in us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shadowy springs and the glaring sand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You were our true-love, young, young land.
</p>
<p>
When the last free trail is a prim, fenced lane<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And our graves grow weeds through forgetful Mays,<br/>
Richer and statelier then you'll reign,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother of men whom the world will praise.<br/>
And your sons will love you and sigh for you,<br/>
Labor and battle and die for you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But never the fondest will understand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The way we have loved you, young, young land.

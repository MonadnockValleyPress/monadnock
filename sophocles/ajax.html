<p>SCENE &mdash; Tents of Aias on the shore, near Ilion; a low underwood in the background; and the sea seen in the distance.</p>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
[Speaking as from the sky, unseen by Odysseus.]<br/>
I see thee, son of Lartios, ever more<br/>
Seeking to seize some moment of attack<br/>
Against thy foes; and now, I find thee here,<br/>
Where by the ships the tents of Aias rise,<br/>
(His ranks the last in order,) hunting out<br/>
And measuring the steps but newly stamped,<br/>
That thou may'st see if he is now within,<br/>
Or stays without. And thou art onward led,<br/>
As by the scent of keen Laconian hound;<br/>
For there, within, the man may now be found,<br/>
With drops of sweat on head and slaughtering hands;<br/>
And thou no longer needest so to peer<br/>
Within the gate; but tell me why thou show'st<br/>
Such zeal, that thou may'st learn from one who knows.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Ο voice, of all Divine Ones dear to me,<br/>
Athena's, clear, though Thou remain unseen,<br/>
I hear thy speech, and catch it in my soul<br/>
As though it were some bronze Tyrsenian trump;<br/>
And now full clear Thou saw'st me wheeling round<br/>
My steps against a man I count my foe,<br/>
Aias, the bearer of the mighty shield.<br/>
For he it is, and no one else, that I<br/>
Long while have tracked; for he this very night<br/>
Hath wrought a work mysterious, if indeed<br/>
'Tis he hath done it, for as yet we know<br/>
Nought clearly, but are wandering in our search.<br/>
And I of my free will have yoked myself<br/>
To bear this toil; for 'twas but now we found<br/>
Our captured flocks destroyed, by man's hand slain,<br/>
And with them too the guardians of the herd;<br/>
And every one imputes the deed to him;<br/>
And then a scout, who saw him there alone,<br/>
The fields o'erleaping with a blood-stained sword,<br/>
Told me, and showed it all. And I forthwith<br/>
Rush on his track; and now in part I guess<br/>
By signs and tokens, and in part am struck<br/>
With sore amaze, and learn not where he is.<br/>
And now Thou comest here most seasonably,<br/>
For I, in all things past or yet to come,<br/>
Am guided by the wisdom of thine hand.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
I knew it, Ο Odysseus, and I came,<br/>
Long since, a ready helper in thy hunt.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
And I, dear Mistress, do I toil aright?<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Know this, the deeds were done by this man's hand.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
To what rash purpose stretched he forth his hand?<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Vexed sore about the great Achilles' arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
But why this raid upon our flocks and herds?<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
He thinks it is your blood that stains his hand.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
What? Was his purpose against Argives aimed?<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
And he had done it, had I failed to watch.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Whence came this daring mood, this rashness wild?<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
'Gainst you, by night, alone, with guile he sallies.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
What? Did he come, and reach his destined spot?<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Yea, at the gates of the two chiefs he stood.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
And what restrained the hand that craved for blood?<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
I held him back from that accursed joy,<br/>
Casting strange glamour o'er his wandering eyes,<br/>
And turned him on the flocks, and where with them<br/>
The herds of captured oxen press in crowds,<br/>
Not yet divided. And on these he falls,<br/>
And wrought fell slaughter of the horned kine,<br/>
Smiting all round; and now it seemed to him<br/>
That he did slay the Atreidæ with his hand,<br/>
Now this, now that, of other generals.<br/>
And I still urged the wild and moon-struck man<br/>
With fresh access of madness, and I cast<br/>
An evil net around him. After this,<br/>
When he had ceased that slaughter, binding fast<br/>
The oxen that still lived, and all the flocks,<br/>
He leads them to his dwelling, counting them<br/>
No troop of horned cattle, but of men;<br/>
And now within he flouts his prisoners.<br/>
And I will show thee this disease full clear,<br/>
That thou may'st see and tell the Argives all.<br/>
But stay thou here, and fear not; think thou not<br/>
The man will prove an evil chance to thee;<br/>
For I will turn his eyes' clear sight aside,<br/>
And keep them back from looking on thy face.<br/>
Ho there, [To Aias,] I bid thee come, who bindest now<br/>
The captive bands with fetters. Thee I call,<br/>
Ο Aias: forward, to thy dwelling's front.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
What dost thou, Ο Athena? Call him not.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Wilt not be still, and 'scape the coward's shame?<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Nay, by the Gods! but let him stay within.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
What dost thou fear? Was he not strong before?<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Always my foe, and more so now than ever.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Is it not sweetest scorn to scorn our foes?<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Enough for me that this man stays within.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Dost fear so much to see a madman's face?<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Nay, were he sane, I should not shun him then.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Though thou be near, he will not see thee now.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
How so, if he the same eyes has to see?<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Know, I will darken even clearest eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
When a God worketh, all is possible.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Hush, then, and stay where now thou tak'st thy stand.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
I'll stay then; yet I fain would be away.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
[To Aias.] Ho, there, Ο Aias, once again I call.<br/>
Why honourest thou so little thine ally?<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Aias from his tent, with a blood-stained scourge in his hand.</p>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Hail, Ο Athena, hail, Ο child of Zeus!<br/>
Well art Thou come, and I with golden spoils<br/>
Will deck thy shrine for this my glorious raid.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Thou speakest well. But tell me this, I pray,<br/>
Is thy sword red with blood of Argive host?<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Well may I boast, and I deny it not.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Did'st thou against the Atreidæ arm thy hand?<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Yea. Nevermore shall they do Aias wrong.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
The men are dead, if I thy meaning catch.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Yea, dead; now let them carry off my arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
So be it; but that son of Lartios,<br/>
What is his plight? Has he escaped thy hand?<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
That scoundrel fox! Dost ask me where he is?<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
E'en so. I mean Odysseus, thy chief foe.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
He, Ο my Mistress, sits a prisoner there,<br/>
My choicest spoil. I seek not yet his death.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
What wilt thou do first, what advantage gain?<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
First he, bound to the pillar in the court. . . .<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
What ill wilt thou on that poor wretch inflict?<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
. . . His back all bleeding with the scourge, shall die.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Do not, I pray, such outrage wreak on him.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
In other things, Athena, have thy way:<br/>
But he this penalty, nought else, shall pay.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Since this thy joy then, to it with a will:<br/>
Spare not a jot of all thy soul desires.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
I go to work. And Thou, I charge Thee, still<br/>
Be with me, helper true, as now Thou art.<br/>
</p>
<p>[Goes back to his tent.]</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Thou see'st, Odysseus, all the might of Gods,<br/>
How great it is. Whom found'st thou than this man<br/>
With keener foresight, or with better gifts,<br/>
To do what seemed most fitting for the time?<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
I know of no man, and I pity him,<br/>
So wretched now, although mine enemy,<br/>
So tied and harnessed to an evil fate,<br/>
And thinking that it touches me as well;<br/>
For this I see, that we, all we that live,<br/>
Are but vain phantoms, shadows fleeting fast.<br/>
</p>
<p>ATHENA</p>
<p>
Do thou, then, seeing this, refrain thy tongue<br/>
From any lofty speech against the Gods,<br/>
Nor boast thyself, though thou excel in strength<br/>
Or weight of stored-up wealth. All human things<br/>
A day lays low, a day lifts up again;<br/>
But still the Gods love those of ordered soul,<br/>
And hate the evil.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
I am full glad, Ο son of Telamon,<br/>
Whose island home is sea-girt Salamis,<br/>
When all is well with thee;<br/>
But when the stroke of Zeus, or evil speech<br/>
Of all the Danai comes on thee full fierce,<br/>
Then have I great dismay,<br/>
And, like a fluttering dove, look on in fear;<br/>
For lo! this night just o'er,<br/>
Great clamours vex our souls,<br/>
Sprung from the evil bruit<br/>
That thou, upon the plain where all our steeds<br/>
Leap wildly to and fro,<br/>
Rushing, hast slain the Danai's spoil of flocks,<br/>
All that was left them, taken by the spear,<br/>
With sharp and glittering steel.<br/>
Such whispered words of guile<br/>
Odysseus into all men's ears doth pour,<br/>
And men believe his speech;<br/>
For now he speaks what is too credible,<br/>
And he who hears rejoiceth more and more<br/>
[Than he who told the tale,]<br/>
Mocking at these thy woes.<br/>
For if one take his aim at lofty souls<br/>
He scarce can miss his mark;<br/>
But one who should at me his slander dart,<br/>
Would fail to gain belief;<br/>
For envy ever dogs the great man's steps;<br/>
Yet men of low estate,<br/>
Apart from mightier ones,<br/>
Are but poor towers of strength.<br/>
Still with the great the mean man prospers best,<br/>
And by the small the great maintains his cause;<br/>
But those, the fools and blind,<br/>
'Tis vain to teach by words.<br/>
By such as these thou art beclamoured now,<br/>
And we can nought avail,<br/>
Apart from thee, Ο king, to ward the blow.<br/>
But, since they dread thine eye, like wild birds' flock<br/>
Fluttered with fear at sight of eagle strong,<br/>
Perchance, should'st thou confront them suddenly,<br/>
They, hushed and dumb, would crouch.<br/>
</p>
<p>Strophe</p>
<p>
Was it that Artemis, the child of Zeus,<br/>
Before whose Tauric altar bleed the bulls,<br/>
(O rumour terrible! Ο source of shame!)<br/>
Had sped thee forth against the people's herds,<br/>
The oxen, shared of all?<br/>
Was it for victory that brought no fruit?<br/>
Or was She robbed of glorious spoils of war?<br/>
Was it for stricken deer<br/>
She gained no votive gifts?<br/>
Or Enyalios, in his coat of mail,<br/>
Did he find cause of blame,<br/>
As sharing war with thee,<br/>
And so revenged his wrong<br/>
In stratagems of night?<br/>
</p>
<p>Antistrophe</p>
<p>
For never yet, Ο son of Telamon,<br/>
Had'st thou so wandered from thy reason's path,<br/>
Falling on flocks and herds;<br/>
By will of Gods, perchance, the evil comes;<br/>
But, Zeus and Phœbos, turn,<br/>
Turn ye aside the Argives' tale of shame!<br/>
But if the mighty kings with subtle craft<br/>
Forge idle tales of thee,<br/>
Or he who draws his birth<br/>
From that pernicious stock of Sisyphos,<br/>
Bear not, oh, bear not, king,<br/>
That tale of foulest shame,<br/>
Still looking idly thus<br/>
Upon thy sea-washed tents.<br/>
</p>
<p>Epode</p>
<p>
But rise from this thy seat, where all too long<br/>
*Thou stay'st, in rest that brings the ills of strife,<br/>
Fresh kindling Heaven's fierce wrath;<br/>
And so the haughtiness of those thy foes<br/>
Speeds on unshrinking as in forest glades<br/>
Where the wind gently blows,<br/>
While all, with chattering tongues,<br/>
Speak words of woe and shame,<br/>
And sorrow dwells with me.<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Tecmessa from the tent.</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ο ye who comrades sailed in Aias' ship,<br/>
Sprung from the ancient race<br/>
Who claim the old Erectheus as their sire,<br/>
We, who afar from home<br/>
Watch over him, yon child of Telamon,<br/>
Have sorrows in good store;<br/>
For now the dread, the great, the mighty one,<br/>
Aias, with tempest wild, lies smitten sore.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
What change hath night then brought<br/>
*From fair and prosperous state?<br/>
Child of Teleutas old, of Phrygia,<br/>
Speak thou, and tell thy tale;<br/>
For mighty Aias loves and honours thee,<br/>
His captive and his bride:<br/>
Thou wilt not speak as one that knoweth not.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
How shall I speak what is unspeakable?<br/>
For thou wilt learn a sorrow sharp as death:<br/>
Our Aias, noble, brave,<br/>
His soul to madness stung,<br/>
Was brought to shame this night.<br/>
Such slaughter wrought by him,<br/>
His victims dripping blood,<br/>
May'st thou behold i' the tent.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Ah, what the news thou bring'st<br/>
Of him the fiery one,<br/>
Intolerable, and yet inevitable,<br/>
By the great Danai's chiefs spread far and wide,<br/>
Which rumour magnifies.<br/>
Ah me! the fate that cometh on I fear;<br/>
Our chief will die the gazing-stock of all,<br/>
Having, with frenzied hand<br/>
And dark and glittering sword,<br/>
Slaughtered the oxen's herd<br/>
And those that kept the steeds.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ah me! Thence, thence he came,<br/>
Bringing the flock in chains;<br/>
Of part upon the ground he cut the throats,<br/>
Part asunder he smote,<br/>
Through the chine cleaving them:<br/>
And taking two white-footed rams,<br/>
From one he cuts the head,<br/>
And tears out its tongue from the roots;<br/>
And one to a column he binds,<br/>
And seizing a driver's rein,<br/>
He smites with shrill re-echoing, doubled thong,<br/>
Venting vile words of shame,<br/>
Which God, not man, had taught.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Now is it time one should hide<br/>
One's face in the shrouding veil,<br/>
And stealthily creep out of sight,<br/>
Or sitting on swift rower's bench,<br/>
Give way to the sea-crossing ship;<br/>
Such are the threats the Atreidæ ply in their wrath,<br/>
And I fear, lest smitten with him,<br/>
Whom a terrible fate holds fast,<br/>
I suffer, like him, stoned to death.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
'Tis so no more; for like the wild south-west,<br/>
Without the lightning's flash,<br/>
He now is lulled to rest;<br/>
And now, in his right mind,<br/>
New form of grief is his;<br/>
For to look out on ills that are one's own,<br/>
In which another's hand has had no share,<br/>
This bringeth sharpest woe.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
If he has rest he sure will prosper well.<br/>
Slight count we make of ills already gone.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Which would'st thou choose, if one should give thee choice,<br/>
Or vexing friends, thyself to feel delight,<br/>
Or sharing common griefs to mourn with them?<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
The double evil, lady, is the worse.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
We then, though mad no longer, suffer more.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
How say'st thou this? I know not what thou say'st.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
That man, when he was in his dire disease,<br/>
Himself rejoiced in all the ills he did,<br/>
But vexed our souls that reason still obeyed;<br/>
But now, when lulled and calmed from that attack,<br/>
He is sore haunted with a troublous grief,<br/>
And we with him are suffering nothing less.<br/>
Have we not here a twofold ill for one?<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
I own it also, and I fear lest stroke<br/>
Smite him from God. How else, if he, though cured,<br/>
Is just as far from joy as when diseased?<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
So stands it, and 'tis right that thou should'st know.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
How did the evil first swoop down on him?<br/>
Tell it to us who grieve at thy mischance.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Thou shalt learn all, as one who shares our woe;<br/>
For he, at dead of night, when evening's lamps<br/>
No longer burnt, his two-edged sword in hand,<br/>
Sought to go out along the lonely paths;<br/>
And 1 rebuke him, saying, "What is this<br/>
Thou dost, Ο Aias? Why unbidden go<br/>
On this emprise, nor by the heralds called,<br/>
Nor hearing voice of trump? Lo! all the host<br/>
Is sleeping sound." And he, with fewest words,<br/>
The well-worn saw, made answer, "Woman, know<br/>
That silence is a woman's noblest part."<br/>
And, heaving this, I ceased. Then he alone<br/>
Rushed forth, and what passed there I cannot tell:<br/>
But then he came within, and brought with him<br/>
Oxen, and shepherd-dogs, and fleecy flocks.<br/>
Some he beheaded, some he clove in twain,<br/>
Cutting their throats, and some, fast bound in chains,<br/>
He mocked, as they were men, upon the flocks<br/>
Venting his fury; and, at last, he rushed<br/>
Out through the door, and with a phantom there<br/>
He bandied words, against the Atreidæ some,<br/>
And some against Odysseus, laughing much<br/>
That he had paid them to the full in scorn;<br/>
And thence once more within the tent he leapt,<br/>
And, long while after, scarce regains his sense.<br/>
And when he saw the tent with slaughter filled,<br/>
He smote his head and groaned: and, falling down,<br/>
He sat among the fallen carcases<br/>
Of that great slaughter of the flocks and herds,<br/>
Tearing his hair by handfuls with his nails.<br/>
And for a long, long time, he speechless sat;<br/>
And then with those dread words he threatened me,<br/>
Unless I told him all the woeful chance,<br/>
And asked me of the plight in which he stood;<br/>
And I, my friends, in terror told him all,<br/>
All that I knew of all that he had done.<br/>
And he forthwith cried out a bitter cry,<br/>
Such as till now I never heard from him;<br/>
For ever did he hold such loud lament,<br/>
Sure sign of one with coward heart and base;<br/>
And holding back from shrill and wailing cries,<br/>
Would groan with deep, low muttering, like a bull:<br/>
But now, thus fallen on an evil chance,<br/>
Tasting nor food, nor drink, among the herds<br/>
Slain with the sword, he sits in silent calm,<br/>
And looks like one on some dire mischief bent.<br/>
[Such are the words he utters, such his grief.]<br/>
But ye, my friends, (for therefore came I forth,)<br/>
Come in, and give us help, if help ye can,<br/>
For men like him still yield to words of friends.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Dread things, Tecmessa, old Teleutas' child,<br/>
Thou tell'st us, that our chief is mad with woe.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
[Within the tent.] Woe, woe is me!<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Yet more, 'twould seem; or heard ye not the cry<br/>
Which Aias just now uttered?<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
[Within.] Woe is me!<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Our chief, it seems, is either frenzied now,<br/>
Or grieving o'er the frenzies of the past.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
[Within.] My son, my son!<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ah wretched me! he calls, Eurysakes,<br/>
For thee. What means he? Where art thou? Ah me!<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
[Within.] I call for Teucros. Will he evermore<br/>
Go forth to spoil while I am perishing?<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
He now seems calm enough. But ope the door;<br/>
Perchance some sense of shame may come on him,<br/>
Seeing even me.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
[Throwing the tent door open, and disclosing<br/>
Aias sitting with carcases of sheep and oxen<br/>
round him.] Behold I open it,<br/>
And thou may'st see his deeds, and how he fares.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Ah, sailor friends! alone of all my friends,<br/>
Alone abiding in your steadfast law,<br/>
Behold how great a surge of blood-flecked foam<br/>
Now whirls around me.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
[To Tecmessa.] Ah me! Thou dost too true a witness bear:<br/>
His deeds show clearly that his sense is gone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Aias, Ο race, well versed in all the sailor's art,<br/>
Who camest, plying still the seaman's oar,<br/>
Thee, thee alone I see as help in grief;<br/>
Yet . . . . kill me, kill, I pray.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Hush! speak not so, nor, curing ill with ill,<br/>
Make sorrow's weight yet greater than it is.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Me, the bold, the brave-hearted,<br/>
Fearless in fight with the foe,<br/>
Thou see'st me show the prowess of mine hand<br/>
On beasts unformidable.<br/>
Ah! woe is me for the shame,<br/>
The scorn that falls on me.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ah, my lord Aias, speak not thus, I pray.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Away with thee! What? Wilt thou not withdraw?<br/>
Ai! ai!<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Oh! by the Gods, give way, and be advised.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Ah! woe is me, who let the cursed ones<br/>
Slip from my hands, and falling on the herds<br/>
Of horned oxen, and those noble flocks,<br/>
Shed their dark gore.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Why dost thou grieve at what is gone and past?<br/>
These things are so, and cannot be undone.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Ο thou whose eye sees all things evermore,<br/>
Tool of all evil, child of Lartios,<br/>
Of all the host the foulest scoundrel-knave,<br/>
Surely thou laughest much in thy delight.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
It is through God that man or laughs or mourns.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Would I could see him, smitten as I am.<br/>
Ah me! ah me!<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Speak nothing vauntingly.<br/>
Dost thou not see what evil plight thou'rt in?<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Ο Zeus! great Father of my sires of old,<br/>
Would that I might destroy<br/>
That crafty, scoundrel foe,<br/>
And those two kings that reign in partnership,<br/>
And then myself might die.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
When thou pray'st this, pray that I die with thee:<br/>
What profits it to live, when thou art dead?<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Ο dark, that art my light,<br/>
Ο gloom to me most clear,<br/>
Take me, yea, take me as your habitant:<br/>
Take me, for neither to the race of Gods,<br/>
Nor yet of men enduring but a day<br/>
Can I, as worthy, look<br/>
For any help in need.<br/>
But She, the child of Zeus,<br/>
Goddess of mightiest power,<br/>
Mocks at me unto death;<br/>
Where from her presence 'scape,<br/>
Where wandering shall I dwell?<br/>
*Ah, friends! if all things fail,<br/>
*For me, and those most near,<br/>
And we a dream pursue,<br/>
Then should the host, as spear by both hands swayed,<br/>
Smite me with one fell stroke.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ah! wretched me! that one so good should speak<br/>
Such words, which once he had not dared to think!<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Ο ye paths of the wave!<br/>
Ο ye caves by the sea!<br/>
Ο thou glade by the shore!<br/>
Long time, long time my feet<br/>
On Troïa's soil ye kept;<br/>
But never, never more<br/>
Breathing the breath of life;<br/>
Let the wise hear and heed.<br/>
Ο streams, Scamandros' streams<br/>
Hard by, to Argives kind,<br/>
Never again shall ye see<br/>
This man who calls to you now,<br/>
Like whom . . . (though great the vaunt,<br/>
Yet will I speak it out)<br/>
In all the army that from Hellas came,<br/>
Troïa no hero found:<br/>
Yet now I lie in this dishonoured plight.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
I know not how to check thee in thy speech,<br/>
Nor yet permit it, whelmed in ills like these.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Ai! ai! who e'er had dreamt my name should be<br/>
So clear a sign and symbol for my woe?<br/>
For now 'tis mine to groan this "Ai, ai" forth,<br/>
Twice, yea, and thrice, such ills have come on me,<br/>
Whose father, head of all the conquering host,<br/>
Brought the chief trophies from fair Ida's shore,<br/>
And home returned, with highest glory crowned;<br/>
And I, his son, to that same Troïa come<br/>
With no less power, nor working with my hands<br/>
Less mighty deeds, am left to perish here,<br/>
Dishonoured by the Argives: yet I think<br/>
I know thus much, that had Achilles lived<br/>
To give his arms as prize of valiant deeds,<br/>
No one would then have seized them in my stead.<br/>
But now the Atreidæ got them for a man<br/>
Crafty in soul, and this my strength despised;<br/>
And were it not my eyes and mind had rushed<br/>
Wildly away from will, they had not lived<br/>
To give their votes against another man.<br/>
But now the virgin child of Zeus, with eyes<br/>
Of fearful brightness, when I stretched my hands<br/>
Against them, sent a frenzied madness on me,<br/>
So that I stained my hands with these poor beasts;<br/>
And they, escaped in safety, mock at me:<br/>
Not with my will was this, but if a God<br/>
Should smite, the worse may 'scape the better man.<br/>
And now what course is right for me, to whom<br/>
The Gods are clearly foes, and all the host<br/>
Of Hellas hates me, and these outspread plains<br/>
And Troïa are mine enemies? Shall I,<br/>
Quitting my seat and sea-side anchorage,<br/>
Leave the Atreidæ by themselves alone,<br/>
And cross the Ægæan waters to my home?<br/>
But then, how shall I look him in the face,<br/>
My father Telamon? How will he bear<br/>
To see me stript, without my valour's prize,<br/>
When he himself won glory's noblest crown?<br/>
That shame is past all bearing. Shall I go<br/>
Against the Troïans' fort, and fighting there,<br/>
Alone with them alone, do some brave deed,<br/>
And then at last gain death? But thus should I<br/>
Gladden my foes, the Atreidæ. Nay, not so:<br/>
I must seek out some perilous emprise,<br/>
To show my father that I sprang from him,<br/>
In nature not faint-hearted. It is shame<br/>
For any man to wish for length of life,<br/>
Who, wrapt in troubles, knows no change for good.<br/>
For what delight brings day still following day,<br/>
Or bringing on, or putting off our death?<br/>
I would not rate that man as worth regard<br/>
Whose fervour glows on vain and empty hopes:<br/>
But either noble life or noble death<br/>
Becomes the gently born. My say is said.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
And none will say, Ο Aias, that thou speak'st<br/>
As one who talks by rote, but from thine heart:<br/>
Yet cease, we pray thee; leave such thoughts as these,<br/>
And let thy friends control thy soul's resolve.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
My master Aias, greater ill is none<br/>
To mortals given than lot of servitude;<br/>
And I was sprung from free-born father, strong,<br/>
If any was in Phrygia, in his wealth:<br/>
And now I am a slave, for so it pleased<br/>
The Gods and thy right hand; and therefore, since<br/>
I share thy bed, I care for thee and thine.<br/>
And now I pray, by Zeus who guards our hearth,<br/>
And by the couch where thou hast slept with me,<br/>
Deem it not right, in bondage leaving me,<br/>
That I should hear hard words from those thy foes;<br/>
For should'st thou die, and dying leave me lone,<br/>
Be sure that I upon that self-same day,<br/>
Dragged by the Argives with a harsh constraint,<br/>
With this thy son must eat a bond-slave's bread;<br/>
And some one of my masters bitter words<br/>
Will speak with scorn, &mdash; "Behold the concubine<br/>
Of Aias who excelled the host in might!<br/>
What bondage now she bears, in place of lot<br/>
That all did envy!" This will some one say,<br/>
And Fate pursue me, while for thee and thine<br/>
Are basest words like these. For very shame<br/>
Leave not thy father in his sad old age;<br/>
For shame leave not thy mother, feeble grown<br/>
With many years, who ofttimes prays the Gods<br/>
That thou may'st live and to thy home return:<br/>
Pity, Ο king, thy boy, and think if he,<br/>
Deprived of childhood's nurture, live bereaved,<br/>
Beneath unfriendly guardians, what sore grief<br/>
Thou, in thy death, dost give to him and me;<br/>
For I have nothing now on earth save thee<br/>
To which to look; for thou hast swept away<br/>
My country with thy spear, and other fate<br/>
Has taken both my mother and my sire<br/>
To dwell, as dead, in Hades. What to me<br/>
Were country in thy stead, or what were wealth?<br/>
For I in thee find all deliverance.<br/>
Yea, think of me too. Still the good man feels,<br/>
Or ought to feel, the memory of delight;<br/>
For gracious favours still do favour win;<br/>
But if a man forget the good received,<br/>
His soul no more wears stamp of gentle birth.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
I would, Ο Aias, thou could'st pity feel,<br/>
As I do. Then would'st thou approve her words.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Great praise shall she have from me, if she dare<br/>
Fully to do the task appointed her.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Lo! Aias dear, I will obey in all.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Bring then thy child to me that I may see him.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
In very fear but now I sent him forth.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
In these late troubles? Or what meanest thou?<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Lest he, poor child, should meet with thee and die.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
That would have been fit pastime for my Fate.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
But I took care against that fate to guard.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
I praise thy deed, and prudence which thou showed'st.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
What service then could I next render thee?<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Give me to speak with him, and look on him.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
He is hard by, in our attendants' care.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Why this delay? Why comes he not at once?<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ho, boy! Thy father calls. Come hither, thou,<br/>
Who chancest now to guide him with thy hands.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Speak'st thou to one who comes, or fails to hear?<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Behold, this servant brings him in to thee.<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Attendant, bringing Eurysakes.</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Lift him, then, lift him here. He will not shrink,<br/>
Beholding all this slaughter newly wrought,<br/>
If he be rightly named his father's son:<br/>
But we to these his father's savage ways<br/>
Must break him in, and make him like in soul.<br/>
Ο boy, may'st thou be happier than thy sire,<br/>
In all things else be like him. And not bad<br/>
Would'st thou be then. And yet thy lot e'en now<br/>
Doth move my envy, that thou feelest nought<br/>
Of all these evils. Sweetest life is found<br/>
In those unconscious years ere yet thou know<br/>
Or joy or sorrow. When thou com'st to this,<br/>
Then thou must show thy breeding to thy foes,<br/>
What son of what a father: but till then,<br/>
In gentle breezes grow, and rear thy life<br/>
A joy to this thy mother. And I know<br/>
That none of all the Achæan host will dare<br/>
Insult thee with foul scorn, though I be gone;<br/>
Such a stout guardian will I leave for thee<br/>
In Teucros, still unsparing for thy need,<br/>
Though now far off he hunts our enemies.<br/>
And ye, who bear the shield, my sailor band,<br/>
On you in common this request I lay;<br/>
Give him this message from me, home to take<br/>
This boy, and show him there to Telamon,<br/>
And to my mother, Eribœa named,<br/>
That he may feed their age for evermore,<br/>
[Till they too enter the abode of Death;]<br/>
And these my arms no umpires &mdash; no, nor yet<br/>
That plague of mine &mdash; shall to Achæans give;<br/>
But thou, my son, Eurysakes, be true<br/>
To that thy name, and holding by the belt<br/>
Well wrought, bear thou the sevenfold shield unhurt;<br/>
But all my other arms with me shall lie<br/>
Entombed. And now, take thou this boy indoors<br/>
And close the tent, and shed no wailing tears<br/>
Here in the front. A woman still must weep.<br/>
Close up the opening quickly: skilful leech<br/>
Mutters no spell o'er sore that needs the knife.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
I tremble as I hear thy eagerness;<br/>
For I like not this sharp, keen-whetted speech.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ah! Aias, lord, what deed dost thou intend?<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Ask not; inquire not. Self-command is good.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ah! my heart fails me. Now, by this thy son,<br/>
And all the Gods, I pray thee, leave us not.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Thou vexest me too much. What? Know'st thou not<br/>
That I no more am debtor to the Gods<br/>
That I should do them service?<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Hush! oh, hush!<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Speak thou to those that hear thee.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Wilt not thou<br/>
Be soothed, and hearken?<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Thou dost speak too much.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Yea, for I fear, Ο prince.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Quick! lead her in.<br/>
</p>
<p>[Sailors take Tecmessa, Eurysakes, and the Attendant to the women's tent.]</p>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
[From the tent.] Oh, by the Gods, relent thou.<br/>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Thou dost seem<br/>
A foolish thing to purpose, if thou think'st<br/>
At such a time as this to school my mood.<br/>
</p>
<p>[Exit, into his tent.]</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>Strophe I.</p>
<p>
Ο glorious Salamis!<br/>
Thou dwellest, blest within thy sea-girt shores,<br/>
Admired of all men still;<br/>
While I, poor fool, long since abiding here<br/>
*In Ida's grassy mead,<br/>
*Winter and summer too,<br/>
*Dwell, worn with woe, through months innumerable,<br/>
Still brooding o'er the fear of evil things,<br/>
That I ere long shall pass<br/>
To shades of Hades terrible and dread.<br/>
</p>
<p>Antistrophe I.</p>
<p>
And now our Aias comes,<br/>
Fresh troubler, hard to heal, (ah me! ah me!)<br/>
And dwells with madness sore,<br/>
Which God inflicts; him thou of old did'st send<br/>
Mighty in battle fierce;<br/>
But now in lonely woe<br/>
Wandering, great sorrow he to friends is found,<br/>
And the high deeds of worthiest praise of old,<br/>
Loveless to loveless souls,<br/>
Are with the Atreidæ fallen, fallen low.<br/>
</p>
<p>Strophe II.</p>
<p>
And, lo! his mother, worn with length of days,<br/>
And white with hoary age,<br/>
When she shall hear his frenzied soul's disease,<br/>
With wailing, wailing loud,<br/>
Will she, ill-starred one, cry, nor pour the strain<br/>
Of nightingale's sad song,<br/>
But shriller notes will utter in lament,<br/>
And on her breast will fall<br/>
The smiting of her hands,<br/>
And fearful tearing of her hoary hair.<br/>
</p>
<p>Antistrophe II.</p>
<p>
For better would he fare in Hades dread,<br/>
Who liveth sick in soul,<br/>
Who, springing from the noblest hero-stock<br/>
Of all the Achæans strong,<br/>
Abides no longer in his native mood,<br/>
But wanders far astray.<br/>
Ο wretched father, what a weight of woe,<br/>
Thy son's, hast thou to learn,<br/>
Which none else yet has borne,<br/>
Of all the high Zeus-sprung Æacidæ.<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Aias from his tent, with his sword.</p>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
Time in its long, long course immeasurable,<br/>
Both brings to light all hidden things, and hides<br/>
What once was seen; and nothing is there strange<br/>
We may not look for: even dreadest oaths<br/>
And firm resolves must yield themselves to him.<br/>
So I, who for a while was stern and hard,<br/>
Like steel, oil-dipped, am womanised in tone,<br/>
Moved by my wife's fond prayers, whom I am loth<br/>
To leave a widow with her orphaned child<br/>
Among my foes. But now I go to bathe<br/>
Where the fair meadows slope along the shore,<br/>
That having washed away my stains of guilt,<br/>
I may avert the Goddess's dire wrath;<br/>
And, going where I find a spot untracked<br/>
By human foot, may bury this my sword,<br/>
Weapon most hateful, digging up the earth<br/>
Where none may see it; but let Hades dark<br/>
And Night watch o'er it. For from that same hour<br/>
When I received it at great Hector's hands,<br/>
A gift most deadly, never kindly word<br/>
Had I from any Argive; and most true<br/>
Is found the proverb that one hears men say &mdash; <br/>
"A foe's gifts are as no gifts, profitless."<br/>
So for the future we shall know to yield<br/>
Our will to God's, shall learn to reverence<br/>
The Atreidæ even. They our rulers are,<br/>
And we must yield. Why not? The strongest things<br/>
That fright the soul still yield to sovereignty.<br/>
Winters with all their snow-drifts still withdraw<br/>
For summer with its fruits; and night's dark orb<br/>
Moves on that day may kindle up its fires,<br/>
Day with its chariot drawn by whitest sieeds;<br/>
And blast of dreadest winds will lull to rest<br/>
The groaning ocean; and all-conquering sleep<br/>
Now binds, now frees, and does not hold for aye<br/>
Whom once it seized. And shall not we too learn<br/>
Our lesson of true wisdom? I, indeed,<br/>
Have learnt but now that we should hate a foe<br/>
Only so far as one that yet may love,<br/>
And to a friend just so much help I'll give<br/>
As unto one that will not always stay;<br/>
For with most men is friendship's haven found<br/>
Most treacherous refuge. But in this our need<br/>
All shall be well, and thou, Ο woman, go<br/>
Within, and pray the Gods to grant in full<br/>
What my heart craves for. And do ye, my friends,<br/>
Pay her the self-same honour as to me,<br/>
And charge ye Teucros, should he come, to care<br/>
For me, and show a kindly heart to you.<br/>
For now I go the journey I must take;<br/>
And ye, do what I bid you, and perchance<br/>
Ye soon may hear of me, though now my fate<br/>
Is evil, as delivered from all ill.<br/>
<p>[Exit.]</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>Strophe</p>
<p>
I thrill with eager desire, I leap for gladness of heart,<br/>
Io, Io, Ο Pan!<br/>
Ο Pan! Ο Pan! Ο Pan!<br/>
Pan that walketh the waves,<br/>
Come from the snow-beaten heights<br/>
From Kyllene's mountainous ridge.<br/>
Come, Ο my king, that leadest the dance of the Gods,<br/>
That thou with me may'st thread<br/>
The dance of windings wild,<br/>
Nysian, or Knossian named;<br/>
For now I needs must dance for very joy.<br/>
And King Apollo, o'er Icarian waves,<br/>
Coming, the Delian God,<br/>
In presence manifest,<br/>
May He be with me gracious evermore.<br/>
</p>
<p>Antistrophe</p>
<p>
And Ares, too, hath loosed the dark calamitous spell<br/>
From off these eyes of ours:<br/>
Io, and Io still,<br/>
Once more, and yet once more.<br/>
And now, Ο Zeus, again<br/>
A day clear, cloudless, fair,<br/>
May dawn upon our ships o'er waves swift-speeding;<br/>
For Aias rests from grief,<br/>
And now with awe profound,<br/>
Duly worships the Gods<br/>
With meetest sacrifice.<br/>
Time, with great changes, bringeth all things low,<br/>
And never shall the word "impossible"<br/>
Pass from my lips, since now<br/>
Aias from wrath hath turned,<br/>
And the hot mood that 'gainst the Atreidæ raged.<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Messenger.</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
I wish, my friends, to tell my good news first:<br/>
Teucros is come but now from Mysian crags,<br/>
And coming where the generals all were met,<br/>
From all the Argive host foul speech he hears;<br/>
For hearing of his coming from afar,<br/>
Gathering around him at his head they hurled<br/>
Their words of scorn, here, there, and everywhere,<br/>
Calling him brother of the madman, kin<br/>
Of him who laid his plans against the host,<br/>
And threatening that he should not save himself<br/>
From falling, bruised and mangled, stoned to death.<br/>
So far they went that even swords were drawn<br/>
Forth from their scabbards, and were crossed in fight;<br/>
And when the strife had reached its furthest bounds,<br/>
It ceased with calmer speech of aged men.<br/>
But where is Aias that he too may hear?<br/>
'Tis right to tell our masters all the truth.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
He is not there within, but now is gone,<br/>
Changed counsels forming for his changing mood.<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Ah me! Or he who sent me on my way,<br/>
Sent me too late, or I too late have come.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
What then is lacking in thy business here?<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Teucros forbade our chief to pass outside<br/>
His tent, till he himself were present here.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
But he is gone, to best of tempers turned,<br/>
That he may 'scape the anger of the Gods.<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
These words of thine are full of foolishness,<br/>
If Calchas be a prophet wise and true.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
What meanest thou? What know'st thou of all these things?<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Thus much I know, and chanced, being there, to hear;<br/>
For from the council where the rulers sat,<br/>
Calchas alone, withdrawing from the Atreidæ,<br/>
His right hand placing with all kindliness<br/>
In Teucros' hand, urged him by every art,<br/>
For this one day, this very day, to keep<br/>
Our Aias in his tent, nor let him go,<br/>
If he desired to see him yet alive;<br/>
For that on this day only, so he spake,<br/>
Athena's wrath would vex him. For the seer<br/>
Said that the over-proud and foolish ones<br/>
Fall into sore misfortunes from the Gods,<br/>
When one, who draws his life from human birth,<br/>
Then thinks and feels as he were more than man.<br/>
And he, when starting hither from his home,<br/>
Showed himself foolish son of prudent sire;<br/>
For thus he bade him: "With thy spear, my son,<br/>
Strive thou to win, but win with help of God!"<br/>
And he replied, in foolish, vaunting speech,<br/>
"My father, with God's help, a man of nought<br/>
Might victory win; but I, I trust, shall grasp<br/>
Without their aid that glory for myself."<br/>
Such boast he uttered; and a second time,<br/>
When great Athena urged him to the fight,<br/>
And bade him turn his hand against his foes,<br/>
He answered her with words one fears to speak:<br/>
"O queen, stand thou the other Argives near;<br/>
The tide of battle will not sweep us down."<br/>
With words like these, not thinking as a man<br/>
Should think, he roused the Goddess to fierce wrath;<br/>
But if he lives this day, with help of God,<br/>
We might be his deliverers. Thus the seer<br/>
Spake, and then Teucros gives me this command<br/>
For thee to keep. But if we miss our mark,<br/>
Our lord is lost, or Calchas is not wise.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Ah, poor Tecmessa! child of misery,<br/>
Come thou, and hear what words are these he speaks;<br/>
The knife has touched the quick, and joy is gone.<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Tecmessa from the tent, with Eurysakes.</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Why rouse ye me, so lately freed from woe,<br/>
Woe very grievous, once again to grieve?<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Hear thou this man, who now has tidings brought<br/>
About our Aias, which I grieve to hear.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ah me! Ο man, what say'st thou? Are we lost?<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Of thy estate I know not, but for him<br/>
I have small hope, if he is not within.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Within he is not; so thy words bring woe.<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Teucros doth bid thee keep thy husband safe<br/>
Within his tent, nor let him forth alone.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
And where is Teucros? Why does he say this?<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
He has but just now come, and says he fears<br/>
Lest this departure bring to Aias death.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Woe, woe is me! From whom did he learn this?<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
From Thestor's son, the seer, who says this day,<br/>
This very day, brings life or death to him.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ah, friends, come help me in my low estate,<br/>
And hasten, some, to bring me Teucros here;<br/>
Some seek the western bays, and some the east;<br/>
Go ye, and search the wanderings of my lord,<br/>
So fraught with evil. Well I see it now,<br/>
My husband tricked me, and has cast me out<br/>
From all his old affection. Ah, my son!<br/>
What shall we do? We must not linger here,<br/>
But I will onward with all strength I have.<br/>
On, hasten we; no time for loitering this,<br/>
[Wishing to save a man so bent on death.]<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Full ready I, and not in words alone:<br/>
Swift action and swift feet shall go with them.<br/>
</p>
<p>[Exeunt Tecmessa, Messenger, and Chorus.]</p>
<p>Aias is seen in the distance by the sea-shore, fixing his sword in the ground.</p>
</p>
<p>AIAS</p>
<p>
The slayer stands where sharpest it will pierce, &mdash; <br/>
If one had time to think of that, &mdash; the gift<br/>
Of Hector, whom of all men most I loathed,<br/>
And found most hostile. And in Troïa's soil,<br/>
Soil of our foes, it stands with sharpened edge,<br/>
Fresh whetted with the stone that wears the steel;<br/>
And I have fixed it carefully and well<br/>
Where most it favours speedy death for him<br/>
Who standeth here. So far, so good: and first,<br/>
Ο Zeus, (for this is right,) be kind to me.<br/>
I ask but this, (no mighty boon, I trow,)<br/>
Send some one as a messenger to bear<br/>
The evil news to Teucros, that he first<br/>
May lift my corpse, by this sharp sword transfixed,<br/>
And that I may not, seen by any foe,<br/>
Before he see me, be to dogs and birds<br/>
Foully cast forth, their quarry and their spoil;<br/>
So much, Ο Zeus, I ask Thee; and I call<br/>
With Thee, great Hermes, guide of all the dead,<br/>
And dweller in the dark, to close mine eyes<br/>
Kindly, with one swift, unconvulsive spring<br/>
Piercing my heart with this same sword of mine;<br/>
And those, the Ever-virgin Ones, I call,<br/>
Erinnyes dread that see all human deeds,<br/>
Swift-footed, that they mark how I am slain<br/>
By yon Atreidæ; may they seize on them,<br/>
Doers of evil, with all evil plagues<br/>
And uttermost destruction, as they now<br/>
See me destroyed [with suicidal hand,<br/>
So let them fall by dearest kindred slain.]<br/>
Come swift Erinnyes, vengeful, glut yourselves<br/>
(Yea, spare them not,) upon the host they rule.<br/>
Thou Sun, whose chariot in the heaven's high path<br/>
Rides on in glory, when Thou see'st the land<br/>
Owned by my fathers, draw thy golden reins,<br/>
And tell all these my sorrows, and my doom,<br/>
To mine old father, and my mother lorn;<br/>
Ah! when she hears, poor wretch, the evil news<br/>
Through all the city, great and bitter cries<br/>
Will issue from her lips. But not for me<br/>
Is time for vain lament. The work must now<br/>
Begin more swiftly. Come, and look on me,<br/>
Ο Death, Ο Death! &mdash; and yet in yonder world<br/>
I shall dwell with thee, speak enough with thee;<br/>
And Thee I call, thou light of golden day,<br/>
Thou Sun, who drivest on thy glorious car,<br/>
Thee, for this last time, never more again.<br/>
Ο Light, Ο sacred land that was my home;<br/>
Ο Salamis, where stands my father's hearth,<br/>
Thou glorious Athens, with thy kindred race;<br/>
Ye streams and rivers here, and Troïa's plains,<br/>
To you that fed my life I bid farewell;<br/>
This last, last word does Aias speak to you;<br/>
All else I speak in Hades to the dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>[Falls on his sword, and dies.]</p>
<p>Enter Chorus, in two companies, searching for Aias.</p>
</p>
<p>SEMI-CHORUS A</p>
Toil upon toil brings toil;<br/>
Whither, ah, whither,<br/>
Whither have I not gone?<br/>
And no place knoweth to help.<br/>
Lo! lo! again I hear a sound of fall.<br/>
</p>
<p>SEMI-CHORUS B</p>
'Tis but our mates, the sailors of our ship.<br/>
</p>
<p>SEMI-CHORUS A</p>
What say ye then?<br/>
</p>
<p>SEMI-CHORUS B</p>
The whole flank has been tracked<br/>
West of the ships.<br/>
</p>
<p>SEMI-CHORUS A</p>
And is there aught discerned?<br/>
</p>
<p>SEMI-CHORUS B</p>
Labour enough, but nothing more to see.<br/>
</p>
<p>SEMI-CHORUS A</p>
And yet upon the eastern region's path<br/>
Our chief is clearly nowhere to be found.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Who, then, will tell me, who<br/>
Of fishers loving toil,<br/>
Plying his sleepless task,<br/>
Or who of Nymphs divine,<br/>
That haunt Olympos' height,<br/>
Or which of all the streams<br/>
Where Bosporos flows fast,<br/>
Will tell if they have seen him anywhere,<br/>
Wandering, the vexed in soul?<br/>
Hard destiny is mine,<br/>
Long tried with weary, toilsome wanderings,<br/>
That still I fail to reach with prosperous course,<br/>
Nor see where now he stays,<br/>
The man overwrought with ill.<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Tecmessa; as she advances, she stumbles on the body.</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Woe, woe is me!<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
What cry hard by is that from out the glade?<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Oh, miserable me!<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
I see that captive bride, the spoil of war,<br/>
Tecmessa, crushed with this o'erwhelming grief.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
I die, I perish; all is lost, my friends.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
What, then, has happened?<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Aias lieth here<br/>
Just slain, his sword within his body buried.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Woe, woe for my voyage home!<br/>
Woe, woe is me, thou hast slain,<br/>
Ο king, thy shipmate true;<br/>
Ah me, grievous my lot!<br/>
Grievous, Ο woman, thy woe!<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Well may one groan and wail to find him thus.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
But by whose hands did that ill-starred one die?<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
He, by his own hand, it is plain; for here<br/>
This sword, firm fixed, on which he fell, gives proof.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Woe, woe is me for my grief!<br/>
Alone thou wast bleeding to death,<br/>
None of thy friends near to guard;<br/>
And I, all deaf and all blind,<br/>
Left thee, neglected, to fall.<br/>
Where, ah ! where does he lie,<br/>
Aias, ill-fated, with ill name of woe?<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ye may not look on him, but I with robe<br/>
Enfolded round, will hide him utterly;<br/>
For none who loved him now could have the heart<br/>
To see him still up-panting from his wound,<br/>
At either nostril, blackened gore and blood<br/>
Springing from that self-slaughter. Now, ah me!<br/>
What shall I do? What friend will lift thee up?<br/>
And where is Teucros? How in timeliest need<br/>
Would he now come the body to lay out<br/>
Of this his fallen brother! Ο ill-starred<br/>
Aias, who, being what thou wast, hast fared<br/>
As now thou farest; e'en from bitterest foes<br/>
Thou now could'st claim the meed of righteous tears.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Ο man of many woes, 'twas thine, 'twas thine,<br/>
In stern unbending mood,<br/>
At the fixed hour to work<br/>
Ill doom of boundless griefs;<br/>
So all night long, till dawn,<br/>
Thou poured'st dire complaint,<br/>
With spirit vexed to death,<br/>
Against the Atreidæ in thy bitter mood.<br/>
Great author of our sorrows was that day,<br/>
When for the arms of great Achilles rose<br/>
Strife of the brave in fight.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ah me! Ah misery!<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
True griefs, I know too well, will pierce the heart.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ah me! Ah misery!<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
I wonder not, Ο woman, thou should'st groan<br/>
Yet more, but now of such a friend bereaved.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Thine 'tis to think; mine all too well to know.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
I own it so.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Ah me! to what a yoke of bondage, child,<br/>
We now draw nigh, what watchers over us!<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Ah! thou hast spoken now<br/>
Of deeds unutterable,<br/>
By the Atreidæ stern<br/>
Heaped upon this our grief:<br/>
But may God ward it off!<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
But for the Gods this had not happened so.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Yea, they have wrought a trouble hard to bear.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Such woe does Pallas, dreaded child of Zeus,<br/>
For her Odysseus' sake inflict on us.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Lo! the man subtle to dare,<br/>
Mocks in the dark of his soul,<br/>
And laughs at this frenzy of woe<br/>
(Fie on 't!) a laugh loud and long,<br/>
And with him those who share the name of king,<br/>
The Atreidæ, as they hear.<br/>
</p>
<p>TECMESSA</p>
<p>
Let them, then, mock and laugh at this man's woes;<br/>
The time may come when they who did not care<br/>
To see him living, in the need of war<br/>
May groan that he is dead; for still the base<br/>
In purpose never know the good they have,<br/>
Until they lose it. Bitter woe to me<br/>
His death has brought, to them good cheer, but joy,<br/>
Great joy to him; for what he sought to gain,<br/>
Yea, death that he desired, he now hath won.<br/>
[How, then, can they exult in this man's death?<br/>
'Twas for the Gods, and not for them he died.]<br/>
In empty vaunt, then, let Odysseus boast,<br/>
For Aias is beyond them; but for me<br/>
He leaves, departing, wailing and lament.<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Teucros.</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Woe is me! Ah, woe!<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
[To Tecmessa.] Hush! for I think I hear our Teucros cry,<br/>
With wailing loud that hits this great woe's mark.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Ο best-loved Aias, brother dear to me,<br/>
Hast thou, then, fared so ill as rumour holds?<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Our lord is dead, Ο Teucros, doubt it not.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Oh, woe is me! Woe for my grievous lot!<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
At such a pass . . .<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Oh, miserable me!<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Thou well may'st groan.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Ο rash and ruthless death!<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Too truly so, Ο Teucros.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Woe is me!<br/>
What of his child? Where in all Troïa is he?<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Alone, within the tents.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Why bring ye not<br/>
With quickest speed the boy, lest any foe<br/>
Seize him, as whelp of lonely lioness?<br/>
Go, hasten, work together. All are wont<br/>
To treat with scorn the dead that prostrate lie.<br/>
</p>
<p>[Some of the Chorus bring in Eurysakes.]</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
And while he lived, Ο Teucros, thee he charged,<br/>
For this his boy to care, as now thou car'st.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Sight of all sights most painful; of all paths<br/>
Path vexing most my spirit, this, which now<br/>
My feet have taken, where, Ο Aias dear,<br/>
Still following thee and tracking out thy course,<br/>
I learnt thy fate: for lo! a swift report,<br/>
As though some God had spread it, went of thee<br/>
Through all the Achæans, that thy death had come;<br/>
And I in woe, and hearing it far off,<br/>
Groaned low; and seeing, perish utterly.<br/>
Ah, me![Some of the Chorus, as he speaks, uncover the body of Aias.<br/>
Come, lay it bare, that I may see it well,<br/>
The whole dread evil. Ο most ghastly sight,<br/>
And work of bitter daring, what a woe<br/>
Thou, in thy death, hast sown for me! Where go,<br/>
Among what men, I who in all thy woes<br/>
Have failed to help thee? Telamon, I trow,<br/>
My father, and thine too, will welcome me<br/>
With cheerful glances, full of kindly mood,<br/>
Without thee coming! Can he fail to frown<br/>
Who, e'en when all went well, but seldom smiled<br/>
Too pleasantly on men? What word of wrath<br/>
Will he now hide? What evil utter not?<br/>
Reproaching me as bastard, captive-born,<br/>
Who, in my coward, base unmanliness<br/>
Abandoned thee, Ο Aias, or in guile,<br/>
That, on thy death, I might thy sceptre wield<br/>
And rule thy house? Such foul reproach will he,<br/>
Rough in his mood, and vexed sore with age,<br/>
Vent in his wrath, by trifles light as air<br/>
To fiercest anger kindled. And at last<br/>
I shall be hurled an outcast from my home,<br/>
Bearing the name of slave instead of free.<br/>
Such fate awaits me there. In Troïa here<br/>
Many my foes, and few the things that help;<br/>
And this, all this, thy death hath brought to me.<br/>
What shall I do? Alas! how lift thee up<br/>
From this bright sword whose murderous point hath brought<br/>
Thee, wretched one, to death? And did'st thou know<br/>
How Hector thus, though dead, should bring thee low?<br/>
Now, by the Gods, look ye upon the fate<br/>
Of those two men &mdash; how Hector, with the belt<br/>
Which this man gave him, bound to chariot's wheel,<br/>
Was dragged and mangled, on and on, till death;<br/>
While he who had this sword as Hector's gift,<br/>
Brought death upon himself by one fell leap.<br/>
Oh, did some dread Erinnys forge this sword,<br/>
And Hades, stern artificer, that belt?<br/>
I must needs own the Gods as working this,<br/>
And all things else that come to mortal men;<br/>
And he who thinks not so, why, let him have<br/>
His own thoughts if he will; I hold to these.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Be not too long, but ponder well how best<br/>
Thou may'st inter his body in the tomb,<br/>
And what thou now wilt say; for, lo! I see<br/>
A man, his foe, exulting, it may be,<br/>
As evil-doer at the evil done.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
What man of all the host is this thou see'st?<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
'Tis Menelaos, for whose sake we sailed.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
I see him. Near, he is not hard to know.<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Menelaos, followed by a Herald, and Attendants.</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
Ho, there! I bid thee not to touch this corpse<br/>
With these thy hands, but leave it as it is.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
And why dost thou such big words lavish here?<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
So think I: so thinks he who rules the host.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Wilt thou not say what ground thou giv'st for this?<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
Because we hoped to bring him from his home,<br/>
Ally and friend to all the Achæan host,<br/>
And found him than the Phrygians worser foe,<br/>
Who, plotting death to all the host at once,<br/>
Came on by night that he might slay with sword;<br/>
And were it not some God had quashed the scheme,<br/>
We should have fallen, and, in shameful plight,<br/>
By chance which now is his, had lain there dead,<br/>
And he had lived; but now a God has turned<br/>
His wanton rage to fall on flocks and herds;<br/>
And, therefore, there is no man strong enough,<br/>
Be he who may, this body to entomb,<br/>
But, cast forth here upon the yellow sands,<br/>
It shall be prey for birds that haunt the shore.<br/>
Therefore, I bid thee, keep from furious wrath;<br/>
For though we failed to rule him while he lived,<br/>
We surely now will master him when dead,<br/>
Wilt thou, or no, and with our hands control.<br/>
For never when he lived would he obey<br/>
The words I spake: yet 'tis a vile man's part<br/>
For one among the people not to deign<br/>
To hear his masters. Never in a state<br/>
Can laws be well administered when dread<br/>
Has ceased to act, nor can an armèd host<br/>
Be rightly ruled, if no defence of fear<br/>
And awe be present. But a man should think,<br/>
Though sturdy in his frame, he yet may fall<br/>
By some small chance of ill. And know this well,<br/>
That he who has both fear and reverence<br/>
Has also safety. But where men are free<br/>
To not proudly, and do all their will,<br/>
That State, be sure, with steady-blowing gale,<br/>
Is driving to destruction, and will fall.<br/>
For me, let seasonable awe be mine,<br/>
Nor let us think that, doing what we please,<br/>
We shall not one day pay the penalty<br/>
In things that pain. These things come on in turn;<br/>
This fellow here was mocker hot and proud;<br/>
Now I am lifted up, and charge thee there<br/>
This body not to bury, lest thou too,<br/>
By burying him, should'st need a burial.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Ο Menelaos, uttering maxims wise,<br/>
Do not thyself then outrage so the dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
I cannot wonder, friends, that one who lives,<br/>
Brought up in low estate, should faults commit,<br/>
When they who deem they come of noblest stock<br/>
Such faulty words will utter in their speech.<br/>
Come, let us start afresh: and dost thou say<br/>
That thou did'st bring this man as stanch ally<br/>
To these Achæans? Did he not sail forth,<br/>
Himself his only master? Or what right<br/>
Had'st thou to rule the people that he led1<br/>
Here from his home? As Sparta's king thou cam'st,<br/>
And not as ours. No greater right had'st thou<br/>
To rule o'er him than he to reign o'er thee.<br/>
Thou cam'st an under-captain, not the lord<br/>
Of all the host, that thou should'st Aias lead.<br/>
Rule those thou rulest, vent thy solemn words<br/>
On them; but I, though thou should'st say me nay,<br/>
Or e'en that other leader, I will place<br/>
This body in the tomb with all due rites,<br/>
Not fearing thy big speeches. He warred not<br/>
For that thy wife, as these who take their fill<br/>
Of many labours, but to keep the oath<br/>
By which he bound himself. 'Twas not for thee,<br/>
For never did he value men of nought.<br/>
Come, therefore, bring more heralds with thee here;<br/>
Yea, bring the general's self. I would not care<br/>
For all thy stir while thou art . . . what thou art.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
I do not like such speech in midst of ills;<br/>
Sharp words will bite, however just they be.<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
This archer seems to have a lofty soul.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
E'en so; I practise no ungentle craft.<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
Had'st thou a shield, thy boast would soar indeed.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
With thee, full-armed, I'll match myself light-armed.<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
How mightily thy tongue doth school thy thought.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
With right on our side we may well be proud.<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
That he, slaying me, should prosper, was that right?<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
"Slaying thee!" 'Twere strange if thou wert dead, who liv'st.<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
God saves me still; in his intent I 'm slain.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Saved by the Gods, put not the Gods to shame.<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
What? Find I fault with laws of those in heaven?<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Yes, if thou stopp'st my burying of the dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
The burial of my foes: for 'tis not well.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
And when was Aias ever found thy foe?<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
He hated me; I him; and this thou know'st.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Yes; for 'twas thou did'st cheat with juggling votes.<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
That fault was with the judges, not with me.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
With goodly stealth, then, thou would'st work much ill.<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
This speech shall bring a bitter grief to some.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Not one whit more, 'twould seem, than we shall cause.<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
I say but this, thou shalt not bury him.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
And hear thou this, that buried he shall be.<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
I once did see a man full bold of speech,<br/>
Who urged his sailors in a storm to sail,<br/>
But not a word had he, when driven to prayer<br/>
By stress of tempest, but beneath a cloak<br/>
He crouched, and let each sailor tread on him;<br/>
And so for thee, and those thy haughty lips,<br/>
Some great storm, blowing from a tiny cloud,<br/>
Shall soon, perchance, hush all thy clamorous speech.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
And I have seen a man of folly full<br/>
Who wantoned proudly in his neighbour's ills,<br/>
And then one came, in fashion like to me,<br/>
And like in mood, and looked, and spake this word:<br/>
"Ο man, abstain from outrage to the dead,<br/>
For if thou dost it, dearly shalt thou pay."<br/>
Such counsel did he give that wretched fool,<br/>
And now I see him; and he is, 'twould seem,<br/>
None else but thee. Do I speak parables?<br/>
</p>
<p>MENELAUS</p>
<p>
I go my way, for it is sore disgrace<br/>
With words to punish, force being in our power. <br/>
<p>[Exit.]</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Go, then, thy way; to me 'tis worst disgrace<br/>
To hear a vain fool prating empty words.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Struggle of mighty strife there soon will be;<br/>
But thou, Ο Teucros, speed,<br/>
Haste, some deep pit to find,<br/>
Where he shall find a grave of dreariest gloom,<br/>
Yet one which men will hold in memory.<br/>
</p>
<p>[Tecmessa advances, with Eurysakes holding her hand.]</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
And lo! they come at very nick of time,<br/>
And stand hard by, this hero's wife and child,<br/>
To deck the burial of the ill-starred dead.<br/>
Come hither, boy, and standing suppliantly,<br/>
Lay hand upon the father that begat thee,<br/>
And sitting in the guise of one who prays,<br/>
Hold in thy hands my locks, and hers, and thine,<br/>
A treasure of entreaty. And should one<br/>
In all our army tear thee from the dead,<br/>
May he thus base, unburied, basely die,<br/>
An exile from his home, with all his race<br/>
As utterly cut off, as I now cut<br/>
This braided lock. Take it, Ο boy, and keep;<br/>
Let no man move thee, hold it suppliant;<br/>
And ye stand by him, not as women found<br/>
Who should be men, but help him till I come<br/>
To bury him, though all should hinder me.<br/>
<p>[Exit.]</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>Strophe I.</p>
<p>
When will it end, the last of wandering years,<br/>
That ever bring to me<br/>
The ceaseless woe of war's unresting toils,<br/>
Through Troïa, drear and wide,<br/>
The Hellenes' shame and reproach?<br/>
</p>
<p>Antistrophe I.</p>
<p>
Would that that man had entered Heaven's high vault,<br/>
Or Hades, man's last home,<br/>
Who for the Hellenes stirred War's hateful strife;<br/>
(O woes that woe beget!)<br/>
For he hath laid men low.<br/>
</p>
<p>Strophe II.</p>
<p>
He hath given me never to share<br/>
The joy of garlands of flowers,<br/>
Nor that of the deep, flowing cups,<br/>
Nor the dulcet notes of the flute,<br/>
Nor &mdash; curses light on his head! &mdash; <br/>
The pleasure that cometh with sleep.<br/>
Yea, from love, from love and its joys<br/>
He hath cut me off. (Ah, woe is me!)<br/>
And here I lie, cared for by none,<br/>
My locks all wet with the dews,<br/>
Keepsake of Troïa the sad.<br/>
</p>
<p>Antistrophe II.</p>
<p>
Till now against terrors of night,<br/>
And sharp arrows a bulwark and stay,<br/>
Was Aias, the mighty and strong:<br/>
Now he, too, a victim is gone<br/>
To the God that ruleth in gloom;<br/>
What joy remaineth for me?<br/>
Would I were there, where the rock,<br/>
Thick-wooded and washed by the waves,<br/>
Hangs o'er the face of the deep,<br/>
Under Sunion's broad jutting peak,<br/>
That there we might hail, once again,<br/>
Athens, the holy, the blest.<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Teucros.</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Lo! I have hastened, seeing our general come,<br/>
Our Agamemnon, speeding on his way,<br/>
And plain it is he comes to speak hard words.<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Agamemnon.</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
They tell me that thou darest fearful words<br/>
To vent against us with impunity,<br/>
Thou, yes, e'en thou, of captive mistress born;<br/>
A noble mother truly can'st thou boast,<br/>
That thou dost speak so loftily, and walk<br/>
On tip-toe proudly, who, being nought, dost strive<br/>
For him who is as nothing, and dost swear<br/>
We did not come to rule the host or fleet,<br/>
Or thee, or the Achæans; but thou say'st<br/>
That Aias sailed himself his only lord.<br/>
And are not these big words to hear from slaves?<br/>
And what was he for whom thou vauntest thus?<br/>
Where went he, or where stood, where I was not?<br/>
Had the Achæans then no men but him?<br/>
A strife full bitter for Achilles' arms<br/>
We set before the Argives then, 'twould seem,<br/>
If everywhere a Teucros call us base,<br/>
And ye are not content, though worsted quite,<br/>
To yield to what the judges have decreed<br/>
With all but one consent, but still revile<br/>
Our name, and, when defeated, strike at us<br/>
In secret guile. With such a mood as this<br/>
There can be no establishment of law,<br/>
If we shall cast off those whose right prevails,<br/>
And lead the hindmost to the foremost rank.<br/>
Nay, we must check these things. The safest men<br/>
Are not the stout, broad-shouldered, brawny ones,<br/>
But still wise thinkers everywhere prevail;<br/>
And oxen, broad of back, by smallest scourge<br/>
Are, spite of all, driven forward in the way;<br/>
And that sure spell, I see, will come ere long<br/>
On thee, unless thou somehow wisdom gain,<br/>
Who, when thy lord is gone, a powerless shade,<br/>
Art bold, with wanton insolence of speech.<br/>
Wilt thou not learn self-mastery? Wilt thou not,<br/>
Remembering what thou art by birth, when next<br/>
Thou comest, bring some free-born man with thee,<br/>
Who, in thy stead, shall speak thy words to us?<br/>
For I, indeed, learn nothing by thy speech,<br/>
Thy barbarous accent so offends mine ear.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Would that ye both self-mastery could learn:<br/>
Better than this I cannot wish you both.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Alas! How soon the credit of the dead<br/>
Flits, and is gone, and proves but treacherous stay,<br/>
When this man, Aias, takes no count of thee,<br/>
Not e'en in poor, cheap words, for whom thou oft<br/>
Thy life exposing, strovest in the fight;<br/>
But all the past is past, and thrown aside.<br/>
Ο thou that speakest such a senseless speech,<br/>
Hast thou no memory, none, of that same day<br/>
When ye were shut within the bulwarks high,<br/>
Already good as dead, and he, himself,<br/>
Alone, came on to help, and freed you all,<br/>
Putting to flight your foes, when fire had seized<br/>
*Your ships' tall masts, and where the sailors sit,<br/>
And Hector's self was leaping o'er the trench<br/>
Right on your sailors' boats? Who staved this off?<br/>
Was it not he of whom thou now dost say,<br/>
That never did he stir a foot for thee?<br/>
Nay, wrought he not in your sight noble deeds?<br/>
And yet once more, when he went forth to meet,<br/>
In single combat, Hector, casting lots,<br/>
At no man's word, the lot which he put in<br/>
Was no deserter, lump of moistened clay,<br/>
But one full sure to be the first to leap<br/>
With nimble spring from out the crested helm;<br/>
'Twas he that did all this, and I with him,<br/>
The base-born slave, of alien mother sprung.<br/>
Thou wretch, what face hast thou to utter this?<br/>
And know'st thou not the father that begat<br/>
Thy father, Pelops, was of alien blood,<br/>
A Phrygian born, of old; that Atreus, he<br/>
Who gave thee life, was godless in his deeds,<br/>
And placed before his brother banquet foul<br/>
Of his own children's flesh; and thou thyself<br/>
Wast born of Cretan mother, whom her sire,<br/>
Detecting with the alien, headlong cast<br/>
A prey to voiceless fishes? And dost thou,<br/>
Such as thou art, reproach me with my birth,<br/>
Such as I am, who, on my father's side,<br/>
From Telamon am sprung, who gained the prize<br/>
Of all the host for valour, and obtained<br/>
My mother as a concubine, who claimed<br/>
A kingly birth from old Laomedon,<br/>
And whom Alcmena's son as chosen gift<br/>
Gave to my father? And should I, thus sprung<br/>
Noble, from noblest, shame my kith and kin,<br/>
Whom now, in such ill plight as this enwrapt,<br/>
Thou thrustest out unburied, and dost feel<br/>
No shame to speak it? But of this be sure,<br/>
If ye will cast him forth, ye will cast, too,<br/>
Us three around him clinging; for 'twere good,<br/>
Striving for him to die in open fight,<br/>
*Much rather than for that false wife of thine,<br/>
Or for thy brother; wherefore look thou well<br/>
Not to my business only but thine own;<br/>
For should'st thou hurt me, thou shalt wish to be<br/>
A coward rather than wax bold on me.<br/>
</p>
<p>Enter Odysseus.</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Thou com'st, Ο King Odysseus, seasonably,<br/>
If thou art here to stop, not stir the strife.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
What is it, sirs? for from afar I heard<br/>
The Atreidæ's clamour o'er this noble corpse.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
And have we not, Ο King Odysseus, heard<br/>
But now most shameful language from this man?<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
What was it? I can much forgive a man<br/>
Who, hearing vile things, answers evil words.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
Foul words he heard, for such his deeds to me.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
And what was this he did that injured thee?<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
He says he will not leave this corpse untombed,<br/>
But, spite of my command, will bury it.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
And may I, as a friend who speaks the truth,<br/>
Row in thy boat, as welcome as before?<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
Speak on; or else I should be most unwise,<br/>
Who count thee, of all Argives, truest friend.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Hear then; by all the Gods, I thee entreat,<br/>
Cast not this man out so unfeelingly,<br/>
Nor leave him there unburied. Let not wrath<br/>
Prevail on thee that thou should'st hate so far<br/>
As upon right to trample. Unto me<br/>
This man of all the host was greatest foe,<br/>
Since I prevailed to gain Achilles' arms;<br/>
But, though he were so, being what he was,<br/>
I would not put so foul a shame on him,<br/>
As not to own I looked upon a man,<br/>
The best and bravest of the Argive host,<br/>
Of all that came to Troïa, saving one,<br/>
Achilles' self. Most wrong 'twould therefore be<br/>
That he should suffer outrage at thy hands;<br/>
Thou would'st not trample upon him alone,<br/>
But on the laws of God. It is not right<br/>
To harm, though thou should'st chance to hate him sore,<br/>
A man of noble nature lying dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
Art thou, Odysseus, this man's champion found?<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
E'en so; I hated while 'twas right to hate.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
Ought'st thou not then to trample on him dead?<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
In wrongful gain, Atreides, find not joy.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
Full hard this fear of God for sovereign prince.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Not so to honour friends who counsel well.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
The noblest man should those that rule obey.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Hush! thou dost rule when worsted by thy friends.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
Remember thou to whom thou giv'st this grace.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
An enemy, but still a noble one.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
What wilt thou? Dost thou a foe's corpse revere?<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Far more than hatred valour weighs with me.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
Fickle and wayward, natures such as thine.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Many once friends again are bitter foes.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
And dost thou praise the getting friends like these?<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Unbending mood I am not wont to praise.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
Thou wilt this very day make cowards of us.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Nay, righteous men in all the Hellenes' eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
And dost thou bid me let him bury it?<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
I do, for I myself shall come to that.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
All men are like; each labours for himself.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Whom should I work for more than for myself?<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
It shall be called thy work then, and not mine.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
Howe'er that be, in any case thou'rt kind.<br/>
</p>
<p>AGAMEMNON</p>
<p>
But know this well, that I would grant to thee<br/>
Far greater boon than even this thou ask'st;<br/>
But as for him, or here, or there, he still<br/>
Is hateful to me; . . . But have thou thy will.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Who says, Odysseus, thou'rt not wise of heart,<br/>
Being what thou art, shall prove himself a fool.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
And now I tell to Teucros that I stand<br/>
A friend as true as once I was a foe,<br/>
And I desire to join in burying him<br/>
Who there lies dead, to join in all the toil,<br/>
And fail in nought of all that men should pay<br/>
Of homage to the noblest men of earth.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Ο good Odysseus, words of praise are mine<br/>
For all thou dost, and thou hast falsified<br/>
My thoughts of thee, for thou, most hostile found<br/>
To him of all the Argives, stood'st alone<br/>
To help him with thy hands, and did'st not dare<br/>
To trample living upon him the dead,<br/>
When this brain-stricken captain of the host,<br/>
He and his brother with him, came and sought<br/>
To cast him out deprived of sepulture.<br/>
Now, therefore, may the Father whose high sway<br/>
Olympos rules, Erinnys noting guilt,<br/>
And Justice the avenger punish them<br/>
For foul deeds foully, even as they wished<br/>
To cast this man to shame unmerited.<br/>
And thee, Ο son of aged Lartios,<br/>
Loth am I now to let thee take thy share<br/>
In burying him, lest I perchance should do<br/>
What he, the dead, approves not. [All the rest<br/>
Do thou do with me, and, if thou wilt bring<br/>
Some soldiers from the host, we shall not grieve.]<br/>
All else will I do, and for thee, know well,<br/>
Thou show'st thyself to us as great of soul.<br/>
</p>
<p>ODYSSEUS</p>
<p>
I fain had joined, but if it please thee not<br/>
That we should share, I go, thy words accepting.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEUCROS</p>
<p>
Enough: already the time<br/>
Is wearing swiftly away;<br/>
Haste ye, some to prepare<br/>
A deep hollowed pit for the grave,<br/>
And some a tall tripod set<br/>
Fit for our task, girt with fire,<br/>
Meet for washing the dead.<br/>
One band, let it fetch from the tent<br/>
His breast-plate, his greaves, and his sword:<br/>
And thou, Ο boy, in thy love,<br/>
With all the strength that thou hast,<br/>
Here, with thy hand on his side,<br/>
Thy father's, lift him with me;<br/>
For still the hot veins pour their stream,<br/>
The dark, thick blood of his strength.<br/>
But come ye, come, one and all,<br/>
Who boast of yourselves as his friends;<br/>
Hasten, come quick to the work,<br/>
Labouring for him who in all<br/>
Was good, and none better than he.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Men may know many things on seeing them;<br/>
But, ere they come in sight,<br/>
No man is prophet of the things that come,<br/>
To tell how he shall fare.<br/>

<h1>Oedipus, King of Thebes</h1>
<h2>by Sophocles</h2>
<h3>translated by Gilbert Murray (1911)</h3>

<h3>Dramatis Personae</h3>
<p>
Oedipus, <em>supposed son of Polybus, King of Corinth; now elected King of Thebes.</em><br/>
Jocasta, <em>Queen of Thebes; widow of La&iuml;us, the late King, and now wife to Oedipus.</em><br/>
Creon, <em>a Prince of Thebes, brother to Jocasta.</em><br/>
Tiresias, <em>an old blind seer.</em><br/>
Priest of Zeus.<br/>
A Stranger <em>from Corinth.</em><br/>
A Shepherd <em>of King La&iuml;us.</em><br/>
A Messenger <em>from the Palace.</em><br/>
Chorus of the Elders of Thebes.<br/>
A Crowd of Suppliants, men, women, and children.
</p>
<p>The following do not appear in the play but are frequently mentioned:&mdash;</p>
<p>
La&iuml;us <em>(pronounced as three syllables, L&aacute;-i-us), the last King of Thebes before Oedipus.</em><br/>
Cadmus, <em>the founder of Thebes; son of Ag&ecirc;nor, King of Sidon.</em><br/>
Polybus and Merop&ecirc;, <em>King and Queen of Corinth, supposed to be the father and mother of Oedipus.</em><br/>
Apollo, <em>the God specially presiding over the oracle of Delphi and the island Delos: he is also called Phoebus, the pure; Loxias, supposed to mean "He of the Crooked Words"; and Lykeios, supposed to mean "Wolf-God." He is also the great Averter of Evil, and has names from the cries "I-&ecirc;" (pronounced "Ee-ay") and "Paian," cries for healing or for the frightening away of evil influences.</em><br/>
Kithairon, <em>a mass of wild mountains south-west of Thebes.</em>
</p>

<hr/>

<p>Scene.&mdash;<em>Before the Palace of Oedipus at Thebes. A crowd of suppliants of all ages are waiting by the altar in front and on the steps of the Palace; among them the Priest of Zeus. As the Palace door opens and Oedipus comes out all the suppliants with a cry move towards him in attitudes of prayer, holding out their olive branches, and then become still again as he speaks.</em></p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
My children, fruit of Cadmus' ancient tree<br/>
New springing, wherefore thus with bended knee<br/>
Press ye upon us, laden all with wreaths<br/>
And suppliant branches? And the city breathes<br/>
Heavy with incense, heavy with dim prayer<br/>
And shrieks to affright the Slayer.&mdash;Children, care<br/>
For this so moves me, I have scorned withal<br/>
Message or writing: seeing 'tis I ye call,<br/>
'Tis I am come, world-honoured Oedipus.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Man, do thou declare&mdash;the rest have thus<br/>
Their champion&mdash;in what mood stand ye so still,<br/>
In dread or sure hope? Know ye not, my will<br/>
Is yours for aid 'gainst all? Stern were indeed<br/>
The heart that felt not for so dire a need.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Priest:</h4>
<p>
O Oedipus, who holdest in thy hand<br/>
My city, thou canst see what ages stand<br/>
At these thine altars; some whose little wing<br/>
Scarce flieth yet, and some with long living<br/>
O'erburdened; priests, as I of Zeus am priest,<br/>
And chosen youths: and wailing hath not ceased<br/>
Of thousands in the market-place, and by<br/>
Athena's two-fold temples and the dry<br/>
Ash of Ism&ecirc;nus' portent-breathing shore.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all our ship, thou see'st, is weak and sore<br/>
Shaken with storms, and no more lighteneth<br/>
Her head above the waves whose trough is death.<br/>
She wasteth in the fruitless buds of earth,<br/>
In parch&egrave;d herds and travail without birth<br/>
Of dying women: yea, and midst of it<br/>
A burning and a loathly god hath lit<br/>
Sudden, and sweeps our land, this Plague of power;<br/>
Till Cadmus' house grows empty, hour by hour,<br/>
And Hell's house rich with steam of tears and blood.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O King, not God indeed nor peer to God<br/>
We deem thee, that we kneel before thine hearth,<br/>
Children and old men, praying; but of earth<br/>
A thing consummate by thy star confessed<br/>
Thou walkest and by converse with the blest;<br/>
Who came to Thebes so swift, and swept away<br/>
The Sphinx's song, the tribute of dismay,<br/>
That all were bowed beneath, and made us free.<br/>
A stranger, thou, naught knowing more than we,<br/>
Nor taught of any man, but by God's breath<br/>
Filled, thou didst raise our life. So the world saith;<br/>
So we say.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore now, O Lord and Chief,<br/>
We come to thee again; we lay our grief<br/>
On thy head, if thou find us not some aid.<br/>
Perchance thou hast heard Gods talking in the shade<br/>
Of night, or eke some man: to him that knows,<br/>
Men say, each chance that falls, each wind that blows<br/>
Hath life, when he seeks counsel. Up, O chief<br/>
Of men, and lift thy city from its grief;<br/>
Face thine own peril! All our land doth hold<br/>
Thee still our saviour, for that help of old:<br/>
Shall they that tell of thee hereafter tell<br/>
"By him was Thebes raised up, and after fell!"<br/>
Nay, lift us till we slip no more. Oh, let<br/>
That bird of old that made us fortunate<br/>
Wing back; be thou our Oedipus again.<br/>
And let thy kingdom be a land of men,<br/>
Not emptiness. Walls, towers, and ships, they all<br/>
Are nothing with no men to keep the wall.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
My poor, poor children! Surely long ago<br/>
I have read your trouble. Stricken, well I know,<br/>
Ye all are, stricken sore: yet verily<br/>
Not one so stricken to the heart as I.<br/>
Your grief, it cometh to each man apart<br/>
For his own loss, none other's; but this heart<br/>
For thee and me and all of us doth weep.<br/>
Wherefore it is not to one sunk in sleep<br/>
Ye come with waking. Many tears these days<br/>
For your sake I have wept, and many ways<br/>
Have wandered on the beating wings of thought.<br/>
And, finding but one hope, that I have sought<br/>
And followed. I have sent Menoikeus' son,<br/>
Creon, my own wife's brother, forth alone<br/>
To Apollo's House in Delphi, there to ask<br/>
What word, what deed of mine, what bitter task,<br/>
May save my city.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lapse of days<br/>
Reckoned, I can but marvel what delays<br/>
His journey. 'Tis beyond all thought that thus<br/>
He comes not, beyond need. But when he does,<br/>
Then call me false and traitor, if I flee<br/>
Back from whatever task God sheweth me.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Priest:</h4>
<p>
At point of time thou speakest. Mark the cheer<br/>
Yonder. Is that not Creon drawing near?<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>They all crowd to gaze where Creon is approaching in the distance.</em>]</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
O Lord Apollo, help! And be the star<br/>
That guides him joyous as his seemings are!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Priest:</h4>
<p>
Oh! surely joyous! How else should he bear<br/>
That fruited laurel wreathed about his hair?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
We soon shall know.&mdash;'Tis not too far for one<br/>
Clear-voiced.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>Shouting</em>) Ho, brother! Prince! Menoikeus' son,<br/>
What message from the God?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon (<em>from a distance</em>):</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message of joy!</p>

<h4><em>Enter</em> Creon:</h4>
<p>
I tell thee, what is now our worst annoy,<br/>
If the right deed be done, shall turn to good.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>The crowd, which has been full of excited hope, falls to doubt and disappointment.</em></p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Nay, but what is the message? For my blood<br/>
Runs neither hot nor cold for words like those.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Shall I speak now, with all these pressing close,<br/>
Or pass within?&mdash;To me both ways are fair.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Speak forth to all! The grief that these men bear<br/>
Is more than any fear for mine own death.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
I speak then what I heard from God.&mdash;Thus saith<br/>
Phoebus, our Lord and Seer, in clear command.<br/>
An unclean thing there is, hid in our land,<br/>
Eating the soil thereof: this ye shall cast<br/>
Out, and not foster till all help be past.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
How cast it out? What was the evil deed?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Hunt the men out from Thebes, or make them bleed<br/>
Who slew. For blood it is that stirs to-day.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Who was the man they killed? Doth Phoebus say?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
O King, there was of old King La&iuml;us<br/>
In Thebes, ere thou didst come to pilot us.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
I know: not that I ever saw his face.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
'Twas he. And Loxias now bids us trace<br/>
And smite the unknown workers of his fall.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Where in God's earth are they? Or how withal<br/>
Find the blurred trail of such an ancient stain?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
In Thebes, he said.&mdash;That which men seek amain<br/>
They find. 'Tis things forgotten that go by.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
And where did La&iuml;us meet them? Did he die<br/>
In Thebes, or in the hills, or some far land?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
To ask God's will in Delphi he had planned<br/>
His journey. Started and returned no more.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
And came there nothing back? No message, nor<br/>
None of his company, that ye might hear?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
They all were slain, save one man; blind with fear<br/>
He came, remembering naught&mdash;or almost naught.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
And what was that? One thing has often brought<br/>
Others, could we but catch one little clue.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
'Twas not one man, 'twas robbers&mdash;that he knew&mdash;<br/>
Who barred the road and slew him: a great band.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Robbers?... What robber, save the work was planned<br/>
By treason here, would dare a risk so plain?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
So some men thought. But La&iuml;us lay slain,<br/>
And none to avenge him in his evil day.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
And what strange mischief, when your master lay<br/>
Thus fallen, held you back from search and deed?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
The dark-songed Sphinx was here. We had no heed<br/>
Of distant sorrows, having death so near.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
It falls on me then. I will search and clear<br/>
This darkness.&mdash;Well hath Phoebus done, and thou<br/>
Too, to recall that dead king, even now,<br/>
And with you for the right I also stand,<br/>
To obey the God and succour this dear land.<br/>
Nor is it as for one that touches me<br/>
Far off; 'tis for mine own sake I must see<br/>
This sin cast out. Whoe'er it was that slew<br/>
La&iuml;us, the same wild hand may seek me too:<br/>
And caring thus for La&iuml;us, is but care<br/>
For mine own blood.&mdash;Up! Leave this altar-stair,<br/>
Children. Take from it every suppliant bough.<br/>
Then call the folk of Thebes. Say, 'tis my vow<br/>
To uphold them to the end. So God shall crown<br/>
Our greatness, or for ever cast us down.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>He goes in to the Palace.</em>]</p>

<h4>Priest:</h4>
<p>
My children, rise.&mdash;The King most lovingly<br/>
Hath promised all we came for. And may He<br/>
Who sent this answer, Phoebus, come confessed<br/>
Helper to Thebes, and strong to stay the pest.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>The suppliants gather up their boughs and stand at the side. The chorus of Theban elders enter.</em>]</p>

<h4>Chorus:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>They speak of the Oracle which they have not yet heard, and cry to</em> Apollo<em> by his special cry "I-&ecirc;."</em>]</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A Voice, a Voice, that is borne on the Holy Way!<br/>
What art thou, O Heavenly One, O Word of the Houses of Gold?<br/>
Thebes is bright with thee, and my heart it leapeth; yet is it cold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my spirit faints as I pray.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I-&ecirc;! I-&ecirc;!<br/>
What task, O Affrighter of Evil, what task shall thy people essay?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One new as our new-come affliction,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or an old toil returned with the years?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unveil thee, thou dread benediction,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope's daughter and Fear's.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>They pray to</em> Athena, Artemis, <em>and</em> Apollo.]</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Zeus-Child that knowest not death, to thee I pray,<br/>
O Pallas; next to thy Sister, who calleth Thebes her own,<br/>
Artemis, named of Fair Voices, who sitteth her orb&egrave;d throne<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the throng of the market way:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I-&ecirc;! I-&ecirc;!<br/>
Apollo, the Pure, the Far-smiter; O Three that keep evil away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If of old for our city's desire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the death-cloud hung close to her brow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye have banished the wound and the fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! come to us now!<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>They tell of the Pestilence.</em>]</p>

<p>
Wounds beyond telling; my people sick unto death;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And where is the counsellor, where is the sword of thought?<br/>
And Holy Earth in her increase perisheth:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The child dies and the mother awaketh not.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I-&ecirc;! I-&ecirc;!<br/>
We have seen them, one on another, gone as a bird is gone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Souls that are flame; yea, higher,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Swifter they pass than fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the rocks of the dying Sun.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>They end by a prayer to</em> Athena]</p>

<p>
Their city wasteth unnumbered; their children lie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where death hath cast them, unpitied, unwept upon.<br/>
The altars stand, as in seas of storm a high<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock standeth, and wives and mothers grey thereon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weep, weep and pray.<br/>
Lo, joy-cries to fright the Destroyer; a flash in the dark they rise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then die by the sobs overladen.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send help, O heaven-born Maiden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look on the light of her eyes!<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>To</em> Zeus, <em>that he drive out the Slayer,</em>]</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ares, the abhorred<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slayer, who bears no sword,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But shrieking, wrapped in fire, stands over me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make that he turn, yea, fly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken, wind-wasted, high<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the vexed hollow of the Vaster Sea;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or back to his own Thrace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To harbour shelterless.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Night hath spared, he bringeth end by day.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him, Him, O thou whose hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beareth the lightning brand,<br/>
O Father Zeus, now with thy thunder, slay and slay!<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>To</em> Apollo, Artemis, <em>and</em> Dionysus.]</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is thy gold-strung bow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Wolf-god, where the flow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of living shafts unconquered, from all ills<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our helpers? Where the white<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spears of thy Sister's light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Far-flashing as she walks the wolf-wild hills?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou, O Golden-crown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theban and named our own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O Wine-gleam, Voice of Joy, for ever more<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ringed with thy Maenads white,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacchus, draw near and smite,<br/>
Smite with thy glad-eyed flame the God whom Gods abhor.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>During the last lines</em> Oedipus <em>has come out from the Palace.</em>]</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Thou prayest: but my words if thou wilt hear<br/>
And bow thee to their judgement, strength is near<br/>
For help, and a great lightening of ill.
Thereof I come to speak, a stranger still<br/>
To all this tale, a stranger to the deed:<br/>
(Else, save that I were clueless, little need<br/>
Had I to cast my net so wide and far:)<br/>
Howbeit, I, being now as all ye are,<br/>
A Theban, to all Thebans high and low<br/>
Do make proclaim: if any here doth know<br/>
By what man's hand died La&iuml;us, your King,<br/>
Labdacus' son, I charge him that he bring<br/>
To me his knowledge. Let him feel no fear<br/>
If on a townsman's body he must clear<br/>
Our guilt: the man shall suffer no great ill,<br/>
But pass from Thebes, and live where else he will.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>No answer.</em>]</p>

<p>
Is it some alien from an alien shore<br/>
Ye know to have done the deed, screen him no more!<br/>
Good guerdon waits you now and a King's love<br/>
Hereafter.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hah! If still ye will not move<br/>
But, fearing for yourselves or some near friend,<br/>
Reject my charge, then hearken to what end<br/>
Ye drive me.&mdash;If in this place men there be<br/>
Who know and speak not, lo, I make decree<br/>
That, while in Thebes I bear the diadem,<br/>
No man shall greet, no man shall shelter them,<br/>
Nor give them water in their thirst, nor share<br/>
In sacrifice nor shrift nor dying prayer,<br/>
But thrust them from our doors, the thing they hide<br/>
Being this land's curse. Thus hath the God replied<br/>
This day to me from Delphi, and my sword<br/>
I draw thus for the dead and for God's word.<br/>
And lastly for the murderer, be it one
Hiding alone or more in unison,<br/>
I speak on him this curse: even as his soul<br/>
Is foul within him let his days be foul,<br/>
And life unfriended grind him till he die.<br/>
More: if he ever tread my hearth and I<br/>
Know it, be every curse upon my head<br/>
That I have spoke this day.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I have said<br/>
I charge ye strictly to fulfil and make<br/>
Perfect, for my sake, for Apollo's sake,<br/>
And this land's sake, deserted of her fruit<br/>
And cast out from her gods. Nay, were all mute<br/>
At Delphi, still 'twere strange to leave the thing<br/>
Unfollowed, when a true man and a King<br/>
Lay murdered. All should search. But I, as now<br/>
Our fortunes fall&mdash;his crown is on my brow,<br/>
His wife lies in my arms, and common fate,<br/>
Had but his issue been more fortunate,<br/>
Might well have joined our children&mdash;since this red<br/>
Chance hath so stamped its heel on La&iuml;us' head,<br/>
I am his champion left, and, as I would<br/>
For mine own father, choose for ill or good<br/>
This quest, to find the man who slew of yore<br/>
Labdacus' son, the son of Polydore,<br/>
Son of great Cadmus whom Agenor old<br/>
Begat, of Thebes first master. And, behold,<br/>
For them that aid me not, I pray no root<br/>
Nor seed in earth may bear them corn nor fruit,<br/>
No wife bear children, but this present curse<br/>
Cleave to them close and other woes yet worse.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough: ye other people of the land,<br/>
Whose will is one with mine, may Justice stand<br/>
Your helper, and all gods for evermore.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>The crowd disperses.</em>]</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
O King, even while thy curse yet hovers o'er<br/>
My head, I answer thee. I slew him not,<br/>
Nor can I shew the slayer. But, God wot,<br/>
If Phoebus sends this charge, let Phoebus read<br/>
Its meaning and reveal who did the deed.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Aye, that were just, if of his grace he would<br/>
Reveal it. How shall man compel his God?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
Second to that, methinks, 'twould help us most ...<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Though it be third, speak! Nothing should be lost.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
To our High Seer on earth vision is given<br/>
Most like to that High Phoebus hath in heaven.<br/>
Ask of Tiresias: he could tell thee true.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
That also have I thought for. Aye, and two<br/>
Heralds have sent ere now. 'Twas Creon set<br/>
Me on.&mdash;I marvel that he comes not yet.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
Our other clues are weak, old signs and far.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
What signs? I needs must question all that are.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
Some travellers slew him, the tale used to be.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
The tale, yes: but the witness, where is he?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
The man hath heard thy curses. If he knows<br/>
The taste of fear, he will not long stay close.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
He fear my words, who never feared the deed?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
Well, there is one shall find him.&mdash;See, they lead<br/>
Hither our Lord Tiresias, in whose mind<br/>
All truth is born, alone of human kind.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Enter</em> Tiresias <em>led by a young disciple. He is an old blind man in a prophet's robe, dark, unkempt and sinister in appearance.</em>]</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Tiresias, thou whose mind divineth well<br/>
All Truth, the spoken and the unspeakable,<br/>
The things of heaven and them that walk the earth;<br/>
Our city ... thou canst see, for all thy dearth<br/>
Of outward eyes, what clouds are over her.<br/>
In which, O gracious Lord, no minister<br/>
Of help, no champion, can we find at all<br/>
Save thee. For Phoebus&mdash;thou hast heard withal<br/>
His message&mdash;to our envoy hath decreed<br/>
One only way of help in this great need:<br/>
To find and smite with death or banishing,<br/>
Him who smote La&iuml;us, our ancient King.<br/>
Oh, grudge us nothing! Question every cry<br/>
Of birds, and all roads else of prophecy<br/>
Thou knowest. Save our city: save thine own<br/>
Greatness: save me; save all that yet doth groan<br/>
Under the dead man's wrong! Lo, in thy hand<br/>
We lay us. And, methinks, no work so grand<br/>
Hath man yet compassed, as, with all he can<br/>
Of chance or power, to help his fellow man.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Tiresias (<em>to himself</em>):</h4>
<p>
Ah me!<br/>
A fearful thing is knowledge, when to know<br/>
Helpeth no end. I knew this long ago,<br/>
But crushed it dead. Else had I never come.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
What means this? Comest thou so deep in gloom?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Tiresias:</h4>
<p>
Let me go back! Thy work shall weigh on thee<br/>
The less, if thou consent, and mine on me.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Prophet, this is not lawful; nay, nor kind<br/>
To Thebes, who feeds thee, thus to veil thy mind.<br/>
</p>

Naught lies with me! With thee, with thee there lies,<br/>

So?&mdash;I command thee by thine own word's power,<br/>

A gift, a thing I sought not&mdash;for this crown<br/>
Creon the stern and true, Creon mine own<br/>
Comrade, comes creeping in the dark to ban<br/>
And slay me; sending first this magic-man<br/>
And schemer, this false beggar-priest, whose eye<br/>
Is bright for gold and blind for prophecy?<br/>
Speak, thou. When hast thou ever shown thee strong<br/>
For aid? The She-Wolf of the woven song<br/>
Came, and thy art could find no word, no breath,<br/>
To save thy people from her riddling death.<br/>
'Twas scarce a secret, that, for common men<br/>
To unravel. There was need of Seer-craft then.<br/>
And thou hadst none to show. No fowl, no flame,<br/>
No God revealed it thee. 'Twas I that came,<br/>
Rude Oedipus, unlearned in wizard's lore,<br/>
And read her secret, and she spoke no more.<br/>
Whom now thou thinkest to hunt out, and stand<br/>
Foremost in honour at King Creon's hand.<br/>
I think ye will be sorry, thou and he<br/>
That shares thy sin-hunt. Thou dost look to me<br/>
An old man; else, I swear this day should bring<br/>
On thee the death thou plottest for thy King.<br/>

<p>
Lord Oedipus, these be but words of wrath,<br/>
All thou hast spoke and all the Prophet hath.<br/>
Which skills not. We must join, for ill or well,<br/>
In search how best to obey God's oracle.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Tiresias:</h4>
<p>
King though thou art, thou needs must bear the right<br/>
Of equal answer. Even in me is might<br/>
For thus much, seeing I live no thrall of thine,<br/>
But Lord Apollo's; neither do I sign<br/>
Where Creon bids me.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am blind, and thou<br/>
Hast mocked my blindness. Yea, I will speak now.<br/>
Eyes hast thou, but thy deeds thou canst not see<br/>
Nor where thou art, nor what things dwell with thee.<br/>
Whence art thou born? Thou know'st not; and unknown,<br/>
On quick and dead, on all that were thine own,<br/>
Thou hast wrought hate. For that across thy path<br/>
Rising, a mother's and a father's wrath,<br/>
Two-handed, shod with fire, from the haunts of men<br/>
Shall scourge thee, in thine eyes now light, but then<br/>
Darkness. Aye, shriek! What harbour of the sea,<br/>
What wild Kithairon shall not cry to thee<br/>
In answer, when thou hear'st what bridal song,<br/>
What wind among the torches, bore thy strong<br/>
Sail to its haven, not of peace but blood.<br/>
Yea, ill things multitude on multitude<br/>
Thou seest not, which so soon shall lay thee low,<br/>
Low as thyself, low as thy children.&mdash;Go,<br/>
Heap scorn on Creon and my lips withal:<br/>
For this I tell thee, never was there fall<br/>
Of pride, nor shall be, like to thine this day.<br/>

<p>
I knew thee not so dark a fool. I swear<br/>
'Twere long before I called thee, had I known.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Fool, say'st thou? Am I truly such an one?<br/>
The two who gave thee birth, they held me wise.<br/>
</p>

<p>

<p>
Then I will go.&mdash;Give me thine arm, my child.<br/>

<p>
Aye, help him quick.&mdash;To see him there makes wild<br/>
My heart. Once gone, he will not vex me more.<br/>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Turning again as he goes</em>]</p>

<p>
I fear thee not; nor will I go before<br/>
That word be spoken which I came to speak.<br/>
How canst thou ever touch me?&mdash;Thou dost seek<br/>
With threats and loud proclaim the man whose hand<br/>
Slew La&iuml;us. Lo, I tell thee, he doth stand<br/>
Here. He is called a stranger, but these days<br/>
Shall prove him Theban true, nor shall he praise<br/>
His birthright. Blind, who once had seeing eyes,<br/>
Beggared, who once had riches, in strange guise,<br/>
His staff groping before him, he shall crawl<br/>
O'er unknown earth, and voices round him call:<br/>
"Behold the brother-father of his own<br/>
Children, the seed, the sower and the sown,<br/>
Shame to his mother's blood, and to his sire<br/>
Son, murderer, incest-worker."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool thine ire<br/>
With thought of these, and if thou find that aught<br/>
Faileth, then hold my craft a thing of naught.<br/>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>They sing of the unknown murderer,</em><br/>

<p>
What man, what man is he whom the voice of Delphi's cell<br/>
Hath named of the bloody hand, of the deed no tongue may tell?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him fly, fly, for his need<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath found him; oh, where is the speed<br/>
That flew with the winds of old, the team of North-Wind's spell?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For feet there be that follow. Yea, thunder-shod<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And girt with fire he cometh, the Child of God;<br/>
And with him are they that fail not, the Sin-Hounds risen from Hell.<br/>
For the mountain hath spoken, a voice hath flashed from amid the snows,<br/>
That the wrath of the world go seek for the man whom no man knows.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he fled to the wild forest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To caves where the eagles nest?<br/>
O angry bull of the rocks, cast out from thy herd-fellows!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rage in his heart, and rage across his way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He toileth ever to beat from his ears away<br/>
The word that floateth about him, living, where'er he goes.<br/>

<p>
Yet strange, passing strange, the wise augur and his lore;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my heart it cannot speak; I deny not nor assent,<br/>
But float, float in wonder at things after and before;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did there lie between their houses some old wrath unspent,<br/>
That Corinth against Cadmus should do murder by the way?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No tale thereof they tell, nor no sign thereof they show;<br/>
Who dares to rise for vengeance and cast Oedipus away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a dark, dark death long ago!<br/>
Ah, Zeus knows, and Apollo, what is dark to mortal eyes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They are Gods. But a prophet, hath he vision more than mine?<br/>
Who hath seen? Who can answer? There be wise men and unwise.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will wait, I will wait, for the proving of the sign.<br/>
But I list not nor hearken when they speak Oedipus ill.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw his face of yore, when the riddling singer passed;<br/>
And we knew him that he loved us, and we saw him great in skill.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my heart shall uphold him to the last!<br/>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Good brother citizens, a frantic word<br/>
I hear is spoken by our chosen Lord<br/>
Oedipus against me, and here am come<br/>
Indignant. If he dreams, 'mid all this doom<br/>
That weighs upon us, he hath had from me<br/>
Or deed or lightest thought of injury, ...<br/>
'Fore God, I have no care to see the sun<br/>
Longer with such a groaning name. Not one<br/>
Wound is it, but a multitude, if now<br/>
All Thebes must hold me guilty&mdash;aye, and thou<br/>
And all who loved me&mdash;of a deed so foul.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
If words were spoken, it was scarce the soul<br/>
That spoke them: 'twas some sudden burst of wrath.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
The charge was made, then, that Tiresias hath<br/>
Made answer false, and that I bribed him, I?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
It was&mdash;perchance for jest. I know not why.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
His heart beat true, his eyes looked steadily<br/>
And fell not, laying such a charge on me?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
I know not. I have no eyes for the thing<br/>
My masters do.&mdash;But see, here comes the King.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Enter</em> Oedipus <em>from the Palace.</em>]</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
How now, assassin? Walking at my gate<br/>
With eye undimmed, thou plotter demonstrate<br/>
Against this life, and robber of my crown?<br/>
God help thee! Me! What was it set me down<br/>
Thy butt? So dull a brain hast found in me<br/>
Aforetime, such a faint heart, not to see<br/>
Thy work betimes, or seeing not to smite?<br/>
Art thou not rash, this once! It needeth might<br/>
Of friends, it needeth gold, to make a throne<br/>
Thy quarry; and I fear me thou hast none.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
One thing alone I ask thee. Let me speak<br/>
As thou hast spoken; then, with knowledge, wreak<br/>
Thy judgement. I accept it without fear.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
More skill hast thou to speak than I to hear<br/>
Thee. There is peril found in thee and hate.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
That one thing let me answer ere too late.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
One thing be sure of, that thy plots are known.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
The man who thinks that bitter pride alone<br/>
Can guide him, without thought&mdash;his mind is sick.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Who thinks to slay his brother with a trick<br/>
And suffer not himself, his eyes are blind.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Thy words are more than just. But say what kind<br/>
Of wrong thou fanciest I have done thee. Speak.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Didst urge me, or didst urge me not, to seek<br/>
A counsel from that man of prophecies?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
So judged I then, nor now judge otherwise.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Suddenly seeing a mode of attack.</em>]</p>

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>The words seem to choke him.</em>]</p>

Speak on. I cannot understand thee thus.<br/>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>With an effort.</em>]</p>

<p>
Passed in that bloody tempest from men's sight?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Long years and old. I scarce can tell them right.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
At that time was this seer in Thebes, or how?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
He was; most wise and honoured, even as now.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
At that time did he ever speak my name?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
No. To mine ear at least it never came.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Held you no search for those who slew your King?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
For sure we did, but found not anything.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
How came the all-knowing seer to leave it so?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Ask him! I speak not where I cannot know.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
One thing thou canst, with knowledge full, I wot.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Speak it. If true, I will conceal it not.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
This: that until he talked with thee, the seer<br/>
Ne'er spoke of me as La&iuml;us' murderer.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
I know not if he hath so spoken now.<br/>
I heard him not.&mdash;But let me ask and thou<br/>
Answer me true, as I have answered thee.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Ask, ask! Thou shalt no murder find in me.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
My sister is thy wife this many a day?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
That charge it is not in me to gainsay.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Thou reignest, giving equal reign to her?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Always to her desire I minister.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Were we not all as one, she thou and I?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Yes, thou false friend! There lies thy treachery.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Not so! Nay, do but follow me and scan<br/>
Thine own charge close. Think'st thou that any man<br/>
Would rather rule and be afraid than rule<br/>
And sleep untroubled? Nay, where lives the fool&mdash;<br/>
I know them not nor am I one of them&mdash;<br/>
Who careth more to bear a monarch's name<br/>
Than do a monarch's deeds? As now I stand<br/>
All my desire I compass at thy hand.<br/>
Were I the King, full half my deeds were done<br/>
To obey the will of others, not mine own.<br/>
Were that as sweet, when all the tale were told,<br/>
As this calm griefless princedom that I hold<br/>
And silent power? Am I so blind of brain<br/>
That ease with glory tires me, and I fain<br/>
Must change them? All men now give me God-speed,<br/>
All smile to greet me. If a man hath need<br/>
Of thee, 'tis me he calleth to the gate,<br/>
As knowing that on my word hangs the fate<br/>
Of half he craves. Is life like mine a thing<br/>
To cast aside and plot to be a King?<br/>
Doth a sane man turn villain in an hour?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, I never lusted thus for power<br/>
Nor bore with any man who turned such lust<br/>
To doing.&mdash;But enough. I claim but just<br/>
Question. Go first to Pytho; find if well<br/>
And true I did report God's oracle.<br/>
Next, seek in Thebes for any plots entwined<br/>
Between this seer and me; which if ye find,<br/>
Then seize and strike me dead. Myself that day<br/>
Will sit with thee as judge and bid thee Slay!<br/>
But damn me not on one man's guess.&mdash;'Tis all<br/>
Unjust: to call a traitor true, to call<br/>
A true man traitor with no cause nor end!<br/>
And this I tell thee. He who plucks a friend<br/>
Out from his heart hath lost a treasured thing<br/>
Dear as his own dear life.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Time shall bring<br/>
Truth back. 'Tis Time alone can make men know<br/>
What hearts are true; the false one day can show.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
To one that fears to fall his words are wise,<br/>
O King; in thought the swift win not the prize.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
When he is swift who steals against my reign<br/>
With plots, then swift am I to plot again.<br/>
Wait patient, and his work shall have prevailed<br/>
Before I move, and mine for ever failed.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
How then? To banish me is thy intent?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Death is the doom I choose, not banishment.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Wilt never soften, never trust thy friend?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
First I would see how traitors meet their end.<br/>
</p>

<p>
I see thou wilt not think.<br/>
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think to save<br/>
My life.<br/>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think, too, of mine.<br/>

</p>

<p>
Yes.... What, if thou art blind in everything?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
The King must be obeyed.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not if the King<br/>
Does evil.<br/>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To your King! Ho, Thebes, mine own!<br/>
</p>

<p>
Thebes is my country, not the King's alone.<br/>

<p>
Stay, Princes, stay! See, on the Castle stair<br/>
The Queen Jocasta standeth. Show to her<br/>
Your strife. She will assuage it as is well.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Vain men, what would ye with this angry swell<br/>
Of words heart-blinded? Is there in your eyes<br/>
No pity, thus, when all our city lies<br/>
Bleeding, to ply your privy hates?... Alack,<br/>
My lord, come in!&mdash;Thou, Creon, get thee back<br/>
To thine own house. And stir not to such stress<br/>
Of peril griefs that are but nothingness.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Sister, it is the pleasure of thy lord,<br/>
Our King, to do me deadly wrong. His word<br/>
Is passed on me: 'tis banishment or death.<br/>
</p>

<p>
I found him ... I deny not what he saith,<br/>
My Queen ... with craft and malice practising<br/>
Against my life.<br/>
</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye Gods, if such a thing<br/>
Hath once been in my thoughts, may I no more<br/>
See any health on earth, but, festered o'er<br/>
With curses, die!&mdash;Have done. There is mine oath.<br/>
</p>

<p>
In God's name, Oedipus, believe him, both<br/>
For my sake, and for these whose hearts are all<br/>
Thine own, and for my brother's oath withal.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Strophe</em>]</p>

<p>
Yield; consent; think! My Lord, I conjure thee!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would ye have me do?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reject not one who never failed his troth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of old and now is strong in his great oath.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Dost know what this prayer means?<br/>
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, verily!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say then the meaning true.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not have thee cast to infamy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of guilt, where none is proved,<br/>
One who hath sworn and whom thou once hast loved.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
'Tis that ye seek? For me, then ... understand<br/>
Well ... ye seek death or exile from the land.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
No, by the God of Gods, the all-seeing Sun!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May he desert me here, and every friend<br/>
With him, to death and utterest malison,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If e'er my heart could dream of such an end!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it bleedeth, it bleedeth sore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a land half slain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we join to the griefs of yore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Griefs of you twain.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Oh, let him go, though it be utterly<br/>
My death, or flight from Thebes in beggary.<br/>
'Tis thy sad lips, not his, that make me know<br/>
Pity. Him I shall hate, where'er he go.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
I see thy mercy moving full of hate<br/>
And slow; thy wrath came swift and desperate.<br/>
Methinks, of all the pain that such a heart<br/>
Spreadeth, itself doth bear the bitterest part.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Oh, leave me and begone!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go, wronged sore<br/>
By thee. These friends will trust me as before.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Antistrophe</em>]</p>

<p>
Queen, wilt thou lead him to his house again?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will, when I have heard.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There fell some word, some blind imagining<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between them. Things known foolish yet can sting.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
From both the twain it rose?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From both the twain.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, and what was the word?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely there is enough of evil stirred,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Thebes heaves on the swell<br/>
Of storm.&mdash;Oh, leave this lying where it fell.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
So be it, thou wise counsellor! Make slight<br/>
My wrong, and blunt my purpose ere it smite.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
O King, not once I have answered. Visibly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mad were I, lost to all wise usages,<br/>
To seek to cast thee from us. 'Twas from thee<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw of old blue sky and summer seas,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Thebes in the storm and rain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reeled, like to die.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, if thou canst, again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue sky, blue sky...!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Husband, in God's name, say what hath ensued<br/>
Of ill, that thou shouldst seek so dire a feud.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
I will, wife. I have more regard for thee<br/>
Than these.&mdash;Thy brother plots to murder me.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Speak on. Make all thy charge. Only be clear.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
He says that I am La&iuml;us' murderer.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Says it himself? Says he hath witnesses?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Nay, of himself he ventures nothing. 'Tis<br/>
This priest, this hellish seer, makes all the tale.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
The seer?&mdash;Then tear thy terrors like a veil<br/>
And take free breath. A seer? No human thing<br/>
Born on the earth hath power for conjuring<br/>
Truth from the dark of God.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, I will tell<br/>
An old tale. There came once an oracle<br/>
To La&iuml;us: I say not from the God<br/>
Himself, but from the priests and seers who trod<br/>
His sanctuary: if ever son were bred<br/>
From him and me, by that son's hand, it said,<br/>
La&iuml;us must die. And he, the tale yet stays<br/>
Among us, at the crossing of three ways<br/>
Was slain by robbers, strangers. And my son&mdash;<br/>
God's mercy!&mdash;scarcely the third day was gone<br/>
When La&iuml;us took, and by another's hand<br/>
Out on the desert mountain, where the land<br/>
Is rock, cast him to die. Through both his feet<br/>
A blade of iron they drove. Thus did we cheat<br/>
Apollo of his will. My child could slay<br/>
No father, and the King could cast away<br/>
The fear that dogged him, by his child to die<br/>
Murdered.&mdash;Behold the fruits of prophecy!<br/>
Which heed not thou! God needs not that a seer<br/>
Help him, when he would make his dark things clear.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Woman, what turmoil hath thy story wrought<br/>
Within me! What up-stirring of old thought!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
What thought? It turns thee like a frightened thing.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
'Twas at the crossing of three ways this King<br/>
Was murdered? So I heard or so I thought.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
That was the tale. It is not yet forgot.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
The crossing of three ways! And in what land?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Phokis 'tis called. A road on either hand<br/>
From Delphi comes and Daulia, in a glen.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
How many years and months have passed since then?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
'Twas but a little time before proclaim<br/>
Was made of thee for king, the tidings came.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
My God, what hast thou willed to do with me?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Oedipus, speak! What is it troubles thee?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Ask me not yet. But say, what build, what height<br/>
Had La&iuml;us? Rode he full of youth and might?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Tall, with the white new gleaming on his brow<br/>
He walked. In shape just such a man as thou.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
God help me! I much fear that I have wrought<br/>
A curse on mine own head, and knew it not.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
How sayst thou? O my King, I look on thee<br/>
And tremble.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus (<em>to himself</em>):</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horror, if the blind can see!<br/>
Answer but one thing and 'twill all be clear.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Speak. I will answer though I shake with fear.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Went he with scant array, or a great band<br/>
Of arm&egrave;d followers, like a lord of land?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Four men were with him, one a herald; one<br/>
Chariot there was, where La&iuml;us rode alone.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Aye me! Tis clear now.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman, who could bring<br/>
To Thebes the story of that manslaying?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
A house-thrall, the one man they failed to slay.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
The one man...? Is he in the house to-day?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Indeed no. When he came that day, and found<br/>
Thee on the throne where once sat La&iuml;us crowned,<br/>
He took my hand and prayed me earnestly<br/>
To send him to the mountain heights, to be<br/>
A herdsman, far from any sight or call<br/>
Of Thebes. And there I sent him. 'Twas a thrall<br/>
Good-hearted, worthy a far greater boon.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Canst find him? I would see this herd, and soon.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
'Tis easy. But what wouldst thou with the herd?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
I fear mine own voice, lest it spoke a word<br/>
Too much; whereof this man must tell me true.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
The man shall come.&mdash;My lord, methinks I too<br/>
Should know what fear doth work thee this despite.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Thou shalt. When I am tossed to such an height<br/>
Of dark foreboding, woman, when my mind<br/>
Faceth such straits as these, where should I find<br/>
A mightier love than thine?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father&mdash;thus<br/>
I tell thee the whole tale&mdash;was Polybus,<br/>
In Corinth King; my mother Merop&ecirc;<br/>
Of Dorian line. And I was held to be<br/>
The proudest in Corinthia, till one day<br/>
A thing befell: strange was it, but no way<br/>
Meet for such wonder and such rage as mine.<br/>
A feast it was, and some one flushed with wine<br/>
Cried out at me that I was no true son<br/>
Of Polybus. Oh, I was wroth! That one<br/>
Day I kept silence, but the morrow morn<br/>
I sought my parents, told that tale of scorn<br/>
And claimed the truth; and they rose in their pride<br/>
And smote the mocker.... Aye, they satisfied<br/>
All my desire; yet still the cavil gnawed<br/>
My heart, and still the story crept abroad.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At last I rose&mdash;my father knew not, nor<br/>
My mother&mdash;and went forth to Pytho's floor<br/>
To ask. And God in that for which I came<br/>
Rejected me, but round me, like a flame,<br/>
His voice flashed other answers, things of woe,<br/>
Terror, and desolation. I must know<br/>
My mother's body and beget thereon<br/>
A race no mortal eye durst look upon,<br/>
And spill in murder mine own father's blood.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard, and, hearing, straight from where I stood,<br/>
No landmark but the stars to light my way,<br/>
Fled, fled from the dark south where Corinth lay,<br/>
To lands far off, where never I might see<br/>
My doom of scorn fulfilled. On bitterly<br/>
I strode, and reached the region where, so saith<br/>
Thy tale, that King of Thebes was struck to death....<br/>
Wife, I will tell thee true. As one in daze<br/>
I walked, till, at the crossing of three ways,<br/>
A herald, like thy tale, and o'er his head<br/>
A man behind strong horses charioted<br/>
Met me. And both would turn me from the path,<br/>
He and a thrall in front. And I in wrath<br/>
Smote him that pushed me&mdash;'twas a groom who led<br/>
The horses. Not a word the master said,<br/>
But watched, and as I passed him on the road<br/>
Down on my head his iron-branch&egrave;d goad<br/>
Stabbed. But, by heaven, he rued it! In a flash<br/>
I swung my staff and saw the old man crash<br/>
Back from his car in blood.... Then all of them<br/>
I slew.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, if that man's unspoken name<br/>
Had aught of La&iuml;us in him, in God's eye<br/>
What man doth move more miserable than I,<br/>
More dogged by the hate of heaven! No man, kin<br/>
Nor stranger, any more may take me in;<br/>
No man may greet me with a word, but all<br/>
Cast me from out their houses. And withal<br/>
'Twas mine own self that laid upon my life<br/>
These curses.&mdash;And I hold the dead man's wife<br/>
In these polluting arms that spilt his soul....<br/>
Am I a thing born evil? Am I foul<br/>
In every vein? Thebes now doth banish me,<br/>
And never in this exile must I see<br/>
Mine ancient folk of Corinth, never tread<br/>
The land that bore me; else my mother's bed<br/>
Shall be defiled, and Polybus, my good<br/>
Father, who loved me well, be rolled in blood.<br/>
If one should dream that such a world began<br/>
In some slow devil's heart, that hated man,<br/>
Who should deny him?&mdash;God, as thou art clean,<br/>
Suffer not this, oh, suffer not this sin<br/>
To be, that e'er I look on such a day!<br/>
Out of all vision of mankind away<br/>
To darkness let me fall ere such a fate<br/>
Touch me, so unclean and so desolate!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
I tremble too, O King; but till thou hear<br/>
From him who saw, oh, let hope conquer fear.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
One shred of hope I still have, and therefore<br/>
Will wait the herdsman's coming. 'Tis no more.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
He shall come. But what further dost thou seek?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
This. If we mark him close and find him speak<br/>
As thou hast, then I am lifted from my dread.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
What mean'st thou? Was there something that I said...?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Thou said'st he spoke of robbers, a great band,<br/>
That slaughtered La&iuml;us' men. If still he stand<br/>
To the same tale, the guilt comes not my way.<br/>
One cannot be a band. But if he say<br/>
One lonely loin-girt man, then visibly<br/>
This is God's finger pointing toward me.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Be sure of this. He told the story so<br/>
When first he came. All they that heard him know,<br/>
Not only I. He cannot change again<br/>
Now. And if change he should, O Lord of men,<br/>
No change of his can make the prophecy<br/>
Of La&iuml;us' death fall true. He was to die<br/>
Slain by my son. So Loxias spake.... My son!<br/>
He slew no man, that poor deserted one<br/>
That died.... And I will no more turn mine eyes<br/>
This way nor that for all their prophecies.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Woman, thou counsellest well. Yet let it not<br/>
Escape thee. Send and have the herdsman brought.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
That will I.&mdash;Come. Thou knowest I ne'er would do<br/>
Nor think of aught, save thou wouldst have it so.<br/>

<p>
Toward God's great mysteries, oh, let me move<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unstain&egrave;d till I die<br/>
In speech or doing; for the Laws thereof<br/>
Are holy, walkers upon ways above,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in the far blue sky;<br/>
Their father is Olympus uncreate;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man hath made nor told<br/>
Their being; neither shall Oblivion set<br/>
Sleep on their eyes, for in them lives a great<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit and grows not old.

'Tis Pride that breeds the tyrant; drunken deep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With perilous things is she,<br/>
Which bring not peace: up, reeling, steep on steep<br/>
She climbs, till lo, the rock-edge, and the leap<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that which needs must be,<br/>
The land where the strong foot is no more strong!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet is there surely Pride<br/>
That saves a city; God preserve it long!<br/>
I judge not. Only through all maze of wrong<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be God, not man, my guide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the arrow that slays askance?<br/>

<p>
Lords of the land, the ways my thought hath trod<br/>
Lead me in worship to these shrines of God<br/>
With flowers and incense flame. So dire a storm<br/>
Doth shake the King, sin, dread and every form<br/>
Of grief the world knows. 'Tis the wise man's way<br/>
To judge the morrow by the yester day;<br/>
Which he doth never, but gives eye and ear<br/>
To all who speak, will they but speak of fear.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing no word of mine hath power to heal<br/>
His torment, therefore forth to thee I steal,<br/>
O Slayer of the Wolf, O Lord of Light,<br/>
Apollo: thou art near us, and of right<br/>
Dost hold us thine: to thee in prayer I fall.<br/>

From Corinth; bearing news that Polybus<br/>
Thy father is no more. He has found his death.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
How?&mdash;Stranger, speak thyself. This that she saith ...<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
Is sure. If that is the first news ye crave,<br/>
I tell thee, Polybus lieth in his grave.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Not murdered?... How? Some passing of disease?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
A slight thing turns an old life to its peace.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Poor father!... 'Tis by sickness he is dead?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
The growing years lay heavy on his head.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
O wife, why then should man fear any more<br/>
The voice of Pytho's dome, or cower before<br/>
These birds that shriek above us? They foretold<br/>
Me for my father's murderer; and behold,<br/>
He lies in Corinth dead, and here am I<br/>
And never touched the sword.... Or did he die<br/>
In grief for me who left him? In that way<br/>
I may have wrought his death.... But come what may,<br/>
He sleepeth in his grave and with him all<br/>
This deadly seercraft, of no worth at all.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Dear Lord, long since did I not show thee clear...?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Indeed, yes. I was warped by mine own fear.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Now thou wilt cast it from thee, and forget.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Forget my mother?... It is not over yet.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
What should man do with fear, who hath but Chance<br/>
Above him, and no sight nor governance<br/>
Of things to be? To live as life may run,<br/>
No fear, no fret, were wisest 'neath the sun.<br/>
And thou, fear not thy mother. Prophets deem<br/>
A deed wrought that is wrought but in a dream.<br/>
And he to whom these things are nothing, best<br/>
Will bear his burden.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thou counsellest<br/>
Were good, save that my mother liveth still.<br/>
And, though thy words be wise, for good or ill<br/>
Her I still fear.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of thy father's tomb!<br/>
Like light across our darkness it hath come.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Great light; but while she lives I fly from her.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
What woman, Prince, doth fill thee so with fear?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Merop&ecirc;, friend, who dwelt with Polybus.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
What in Queen Merop&ecirc; should fright thee thus?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
A voice of God, stranger, of dire import.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
Meet for mine ears? Or of some secret sort?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Nay, thou must hear, and Corinth. Long ago<br/>
Apollo spake a doom, that I should know<br/>
My mother's flesh, and with mine own hand spill<br/>
My father's blood.&mdash;'Tis that, and not my will,<br/>
Hath kept me always far from Corinth. So;<br/>
Life hath dealt kindly with me, yet men know<br/>
On earth no comfort like a mother's face.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
'Tis that, hath kept thee exiled in this place?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
That, and the fear too of my father's blood.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
Then, surely, Lord ... I came but for thy good ... <br/>
'Twere well if from that fear I set thee free.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Ah, couldst thou! There were rich reward for thee.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
To say truth, I had hoped to lead thee home<br/>
Now, and myself to get some good therefrom.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Nay; where my parents are I will not go.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
My son, 'tis very clear thou dost not know<br/>
What road thou goest.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? In God's name, say!<br/>
How clear?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis this, keeps thee so long away
From Corinth?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis the fear lest that word break
One day upon me true.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear lest thou take
Defilement from the two that gave thee birth?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
'Tis that, old man, 'tis that doth fill the earth
With terror.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then thy terror all hath been
For nothing.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? Were not your King and Queen<br/>
My parents?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polybus was naught to thee
In blood.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? He, my father!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was he<br/>
As much as I, but no more.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art naught;<br/>
'Twas he begot me.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas not I begot
Oedipus, neither was it he.<br/>
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What wild
Fancy, then, made him name me for his child?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
Thou wast his child&mdash;by gift. Long years ago
Mine own hand brought thee to him.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming so,
From a strange hand, he gave me that great love?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
He had no child, and the desire thereof<br/>
Held him.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou didst find somewhere&mdash;or buy&mdash;
A child for him?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found it in a high<br/>
Glen of Kithairon.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Movement of</em> Jocasta, <em>who stands riveted with dread, unnoticed by the others.</em></p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yonder? To what end<br/>
Wast travelling in these parts?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to tend<br/>
The flocks here on the mountain.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wast one<br/>
That wandered, tending sheep for hire?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My son,<br/>
That day I was the saviour of a King.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
How saviour? Was I in some suffering<br/>
Or peril?
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine own feet a tale could speak.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Ah me! What ancient pain stirs half awake<br/>
Within me!
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas a spike through both thy feet.<br/>
I set thee free.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange scorn that, to greet<br/>
A babe new on the earth!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that they fain<br/>
Must call thee Oedipus, "<em>Who-walks-in-pain</em>."<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Who called me so&mdash;father or mother? Oh,<br/>
In God's name, speak!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not. He should know<br/>
Who brought thee.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So: I was not found by thee.<br/>
Thou hadst me from another?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye; to me<br/>
One of the shepherds gave the babe, to bear<br/>
Far off.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shepherd? Know'st thou not? Declare<br/>
All that thou knowest.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By my memory, then,<br/>
I think they called him one of La&iuml;us' men.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
That La&iuml;us who was king in Thebes of old?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
The same. My man did herding in his fold.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Is he yet living? Can I see his face?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Turning to the Chorus.</em><br/>

<p>
Ye will know that, being natives to the place.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
How?&mdash;Is there one of you within my pale<br/>
Standing, that knows the shepherd of his tale?<br/>
Ye have seen him on the hills? Or in this town?<br/>
Speak! For the hour is come that all be known.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
I think 'twill be the Peasant Man, the same,<br/>
Thou hast sought long time to see.&mdash;His place and name<br/>
Our mistress, if she will, can tell most clear.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jocasta <em>remains as if she heard nothing.</em>]</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Thou hear'st him, wife. The herd whose presence here<br/>
We craved for, is it he this man would say?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
He saith ... What of it? Ask not; only pray<br/>
Not to remember.... Tales are vainly told.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
'Tis mine own birth. How can I, when I hold<br/>
Such clues as these, refrain from knowing all?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
For God's love, no! Not if thou car'st at all<br/>
For thine own life.... My anguish is enough.
</p>

<h4>Oedipus (<em>bitterly</em>):</h4>
<p>
Fear not!... Though I be thrice of slavish stuff<br/>
From my third grand-dam down, it shames not thee.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
Ask no more. I beseech thee.... Promise me!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
To leave the Truth half-found? 'Tis not my mood.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
I understand; and tell thee what is good.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Thy good doth weary me.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O child of woe,<br/>
I pray God, I pray God, thou never know!<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Turning from her.</em>]</p>

<p>
Go, fetch the herdsman straight!&mdash;This Queen of mine<br/>
May walk alone to boast her royal line.
</p>

<h4>Jocasta:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>She twice draws in her breath through her teeth, as if in some sharp pain.</em>]</p>

<p>
Unhappy one, goodbye! Goodbye before<br/>
I go: this once, and never never more!<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>She comes towards him as though to take a last farewell, then stops suddenly, turns, and rushes into the Palace.</em></p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
King, what was that? She passed like one who flies<br/>
In very anguish. Dread is o'er mine eyes<br/>
Lest from this silence break some storm of wrong.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Break what break will! My mind abideth strong<br/>
To know the roots, how low soe'er they be,<br/>
Which grew to Oedipus. This woman, she<br/>
Is proud, methinks, and fears my birth and name<br/>
Will mar her nobleness. But I, no shame<br/>
Can ever touch me. I am Fortune's child,<br/>
Not man's; her mother face hath ever smiled<br/>
Above me, and my brethren of the sky,<br/>
The changing Moons, have changed me low and high.<br/>
There is my lineage true, which none shall wrest<br/>
From me; who then am I to fear this quest?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Chorus:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>They sing</em> Oedipus <em>as the foundling of their own Theban mountain, Kithairon, and doubtless of divine birth.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Strophe</em>]</p>

<p>
If I, O Kithairon, some vision can borrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From seercraft, if still there is wit in the old,<br/>
Long, long, through the deep-orb&egrave;d Moon of the morrow&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So hear me, Olympus!&mdash;thy tale shall be told.<br/>
O mountain of Thebes, a new Theban shall praise thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One born of thy bosom, one nursed at thy springs;<br/>
And the old men shall dance to thy glory, and raise thee<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To worship, O bearer of joy to my kings.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou, we pray,<br/>
Look down in peace, O Apollo; I-&ecirc;, I-&ecirc;!<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Antistrophe</em></p>

<p>
What Oread mother, unaging, unweeping,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did bear thee, O Babe, to the Crag-walker Pan;<br/>
Or perchance to Apollo? He loveth the leaping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of herds on the rock-ways unhaunted of man.<br/>
Or was it the lord of Cyll&ecirc;n&ecirc;, who found thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or glad Dionysus, whose home is the height,<br/>
Who knew thee his own on the mountain, as round thee<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Brides of Helicon laughed for delight?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis there, 'tis there,<br/>
The joy most liveth of all his dance and prayer.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
If I may judge, ye Elders, who have ne'er<br/>
Seen him, methinks I see the shepherd there<br/>
Whom we have sought so long. His weight of years<br/>
Fits well with our Corinthian messenger's;<br/>
And, more, I know the men who guide his way,<br/>
Bondsmen of mine own house.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, friend, wilt say<br/>
Most surely, who hast known the man of old.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
I know him well. A shepherd of the fold<br/>
Of La&iuml;us, one he trusted more than all.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>The</em> Shepherd <em>comes in, led by two thralls. He is an old man and seems terrified.</em></p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Thou first, our guest from Corinth: say withal<br/>
Is this the man?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the man, O King.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Addressing the</em> Shepherd.<br/>

<p>
Old man! Look up, and answer everything<br/>
I ask thee.&mdash;Thou wast La&iuml;us' man of old?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Shepherd:</h4>
<p>
Born in his house I was, not bought with gold.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
What kind of work, what way of life, was thine?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Shepherd:</h4>
<p>
Most of my days I tended sheep or kine.<br/>
</p>

<p>
What was thy camping ground at midsummer?<br/>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes Kithairon, sometimes mountains near.<br/>

<p>
Saw'st ever there this man thou se&euml;st now?<br/>

<h4>Shepherd:</h4>
<p>
There, Lord? What doing?&mdash;What man meanest thou?<br/>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Pointing to the</em> Stranger.]</p>

<p>
Look! Hath he ever crossed thy path before?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Shepherd:</h4>
<p>
I call him not to mind, I must think more.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
Small wonder that, O King! But I will throw<br/>
Light on his memories.&mdash;Right well I know<br/>
He knows the time when, all Kithairon through,<br/>
I with one wandering herd and he with two,<br/>
Three times we neighboured one another, clear<br/>
From spring to autumn stars, a good half-year.<br/>
At winter's fall we parted; he drove down<br/>
To his master's fold, and I back to mine own....<br/>
Dost call it back, friend? Was it as I say?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Shepherd:</h4>
<p>
It was. It was.... 'Tis all so far away.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stranger:</h4>
<p>
Say then: thou gavest me once, there in the wild,<br/>
A babe to rear far off as mine own child?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Shepherd:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>His terror returning.</em>]</p>

<p>
What does this mean? To what end askest thou?<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Pointing to</em> Oedipus.]</p>

<p>
That babe has grown, friend. 'Tis our master now.<br/>

<h4>Shepherd:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>He slowly understands, then stands for a moment horror-struck.</em>]</p>

<p>
No, in the name of death!... Fool, hold thy peace.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>He lifts his staff at the</em> Stranger.]</p>

<p>
Ha, greybeard! Wouldst thou strike him?&mdash;'Tis not his<br/>
Offences, 'tis thine own we need to mend.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Shepherd:</h4>
<p>
Most gentle master, how do I offend?<br/>
</p>

<p>
Whence came that babe whereof he questioneth?<br/>
</p>

<p>
He doth not know ... 'tis folly ... what he saith.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Thou wilt not speak for love; but pain maybe ...<br/>
</p>

<p>
I am very old. Ye would not torture me.<br/>

<p>
Back with his arms, ye bondmen! Hold him so.<br/>

<p>

<p>
Didst give this man the child, as he doth say?<br/>

It came.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didst thou, then, let him go<br/>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O King, I pitied him.<br/>
I thought the man would save him to some dim<br/>
And distant land, beyond all fear.... And he,<br/>
To worse than death, did save him!... Verily,<br/>
If thou art he whom this man telleth of,<br/>
To sore affliction thou art born.<br/>
</p>

All, all, shall be fulfilled.... Oh, on these eyes<br/>
Shed light no more, ye everlasting skies<br/>
That know my sin! I have sinned in birth and breath.<br/>
I have sinned with Woman. I have sinned with Death.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Zeus, when the riddling breath<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was stayed and the Maid of Death<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slain, and we saw him through<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O great King, our master,<br/>

<h4>Messenger:</h4>
<p>
O ye above this land in honour old<br/>
Exalted, what a tale shall ye be told,<br/>
What sights shall see, and tears of horror shed,<br/>
If still your hearts be true to them that led<br/>
Your sires! There runs no river, well I ween,<br/>
Not Phasis nor great Ister, shall wash clean<br/>
This house of all within that hideth&mdash;nay,<br/>
Nor all that creepeth forth to front the day,<br/>
Of purposed horror. And in misery<br/>
That woundeth most which men have willed to be.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
No lack there was in what we knew before<br/>
Of food for heaviness. What bring'st thou more?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Messenger:</h4>
<p>
One thing I bring thee first.... 'Tis quickly said.<br/>
Jocasta, our anointed queen, is dead.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
Unhappy woman! How came death to her?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Messenger:</h4>
<p>
By her own hand.... Oh, of what passed in there<br/>
Ye have been spared the worst. Ye cannot see.<br/>
Howbeit, with that which still is left in me<br/>
Of mind and memory, ye shall hear her fate.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one entranced with passion, through the gate<br/>
She passed, the white hands flashing o'er her head,<br/>
Like blades that tear, and fled, unswerving fled,<br/>
Toward her old bridal room, and disappeared<br/>
And the doors crashed behind her. But we heard<br/>
Her voice within, crying to him of old,<br/>
Her La&iuml;us, long dead; and things untold<br/>
Of the old kiss unforgotten, that should bring<br/>
The lover's death and leave the loved a thing<br/>
Of horror, yea, a field beneath the plough<br/>
For sire and son: then wailing bitter-low<br/>
Across that bed of births unreconciled,<br/>
Husband from husband born and child from child.<br/>
And, after that, I know not how her death<br/>
Found her. For sudden, with a roar of wrath,<br/>
Burst Oedipus upon us. Then, I ween,<br/>
We marked no more what passion held the Queen,<br/>
But him, as in the fury of his stride,<br/>
"A sword! A sword! And show me here," he cried,<br/>
"That wife, no wife, that field of bloodstained earth<br/>
Where husband, father, sin on sin, had birth,<br/>
Polluted generations!" While he thus<br/>
Raged on, some god&mdash;for sure 'twas none of us&mdash;<br/>
Showed where she was; and with a shout away,<br/>
As though some hand had pointed to the prey,<br/>
He dashed him on the chamber door. The straight<br/>
Door-bar of oak, it bent beneath his weight,<br/>
Shook from its sockets free, and in he burst<br/>
To the dark chamber.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There we saw her first<br/>
Hanged, swinging from a noose, like a dead bird.<br/>
He fell back when he saw her. Then we heard<br/>
A miserable groan, and straight he found<br/>
And loosed the strangling knot, and on the ground<br/>
Laid her.&mdash;Ah, then the sight of horror came!<br/>
The pin of gold, broad-beaten like a flame,<br/>
He tore from off her breast, and, left and right,<br/>
Down on the shuddering orbits of his sight<br/>
Dashed it: "Out! Out! Ye never more shall see<br/>
Me nor the anguish nor the sins of me.<br/>
Ye looked on lives whose like earth never bore,<br/>
Ye knew not those my spirit thirsted for:<br/>
Therefore be dark for ever!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a song<br/>
His voice rose, and again, again, the strong<br/>
And stabbing hand fell, and the massacred<br/>
And bleeding eyeballs streamed upon his beard,<br/>
Wild rain, and gouts of hail amid the rain.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold affliction, yea, afflictions twain<br/>
From man and woman broken, now made one<br/>
In downfall. All the riches yester sun<br/>
Saw in this house were rich in verity.<br/>
What call ye now our riches? Agony,<br/>
Delusion, Death, Shame, all that eye or ear<br/>
Hath ever dreamed of misery, is here.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Leader:</h4>
<p>
And now how fares he? Doth the storm abate?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Messenger:</h4>
<p>
He shouts for one to open wide the gate<br/>
And lead him forth, and to all Thebes display<br/>
His father's murderer, his mother's.... Nay,<br/>
Such words I will not speak. And his intent<br/>
Is set, to cast himself in banishment<br/>
Out to the wild, not walk 'mid human breed<br/>
Bearing the curse he bears. Yet sore his need<br/>
Of strength and of some guiding hand. For sure<br/>
He hath more burden now than man may endure.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But see, the gates fall back, and that appears<br/>
Which he who loathes shall pity&mdash;yea, with tears.<br/>

<p>
How shall I hold this counsel of thy mind<br/>
True? Thou wert better dead than living blind.<br/>

<p>
That this deed is not well and wisely wrought<br/>
Thou shalt not show me; therefore school me not.<br/>
Think, with what eyes hereafter in the place<br/>
Of shadows could I see my father's face,<br/>
Or my poor mother's? Both of whom this hand<br/>
Hath wronged too deep for man to understand.<br/>
Or children&mdash;born as mine were born, to see<br/>
Their shapes should bring me joy? Great God!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me<br/>
There is no joy in city nor in tower<br/>
Nor temple, from all whom, in this mine hour,<br/>
I that was chief in Thebes alone, and ate<br/>
The King's bread, I have made me separate<br/>
For ever. Mine own lips have bid the land<br/>
Cast from it one so evil, one whose hand<br/>
To sin was dedicate, whom God hath shown<br/>
Birth-branded ... and my blood the dead King's own!<br/>
All this myself have proved. And can I then<br/>
Look with straight eyes into the eyes of men?<br/>
I trow not. Nay, if any stop there were<br/>
To dam this fount that welleth in mine ear<br/>
For hearing, I had never blenched nor stayed<br/>
Till this vile shell were all one dungeon made,<br/>
Dark, without sound. 'Tis thus the mind would fain<br/>
Find peace, self-prisoned from a world of pain.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O wild Kithairon, why was it thy will<br/>
To save me? Why not take me quick and kill,<br/>
Kill, before ever I could make men know<br/>
The thing I am, the thing from which I grow?<br/>
Thou dead King, Polybus, thou city wall<br/>
Of Corinth, thou old castle I did call<br/>
My father's, what a life did ye begin,<br/>
What splendour rotted by the worm within,<br/>
When ye bred me! O Crossing of the Roads,<br/>
O secret glen and dusk of crowding woods,<br/>
O narrow footpath creeping to the brink<br/>
Where meet the Three! I gave you blood to drink.<br/>
Do ye remember? 'Twas my life-blood, hot<br/>
From mine own father's heart. Have ye forgot<br/>
What deed I did among you, and what new<br/>
And direr deed I fled from you to do?<br/>
O flesh, horror of flesh!...<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is shame<br/>
To do should not be spoken. In God's name,<br/>
Take me somewhere far off and cover me<br/>
From sight, or slay, or cast me to the sea<br/>
Where never eye may see me any more.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Do ye fear to touch a man so sore<br/>
Stricken? Nay, tremble not. My misery<br/>
Is mine, and shall be borne by none but me.<br/>

Lo, yonder comes for answer to thy prayer<br/>

<p>
Alas, what word to Creon can I speak,<br/>
How make him trust me more? He hath seen of late<br/>
So vile a heart in me, so full of hate.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Enter</em> Creon]</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Not to make laughter, Oedipus, nor cast<br/>
Against thee any evil of the past<br/>
I seek thee, but ... Ah God! ye ministers,<br/>
Have ye no hearts? Or if for man there stirs<br/>
No pity in you, fear at least to call<br/>
Stain on our Lord the Sun, who feedeth all;<br/>
Nor show in nakedness a horror such<br/>
As this, which never mother Earth may touch,<br/>
Nor God's clean rain nor sunlight. Quick within!<br/>
Guide him.&mdash;The ills that in a house have been<br/>
They of the house alone should know or hear.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
In God's name, since thou hast undone the fear<br/>
Within me, coming thus, all nobleness,<br/>
To one so vile, grant me one only grace.<br/>
For thy sake more I crave it than mine own.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Let me first hear what grace thou wouldst be shown.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Cast me from Thebes ... now, quick ... where none may see<br/>
My visage more, nor mingle words with me.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
That had I done, for sure, save that I still<br/>
Tremble, and fain would ask Apollo's will.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
His will was clear enough, to stamp the unclean<br/>
Thing out, the bloody hand, the heart of sin.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
'Twas thus he seemed to speak; but in this sore<br/>
Strait we must needs learn surer than before.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Thou needs must trouble God for one so low?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Surely; thyself will trust his answer now.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
I charge thee more ... and, if thou fail, my sin<br/>
Shall cleave to thee.... For her who lies within,<br/>
Make as thou wilt her burial. 'Tis thy task<br/>
To tend thine own. But me: let no man ask<br/>
This ancient city of my sires to give<br/>
Harbour in life to me. Set me to live<br/>
On the wild hills and leave my name to those<br/>
Deeps of Kithairon which my father chose,<br/>
And mother, for my vast and living tomb.<br/>
As they, my murderers, willed it, let my doom<br/>
Find me. For this my very heart doth know,<br/>
No sickness now, nor any mortal blow,<br/>
Shall slay this body. Never had my breath<br/>
Been thus kept burning in the midst of death,<br/>
Save for some frightful end. So, let my way<br/>
Go where it listeth.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my children&mdash;Nay,<br/>
Creon, my sons will ask thee for no care.<br/>
Men are they, and can find them everywhere<br/>
What life needs. But my two poor desolate<br/>
Maidens.... There was no table ever set<br/>
Apart for them, but whatso royal fare<br/>
I tasted, they were with me and had share<br/>
In all.... Creon, I pray, forget them not.<br/>
And if it may be, go, bid them be brought,<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Creon <em>goes and presently returns with the two princesses.</em> Oedipus <em>thinks he is there all the time.</em>]</p>

<p>
That I may touch their faces, and so weep....<br/>
Go, Prince. Go, noble heart!...<br/>
If I might touch them, I should seem to keep<br/>
And not to have lost them, now mine eyes are gone....<br/>
What say I?<br/>
In God's name, can it be I hear mine own<br/>
Beloved ones sobbing? Creon of his grace<br/>
Hath brought my two, my dearest, to this place.<br/>
Is it true?<br/>
</p>

<p>
'Tis true. I brought them, for in them I know<br/>
Thy joy is, the same now as long ago.<br/>

<p>
God bless thee, and in this hard journey give<br/>
Some better guide than mine to help thee live.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Children! Where are ye? Hither; come to these<br/>
Arms of your ... brother, whose wild offices<br/>
Have brought much darkness on the once bright eyes<br/>
Of him who grew your garden; who, nowise<br/>
Seeing nor understanding, digged a ground<br/>
The world shall shudder at. Children, my wound<br/>
Is yours too, and I cannot meet your gaze<br/>
Now, as I think me what remaining days<br/>
Of bitter living the world hath for you.<br/>
What dance of damsels shall ye gather to,<br/>
What feast of Thebes, but quick ye shall turn home,<br/>
All tears, or ere the feast or dancers come?<br/>
And, children, when ye reach the years of love,<br/>
Who shall dare wed you, whose heart rise above<br/>
The peril, to take on him all the shame<br/>
That cleaves to my name and my children's name?<br/>
God knows, it is enough!...<br/>
My flowers, ye needs must die, waste things, bereft<br/>
And fruitless.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creon, thou alone art left<br/>
Their father now, since both of us are gone<br/>
Who cared for them. Oh, leave them not alone<br/>
To wander masterless, these thine own kin,<br/>
And beggared. Neither think of them such sin<br/>
As ye all know in me, but let their fate<br/>
Touch thee. So young they are, so desolate&mdash;<br/>
Of all save thee. True man, give me thine hand,<br/>
And promise.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Oedipus <em>and</em> Creon <em>clasp hands.</em>]</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your age could understand,<br/>
Children, full many counsels I could give.<br/>
But now I leave this one word: Pray to live<br/>
As life may suffer you, and find a road<br/>
To travel easier than your father trod.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
Enough thy heart hath poured its tears; now back into thine house repair.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
I dread the house, yet go I must.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair season maketh all things fair.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
One oath then give me, and I go.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name it, and I will answer thee.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
To cast me from this land.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gift not mine but God's thou askest me.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
I am a thing of God abhorred.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more, then, will he grant thy prayer.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Thou givest thine oath?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no light; and, seeing not, I may not swear.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Then take me hence. I care not.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go in peace, and give these children o'er.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Oedipus:</h4>
<p>
Ah no! Take not away my daughters!<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>They are taken from him.</em>]</p>

<h4>Creon:</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seek not to be master more.<br/>
Did not thy masteries of old forsake thee when the end was near?<br/>
</p>

<h4>Chorus:</h4>
<p>
Ye citizens of Thebes, behold; 'tis Oedipus that passeth here,<br/>
Who read the riddle-word of Death, and mightiest stood of mortal men,<br/>
And Fortune loved him, and the folk that saw him turned and looked again.<br/>
Lo, he is fallen, and around great storms and the outreaching sea!<br/>
Therefore, O Man, beware, and look toward the end of things that be,<br/>
The last of sights, the last of days; and no man's life account as gain<br/>
Ere the full tale be finished and the darkness find him without pain.<br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Oedipus <em>is led into the house and the doors close on him.</em>]</p>

<p>THE END</p>

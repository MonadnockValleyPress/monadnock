<h1>Antigone</h1>
<h2>by Sophocles</h2>
<h3>translated by E.H. Plumptre (1878)</h3>
<p><em>Enter</em> ANTIGONE <em>and</em> ISMENE</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Ismene, mine own sister, dearest one;<br/>
Is there, of all the ills of Œdipus,<br/>
One left that Zeus will fail to bring on us,<br/>
While still we live? for nothing is there sad<br/>
Or full of woe, or base, or fraught with shame,<br/>
But I have seen it in thy woes and mine.<br/>
And now, what new decree is this they tell,<br/>
Our ruler has enjoined on all the state?<br/>
Know'st thou? hast heard? or is it hid from thee,<br/>
The doom of foes that comes upon thy friends?
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
No tidings of our friends, Antigone,<br/>
Painful or pleasant since that hour have come<br/>
When we, two sisters, lost our brothers twain,<br/>
In one day dying by each other's hand.<br/>
And since in this last night the Argive host<br/>
Has left the field, I nothing further know,<br/>
Nor brightening fortune, nor increasing gloom.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
That knew I well, and therefore sent for thee<br/>
Beyond the gates, that thou mayst hear alone.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
What meanest thou? It is but all too clear<br/>
Thou broodest darkly o'er some tale of woe.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
And does not Creon treat our brothers twain<br/>
One with the rites of burial, one with shame?<br/>
Eteocles, so say they, he interred<br/>
Fitly, with wonted rites, as one held meet<br/>
To pass with honour to the gloom below.<br/>
But for the corpse of Polynices, slain<br/>
So piteously, they say, he has proclaimed<br/>
To all the citizens, that none should give<br/>
His body burial, or bewail his fate,<br/>
But leave it still unsepulchred, unwept,<br/>
A prize full rich for birds that scent afar<br/>
Their sweet repast. So Creon bids, they say,<br/>
Creon the good, commanding thee and me,<br/>
Yes, me, I say, and now is coming here,<br/>
To make it clear to those who knew it not,<br/>
And counts the matter not a trivial thing;<br/>
But whoso does the things that he forbids,<br/>
For him, there waits within the city's walls<br/>
The death of stoning. Thus, then, stands thy case;<br/>
And quickly thou wilt show, if thou art born<br/>
Of noble nature, or degenerate liv'st,<br/>
Base child of honoured parents.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
How could I,<br/>
O daring in thy mood, in this our plight,<br/>
Or doing or undoing, aught avail?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Wilt thou with me share risk and toil? Look to it.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
What risk is this? What purpose fills thy mind?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Wilt thou with me go forth to help the dead?<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
And dost thou mean to give him sepulture,<br/>
When all have been forbidden?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
He is still<br/>
My brother; yes, and thine, though thou, it seems,<br/>
Wouldst fain he were not. I desert him not.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
O daring one, when Creon bids thee not!<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
What right has he to keep me from mine own?<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
Ah me! remember, sister, how our sire<br/>
Perished, with hate o'erwhelmed and infamy,<br/>
From evils that he brought upon himself,<br/>
And with his own hand robbed himself of sight,<br/>
And how his wife and mother, both in one,<br/>
With twist and cordage, cast away her life;<br/>
And thirdly, how our brothers in one day<br/>
In suicidal conflict wrought the doom,<br/>
Each of the other. And we twain are left;<br/>
And think, how much more wretchedly than all<br/>
We twain shall perish, if, against the law,<br/>
We brave our sovereign's edict and his power.<br/>
For this we need remember, we were born<br/>
Women; as such, not made to strive with men.<br/>
And next, that they who reign surpass in strength,<br/>
And we must bow to this, and worse than this.<br/>
I, then, entreating those that dwell below,<br/>
To judge me leniently, as forced to yield,<br/>
Will hearken to our rulers. Over-zeal<br/>
In act or word but little wisdom shows.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
I would not ask thee. No! if thou shouldst wish<br/>
To do it, and wouldst gladly join with me.<br/>
Do what thou wilt, I go to bury him;<br/>
And good it were, this having done, to die.<br/>
Loved I shall be with him whom I have loved,<br/>
Guilty of holiest crime. More time have I<br/>
In which to win the favour of the dead,<br/>
Than that of those who live; for I shall rest<br/>
For ever there. But thou, if thus thou please,<br/>
Count as dishonoured what the Gods approve.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
I do them no dishonour, but I find<br/>
Myself too weak to war against the state.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Make what excuse thou wilt, I go to rear<br/>
A grave above the brother whom I love.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
Ah, wretched me! how much I fear for thee.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Fear not for me. Thine own fate guide aright.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
At any rate, disclose this deed to none:<br/>
Keep it close hidden. I will hide it too.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Speak out! I bid thee. Silent, thou wilt be<br/>
More hateful to me than if thou shouldst tell<br/>
My deed to all men.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
Fiery is thy mood,<br/>
Although thy deeds might chill the very blood.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
I know I please the souls I seek to please.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
If thou canst do it; but thy passion craves<br/>
For things impossible.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
I'll cease to strive<br/>
When strength shall fail me.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
Even from the first,<br/>
It is not meet to seek what may not be.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
If thou speak thus, my hatred wilt thou gain,<br/>
And rightly wilt be hated of the dead.<br/>
Leave me and my ill counsel to endure<br/>
This dreadful doom. I shall not suffer aught<br/>
So evil as a death dishonourable.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
Go, then, if so thou wilt. Of this be sure,<br/>
Wild as thou art, thy friends must love thee still.&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Exeunt.</em><br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> CHORUS</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>STROPHE I</p>
<p>
Ray of the glorious sun,<br/>
Brightest of all that ever shone on Thebes,<br/>
Thebes with her seven high gates,<br/>
Thou didst appear that day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eye of the golden dawn,<br/>
O'er Dirkè's streams advancing,<br/>
Driving with quickened curb,<br/>
In haste of headlong flight,<br/>
The warrior who, in panoply of proof,<br/>
From Argos came, with shield as white as snow;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who came to this our land,<br/>
Roused by the strife of tongues<br/>
That Polynices stirred;<br/>
Shrieking his shrill sharp cry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle hovered round,<br/>
With snow-white wing bedecked,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Begirt with myriad arms,<br/>
And flowing horsehair crests.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTISTROPHE I</p>
<p>
He stood above our towers,<br/>
Circling, with blood-stained spears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The portals of our gates;<br/>
He went, before he filled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His jaws with blood of men,<br/>
Before Hephæstus with his pitchy flame<br/>
Had seized our crown of towers.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So loud the battle din that Ares loves,<br/>
Was raised around his rear,<br/>
A conflict hard and stiff,<br/>
E'en for his dragon foe.<br/>
For breath of haughty speech<br/>
Zeus hateth evermore exceedingly;<br/>
And seeing them advance,<br/>
Exulting in the clang of golden arms,<br/>
With brandished fire he hurls them headlong down,<br/>
In act, upon the topmost battlement<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushing, with eager step,<br/>
To shout out, 'Victory!'<br/>
</p>
<p>STROPHE II</p>
<p>
Crashing to earth he fell,<br/>
Who came, with madman's haste,<br/>
Drunken, but not with wine,<br/>
And swept o'er us with blasts,<br/>
The whirlwind blasts of hate.<br/>
Thus on one side they fare,<br/>
And mighty Ares, bounding in his strength,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dashing now here, now there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere brought other fate.<br/>
For seven chief warriors at the seven gates met,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Equals with equals matched,<br/>
To Zeus, the Lord of War,<br/>
Left tribute, arms of bronze;<br/>
All but the hateful ones<br/>
Who, from one father and one mother sprung,<br/>
Stood wielding, hand to hand,<br/>
Their doubly pointed spears;<br/>
They had their doom of death,<br/>
In common, shared by both.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTISTROPHE II</p>
<p>But now, since Victory, of mightiest name,<br/>
Hath come to Thebes, of many chariots proud,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Joying and giving joy,<br/>
After these wars just past,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn ye forgetfulness,<br/>
And all night long, with dance and voice of hymns<br/>
Let us go round to all the shrines of Gods,<br/>
While Bacchus, making Thebes resound with shouts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Begins the strain of joy;<br/>
But, lo! the sovereign of this land of ours,<br/>
<em>Creon</em>, Men#x153;keus' son,<br/>
He, whom strange change and chances from the God<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have nobly raised to power,<br/>
Comes to us, steering on some new device;<br/>
For, lo! he hath convened,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By herald's loud command,<br/>
This council of the elders of our land.<br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> CREON</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
My Friends, for what concerns our commonwealth,<br/>
The Gods who vexed it with the billowing storms<br/>
Have righted it again; but I have sent,<br/>
By special summons, calling you to come<br/>
Apart from all the others, This, in part,<br/>
As knowing ye did all along uphold<br/>
The might of Laius' throne, in part again,<br/>
Because when Œdipus our country ruled,<br/>
And, when he perished, then towards his sons<br/>
Ye still were faithful in your steadfast mind.<br/>
And since they fell, as by a double death,<br/>
Both on the selfsame day with murderous blow,<br/>
Smiting and being smitten, now I hold<br/>
Their thrones and all their power of sov'reignty<br/>
By nearness of my kindred to the dead.<br/>
And hard it is to learn what each man is,<br/>
In heart and mind and judgment, till one gains<br/>
Experience in the exercise of power.<br/>
For me, whoe'er is called to guide a state,<br/>
And does not catch at counsels wise and good,<br/>
But holds his peace through any fear of man,<br/>
I deem him basest of all men that are,<br/>
Of all that ever have been; and whoe'er<br/>
As worthier than his country counts his friend,<br/>
I utterly despise him. I myself,<br/>
Zeus be my witness, who beholdeth all,<br/>
Will not keep silence, seeing danger come,<br/>
Instead of safety, to my subjects true.<br/>
Nor could I take as friend my country's foe;<br/>
For this I know, that there our safety lies,<br/>
And sailing in her while she holds her course,<br/>
We gather friends around us. By these rules<br/>
And such as these will I maintain the state.<br/>
And now I come, with edicts close allied<br/>
To these in spirit, for my subjects all,<br/>
Concerning those two sons of Œdipus.<br/>
Eteocles, who died in deeds of might<br/>
Illustrious, fighting for our fatherland,<br/>
To honour him with sepulture, all rites<br/>
Duly performed that to the noblest dead<br/>
Of right belong. Not so his brother; him<br/>
I speak of, Polynices, who, returned<br/>
From exile, sought with fire and sword to waste<br/>
His father's city and the shrines of Gods,<br/>
Yea, sought to glut his rage with blood of men,<br/>
And lead them captives to the bondslave's doom;<br/>
Him I decree that none should dare entomb,<br/>
That none should utter wail or loud lament,<br/>
But leave his corpse unburied, by the dogs<br/>
And vultures mangled, foul to look upon.<br/>
Such is my purpose. Ne'er, if I can help,<br/>
Shall the vile share the honours of the just;<br/>
But whoso shows himself my country's friend,<br/>
Living or dead, from me shall honour gain.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
This is thy pleasure, O Menœkeus' son,<br/>
For him who hated, him who loved our state;<br/>
And thou hast power to make what laws thou wilt,<br/>
Both for the dead and all of us who live.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Be ye, then, guardians of the things I speak.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Commit this task to one of younger years.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
The watchmen are appointed for the corpse.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
What duty, then, enjoin'st thou on another?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Not to consent with those that disobey.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
None are so foolish as to seek for death.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And that shall be his doom; but love of gain<br/>
Hath oft with false hopes lured men to their death.<br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> GUARD</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
I will not say, O king, that I am come<br/>
Panting with speed and plying nimble feet,<br/>
For I had many halting-points of thought,<br/>
Backwards and forwards turning, round and round;<br/>
For now my mind would give me sage advice:<br/>
"Poor wretch, and wilt thou go and bear the blame?"<br/>
Or &mdash; "Dost thou tarry now? Shall Creon know<br/>
These things from others? How wilt thou escape?"<br/>
Resolving thus, I came in haste, yet slow,<br/>
And thus a short way finds itself prolonged,<br/>
But, last of all, to come to thee prevailed.<br/>
And though I tell of naught, thou shalt hear all;<br/>
For this one hope I cling to steadfastly,<br/>
That I shall suffer nothing but my fate.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
What is it, then, that causes such dismay?<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
First, for mine own share in it, this I say,<br/>
I did not do it, do not know who did,<br/>
Nor should I rightly come to ill for it.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Thou tak'st good aim and fencest up thy tale<br/>
All round and round. 'Twould seem thou hast some news.<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
Yea, news of fear engenders long delay.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Tell thou thy tale, and then depart in peace.<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
And speak I will. The corpse ... Some one has been<br/>
But now and buried it, a little dust<br/>
O'er the skin scattering, with the wonted rites.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
What say'st thou? Who has dared this deed of guilt?<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
I know not. Neither was there stroke of spade,<br/>
Nor earth cast up by mattock. All the soil<br/>
Was dry and hard, no track of chariot wheel;<br/>
But he who did it went and left no sign.<br/>
But when the first day's watchman showed it us,<br/>
The sight caused wonder and sore grief to all,<br/>
For he had disappeared. No tomb, indeed,<br/>
Was over him, but dust all lightly strown,<br/>
As by some hand that shunned defiling guilt;<br/>
And no work was there of a beast of prey<br/>
Or dog devouring. Evil words arose<br/>
Among us, guard to guard imputing blame,<br/>
Which might have come to blows, for none was there<br/>
To check its course, and each to each appeared<br/>
The man whose hand had done it. As for proof,<br/>
That there was none, and so he 'scaped our ken.<br/>
And we were ready in our hands to take<br/>
Bars of hot iron, and to walk through fire,<br/>
And call the Gods to witness none of us<br/>
Had done the deed, nor knew who counselled it,<br/>
Nor who had wrought it. Then at last, when naught<br/>
Was gained by all our searching, some one says<br/>
What made us bend our gaze upon the ground<br/>
In fear and trembling; for we neither saw<br/>
How to oppose it, nor, accepting it,<br/>
How we might prosper in it. And his speech<br/>
Was this, that all our tale should go to thee,<br/>
Not hushed up anywise. This gained the day;<br/>
And me, ill-starred, the lot condemns to win<br/>
This precious prize. So here I come to thee<br/>
Against my will; and surely do I trow<br/>
Thou dost not wish to see me. Still 'tis true<br/>
That no man loves the messenger of ill.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
For me, my prince, my mind some time has thought<br/>
That this perchance has some divine intent.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Cease thou, before thou fillest me with wrath,<br/>
Lest thou be found a dastard and a fool.<br/>
For what thou say'st is most intolerable,<br/>
That for this corpse the providence of Gods<br/>
Has any care. What! have they buried him,<br/>
As to their patron paying honours high,<br/>
Who came to waste their columned shrines with fire,<br/>
To desecrate their offerings and their lands,<br/>
And all their wonted customs? Dost thou see<br/>
The Gods approving men of evil deeds?<br/>
It is not so; but men of rebel mood,<br/>
Lifting their head in secret long ago,<br/>
Have stirred this thing against me. Never yet<br/>
Had they their neck beneath the yoke, content<br/>
To own me as their ruler. They, I know,<br/>
Have bribed these men to let the deed be done.<br/>
No thing in use by man, for power of ill,<br/>
Can equal money. This lays cities low,<br/>
This drives men forth from quiet dwelling-place,<br/>
This warps and changes minds of worthiest stamp,<br/>
To turn to deeds of baseness, teaching men<br/>
All shifts of cunning, and to know the guilt<br/>
Of every impious deed. But they who, hired,<br/>
Have wrought this crime, have laboured to their cost,<br/>
Or soon or late to pay the penalty.<br/>
But if Zeus still claims any awe from me,<br/>
Know this, and with an oath I tell it thee,<br/>
Unless ye find the very man whose hand<br/>
Has wrought this burial, and before mine eyes<br/>
Present him captive, death shall not suffice,<br/>
Till first, impaled still living, ye shall show<br/>
The story of this outrage, that henceforth,<br/>
Knowing what gain is lawful, ye may grasp<br/>
At that, and learn it is not meet to love<br/>
Gain from all quarters. By base profit won,<br/>
You will see more destroyed than prospering.<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
May I, then speak? Or shall I turn and go?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Dost thou not see how vexing are thy words?<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
Is it thine ears they trouble, or thy soul?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Why dost thou gauge my trouble where it is?<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
The doer grieves thy heart, but I thine ears.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Pshaw! what a babbler, born to prate, art thou.<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
And therefore not the man to do this deed.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Yes, that too; selling e'en thy soul for pay.<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
Ah me!<br/>
How fearful 'tis, in thinking, false to think.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Prate about thinking; but unless ye show<br/>
To me the doers, ye shall say ere long<br/>
That evil gains still work their punishment.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>Exit</em></p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
God send we find him! Should we find him not,<br/>
As well may be, for this must chance decide,<br/>
You will not see me coming here again;<br/>
For now, being safe beyond all hope of mine,<br/>
Beyond all thought, I owe the Gods much thanks.
</p>
<p>[<em>Exit</em></p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>STROPHE I</p>
<p>
Many the forms of life,<br/>
Fearful and strange to see,<br/>
But man supreme stands out,<br/>
For strangeness and for fear.<br/>
He, with the wintry gales,<br/>
O'er the foam-crested sea,<br/>
'Mid billows surging round,<br/>
Tracketh his way across:<br/>
Earth, of all Gods, from ancient days, the first,<br/>
Mightiest and undecayed,<br/>
He, with his circling plough,<br/>
Wears ever year by year.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTISTROPHE I</p>
<p>
The thoughtless tribe of birds,<br/>
The beasts that roam the fields,<br/>
The finny brood of ocean's depths,<br/>
He takes them all in nets of knotted mesh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, wonderful in skill.<br/>
And by his arts he holds in sway<br/>
The wild beasts on the mountain's height;<br/>
And brings the neck-encircling yoke<br/>
On horse with shaggy mane,<br/>
Or bull that walks untamed upon the hills.<br/>
</p>
<p>STROPHE II</p>
<p>
And speech, and thought as swift as wind,<br/>
And tempered mood for higher life of states,<br/>
These he has learnt, and how to flee<br/>
The stormy sleet of frost unkind,<br/>
The tempest thunderbolts of Zeus.<br/>
So all-preparing, unprepared<br/>
He meeteth naught the coming days may bring;<br/>
Only from Hades, still<br/>
He fails to find a refuge at the last,<br/>
Though skill of art may teach him to escape<br/>
From depths of fell disease incurable.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTISTROPHE II</p>
<p>
So, gifted with a wondrous might,<br/>
Above all fancy's dreams, with skill to plan,<br/>
Now unto evil, now to good,<br/>
He wends his way. Now holding fast the laws,<br/>
His country's sacred rights,<br/>
That rest upon the oath of Gods on high,<br/>
High in the state he stands.<br/>
An outlaw and an exile he who loves<br/>
The thing that is not good,<br/>
In wilful pride of soul:<br/>
Ne'er may he sit beside my hearth,<br/>
Ne'er may my thoughts be like to his,<br/>
Who worketh deeds like this.<br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> GUARDS, <em>bringing in</em> ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
As to this portent which the Gods have sent,<br/>
I stand in doubt. Can I, who know her, say<br/>
That this is not the maid Antigone?<br/>
O wretched one of wretched father born,<br/>
What means this? Surely 'tis not that they bring<br/>
Thee as a rebel 'gainst the king's decree,<br/>
And taken in the folly of thine act?<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
Yes! She it was by whom the deed was done.<br/>
We found her burying. Where is Creon, pray?<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Forth from his palace comes he just in time.<br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> CREON</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
What chance is this with which my coming fits?<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
Men, O my king, should pledge themselves to naught;<br/>
For cool reflection makes their purpose void.<br/>
I hardly thought to venture here again,<br/>
Cowed by thy threats, which then fell thick on me;<br/>
But since no joy is like the sweet delight<br/>
Which comes beyond, above, against our hopes,<br/>
I come, although I swore the contrary,<br/>
Bringing this maiden, whom in act we found<br/>
Decking the grave. No need for lots was now;<br/>
The prize was mine, no other claimed a share.<br/>
And now, O king, take her, and as thou wilt,<br/>
Judge and convict her. I can claim a right<br/>
To wash my hands of all this troublous coil.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
How and where was it that ye seized and brought her?<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
She was in act of burying. Now thou knowest<br/>
All that I have to tell.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And dost thou know<br/>
And rightly weigh the tale thou tellest me?<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
I saw her burying that selfsame corpse<br/>
Thou bad'st us not to bury. Speak I clear?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
How was she seen, detected, prisoner made?<br/>
</p>
<p>GUARD</p>
<p>
The matter passed as follows: When we came,<br/>
With all those dreadful threats of thine upon us,<br/>
Sweeping away the dust which, lightly spread,<br/>
Covered the corpse, and laying stript and bare<br/>
The tained carcase, on the hill we sat<br/>
To windward, shunning the infected air,<br/>
Each stirring up his fellow with strong words,<br/>
If any shirked his duty. This went on<br/>
Some time, until the glowing orb of day<br/>
Stood in mid-heaven, and the scorching heat<br/>
Fell on us. Then a sudden whirlwind rose,<br/>
A scourge from heaven, raising squalls on earth,<br/>
And filled the plain, the leafage stripping bare<br/>
Of all the forest, and the air's vast space<br/>
Was thick and troubled, and we closed our eyes<br/>
Until the plague the Gods had sent was past;<br/>
And when it ceased, a weary time being gone,<br/>
The girl was seen, and with a bitter cry,<br/>
Shrill as a bird's, she wails, when it beholds<br/>
Its nest all emptied of its infant brood;<br/>
So she, when she beholds the corpse all stript,<br/>
Groaned loud with many moanings. And she called<br/>
Fierce curses down on those who did the deed,<br/>
And in her hand she brings some sandlike dust,<br/>
And from a well-chased ewer, all of bronze,<br/>
She pours the three libations o'er the dead.<br/>
And we, beholding, started up forthwith,<br/>
And run her down, in nothing terrified.<br/>
And then we charged her with the former deed,<br/>
As well as this. And nothing she denied.<br/>
But this to me both bitter is and sweet,<br/>
For to escape one's-self from ill is sweet,<br/>
But to bring friends to trouble, this is hard<br/>
And bitter. Yet my nature bids me count<br/>
Above all these things safety for myself.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON [<em>to</em> ANTIGONE]</p>
<p>
And thou, then, bending to the ground thy head,<br/>
Confessest thou, or dost deny the deed?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
I own I did it. I will not deny.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON [<em>to</em> GUARD]</p>
<p>
Go thou thy way, where'er thy will may choose,<br/>
Freed from a weighty charge.
</p>
<p>[<em>Exit</em> GUARD]</p>
<p>[<em>To</em> ANTIGONE]</p>
<p>
And now for thee,<br/>
Say in few words, not lengthening out thy speech,<br/>
Didst thou not know the edicts which forbade<br/>
The things thou ownest?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Right well I knew them all.<br/>
How could I not? Full clear and plain were they.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Didst thou, then, dare to disobey these laws?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Yes, for it was not Zeus who gave them forth,<br/>
Nor Justice, dwelling with the Gods below,<br/>
Who traced these laws for all the sons of men;<br/>
Nor did I deem thy edicts strong enough,<br/>
Coming from mortal man, to set at naught<br/>
The unwritten laws of God that know not change.<br/>
They are not of to-day nor yesterday,<br/>
But live for ever, nor can man assign<br/>
When first they sprang to being. Not through fear<br/>
Of any man's resolve was I prepared<br/>
Before the Gods to bear the penalty<br/>
Of sinning against these. That I should die<br/>
I knew (how should I not?), though thy decree<br/>
Had never spoken. And, before my time<br/>
If I should die, I reckon this a gain;<br/>
For whoso lives, as I, in many woes,<br/>
How can it be but death shall bring him gain?<br/>
And so for me to bear this doom of thine<br/>
Has nothing painful. But, if I had left<br/>
My mother's son unburied on his death,<br/>
I should have given them pain. But as things are,<br/>
Pain I feel none. And should I seem to thee<br/>
To have done a foolish deed, 'tis simply this, &mdash; <br/>
I bear the charge of folly from a fool.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
The maiden's stubborn will, of stubborn sire<br/>
The offspring shows itself. She knows not yet<br/>
To yield to evils.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Know, then, minds too stiff<br/>
Most often stumble, and the rigid steel<br/>
Baked in the furnace, made exceeding hard,<br/>
Thou seest most often split and broken lie;<br/>
And I have known the steeds of fiery mood<br/>
With a small curb subdued. It is not meet<br/>
That one who lives in bondage to his neighbours<br/>
Should boast too loudly. Wanton outrage then<br/>
She learnt when first these laws of mine she crossed,<br/>
But, having done it, this is yet again<br/>
A second outrage over it to boast,<br/>
And laugh at having done it. Surely, then,<br/>
She is the man, not I, if all unscathed<br/>
Such deeds of might are hers. But be she child<br/>
Of mine own sister, nearest kin of all<br/>
That Zeus o'erlooks within our palace court,<br/>
She and her sister shall not 'scape their doom<br/>
Most foul and shameful; for I charge her, too,<br/>
With having planned this deed of sepulture.<br/>
Go ye and call her. 'Twas but now within<br/>
I saw her raving, losing self-command.<br/>
And still the mind of those who in the dark<br/>
Plan deeds of evil is the first to fail,<br/>
And so convicts itself of secret guilt.<br/>
But most I hate when one found out in guilt<br/>
Will seek to glaze and brave it to the end.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
And dost thou seek aught else beyond my death?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Naught else for me. That gaining, I gain all.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Wilt thou delay? Of all thy words not one<br/>
Pleases me now, nor aye is like to please,<br/>
And so all mine must grate upon thine ears.<br/>
And yet how could I higher glory gain<br/>
Than giving my true brother all the rites<br/>
Of solemn burial? These who hear would say<br/>
It pleases them, did not their fear of thee<br/>
Close up their lips. This power has sovereignty,<br/>
That it can do and say whate'er it will.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Of all the race of Cadmus thou alone<br/>
Look'st thus upon the deed.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
They see it too<br/>
As I do, but in fear of thee they keep<br/>
Their tongue between their teeth.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And dost thou feel<br/>
No shame to plan thy schemes apart from these?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
There is no baseness in the act which shows<br/>
Our reverence for our kindred.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Was he not<br/>
Thy brother also, who against him fought?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
He was my brother, of one mother born,<br/>
And of the selfsame father.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Why, then, pay<br/>
Thine impious honours to the carcase there?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
The dead below will not accept thy words.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Yes, if thou equal honours pay to him,<br/>
And that most impious monster.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
'Twas no slave<br/>
That perished, but my brother.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Yes, in act<br/>
To waste this land, while <em>he</em> in its defence<br/>
Stood fighting bravely.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Not the less does death<br/>
Crave equal rites for all.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
But not that good<br/>
And evil share alike?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
And yet who knows<br/>
If in that world these things are counted good?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Our foe, I tell thee, ne'er becomes our friend,<br/>
Not even when he dies.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
My bent is fixed,<br/>
I tell thee, not for hatred, but for love.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Go, then, below. And if thou must have love,<br/>
Love those thou find'st there. While I live, at least,<br/>
A woman shall not rule.<br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> ISMENE</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
And, lo! Ismene at the gate<br/>
Comes shedding tears of sisterly regard,<br/>
And o'er her brow a gathering cloud<br/>
Mars the deep roseate blush,<br/>
Bedewing her fair cheek.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON [<em>to</em> ISMENE]</p>
<p>
And thou who, creeping as a viper creeps,<br/>
Didst drain my life in secret, and I knew not<br/>
That I was rearing two accurs&egrave;d ones,<br/>
Subverters of my throne: come, tell me, then,<br/>
Dost thou confess thou took'st thy part in it?<br/>
Or wilt thou swear thou didst not know of it?<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
I did the deed. Since she will have it so,<br/>
I share the guilt; I bear an equal blame.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
This, Justice will not suffer, since, in truth,<br/>
Thou wouldst have none of it. And I, for one,<br/>
Shared it not with thee.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
I am not ashamed<br/>
To count myself companion in thy woes.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Whose was the deed, Death knows, and those below.<br/>
I do not love a friend who loves in words.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
Do not, my sister, put me to such shame<br/>
As not to let me share thy death with thee,<br/>
And with thee pay due reverence to the dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Share not my death, nor make thine own this deed<br/>
Thou hadst no hand in. Let my death suffice.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
And what to me is life, bereaved of thee?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Ask Creon there. To him thy tender care<br/>
Is given so largely.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p
>Why wilt thou torture me,<br/>
In nothing bettered by it?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Yes &mdash; at thee,<br/>
E'en while I laugh, I laugh with pain of heart.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
But now, at least, how may I profit thee?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Save thou thyself. I grudge not thy escape.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
Ah, woe is me! and must I miss thy fate?<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Thou mad'st thy choice to live, and I to die.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
'Tis not through want of any words of mine.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
To these thou seemest, doubtless, to be wise;<br/>
I to those others.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
Yet our fault is one.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Take courage. Thou wilt live. My soul long since<br/>
Has given itself to Death, that to the dead<br/>
I might bring help.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Of these two maidens here,<br/>
The one, I say, hath lost her mind but now,<br/>
The other ever since her life began.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
Yea, O my king. No mind that ever lived<br/>
Stands firm in evil days, but still it goes,<br/>
Beside itself, astray.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
So then did thine<br/>
When thou didst choose thy evil deeds to do,<br/>
With those already evil.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
How could I.<br/>
Alone, apart from her, endure to live?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Speak not of her. She stands no longer here.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
And wilt thou slay thy son's betrothed bride?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Full many a field there is which he may plough.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
But none like that prepared for him and her.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Wives that are vile, I love not for my son.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Ah, dearest Hæmon, how thy father shames thee!<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Thou art too vexing, thou, and these thy words,<br/>
On marriage ever harping.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
Wilt thou rob<br/>
Thine own dear son of her whom he has loved?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
'Tis Death who breaks the marriage contract off.<br/>
</p>
<p>ISMENE</p>
<p>
Her doom is fixed, it seems, then. She must die.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
So thou dost think, and I. No more delay,<br/>
Ye slaves. Our women henceforth must be kept<br/>
As women &mdash; suffered not to roam abroad;<br/>
For even boldest natures shrink in fear<br/>
When they behold the end of life draw nigh.
</p>
<p>[<em>Exeunt Guards with</em> ANTIGONE <em>and</em> ISMENE.</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>STROPHE I</p>
<p>
Blessed are those whose life has known no woe!<br/>
For unto those whose house<br/>
The Gods have shaken, nothing fails of curse<br/>
Or woe, that creepeth on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To generations, far,<br/>
As when a wave, where Thracian blasts blow strong<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On that tempestuous shore,<br/>
Up surges from the depths beneath the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the deep abyss<br/>
Rolls the black wind-vexed sand,<br/>
And every jutting peak that drives it back<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-echoes with the roar.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTISTROPHE I</p>
<p>
I see the ancient doom<br/>
That fell upon the seed of Labdacus,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who perished long ago,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still falling, woes on woes;<br/>
That generation cannot rescue this;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some God still urges on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And will not be appeased.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So now there rose a gleam<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last weak shoots<br/>
That sprang from out the race of Œdipus;<br/>
And thus the blood-stained sword<br/>
Of those that reign below<br/>
Cuts off relentlessly<br/>
Madness of speech, and fury of the soul.<br/>
</p>
<p>STROPHE II</p>
<p>
Thy power, O Zeus, what haughtiness of man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could ever hold in check?<br/>
Which neither sleep, that maketh all things old,<br/>
Nor the long months of Gods that wax not faint,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can for a moment seize.<br/>
But still as Lord supreme,<br/>
Through time that grows not old,<br/>
Thou dwellest in thy sheen of radiancy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On far Olympus' height.<br/>
Through all the future and the coming years,<br/>
As through all time that's past,<br/>
One law holds ever good,<br/>
That nothing comes to life of man on earth,<br/>
Unscathed throughout by woe.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTISTROPHE II</p>
<p>
To many, hope may come, in wanderings wild,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A solace and a joy;<br/>
To many, shows of fickle-hearted love;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But still it creepeth on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On him who knows it not,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he brings his foot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the scorching flame.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisely from one of old<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The far-famed saying came<br/>
That evil ever seems to be as good<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To those whose thoughts of heart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;God leadeth unto woe,<br/>
And without woe, but shortest time he spends.<br/>
And here comes Hæmon, youngest of thy sons.<br/>
Comes he bewailing sore<br/>
The fate of her who should have been his wife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His bride Antigone,<br/>
Sore grieving at the failure of his joys?<br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> HÆMON</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Soon we shall know much more than seers can tell.<br/>
Surely thou dost not come, my son, to rage<br/>
Against thy father, hearing his decree,<br/>
Fixing her doom who should have been thy bride;<br/>
Or are we still, whate'er we do, beloved?<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
My father, I am thine. Do thou direct<br/>
With thy wise counsels, I will follow them.<br/>
No marriage weighs one moment in the scales<br/>
With me, while thou art prospering in thy reign.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
This thought, my son, should dwell within thy breast,<br/>
That all things stand below a father's will:<br/>
For this men pray that they may rear and keep<br/>
Obedient offspring by their hearths and homes,<br/>
That they may both requite their father's foes,<br/>
And pay with him like honours to his friend.<br/>
But he who reareth sons that profit not,<br/>
What could one say of him but this, that he<br/>
Breeds his own sorrow, laughter to his foes?<br/>
Lose not thy reason, then, my son, o'ercome<br/>
By pleasure, for a woman's sake, but know,<br/>
A cold embrace is that to have at home<br/>
A worthless wife, the partner of thy bed.<br/>
What ulcerous sore is worse than one we love<br/>
Who proves all worthless? No! with loathing scorn,<br/>
As hateful to thee, let her go and wed<br/>
A spouse in Hades. Taken in the act<br/>
I found her, her alone of all the state,<br/>
Rebellious. And I will not make myself<br/>
False to the state. She dies. So let her call<br/>
On Zeus, the lord of kindred. If I rear<br/>
Of mine own stock things foul and orderless,<br/>
I shall have work enough with those without.<br/>
For he who in the life of home is good<br/>
Will still be seen as just in things of state;<br/>
While he who breaks or goes beyond the laws,<br/>
Or thinks to bid the powers that be obey,<br/>
He must not hope to gather praise from me.<br/>
No! we must follow whom the state appoints<br/>
In things or just and lowly, or, may be,<br/>
The opposite of these. Of such a man<br/>
I should be sure that he would govern well,<br/>
And know well to be governed, and would stand,<br/>
In war's wild storm, on his appointed post,<br/>
A just and good defender. Anarchy<br/>
Is our worst evil, brings our commonwealth<br/>
To utter ruin, lays whole houses low,<br/>
In battle strife hurls men in shameful flight;<br/>
But they who walk uprightly, these shall find<br/>
Obedience saves most men. Sure help should come<br/>
To what our rulers order; least of all<br/>
Ought we to bow before a woman's sway.<br/>
Far better, if it must be so, to fall<br/>
By a man's hand, than thus to bear reproach,<br/>
By woman conquered.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Unto us, O king,<br/>
Unless our years have robbed us of our wit,<br/>
Thou seemest to say wisely what thou say'st.<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
The Gods, my father, have bestowed on man<br/>
His reason, noblest of all earthly gifts;<br/>
Nor dare I say nor prove that what thou speak'st<br/>
Is aught but right. And yet another's thoughts<br/>
May have some reason. I am wont to watch<br/>
What each man says or does, or blames in thee<br/>
(For dread thy face to one of low estate),<br/>
In words thou wouldst not much rejoice to hear.<br/>
But I can hear the things in darkness said,<br/>
How the whole city wails this maiden's fate,<br/>
As one "who of all women worthiest praise,<br/>
For noblest deed must die the foulest death.<br/>
She who, her brother fallen in the fray,<br/>
Would neither leave unburied, nor expose<br/>
To carrion dogs, or any bird of prey,<br/>
May she not claim the meed of golden crown?"<br/>
Such is the whisper that in secret runs<br/>
All darkling. And for me, my father, naught<br/>
Is dearer than thy welfare. What can be<br/>
A nobler form of honour for the son<br/>
Than a sire's glory, or for sire than son's?<br/>
I pray thee, then, wear not one mood alone,<br/>
That what thou say'st is right, and naught but that;<br/>
For he who thinks that he alone is wise,<br/>
His mind and speech above what others boast,<br/>
Such men when searched are mostly empty found.<br/>
But for a man to learn, though he be wise,<br/>
Yea, to learn much, and know the time to yield,<br/>
Brings no disgrace. When winter floods the streams,<br/>
Thou seest the trees that bend before the storm,<br/>
Save their last twigs, while those that will not yield<br/>
Perish with root and branch. And when one hauls<br/>
Too tight the mainsail sheet, and will not slack,<br/>
He has to end his voyage with deck o'erturned.<br/>
Do thou, then, yield. Permit thyself to change.<br/>
Young though I be, if any prudent thought<br/>
Be with me, I at least will dare assert<br/>
The higher worth of one who, come what will,<br/>
Is full of knowledge. If that may not be<br/>
(For nature is not wont to take that bent),<br/>
'Tis good to learn from those who counsel well.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
My king! 'tis fit that thou shouldst learn from him,<br/>
If he speaks words in season; and, in turn,<br/>
That thou [<em>to</em> HÆMON] shouldst learn of him, for both speak well.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Shall we at our age stoop to learn from him,<br/>
Such as he is, our lesson?<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
'Twere not wrong.<br/>
And if I be but young, not age but deeds<br/>
Thou shouldst regard.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Fine deeds, I trow, to pay<br/>
Such honour to the lawless.<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
'Tis not I<br/>
Would bid you waste your honour on the base.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And has she not been seized with that disease?<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
The men of Thebes with one accord say, No.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And will my subjects tell me how to rule?<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
Dost thou not see that these words fall from thee<br/>
As from some beardless boy?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And who, then, else<br/>
But me should rule this land?<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
That is no state<br/>
Which hangs on one man's will.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
The state, I pray,<br/>
It is not reckoned his who governs it?<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
Brave rule! Alone, and o'er an empty land!<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Here, as it seems, is one who still will fight,<br/>
A woman's friend.<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
If thou a woman be,<br/>
For all my care I lavish upon thee.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Basest of base, who with thy father still<br/>
Wilt hold debate!<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
For, lo! I see thee still<br/>
Guilty of wrong.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And am I guilty, then,<br/>
Claiming due reverence for my sovereignty?<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
Thou show'st no reverence, trampling on the laws<br/>
The Gods hold sacred.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
O thou sin-stained soul,<br/>
A woman's victim.<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
Yet thou wilt not find<br/>
In me the slave of baseness.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
All thy speech<br/>
Still hangs on her.<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
Yes, and on thee, myself,<br/>
And the great Gods below.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Of this be sure,<br/>
Thou shalt not wed her in the land of life.<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
She, then, must die, and in her death will slay<br/>
Another than herself.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And dost thou dare<br/>
To come thus threatening?<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
Is it then a threat<br/>
To speak to erring judgment?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
To thy cost<br/>
Thou shalt learn wisdom, having none thyself.<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>

And, speaking, wilt not listen? Is it so?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
No, by Olympus! Thou shalt not go free<br/>
To flout me with reproaches. Lead her out<br/>
Whom my soul hates, that she may die forthwith<br/>
Before mine eyes, and near her bridegroom here.<br/>
</p>
<p>HÆMON</p>
<p>
No! Think it not! Near me she shall not die,<br/>
And thou shalt never see my face alive,<br/>
So mad art thou with all that would be friends.

The man has gone, O king, in hasty mood.<br/>
A mind distressed in youth is hard to bear.<br/>

Let him do what he will, and bear himself<br/>
Too high for mortal state, he shall not free<br/>
Those maidens from their doom!<br/>

To slay them both?<br/>

There thou say'st well: and with what kind of death<br/>
Mean'st thou to kill her?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Where the desert path<br/>
Is loneliest, there, alive, in rocky cave<br/>
Will I immure her, just so much of food<br/>
Before her set as may appease the Gods,<br/>
And save the city from the guilt of blood;<br/>
And there, invoking Hades, whom alone<br/>
Of all the Gods she worships, she, perchance,<br/>
Shall gain escape from death, or else shall know<br/>
That all her worship is but labour lost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;O Love, in every battle victor owned;<br/>
Love, now assailing wealth and lordly state,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on a girl's soft cheek,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slumbering the livelong night;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now wandering o'er the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now in shepherd's folds;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Undying Ones have no escape from thee,<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glowing eyes of bride beloved and fair<br/>

For Aphrodite, she whom none subdues,<br/>

Beyond the bounds of right;<br/>
I look on this, and cannot stay<br/>
The fountain of my tears.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind her sad, lonely way<br/>
To that dread chamber where is room for all.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Yes! O ye men of this my fatherland,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye see me on my way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's last long journey, gazing on the sun,<br/>
His last rays watching, now and nevermore;<br/>
Alone he leads me, who has room for all,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hades, the Lord of Death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Acheron's dark shore,<br/>
With neither part nor lot in marriage rites,<br/>
No marriage hymn resounding in my ears,<br/>
But Acheron shall claim me as his bride.<br/>

And hast thou not all honour, worthiest praise,<br/>
Who goest to the home that hides the dead,<br/>
Not smitten by the sickness that decays,<br/>

But of thine own free will, in fullest life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Hades tak'st thy way?<br/>

<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
I heard of old her pitiable end,<br/>
Where Sipylus rears high its lofty crag,<br/>
The Phrygian daughter of a stranger land,<br/>
Whom Tantalus begot;<br/>
Whom growth of rugged rock,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinging as ivy clings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Subdued, and made its own:<br/>
And now, so runs the tale,<br/>
There, as she melts in shower,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow abideth aye,<br/>
And still bedews yon cliffs that lie below<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those brows that ever weep.<br/>
With fate like hers doth Fortune bring me low.<br/>

<p>
Godlike in nature, godlike, too, in birth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was she of whom thou tell'st,<br/>
And we are mortals, born of mortal seed.<br/>
And, lo! for one who liveth but to die,<br/>
To gain like doom with those of heavenly race<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is great and strange to hear.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Ye mock me, then. Alas! Why wait ye not?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By all our fathers' Gods, I ask of you,<br/>
Why wait ye not till I have passed away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But flout me while I live?<br/>
O city that I love, O men that dwell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That city's wealthiest lords,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O Dirk&egrave;, fairest fount,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O grove of Thebes, that boasts her chariot host,<br/>
I take you all to witness, look and see,<br/>
How, with no friends to weep,<br/>
By what stern laws condemned,<br/>
I go to that strong dungeon of the tomb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For burial new and strange.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, miserable me!<br/>
Whom neither mortal men nor spirits own,<br/>
Nor those that live, nor those that fall asleep.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Forward and forward still to farthest verge<br/>
Of daring hast thou gone,<br/>
And now, O child, thou fallest heavily<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Right erects her throne;<br/>
Surely thou payest to the uttermost<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy father's debt of guilt.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Ah! thou hast touched the quick of all my grief,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrice-told tale of all my father's woe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate which dogs us all,<br/>
The race of Labdacus of ancient fame.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe for the curses dire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that defiled bed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With foulest incest stained,<br/>
Whence I myself have sprung, most miserable.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, I go to them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To sojourn in the grave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound by a curse, unwed;<br/>
Ah, brother, thou didst find<br/>
Thy marriage fraught with ill,<br/>
And in thy death hast smitten down my life.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Acts reverent and devout<br/>
May claim devotion's name,<br/>
But power, in one who cares to keep his power,<br/>
May never be defied;<br/>
And thee thy stubborn mood,<br/>
Self-chosen, layeth low.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Unwept, without a friend,<br/>
Unwed, and whelmed in woe,<br/>
I journey on the road that open lies.<br/>
No more shall it be mine (O misery!)<br/>
To look upon the holy eye of day,<br/>
And yet, of all my friends,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one bewails my fate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No kindly tear is shed.<br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> CREON</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And know ye not, if men can vantage gain<br/>
By songs and wailings at the hour of death,<br/>
That they will never stop? Lead, lead her on,<br/>
And, as I said, without delay immure<br/>
In yon cavernous tomb, and then depart.<br/>
Leave her, or lone and desolate to die,<br/>
Or, living, in the tomb to find her home.<br/>
Our hands are clean in all that touches her;<br/>
But she no more shall sojourn here with us.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE [<em>turning towards the cavern</em>]</p>
<p>
O tomb, my bridal chamber, vaulted home,<br/>
Guarded right well for ever, where I go<br/>
To join mine own, of whom, of all that die,<br/>
As most in number Persephassa owns;<br/>
And I, of all the last and lowest, wend<br/>
My way below, life's little span unfilled.<br/>
And yet I go, and feed myself with hopes<br/>
That I shall meet them, by my father loved,<br/>
Dear to my mother, well-beloved of thee,<br/>
Thou dearest brother: I, with these my hands,<br/>
Washed each dear corpse, arrayed you, poured the stream,<br/>
In rites of burial. And in care for thee,<br/>
Thy body, Polynices, honouring,<br/>
I gain this recompense. And yet 'twas well;<br/>
I had not done it had I come to be<br/>
A mother with her children, &mdash; had not dared,<br/>
Though 'twere a husband dead that mouldered there,<br/>
Against my country's will to bear this toil,<br/>
And dost thou ask what law constrained me thus?<br/>
I answer, had I lost a husband dear,<br/>
I might have had another; other sons<br/>
By other spouse, if one were lost to me;<br/>
But when my father and my mother sleep<br/>
In Hades, then no brother more can come.<br/>
And therefore, giving thee the foremost place,<br/>
I seemed in Creon's eyes, O brother dear,<br/>
To sin in boldest daring. So himself,<br/>
He leads me, having taken me by force,<br/>
Cut off from marriage bed and marriage feast,<br/>
Untasting wife's true joy, or mother's bliss,<br/>
With infant at her breast, but all forlorn,<br/>
Bereaved of friends, in utter misery,<br/>
Alive, I tread the chambers of the dead.<br/>
What law of Heaven have I transgressed against?<br/>
What use for me, ill-starred one, still to look<br/>
To any God for succour, or to call<br/>
On any friend for aid? For holiest deed<br/>
I bear this charge of rank unholiness.<br/>
If acts like these the Gods on high approve,<br/>
We, taught by suffering, own that we have sinned;<br/>
But if they sin [<em>looking at</em> CREON], I pray they suffer not<br/>
Worse evils than the wrongs they do to me.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Still do the same wild blasts<br/>
Vex her poor storm-tossed soul.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Therefore shall these her guards<br/>
Weep sore for this delay.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTIGONE</p>
<p>
Ah me! this word of thine<br/>
Tells of death drawing nigh.<br/>

<p>
I cannot bid thee hope<br/>
That other fate is thine.<br/>

O citadel of Thebes, my native land,<br/>
Ye Gods of old renown,<br/>
I go, and linger not.<br/>
Behold me. O ye senators of Thebes,<br/>
The last, love scion of the kingly race,<br/>
What things I suffer, and from whom they come,<br/>
Revering still where reverence most is due.

<p>STROPHE I</p>
<p>
So Danæ's form endured of old,<br/>
In brazen palace hid,<br/>
To lose the light of heaven,<br/>
And in her tomblike chamber was enclosed,<br/>
And yet high honour came to her, O child,<br/>
And on her flowed the golden shower of Zeus.<br/>
But great and dread the might of Destiny:<br/>
Nor tempest-storm, nor war,<br/>
Nor tower, nor dark-hulled ships<br/>
That sweep the sea, escape.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTISTROPHE I</p>
<p>
Bitter and sharp in mood,<br/>
The son of Dryas, king<br/>
Of yon Edonian tribes,<br/>
By Dionysus' hands,<br/>
Was shut in prison cave,<br/>
And so his frenzy wild and soul o'erbold<br/>
Waste slowly evermore.<br/>
And he was taught that he, with ribald tongue<br/>
In what wild frenzy, had attacked the Gods.<br/>
For fain had he the Mænad throng brought low,<br/>
And that bright flashing fire,<br/>
And roused the wrath of Muses sweet in song.<br/>

<p>STROPHE II</p>
<p>
And by Kyanean waters' double sea<br/>
Are shores of Bosphorus, and Thracian isle,<br/>
As Salmydessus known, inhospitable,<br/>
Where Ares, God of all the region round,<br/>
Saw the accursed wound<br/>
That smote with blindness Phineus' twin-born sons<br/>
By a fierce stepdame's hand, &mdash; <br/>
Dark wound, upon the dark-doomed eyeballs struck,<br/>
Not with the stroke of sword,<br/>
But blood-stained hands, on point of spindle sharp.<br/>
</p>
<p>ANTISTROPHE II</p>
<p>
And they in misery, miserable fate<br/>
Lamenting, waste away,<br/>
Born of a mother wedded to a curse.<br/>
And she who claimed descent<br/>
From men of ancient fame,<br/>
The old Erechteid race,<br/>
Daughter of Boreas, in far distant caves<br/>
Amid her father's woods,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was reared, a child of Gods,<br/>
Swift moving as the steed, o'er lofty crag,<br/>
And yet, my child, on her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore down the Destinies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose years are infinite.<br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> TEIRESIAS, <em>guided by a Boy.</em></p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
Princes of Thebes, we come as travellers joined,<br/>
One seeing for both, for still the blind must use<br/>
A guide's assistance to direct his steps.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And what new thing, Teiresias, brings thee here?<br/>
</p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
That I will tell thee, and do thou obey<br/>
The seer who speaks.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Of old I was not wont<br/>
To differ from thy judgment.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
Therefore, well<br/>
And safely dost thou steer our good ship's course.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
I, from experience, bear my witness still<br/>
Of good derived from thee.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
Bethink thee, then,<br/>
Thou walkest now upon a razor's edge.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
What means this? Lo! I shudder at thy speech.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
Soon shalt thou know, as I unfold the signs<br/>
Of my dread art. For sitting, as of old,<br/>
Upon my ancient seat of augury,<br/>
Where every bird has access, lo! I hear<br/>
Strange cry of winged creatures, shouting shrill,<br/>
In clamour sharp and savage, and I knew<br/>
That they were tearing each the other's breast<br/>
With bloody talons, for their whirring wings<br/>
Made that quite clear; and straightway I, in fear,<br/>
Made trial of the sacrifice that lay<br/>
On fiery altar. But the living flame<br/>
Shone not from out the offering; then there oozed<br/>
Upon the ashes, trickling from the bones,<br/>
A moisture, and it bubbled, and it spat,<br/>
And, lo! the gall was scattered to the air,<br/>
And forth from out the fat that wrapped them round,<br/>
The thigh joints fell. Such omens of decay<br/>
From strange mysterious rites I learnt from him,<br/>
This boy, who now stands here, for he is still<br/>
A guide to me, as I to others am.<br/>
And all this evil falls upon the state,<br/>
From out thy counsels; for our altars all,<br/>
Our sacred hearths, are full of food for dogs<br/>
And birds unclean, the flesh of that poor wretch<br/>
Who fell, the son of Œdipus. And so<br/>
The Gods no longer hear our solemn prayers,<br/>
Nor own the flame that burns the sacrifice;<br/>
Nor do the birds give cry of omen good,<br/>
But feed on carrion of a human corpse.<br/>
Think thou on this, my son: to err, indeed,<br/>
Is common unto all, but having erred,<br/>
He is no longer reckless or unblest,<br/>
Who, having fallen into evil, seeks<br/>
For healing, nor continues still unmoved.<br/>
Self-will must bear the guilt of stubbornness:<br/>
Yield to the dead, and outrage not a corpse.<br/>
What gain is it a fallen foe to slay?<br/>
Good counsel give I, planning good for thee;<br/>
And of all joys the sweetest is to learn<br/>
From one who speaketh well, should that bring gain.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Old man, as archers aiming at their mark,<br/>
So ye shoot forth your venomed darts at me;<br/>
I know your augur's skill, and by your arts<br/>
Long since am tricked and sold. Yes, gain your gains,<br/>
Get precious bronze from Sardis, Indian gold,<br/>
That corpse ye shall not hide in any tomb.<br/>
Not though the eagles, birds of Zeus, should bear<br/>
Their carrion morsels to their master's throne,<br/>
Not even fearing this pollution dire,<br/>
Will I consent to burial. Well I know<br/>
That man is powerless to pollute the Gods.<br/>
But many fall, Teiresias, dotard old,<br/>
A shameful fall, who gloze their shameful words,<br/>
For lucre's sake, with surface show of good.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
Ah, me! Does no man know, does none consider....<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Consider what? What trite poor saw is this?<br/>
</p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
How far good counsel heaped up wealth excels?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
By just so far methinks the greatest hurt<br/>
Is sheer unwisdom.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
Thou, at least, hast grown<br/>
From head to foot all full of that disease.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>

Loath am I with a prophet evil words<br/>
To bandy to and fro.<br/>

Saying that I utter speech that is not true.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
The race of seers is ever fond of gold.<br/>

<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
And that of tyrants loves the gain that comes<br/>
Of filthy lucre.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Art thou ignorant, then,<br/>
That what thou say'st, thou speak'st of those that rule?<br/>
</p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
I know it. 'Twas from me thou hadst the state,<br/>
By me preserved.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Wise art thou as a seer,<br/>
But too much given to wrong and injury.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
Thou wilt provoke me in my wrath to speak<br/>
Of things best left unspoken.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Speak them out!<br/>
Only take heed thou speak them not for gain.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
And dost thou, then, already judge me thus?<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Know that my judgment is not bought and sold.<br/>
</p>
<p>TEIRESIAS</p>
<p>
Know, then, and know it well, that thou shalt see<br/>
Not many winding circuits of the sun,<br/>
Before thou giv'st a quittance for the dead,<br/>
A corpse by thee begotten; for that thou<br/>
Hast trampled to the ground what stood on high,<br/>
And foully placed within a charnel-house<br/>
A living soul. And now thou keep'st from them,<br/>
The Gods below, the corpse of one unblest,<br/>
Unwept, unhallowed. Neither part nor lot<br/>
Hast thou in them, nor have the Gods who rule<br/>
The worlds above, but at thy hands they meet<br/>
This outrage. And for this they wait for thee,<br/>
The sure though slow avengers of the grave,<br/>
The dread Erinyes of the Gods above,<br/>
In these same evils to be snared and caught.<br/>
Search well if I say this as one who sells<br/>
His soul for money. Yet a little while,<br/>
And in thy house men's wailing, women's cry,<br/>
Shall make it plain. And every city stirs<br/>
Itself in arms against thee, owning those<br/>
Whose limbs the dogs have buried, or fierce wolves,<br/>
Or winged birds have brought the accurs&egrave;d taint<br/>
To city's altar-hearth. Doom like to this,<br/>
Sure darting as an arrow to its mark,<br/>
I launch at thee (for thou dost grieve me sore),<br/>
An archer aiming at the very heart,<br/>
And thou shalt not escape its fiery sting.<br/>
And now, O boy, lead thou me home again,<br/>
And let him vent his spleen on younger men,<br/>
And learn to keep his tongue more orderly,<br/>
With better thoughts than this his present mood.

I cannot count this living, rather deem<br/>
As of a breathing corpse. His heaped-up stores<br/>
Of wealth are large; so be it, and he lives<br/>
With all a sovereign's state, and yet, if joy<br/>
Be absent, all the rest I count as naught,<br/>
And would not weigh them against pleasure's charm,<br/>
More than a vapour's shadow.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
What is this?<br/>
What new disaster tell'st thou of our chiefs?<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Dead are they, and the living cause their death.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Who slays, and who is slaughtered? Tell thy tale.<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Hæmon is dead. His own hand sheds his blood.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Was it father's hand that struck the blow,<br/>
Or his own arm?<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
He by himself alone,<br/>
Yet in his wrath he charged his father with it.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
O prophet! true, most true, those words of thine.<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Since thus it stands, we may as well debate<br/>
Of other things in council.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Lo! there comes<br/>
The wife of Creon, sad Eurydice.<br/>
She from the house is come, or hearing speech<br/>
About her son, or else by chance.<br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> EURYDICE</p>
<p>EURYDICE</p>
<p>
My friends,<br/>
I on my way without, as suppliant bound<br/>
To pay my vows at Pallas' shrine, have heard<br/>
Your words, and so I chanced to slip the bolt<br/>
Of the half-opened door, when, lo! a sound<br/>
Falls on my ears of evil near at hand,<br/>
And terror-struck I fell in deadly swoon<br/>
Back in my handmaids' arms; yet tell it me,<br/>
Tell the tale once again, for I shall hear,<br/>
By long experience disciplined to grief.<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Dear lady, I will tell thee: I was by,<br/>
And will not leave one word of truth untold.<br/>
Why should we smooth and gloze, when all too soon<br/>
We should be found as liars? Truth is still<br/>
The best and wisest. Lo! I went with him,<br/>
Thy husband, in attendance, to the height<br/>
Of yonder plain, where still all ruthlessly<br/>
The corpse of Polynices tombless lay,<br/>
Mangled by dogs. And, having prayed to her,<br/>
The Goddess of all pathways, and to Pluto,<br/>
To look with favour on them, him they washed<br/>
With holy water; and what yet was left<br/>
We burnt in branches freshly cut, and heaped<br/>
A high raised grave from out the soil around,<br/>
And then we entered on the stone-paved home,<br/>
Death's marriage-chamber for the ill-starred maid.<br/>
And some one hears, while standing yet afar,<br/>
Shrill voice of wailing near the bridal bower,<br/>
By funeral rites unhallowed, and he comes<br/>
And tells my master, Creon. On his ears,<br/>
Advancing nearer, falls a shriek confused<br/>
Of bitter sorrow, and with grieving loud,<br/>
He utters one sad cry: "Me miserable!<br/>
And am I, then, a prophet? Do I wend<br/>
This day the dreariest way of all my life?<br/>
My son's voice greets me. Go, my servants, go,<br/>
Quickly draw near, and standing by the tomb,<br/>
Search ye and see; and where the joined stones<br/>
Still leave an opening, look ye in, and say<br/>
If I hear Hæmon's voice, or if my soul<br/>
Is cheated by the Gods." And then we searched,<br/>
As he, our master, in his frenzy, bade us;<br/>
And, in the furthest corner of the vault,<br/>
We saw her hanging by a twisted cord<br/>
Of linen threads entwined, and him we found<br/>
Clasping her form in passionate embrace,<br/>
And mourning o'er the doom that robbed him of her,<br/>
His father's deed, and that his marriage bed,<br/>
So full of sorrow. When he saw him there,<br/>
Groaning again in bitterness of heart,<br/>
He goes to him, and calls in wailing voice,<br/>
"Ah! wretched me! what dost thou! Hast thou lost<br/>
Thy reason? In what evil sinkest thou?<br/>
Come forth, my child, on bended knee I ask thee."<br/>
And then the boy, with fierce, wild gleaming eyes,<br/>
Glared at him, spat upon his face, and draws,<br/>
Still answering naught, the sharp two-edged sword.<br/>
Missing his aim (his father from the blow<br/>
Turning aside), in anger with himself,<br/>
The poor ill-doomed one, even as he was,<br/>
Fell on his sword, and drove it through his breast,<br/>
Full half its length, and clasping, yet alive,<br/>
The maiden's arm, still soft, he there breathes out<br/>
In broken gasps, upon her fair white cheek,<br/>
A rain of blood. And so at last they lie,<br/>
Dead bridegroom with dead bride, and he has gained<br/>
His marriage rites in Hades' darksome home,<br/>
And left to all men witness terrible,<br/>
That man's worst ill is stubbornness of heart.
</p>
<p>[<em>Exit</em> EURYDICE]</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
What dost thou make of this? She turns again,<br/>
And not one word, or good or ill, will speak.<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
I, too, am full of wonder. Yet with hopes<br/>
I feed myself, she will not think it meet,<br/>
Hearing her son's woes, openly to wail<br/>
Before her subjects, but beneath her roof<br/>
Will think it best to bear her private griefs.<br/>
Too trained a judgment has she so to err.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
I know not. To my mind, or silence hard,<br/>
Or vain wild cries, are signs of bitter woe.<br/>
</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Soon we shall know, within the house advancing,<br/>
If, in the passion of her heart, she hides<br/>
A secret purpose. Truly dost thou speak;<br/>
There is a terror in that silence hard.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>[<em>seeing</em> CREON <em>approaching with the corpse of</em> HÆMON <em>in his arms</em>]</p>
<p>
And, lo! the king himself comes on,<br/>
And in his hands he bears a record clear,<br/>
No woe (if I may speak) by others caused,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself the great offender.<br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> CREON <em>bearing</em> HÆMON'S <em>body</em></p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Woe! for the sins of souls of evil mood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong, mighty to destroy;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O ye who look on those of kindred race,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slayers and the slain,<br/>
Woe for mine own rash plans that prosper not;<br/>
Woe for thee, son; but new in life's career,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by a new fate dying.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe! woe!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou diest, thou art gone,<br/>
Not by thine evil counsel, but by mine.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Ah me! Too late thou seem'st to see the right.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Ah me!<br/>
I learn the grievous lesson. On my head,<br/>
God, pressing sore, hath smitten me and vexed,<br/>
In ways most rough and terrible (ah me!),<br/>
Shattering the joy, and trampling underfoot.<br/>
Woe! woe! We toil for that which profits not.<br/>
</p>
<p><em>Enter</em> Second Messenger</p>
<p>SECOND MESSENGER</p>
<p>
My master! thou, as one who hast full store,<br/>
One source of sorrow bearest in thine arms,<br/>
And others in thy house, too soon, it seems,<br/>
Thou need'st must come and see.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And what remains<br/>
Worse evil than the evils that we bear?<br/>
</p>
<p>SECOND MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Thy wife is dead. Thy dead son's mother true,<br/>
Ill starred one, smitten with a deadly blow,<br/>
But some few moments since.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p
>O agony?<br/>
Thou house of Death, that none may purify,<br/>
Why dost thou thus destroy me?<br/>
O thou who comest, bringing in thy train<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woes horrible to tell,<br/>
Thou tramplest on a man already slain.<br/>
What say'st thou? What new tidings bring'st to me?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! ah me!<br/>
Is it that over all the slaughter wrought<br/>
My own wife's death has come to crown it all?<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>It is but all too clear! No longer now<br/>
Does yon recess conceal her.
</p>
<p>[<em>The gates open and show the dead body of</em> EURYDICE]</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Woe is me!<br/>
This second stroke I gaze on, miserable,<br/>
What fate, yea, what still lies in wait for me?<br/>
Here in my arms I bear what was my son;<br/>
And there, O misery! look upon the dead.<br/>
Ah, wretched mother! ah, my son! my son!<br/>
</p>
<p>SECOND MESSENGER</p>
<p>
Sore wounded, she around the altar clung,<br/>
And closed her darkening eyelids, and bewailed<br/>
The honoured bed of Megareus, who died<br/>
Long since, and then again that corpse thou hast;<br/>
And last of all she cried a bitter cry<br/>
Against thy deeds, the murderer of thy son.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Woe! woe! alas!<br/>
I shudder in my fear: Will no one strike<br/>
A deadly blow with sharp two-edg&egrave;d sword?<br/>
Fearful my fate, alas!<br/>
And with a fearful woe full sore beset.<br/>
</p>
<p>SECOND MESSENGER</p>
<p>
She in her death charged thee with being the cause<br/>
Of all their sorrows, his and hers alike.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
And in what way struck she the murderous blow?<br/>
</p>
<p>SECOND MESSENGER</p>
<p>
With her own hand below her heart she stabbed,<br/>
Hearing her son's most pitiable fate.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Ah me! The fault is mine. On no one else,<br/>
Of all that live, the fearful guilt can come;<br/>
I, even I, did slay thee, wretched one,<br/>
I; yes, I say it clearly. Come, ye guards,<br/>
Lead me forth quickly; lead me out of sight,<br/>
More crushed to nothing than the dead unborn.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Thou counsellest gain, if gain there be in ills,<br/>
For present evils then are easiest borne<br/>
When shortest lived.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
Oh, come thou, then, come thou,<br/>
Last of my sorrows, that shall bring to me<br/>
Best boon, my life's last day. Come, then, oh, come<br/>
That nevermore I look upon the light.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
These things are in the future. What is near,<br/>
That we must do. O'er what is yet to come<br/>
They watch, to whom that work of right belongs.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON</p>
<p>
I did but pray for what I most desire.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Pray thou for nothing more. For mortal man<br/>
There is no issue from a doom decreed.<br/>
</p>
<p>CREON [<em>looking at the two corpses</em>]</p>
<p>
Lead me, then, forth,<br/>
vain shadow that I am,<br/>
Who slew thee, O my son, unwittingly,<br/>
And thee, too &mdash; (O my sorrow) &mdash; and I know not<br/>
Which way to look. All near at hand is turned<br/>
Aside to evil; and upon my head<br/>
There falls a doom far worse than I can bear.<br/>
</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>
Man's highest blessedness<br/>
In wisdom chiefly stands;<br/>
And in the things that touch upon the Gods,<br/>
'Tis best in word of deed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To shun unholy pride;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Great words of boasting bring great punishments;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so to gray-haired age<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes wisdom at the last.<br/>

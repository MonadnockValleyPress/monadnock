<h1>Paradise Lost</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<h2>Book V</h2>
<p>
Now Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime<br/>
Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl,<br/>
When Adam waked, so customed; for his sleep<br/>
Was aery-light, from pure digestion bred,<br/>
And temperate vapours bland, which the only sound<br/>
Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan,<br/>
Lightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song<br/>
Of birds on every bough; so much the more<br/>
His wonder was to find unwakened Eve<br/>
With tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek,<br/>
As through unquiet rest: He, on his side<br/>
Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love<br/>
Hung over her enamoured, and beheld<br/>
Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep,<br/>
Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice<br/>
Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,<br/>
Her hand soft touching, whispered thus. Awake,<br/>
My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,<br/>
Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!<br/>
Awake: The morning shines, and the fresh field<br/>
Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring<br/>
Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove,<br/>
What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,<br/>
How nature paints her colours, how the bee<br/>
Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.<br/>
Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye<br/>
On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.<br/>
O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,<br/>
My glory, my perfection! glad I see<br/>
Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night<br/>
(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,<br/>
If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,<br/>
Works of day past, or morrow's next design,<br/>
But of offence and trouble, which my mind<br/>
Knew never till this irksome night: Methought,<br/>
Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk<br/>
With gentle voice; I thought it thine: It said,<br/>
"Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,<br/>
The cool, the silent, save where silence yields<br/>
To the night-warbling bird, that now awake<br/>
Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns<br/>
Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light<br/>
Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,<br/>
If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,<br/>
Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire?<br/>
In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment<br/>
Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze."<br/>
I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;<br/>
To find thee I directed then my walk;<br/>
And on, methought, alone I passed through ways<br/>
That brought me on a sudden to the tree<br/>
Of interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,<br/>
Much fairer to my fancy than by day:<br/>
And, as I wondering looked, beside it stood<br/>
One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven<br/>
By us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled<br/>
Ambrosia; on that tree he also gazed;<br/>
And "O fair plant," said he, "with fruit surcharged,<br/>
Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,<br/>
Nor God, nor Man? Is knowledge so despised?<br/>
Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?<br/>
Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold<br/>
Longer thy offered good; why else set here?"<br/>
This said, he paused not, but with venturous arm<br/>
He plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled<br/>
At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:<br/>
But he thus, overjoyed; "O fruit divine,<br/>
Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,<br/>
Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit<br/>
For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:<br/>
And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more<br/>
Communicated, more abundant grows,<br/>
The author not impaired, but honoured more?<br/>
Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!<br/>
Partake thou also; happy though thou art,<br/>
Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:<br/>
Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods<br/>
Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,<br/>
But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes<br/>
Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see<br/>
What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!"<br/>
So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,<br/>
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part<br/>
Which he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell<br/>
So quickened appetite, that I, methought,<br/>
Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the clouds<br/>
With him I flew, and underneath beheld<br/>
The earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide<br/>
And various: Wondering at my flight and change<br/>
To this high exaltation; suddenly<br/>
My guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,<br/>
And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked<br/>
To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her night<br/>
Related, and thus Adam answered sad.<br/>
Best image of myself, and dearer half,<br/>
The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep<br/>
Affects me equally; nor can I like<br/>
This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;<br/>
Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,<br/>
Created pure. But know that in the soul<br/>
Are many lesser faculties, that serve<br/>
Reason as chief; among these Fancy next<br/>
Her office holds; of all external things<br/>
Which the five watchful senses represent,<br/>
She forms imaginations, aery shapes,<br/>
Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames<br/>
All what we affirm or what deny, and call<br/>
Our knowledge or opinion; then retires<br/>
Into her private cell, when nature rests.<br/>
Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes<br/>
To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,<br/>
Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams;<br/>
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.<br/>
Some such resemblances, methinks, I find<br/>
Of our last evening's talk, in this thy dream,<br/>
But with addition strange; yet be not sad.<br/>
Evil into the mind of God or Man<br/>
May come and go, so unreproved, and leave<br/>
No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope<br/>
That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,<br/>
Waking thou never will consent to do.<br/>
Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,<br/>
That wont to be more cheerful and serene,<br/>
Than when fair morning first smiles on the world;<br/>
And let us to our fresh employments rise<br/>
Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers<br/>
That open now their choisest bosomed smells,<br/>
Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store.<br/>
So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;<br/>
But silently a gentle tear let fall<br/>
From either eye, and wiped them with her hair;<br/>
Two other precious drops that ready stood,<br/>
Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell<br/>
Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse<br/>
And pious awe, that feared to have offended.<br/>
So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.<br/>
But first, from under shady arborous roof<br/>
Soon as they forth were come to open sight<br/>
Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,<br/>
With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,<br/>
Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,<br/>
Discovering in wide landskip all the east<br/>
Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains,<br/>
Lowly they bowed adoring, and began<br/>
Their orisons, each morning duly paid<br/>
In various style; for neither various style<br/>
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise<br/>
Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung<br/>
Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence<br/>
Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,<br/>
More tuneable than needed lute or harp<br/>
To add more sweetness; and they thus began.<br/>
These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,<br/>
Almighty! Thine this universal frame,<br/>
Thus wonderous fair; Thyself how wonderous then!<br/>
Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens<br/>
To us invisible, or dimly seen<br/>
In these thy lowest works; yet these declare<br/>
Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.<br/>
Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,<br/>
Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs<br/>
And choral symphonies, day without night,<br/>
Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven<br/>
On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol<br/>
Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.<br/>
Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,<br/>
If better thou belong not to the dawn,<br/>
Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn<br/>
With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,<br/>
While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.<br/>
Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,<br/>
Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise<br/>
In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,<br/>
And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.<br/>
Moon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,<br/>
With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;<br/>
And ye five other wandering Fires, that move<br/>
In mystick dance not without song, resound<br/>
His praise, who out of darkness called up light.<br/>
Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth<br/>
Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run<br/>
Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix<br/>
And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change<br/>
Vary to our great Maker still new praise.<br/>
Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise<br/>
From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,<br/>
Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,<br/>
In honour to the world's great Author rise;<br/>
Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,<br/>
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,<br/>
Rising or falling still advance his praise.<br/>
His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,<br/>
Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,<br/>
With every plant, in sign of worship wave.<br/>
Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,<br/>
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.<br/>
Join voices, all ye living Souls: Ye Birds,<br/>
That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,<br/>
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.<br/>
Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk<br/>
The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;<br/>
Witness if I be silent, morn or even,<br/>
To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,<br/>
Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.<br/>
Hail, universal Lord, be bounteous still<br/>
To give us only good; and if the night<br/>
Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed,<br/>
Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark!<br/>
So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts<br/>
Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.<br/>
On to their morning's rural work they haste,<br/>
Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row<br/>
Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far<br/>
Their pampered boughs, and needed hands to check<br/>
Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine<br/>
To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines<br/>
Her marriageable arms, and with him brings<br/>
Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn<br/>
His barren leaves. Them thus employed beheld<br/>
With pity Heaven's high King, and to him called<br/>
Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned<br/>
To travel with Tobias, and secured<br/>
His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.<br/>
Raphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth<br/>
Satan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf,<br/>
Hath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed<br/>
This night the human pair; how he designs<br/>
In them at once to ruin all mankind.<br/>
Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend<br/>
Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade<br/>
Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired,<br/>
To respite his day-labour with repast,<br/>
Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,<br/>
As may advise him of his happy state,<br/>
Happiness in his power left free to will,<br/>
Left to his own free will, his will though free,<br/>
Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware<br/>
He swerve not, too secure: Tell him withal<br/>
His danger, and from whom; what enemy,<br/>
Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now<br/>
The fall of others from like state of bliss;<br/>
By violence? no, for that shall be withstood;<br/>
But by deceit and lies: This let him know,<br/>
Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend<br/>
Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.<br/>
So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled<br/>
All justice: Nor delayed the winged Saint<br/>
After his charge received; but from among<br/>
Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood<br/>
Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,<br/>
Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,<br/>
On each hand parting, to his speed gave way<br/>
Through all the empyreal road; till, at the gate<br/>
Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide<br/>
On golden hinges turning, as by work<br/>
Divine the sovran Architect had framed.<br/>
From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,<br/>
Star interposed, however small he sees,<br/>
Not unconformed to other shining globes,<br/>
Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned<br/>
Above all hills. As when by night the glass<br/>
Of Galileo, less assured, observes<br/>
Imagined lands and regions in the moon:<br/>
Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades<br/>
Delos or Samos first appearing, kens<br/>
A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight<br/>
He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky<br/>
Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing<br/>
Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan<br/>
Winnows the buxom air; till, within soar<br/>
Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems<br/>
A phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,<br/>
When, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's<br/>
Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.<br/>
At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise<br/>
He lights, and to his proper shape returns<br/>
A Seraph winged: Six wings he wore, to shade<br/>
His lineaments divine; the pair that clad<br/>
Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast<br/>
With regal ornament; the middle pair<br/>
Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round<br/>
Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold<br/>
And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet<br/>
Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail,<br/>
Sky-tinctured grain. Like Maia's son he stood,<br/>
And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled<br/>
The circuit wide. Straight knew him all the bands<br/>
Of Angels under watch; and to his state,<br/>
And to his message high, in honour rise;<br/>
For on some message high they guessed him bound.<br/>
Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come<br/>
Into the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,<br/>
And flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;<br/>
A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here<br/>
Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will<br/>
Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,<br/>
Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss.<br/>
Him through the spicy forest onward come<br/>
Adam discerned, as in the door he sat<br/>
Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun<br/>
Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm<br/>
Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:<br/>
And Eve within, due at her hour prepared<br/>
For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please<br/>
True appetite, and not disrelish thirst<br/>
Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,<br/>
Berry or grape: To whom thus Adam called.<br/>
Haste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold<br/>
Eastward among those trees, what glorious shape<br/>
Comes this way moving; seems another morn<br/>
Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven<br/>
To us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe<br/>
This day to be our guest. But go with speed,<br/>
And, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour<br/>
Abundance, fit to honour and receive<br/>
Our heavenly stranger: Well we may afford<br/>
Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow<br/>
From large bestowed, where Nature multiplies<br/>
Her fertile growth, and by disburthening grows<br/>
More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.<br/>
To whom thus Eve. Adam, earth's hallowed mould,<br/>
Of God inspired! small store will serve, where store,<br/>
All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;<br/>
Save what by frugal storing firmness gains<br/>
To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:<br/>
But I will haste, and from each bough and brake,<br/>
Each plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice<br/>
To entertain our Angel-guest, as he<br/>
Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth<br/>
God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.<br/>
So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste<br/>
She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent<br/>
What choice to choose for delicacy best,<br/>
What order, so contrived as not to mix<br/>
Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring<br/>
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change;<br/>
Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk<br/>
Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields<br/>
In India East or West, or middle shore<br/>
In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where<br/>
Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat<br/>
Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,<br/>
She gathers, tribute large, and on the board<br/>
Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape<br/>
She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths<br/>
From many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed<br/>
She tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold<br/>
Wants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground<br/>
With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.<br/>
Mean while our primitive great sire, to meet<br/>
His God-like guest, walks forth, without more train<br/>
Accompanied than with his own complete<br/>
Perfections; in himself was all his state,<br/>
More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits<br/>
On princes, when their rich retinue long<br/>
Of horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,<br/>
Dazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.<br/>
Nearer his presence Adam, though not awed,<br/>
Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,<br/>
As to a superiour nature bowing low,<br/>
Thus said. Native of Heaven, for other place<br/>
None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;<br/>
Since, by descending from the thrones above,<br/>
Those happy places thou hast deigned a while<br/>
To want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us<br/>
Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess<br/>
This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower<br/>
To rest; and what the garden choicest bears<br/>
To sit and taste, till this meridian heat<br/>
Be over, and the sun more cool decline.<br/>
Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.<br/>
Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such<br/>
Created, or such place hast here to dwell,<br/>
As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,<br/>
To visit thee; lead on then where thy bower<br/>
O'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,<br/>
I have at will. So to the sylvan lodge<br/>
They came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,<br/>
With flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,<br/>
Undecked save with herself, more lovely fair<br/>
Than Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned<br/>
Of three that in mount Ida naked strove,<br/>
Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil<br/>
She needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm<br/>
Altered her cheek. On whom the Angel Hail<br/>
Bestowed, the holy salutation used<br/>
Long after to blest Mary, second Eve.<br/>
Hail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb<br/>
Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,<br/>
Than with these various fruits the trees of God<br/>
Have heaped this table!&mdash;Raised of grassy turf<br/>
Their table was, and mossy seats had round,<br/>
And on her ample square from side to side<br/>
All autumn piled, though spring and autumn here<br/>
Danced hand in hand. A while discourse they hold;<br/>
No fear lest dinner cool; when thus began<br/>
Our author. Heavenly stranger, please to taste<br/>
These bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom<br/>
All perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,<br/>
To us for food and for delight hath caused<br/>
The earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps<br/>
To spiritual natures; only this I know,<br/>
That one celestial Father gives to all.<br/>
To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives<br/>
(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part<br/>
Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found<br/>
No ingrateful food: And food alike those pure<br/>
Intelligential substances require,<br/>
As doth your rational; and both contain<br/>
Within them every lower faculty<br/>
Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,<br/>
Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,<br/>
And corporeal to incorporeal turn.<br/>
For know, whatever was created, needs<br/>
To be sustained and fed: Of elements<br/>
The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,<br/>
Earth and the sea feed air, the air those fires<br/>
Ethereal, and as lowest first the moon;<br/>
Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged<br/>
Vapours not yet into her substance turned.<br/>
Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale<br/>
From her moist continent to higher orbs.<br/>
The sun that light imparts to all, receives<br/>
From all his alimental recompence<br/>
In humid exhalations, and at even<br/>
Sups with the ocean. Though in Heaven the trees<br/>
Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines<br/>
Yield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn<br/>
We brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground<br/>
Covered with pearly grain: Yet God hath here<br/>
Varied his bounty so with new delights,<br/>
As may compare with Heaven; and to taste<br/>
Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat,<br/>
And to their viands fell; nor seemingly<br/>
The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss<br/>
Of Theologians; but with keen dispatch<br/>
Of real hunger, and concoctive heat<br/>
To transubstantiate: What redounds, transpires<br/>
Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire<br/>
Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist<br/>
Can turn, or holds it possible to turn,<br/>
Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,<br/>
As from the mine. Mean while at table Eve<br/>
Ministered naked, and their flowing cups<br/>
With pleasant liquours crowned: O innocence<br/>
Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,<br/>
Then had the sons of God excuse to have been<br/>
Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts<br/>
Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy<br/>
Was understood, the injured lover's hell.<br/>
Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,<br/>
Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose<br/>
In Adam, not to let the occasion pass<br/>
Given him by this great conference to know<br/>
Of things above his world, and of their being<br/>
Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw<br/>
Transcend his own so far; whose radiant forms,<br/>
Divine effulgence, whose high power, so far<br/>
Exceeded human; and his wary speech<br/>
Thus to the empyreal minister he framed.<br/>
Inhabitant with God, now know I well<br/>
Thy favour, in this honour done to Man;<br/>
Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed<br/>
To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,<br/>
Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,<br/>
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem<br/>
At Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare<br/>
To whom the winged Hierarch replied.<br/>
O Adam, One Almighty is, from whom<br/>
All things proceed, and up to him return,<br/>
If not depraved from good, created all<br/>
Such to perfection, one first matter all,<br/>
Endued with various forms, various degrees<br/>
Of substance, and, in things that live, of life;<br/>
But more refined, more spiritous, and pure,<br/>
As nearer to him placed, or nearer tending<br/>
Each in their several active spheres assigned,<br/>
Till body up to spirit work, in bounds<br/>
Proportioned to each kind. So from the root<br/>
Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves<br/>
More aery, last the bright consummate flower<br/>
Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,<br/>
Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,<br/>
To vital spirits aspire, to animal,<br/>
To intellectual; give both life and sense,<br/>
Fancy and understanding; whence the soul<br/>
Reason receives, and reason is her being,<br/>
Discursive, or intuitive; discourse<br/>
Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,<br/>
Differing but in degree, of kind the same.<br/>
Wonder not then, what God for you saw good<br/>
If I refuse not, but convert, as you<br/>
To proper substance. Time may come, when Men<br/>
With Angels may participate, and find<br/>
No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;<br/>
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps<br/>
Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit,<br/>
Improved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend<br/>
Ethereal, as we; or may, at choice,<br/>
Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell;<br/>
If ye be found obedient, and retain<br/>
Unalterably firm his love entire,<br/>
Whose progeny you are. Mean while enjoy<br/>
Your fill what happiness this happy state<br/>
Can comprehend, incapable of more.<br/>
To whom the patriarch of mankind replied.<br/>
O favourable Spirit, propitious guest,<br/>
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct<br/>
Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set<br/>
From center to circumference; whereon,<br/>
In contemplation of created things,<br/>
By steps we may ascend to God. But say,<br/>
What meant that caution joined, If ye be found<br/>
Obedient? Can we want obedience then<br/>
To him, or possibly his love desert,<br/>
Who formed us from the dust and placed us here<br/>
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss<br/>
Human desires can seek or apprehend?<br/>
To whom the Angel. Son of Heaven and Earth,<br/>
Attend! That thou art happy, owe to God;<br/>
That thou continuest such, owe to thyself,<br/>
That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.<br/>
This was that caution given thee; be advised.<br/>
God made thee perfect, not immutable;<br/>
And good he made thee, but to persevere<br/>
He left it in thy power; ordained thy will<br/>
By nature free, not over-ruled by fate<br/>
Inextricable, or strict necessity:<br/>
Our voluntary service he requires,<br/>
Not our necessitated; such with him<br/>
Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how<br/>
Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve<br/>
Willing or no, who will but what they must<br/>
By destiny, and can no other choose?<br/>
Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand<br/>
In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state<br/>
Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;<br/>
On other surety none: Freely we serve,<br/>
Because we freely love, as in our will<br/>
To love or not; in this we stand or fall:<br/>
And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,<br/>
And so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall<br/>
From what high state of bliss, into what woe!<br/>
To whom our great progenitor. Thy words<br/>
Attentive, and with more delighted ear,<br/>
Divine instructer, I have heard, than when<br/>
Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills<br/>
Aereal musick send: Nor knew I not<br/>
To be both will and deed created free;<br/>
Yet that we never shall forget to love<br/>
Our Maker, and obey him whose command<br/>
Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts<br/>
Assured me, and still assure: Though what thou tellest<br/>
Hath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,<br/>
But more desire to hear, if thou consent,<br/>
The full relation, which must needs be strange,<br/>
Worthy of sacred silence to be heard;<br/>
And we have yet large day, for scarce the sun<br/>
Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins<br/>
His other half in the great zone of Heaven.<br/>
Thus Adam made request; and Raphael,<br/>
After short pause assenting, thus began.<br/>
High matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,<br/>
Sad task and hard: For how shall I relate<br/>
To human sense the invisible exploits<br/>
Of warring Spirits? how, without remorse,<br/>
The ruin of so many glorious once<br/>
And perfect while they stood? how last unfold<br/>
The secrets of another world, perhaps<br/>
Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good<br/>
This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach<br/>
Of human sense, I shall delineate so,<br/>
By likening spiritual to corporal forms,<br/>
As may express them best; though what if Earth<br/>
Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein<br/>
Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?<br/>
As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild<br/>
Reigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests<br/>
Upon her center poised; when on a day<br/>
(For time, though in eternity, applied<br/>
To motion, measures all things durable<br/>
By present, past, and future,) on such day<br/>
As Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host<br/>
Of Angels by imperial summons called,<br/>
Innumerable before the Almighty's throne<br/>
Forthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared<br/>
Under their Hierarchs in orders bright:<br/>
Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,<br/>
Standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear<br/>
Stream in the air, and for distinction serve<br/>
Of hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;<br/>
Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed<br/>
Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love<br/>
Recorded eminent. Thus when in orbs<br/>
Of circuit inexpressible they stood,<br/>
Orb within orb, the Father Infinite,<br/>
By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,<br/>
Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top<br/>
Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.<br/>
Hear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,<br/>
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;<br/>
Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.<br/>
This day I have begot whom I declare<br/>
My only Son, and on this holy hill<br/>
Him have anointed, whom ye now behold<br/>
At my right hand; your head I him appoint;<br/>
And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow<br/>
All knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:<br/>
Under his great vice-gerent reign abide<br/>
United, as one individual soul,<br/>
For ever happy: Him who disobeys,<br/>
Me disobeys, breaks union, and that day,<br/>
Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls<br/>
Into utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place<br/>
Ordained without redemption, without end.<br/>
So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words<br/>
All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.<br/>
That day, as other solemn days, they spent<br/>
In song and dance about the sacred hill;<br/>
Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere<br/>
Of planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels<br/>
Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,<br/>
Eccentrick, intervolved, yet regular<br/>
Then most, when most irregular they seem;<br/>
And in their motions harmony divine<br/>
So smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear<br/>
Listens delighted. Evening now approached,<br/>
(For we have also our evening and our morn,<br/>
We ours for change delectable, not need;)<br/>
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn<br/>
Desirous; all in circles as they stood,<br/>
Tables are set, and on a sudden piled<br/>
With Angels food, and rubied nectar flows<br/>
In pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,<br/>
Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.<br/>
On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,<br/>
They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet<br/>
Quaff immortality and joy, secure<br/>
Of surfeit, where full measure only bounds<br/>
Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered<br/>
With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.<br/>
Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled<br/>
From that high mount of God, whence light and shade<br/>
Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed<br/>
To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there<br/>
In darker veil) and roseate dews disposed<br/>
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;<br/>
Wide over all the plain, and wider far<br/>
Than all this globous earth in plain outspread,<br/>
(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,<br/>
Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend<br/>
By living streams among the trees of life,<br/>
Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared,<br/>
Celestial tabernacles, where they slept<br/>
Fanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,<br/>
Melodious hymns about the sovran throne<br/>
Alternate all night long: but not so waked<br/>
Satan; so call him now, his former name<br/>
Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,<br/>
If not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,<br/>
In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught<br/>
With envy against the Son of God, that day<br/>
Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed<br/>
Messiah King anointed, could not bear<br/>
Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.<br/>
Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,<br/>
Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour<br/>
Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved<br/>
With all his legions to dislodge, and leave<br/>
Unworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,<br/>
Contemptuous; and his next subordinate<br/>
Awakening, thus to him in secret spake.<br/>
Sleepest thou, Companion dear? What sleep can close<br/>
Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree<br/>
Of yesterday, so late hath passed the lips<br/>
Of Heaven's Almighty. Thou to me thy thoughts<br/>
Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;<br/>
Both waking we were one; how then can now<br/>
Thy sleep dissent? New laws thou seest imposed;<br/>
New laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise<br/>
In us who serve, new counsels to debate<br/>
What doubtful may ensue: More in this place<br/>
To utter is not safe. Assemble thou<br/>
Of all those myriads which we lead the chief;<br/>
Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim night<br/>
Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,<br/>
And all who under me their banners wave,<br/>
Homeward, with flying march, where we possess<br/>
The quarters of the north; there to prepare<br/>
Fit entertainment to receive our King,<br/>
The great Messiah, and his new commands,<br/>
Who speedily through all the hierarchies<br/>
Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws.<br/>
So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused<br/>
Bad influence into the unwary breast<br/>
Of his associate: He together calls,<br/>
Or several one by one, the regent Powers,<br/>
Under him Regent; tells, as he was taught,<br/>
That the Most High commanding, now ere night,<br/>
Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,<br/>
The great hierarchal standard was to move;<br/>
Tells the suggested cause, and casts between<br/>
Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound<br/>
Or taint integrity: But all obeyed<br/>
The wonted signal, and superiour voice<br/>
Of their great Potentate; for great indeed<br/>
His name, and high was his degree in Heaven;<br/>
His countenance, as the morning-star that guides<br/>
The starry flock, allured them, and with lies<br/>
Drew after him the third part of Heaven's host.<br/>
Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns<br/>
Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,<br/>
And from within the golden lamps that burn<br/>
Nightly before him, saw without their light<br/>
Rebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread<br/>
Among the sons of morn, what multitudes<br/>
Were banded to oppose his high decree;<br/>
And, smiling, to his only Son thus said.<br/>
Son, thou in whom my glory I behold<br/>
In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,<br/>
Nearly it now concerns us to be sure<br/>
Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms<br/>
We mean to hold what anciently we claim<br/>
Of deity or empire: Such a foe<br/>
Is rising, who intends to erect his throne<br/>
Equal to ours, throughout the spacious north;<br/>
Nor so content, hath in his thought to try<br/>
In battle, what our power is, or our right.<br/>
Let us advise, and to this hazard draw<br/>
With speed what force is left, and all employ<br/>
In our defence; lest unawares we lose<br/>
This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.<br/>
To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,<br/>
Lightning divine, ineffable, serene,<br/>
Made answer. Mighty Father, thou thy foes<br/>
Justly hast in derision, and, secure,<br/>
Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,<br/>
Matter to me of glory, whom their hate<br/>
Illustrates, when they see all regal power<br/>
Given me to quell their pride, and in event<br/>
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue<br/>
Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.<br/>
So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,<br/>
Far was advanced on winged speed; an host<br/>
Innumerable as the stars of night,<br/>
Or stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun<br/>
Impearls on every leaf and every flower.<br/>
Regions they passed, the mighty regencies<br/>
Of Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,<br/>
In their triple degrees; regions to which<br/>
All thy dominion, Adam, is no more<br/>
Than what this garden is to all the earth,<br/>
And all the sea, from one entire globose<br/>
Stretched into longitude; which having passed,<br/>
At length into the limits of the north<br/>
They came; and Satan to his royal seat<br/>
High on a hill, far blazing, as a mount<br/>
Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers<br/>
From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;<br/>
The palace of great Lucifer, (so call<br/>
That structure in the dialect of men<br/>
Interpreted,) which not long after, he<br/>
Affecting all equality with God,<br/>
In imitation of that mount whereon<br/>
Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven,<br/>
The Mountain of the Congregation called;<br/>
For thither he assembled all his train,<br/>
Pretending so commanded to consult<br/>
About the great reception of their King,<br/>
Thither to come, and with calumnious art<br/>
Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears.<br/>
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;<br/>
If these magnifick titles yet remain<br/>
Not merely titular, since by decree<br/>
Another now hath to himself engrossed<br/>
All power, and us eclipsed under the name<br/>
Of King anointed, for whom all this haste<br/>
Of midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,<br/>
This only to consult how we may best,<br/>
With what may be devised of honours new,<br/>
Receive him coming to receive from us<br/>
Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!<br/>
Too much to one! but double how endured,<br/>
To one, and to his image now proclaimed?<br/>
But what if better counsels might erect<br/>
Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?<br/>
Will ye submit your necks, and choose to bend<br/>
The supple knee? Ye will not, if I trust<br/>
To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves<br/>
Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before<br/>
By none; and if not equal all, yet free,<br/>
Equally free; for orders and degrees<br/>
Jar not with liberty, but well consist.<br/>
Who can in reason then, or right, assume<br/>
Monarchy over such as live by right<br/>
His equals, if in power and splendour less,<br/>
In freedom equal? or can introduce<br/>
Law and edict on us, who without law<br/>
Err not? much less for this to be our Lord,<br/>
And look for adoration, to the abuse<br/>
Of those imperial titles, which assert<br/>
Our being ordained to govern, not to serve.<br/>
Thus far his bold discourse without controul<br/>
Had audience; when among the Seraphim<br/>
Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored<br/>
The Deity, and divine commands obeyed,<br/>
Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe<br/>
The current of his fury thus opposed.<br/>
O argument blasphemous, false, and proud!<br/>
Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven<br/>
Expected, least of all from thee, Ingrate,<br/>
In place thyself so high above thy peers.<br/>
Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn<br/>
The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,<br/>
That to his only Son, by right endued<br/>
With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven<br/>
Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due<br/>
Confess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,<br/>
Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,<br/>
And equal over equals to let reign,<br/>
One over all with unsucceeded power.<br/>
Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute<br/>
With him the points of liberty, who made<br/>
Thee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven<br/>
Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?<br/>
Yet, by experience taught, we know how good,<br/>
And of our good and of our dignity<br/>
How provident he is; how far from thought<br/>
To make us less, bent rather to exalt<br/>
Our happy state, under one head more near<br/>
United. But to grant it thee unjust,<br/>
That equal over equals monarch reign:<br/>
Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,<br/>
Or all angelick nature joined in one,<br/>
Equal to him begotten Son? by whom,<br/>
As by his Word, the Mighty Father made<br/>
All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven<br/>
By him created in their bright degrees,<br/>
Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named<br/>
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,<br/>
Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,<br/>
But more illustrious made; since he the head<br/>
One of our number thus reduced becomes;<br/>
His laws our laws; all honour to him done<br/>
Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage,<br/>
And tempt not these; but hasten to appease<br/>
The incensed Father, and the incensed Son,<br/>
While pardon may be found in time besought.<br/>
So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal<br/>
None seconded, as out of season judged,<br/>
Or singular and rash: Whereat rejoiced<br/>
The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.<br/>
That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work<br/>
Of secondary hands, by task transferred<br/>
From Father to his Son? strange point and new!<br/>
Doctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw<br/>
When this creation was? rememberest thou<br/>
Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?<br/>
We know no time when we were not as now;<br/>
Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised<br/>
By our own quickening power, when fatal course<br/>
Had circled his full orb, the birth mature<br/>
Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.<br/>
Our puissance is our own; our own right hand<br/>
Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try<br/>
Who is our equal: Then thou shalt behold<br/>
Whether by supplication we intend<br/>
Address, and to begirt the almighty throne<br/>
Beseeching or besieging. This report,<br/>
These tidings carry to the anointed King;<br/>
And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.<br/>
He said; and, as the sound of waters deep,<br/>
Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause<br/>
Through the infinite host; nor less for that<br/>
The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone<br/>
Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.<br/>
O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,<br/>
Forsaken of all good! I see thy fall<br/>
Determined, and thy hapless crew involved<br/>
In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread<br/>
Both of thy crime and punishment: Henceforth<br/>
No more be troubled how to quit the yoke<br/>
Of God's Messiah; those indulgent laws<br/>
Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees<br/>
Against thee are gone forth without recall;<br/>
That golden scepter, which thou didst reject,<br/>
Is now an iron rod to bruise and break<br/>
Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise;<br/>
Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly<br/>
These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath<br/>
Impendent, raging into sudden flame,<br/>
Distinguish not: For soon expect to feel<br/>
His thunder on thy head, devouring fire.<br/>
Then who created thee lamenting learn,<br/>
When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.<br/>
So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found<br/>
Among the faithless, faithful only he;<br/>
Among innumerable false, unmoved,<br/>
Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,<br/>
His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;<br/>
Nor number, nor example, with him wrought<br/>
To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,<br/>
Though single. From amidst them forth he passed,<br/>
Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained<br/>
Superiour, nor of violence feared aught;<br/>
And, with retorted scorn, his back he turned<br/>
On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.

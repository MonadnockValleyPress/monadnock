<h1>On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<p>
How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stolen on his wing my three-and-twentieth year!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hasting days fly on with full career,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.<br/>
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I to manhood am arrived so near;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And inward ripeness doth much less appear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That some more timely-happy spirits endu'th.<br/>
Yet, be it less or more, or soon or slow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be still in strictest measure even<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that same lot, however mean or high,<br/>
Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is, if I have grace to use it so,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ever in my great Task-Master's eye.

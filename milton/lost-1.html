<h1>Paradise Lost</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<h2>Book I</h2>
<p>
Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit<br/>
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste<br/>
Brought death into the World, and all our woe,<br/>
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man<br/>
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,<br/>
Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top<br/>
Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire<br/>
That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed<br/>
In the beginning how the heavens and earth<br/>
Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill<br/>
Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed<br/>
Fast by the oracle of God, I thence<br/>
Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,<br/>
That with no middle flight intends to soar<br/>
Above th' Aonian mount, while it pursues<br/>
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.<br/>
And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer<br/>
Before all temples th' upright heart and pure,<br/>
Instruct me, for thou know'st; thou from the first<br/>
Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread,<br/>
Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss,<br/>
And mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark<br/>
Illumine, what is low raise and support;<br/>
That, to the height of this great argument,<br/>
I may assert Eternal Providence,<br/>
And justify the ways of God to men.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say first&mdash;for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,<br/>
Nor the deep tract of Hell&mdash;say first what cause<br/>
Moved our grand parents, in that happy state,<br/>
Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off<br/>
From their Creator, and transgress his will<br/>
For one restraint, lords of the World besides.<br/>
Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile,<br/>
Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived<br/>
The mother of mankind, what time his pride<br/>
Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host<br/>
Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring<br/>
To set himself in glory above his peers,<br/>
He trusted to have equalled the Most High,<br/>
If he opposed, and with ambitious aim<br/>
Against the throne and monarchy of God,<br/>
Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud,<br/>
With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power<br/>
Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky,<br/>
With hideous ruin and combustion, down<br/>
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell<br/>
In adamantine chains and penal fire,<br/>
Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine times the space that measures day and night<br/>
To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew,<br/>
Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf,<br/>
Confounded, though immortal. But his doom<br/>
Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought<br/>
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain<br/>
Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes,<br/>
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay,<br/>
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.<br/>
At once, as far as Angels ken, he views<br/>
The dismal situation waste and wild.<br/>
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round,<br/>
As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames<br/>
No light; but rather darkness visible<br/>
Served only to discover sights of woe,<br/>
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace<br/>
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes<br/>
That comes to all, but torture without end<br/>
Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed<br/>
With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.<br/>
Such place Eternal Justice has prepared<br/>
For those rebellious; here their prison ordained<br/>
In utter darkness, and their portion set,<br/>
As far removed from God and light of Heaven<br/>
As from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole.<br/>
Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!<br/>
There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelmed<br/>
With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,<br/>
He soon discerns; and, weltering by his side,<br/>
One next himself in power, and next in crime,<br/>
Long after known in Palestine, and named<br/>
Beelzebub. To whom th' Arch-Enemy,<br/>
And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words<br/>
Breaking the horrid silence, thus began:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If thou beest he&mdash;but O how fallen! how changed<br/>
From him who, in the happy realms of light<br/>
Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine<br/>
Myriads, though bright!&mdash;if he whom mutual league,<br/>
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope<br/>
And hazard in the glorious enterprise<br/>
Joined with me once, now misery hath joined<br/>
In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest<br/>
From what height fallen: so much the stronger proved<br/>
He with his thunder; and till then who knew<br/>
The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those,<br/>
Nor what the potent Victor in his rage<br/>
Can else inflict, do I repent, or change,<br/>
Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind,<br/>
And high disdain from sense of injured merit,<br/>
That with the Mightiest raised me to contend,<br/>
And to the fierce contentions brought along<br/>
Innumerable force of Spirits armed,<br/>
That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,<br/>
His utmost power with adverse power opposed<br/>
In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven,<br/>
And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?<br/>
All is not lost&mdash;the unconquerable will,<br/>
And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br/>
And courage never to submit or yield:<br/>
And what is else not to be overcome?<br/>
That glory never shall his wrath or might<br/>
Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace<br/>
With suppliant knee, and deify his power<br/>
Who, from the terror of this arm, so late<br/>
Doubted his empire&mdash;that were low indeed;<br/>
That were an ignominy and shame beneath<br/>
This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods,<br/>
And this empyreal substance, cannot fail;<br/>
Since, through experience of this great event,<br/>
In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,<br/>
We may with more successful hope resolve<br/>
To wage by force or guile eternal war,<br/>
Irreconcilable to our grand Foe,<br/>
Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy<br/>
Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake th' apostate Angel, though in pain,<br/>
Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;<br/>
And him thus answered soon his bold compeer:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers<br/>
That led th' embattled Seraphim to war<br/>
Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds<br/>
Fearless, endangered Heaven's perpetual King,<br/>
And put to proof his high supremacy,<br/>
Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate,<br/>
Too well I see and rue the dire event<br/>
That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat,<br/>
Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host<br/>
In horrible destruction laid thus low,<br/>
As far as Gods and heavenly Essences<br/>
Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains<br/>
Invincible, and vigour soon returns,<br/>
Though all our glory extinct, and happy state<br/>
Here swallowed up in endless misery.<br/>
But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now<br/>
Of force believe almighty, since no less<br/>
Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours)<br/>
Have left us this our spirit and strength entire,<br/>
Strongly to suffer and support our pains,<br/>
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,<br/>
Or do him mightier service as his thralls<br/>
By right of war, whate'er his business be,<br/>
Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire,<br/>
Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep?<br/>
What can it the avail though yet we feel<br/>
Strength undiminished, or eternal being<br/>
To undergo eternal punishment?"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-Fiend replied:&mdash;<br/>
"Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable,<br/>
Doing or suffering: but of this be sure&mdash;<br/>
To do aught good never will be our task,<br/>
But ever to do ill our sole delight,<br/>
As being the contrary to his high will<br/>
Whom we resist. If then his providence<br/>
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,<br/>
Our labour must be to pervert that end,<br/>
And out of good still to find means of evil;<br/>
Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps<br/>
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb<br/>
His inmost counsels from their destined aim.<br/>
But see! the angry Victor hath recalled<br/>
His ministers of vengeance and pursuit<br/>
Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail,<br/>
Shot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid<br/>
The fiery surge that from the precipice<br/>
Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder,<br/>
Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage,<br/>
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now<br/>
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.<br/>
Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn<br/>
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.<br/>
Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild,<br/>
The seat of desolation, void of light,<br/>
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames<br/>
Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend<br/>
From off the tossing of these fiery waves;<br/>
There rest, if any rest can harbour there;<br/>
And, re-assembling our afflicted powers,<br/>
Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br/>
Our enemy, our own loss how repair,<br/>
How overcome this dire calamity,<br/>
What reinforcement we may gain from hope,<br/>
If not, what resolution from despair."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate,<br/>
With head uplift above the wave, and eyes<br/>
That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides<br/>
Prone on the flood, extended long and large,<br/>
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge<br/>
As whom the fables name of monstrous size,<br/>
Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove,<br/>
Briareos or Typhon, whom the den<br/>
By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast<br/>
Leviathan, which God of all his works<br/>
Created hugest that swim th' ocean-stream.<br/>
Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam,<br/>
The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,<br/>
Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,<br/>
With fixed anchor in his scaly rind,<br/>
Moors by his side under the lee, while night<br/>
Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.<br/>
So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay,<br/>
Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence<br/>
Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will<br/>
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven<br/>
Left him at large to his own dark designs,<br/>
That with reiterated crimes he might<br/>
Heap on himself damnation, while he sought<br/>
Evil to others, and enraged might see<br/>
How all his malice served but to bring forth<br/>
Infinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn<br/>
On Man by him seduced, but on himself<br/>
Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool<br/>
His mighty stature; on each hand the flames<br/>
Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and rolled<br/>
In billows, leave i' th' midst a horrid vale.<br/>
Then with expanded wings he steers his flight<br/>
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky air,<br/>
That felt unusual weight; till on dry land<br/>
He lights&mdash;if it were land that ever burned<br/>
With solid, as the lake with liquid fire,<br/>
And such appeared in hue as when the force<br/>
Of subterranean wind transports a hill<br/>
Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side<br/>
Of thundering Etna, whose combustible<br/>
And fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire,<br/>
Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds,<br/>
And leave a singed bottom all involved<br/>
With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole<br/>
Of unblest feet. Him followed his next mate;<br/>
Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood<br/>
As gods, and by their own recovered strength,<br/>
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,"<br/>
Said then the lost Archangel, "this the seat<br/>
That we must change for Heaven?&mdash;this mournful gloom<br/>
For that celestial light? Be it so, since he<br/>
Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid<br/>
What shall be right: farthest from him is best<br/>
Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme<br/>
Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields,<br/>
Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,<br/>
Infernal world! and thou, profoundest Hell,<br/>
Receive thy new possessor&mdash;one who brings<br/>
A mind not to be changed by place or time.<br/>
The mind is its own place, and in itself<br/>
Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.<br/>
What matter where, if I be still the same,<br/>
And what I should be, all but less than he<br/>
Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least<br/>
We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built<br/>
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:<br/>
Here we may reign secure; and, in my choice,<br/>
To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:<br/>
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.<br/>
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,<br/>
Th' associates and co-partners of our loss,<br/>
Lie thus astonished on th' oblivious pool,<br/>
And call them not to share with us their part<br/>
In this unhappy mansion, or once more<br/>
With rallied arms to try what may be yet<br/>
Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell?"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub<br/>
Thus answered:&mdash;"Leader of those armies bright<br/>
Which, but th' Omnipotent, none could have foiled!<br/>
If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge<br/>
Of hope in fears and dangers&mdash;heard so oft<br/>
In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge<br/>
Of battle, when it raged, in all assaults<br/>
Their surest signal&mdash;they will soon resume<br/>
New courage and revive, though now they lie<br/>
Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire,<br/>
As we erewhile, astounded and amazed;<br/>
No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scarce had ceased when the superior Fiend<br/>
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield,<br/>
Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,<br/>
Behind him cast. The broad circumference<br/>
Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb<br/>
Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views<br/>
At evening, from the top of Fesole,<br/>
Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,<br/>
Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.<br/>
His spear&mdash;to equal which the tallest pine<br/>
Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast<br/>
Of some great ammiral, were but a wand&mdash;<br/>
He walked with, to support uneasy steps<br/>
Over the burning marl, not like those steps<br/>
On Heaven's azure; and the torrid clime<br/>
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire.<br/>
Nathless he so endured, till on the beach<br/>
Of that inflamed sea he stood, and called<br/>
His legions&mdash;Angel Forms, who lay entranced<br/>
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks<br/>
In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades<br/>
High over-arched embower; or scattered sedge<br/>
Afloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed<br/>
Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew<br/>
Busiris and his Memphian chivalry,<br/>
While with perfidious hatred they pursued<br/>
The sojourners of Goshen, who beheld<br/>
From the safe shore their floating carcases<br/>
And broken chariot-wheels. So thick bestrown,<br/>
Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flood,<br/>
Under amazement of their hideous change.<br/>
He called so loud that all the hollow deep<br/>
Of Hell resounded:&mdash;"Princes, Potentates,<br/>
Warriors, the Flower of Heaven&mdash;once yours; now lost,<br/>
If such astonishment as this can seize<br/>
Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place<br/>
After the toil of battle to repose<br/>
Your wearied virtue, for the ease you find<br/>
To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven?<br/>
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br/>
To adore the Conqueror, who now beholds<br/>
Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood<br/>
With scattered arms and ensigns, till anon<br/>
His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern<br/>
Th' advantage, and, descending, tread us down<br/>
Thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts<br/>
Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?<br/>
Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung<br/>
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch<br/>
On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,<br/>
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br/>
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight<br/>
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br/>
Yet to their General's voice they soon obeyed<br/>
Innumerable. As when the potent rod<br/>
Of Amram's son, in Egypt's evil day,<br/>
Waved round the coast, up-called a pitchy cloud<br/>
Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind,<br/>
That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung<br/>
Like Night, and darkened all the land of Nile;<br/>
So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br/>
Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell,<br/>
'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires;<br/>
Till, as a signal given, th' uplifted spear<br/>
Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br/>
Their course, in even balance down they light<br/>
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the plain:<br/>
A multitude like which the populous North<br/>
Poured never from her frozen loins to pass<br/>
Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sons<br/>
Came like a deluge on the South, and spread<br/>
Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands.<br/>
Forthwith, form every squadron and each band,<br/>
The heads and leaders thither haste where stood<br/>
Their great Commander&mdash;godlike Shapes, and Forms<br/>
Excelling human; princely Dignities;<br/>
And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones,<br/>
Though on their names in Heavenly records now<br/>
Be no memorial, blotted out and rased<br/>
By their rebellion from the Books of Life.<br/>
Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve<br/>
Got them new names, till, wandering o'er the earth,<br/>
Through God's high sufferance for the trial of man,<br/>
By falsities and lies the greatest part<br/>
Of mankind they corrupted to forsake<br/>
God their Creator, and th' invisible<br/>
Glory of him that made them to transform<br/>
Oft to the image of a brute, adorned<br/>
With gay religions full of pomp and gold,<br/>
And devils to adore for deities:<br/>
Then were they known to men by various names,<br/>
And various idols through the heathen world.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, Muse, their names then known, who first, who last,<br/>
Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch,<br/>
At their great Emperorr's call, as next in worth<br/>
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br/>
While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief were those who, from the pit of Hell<br/>
Roaming to seek their prey on Earth, durst fix<br/>
Their seats, long after, next the seat of God,<br/>
Their altars by his altar, gods adored<br/>
Among the nations round, and durst abide<br/>
Jehovah thundering out of Sion, throned<br/>
Between the Cherubim; yea, often placed<br/>
Within his sanctuary itself their shrines,<br/>
Abominations; and with cursed things<br/>
His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned,<br/>
And with their darkness durst affront his light.<br/>
First, Moloch, horrid king, besmeared with blood<br/>
Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears;<br/>
Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud,<br/>
Their children's cries unheard that passed through fire<br/>
To his grim idol. Him the Ammonite<br/>
Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain,<br/>
In Argob and in Basan, to the stream<br/>
Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such<br/>
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br/>
Of Solomon he led by fraud to build<br/>
His temple right against the temple of God<br/>
On that opprobrious hill, and made his grove<br/>
The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence<br/>
And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell.<br/>
Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moab's sons,<br/>
From Aroar to Nebo and the wild<br/>
Of southmost Abarim; in Hesebon<br/>
And Horonaim, Seon's real, beyond<br/>
The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines,<br/>
And Eleale to th' Asphaltic Pool:<br/>
Peor his other name, when he enticed<br/>
Israel in Sittim, on their march from Nile,<br/>
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br/>
Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged<br/>
Even to that hill of scandal, by the grove<br/>
Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate,<br/>
Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.<br/>
With these came they who, from the bordering flood<br/>
Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts<br/>
Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names<br/>
Of Baalim and Ashtaroth&mdash;those male,<br/>
These feminine. For Spirits, when they please,<br/>
Can either sex assume, or both; so soft<br/>
And uncompounded is their essence pure,<br/>
Not tried or manacled with joint or limb,<br/>
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br/>
Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose,<br/>
Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure,<br/>
Can execute their airy purposes,<br/>
And works of love or enmity fulfil.<br/>
For those the race of Israel oft forsook<br/>
Their Living Strength, and unfrequented left<br/>
His righteous altar, bowing lowly down<br/>
To bestial gods; for which their heads as low<br/>
Bowed down in battle, sunk before the spear<br/>
Of despicable foes. With these in troop<br/>
Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians called<br/>
Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns;<br/>
To whose bright image nightly by the moon<br/>
Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs;<br/>
In Sion also not unsung, where stood<br/>
Her temple on th' offensive mountain, built<br/>
By that uxorious king whose heart, though large,<br/>
Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell<br/>
To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,<br/>
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured<br/>
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate<br/>
In amorous ditties all a summer's day,<br/>
While smooth Adonis from his native rock<br/>
Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood<br/>
Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale<br/>
Infected Sion's daughters with like heat,<br/>
Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch<br/>
Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led,<br/>
His eye surveyed the dark idolatries<br/>
Of alienated Judah. Next came one<br/>
Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark<br/>
Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off,<br/>
In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge,<br/>
Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers:<br/>
Dagon his name, sea-monster, upward man<br/>
And downward fish; yet had his temple high<br/>
Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast<br/>
Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,<br/>
And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.<br/>
Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat<br/>
Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks<br/>
Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.<br/>
He also against the house of God was bold:<br/>
A leper once he lost, and gained a king&mdash;<br/>
Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew<br/>
God's altar to disparage and displace<br/>
For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn<br/>
His odious offerings, and adore the gods<br/>
Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared<br/>
A crew who, under names of old renown&mdash;<br/>
Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train&mdash;<br/>
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused<br/>
Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek<br/>
Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms<br/>
Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape<br/>
Th' infection, when their borrowed gold composed<br/>
The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king<br/>
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,<br/>
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox&mdash;<br/>
Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed<br/>
From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke<br/>
Both her first-born and all her bleating gods.<br/>
Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd<br/>
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br/>
Vice for itself. To him no temple stood<br/>
Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he<br/>
In temples and at altars, when the priest<br/>
Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled<br/>
With lust and violence the house of God?<br/>
In courts and palaces he also reigns,<br/>
And in luxurious cities, where the noise<br/>
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,<br/>
And injury and outrage; and, when night<br/>
Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons<br/>
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.<br/>
Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night<br/>
In Gibeah, when the hospitable door<br/>
Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the prime in order and in might:<br/>
The rest were long to tell; though far renowned<br/>
Th' Ionian gods&mdash;of Javan's issue held<br/>
Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth,<br/>
Their boasted parents;&mdash;Titan, Heaven's first-born,<br/>
With his enormous brood, and birthright seized<br/>
By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove,<br/>
His own and Rhea's son, like measure found;<br/>
So Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete<br/>
And Ida known, thence on the snowy top<br/>
Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air,<br/>
Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff,<br/>
Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds<br/>
Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old<br/>
Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian fields,<br/>
And o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br/>
Downcast and damp; yet such wherein appeared<br/>
Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief<br/>
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br/>
In loss itself; which on his countenance cast<br/>
Like doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride<br/>
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br/>
Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised<br/>
Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears.<br/>
Then straight commands that, at the warlike sound<br/>
Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared<br/>
His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed<br/>
Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall:<br/>
Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled<br/>
Th' imperial ensign; which, full high advanced,<br/>
Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,<br/>
With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed,<br/>
Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while<br/>
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds:<br/>
At which the universal host up-sent<br/>
A shout that tore Hell's concave, and beyond<br/>
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.<br/>
All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br/>
Ten thousand banners rise into the air,<br/>
With orient colours waving: with them rose<br/>
A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms<br/>
Appeared, and serried shields in thick array<br/>
Of depth immeasurable. Anon they move<br/>
In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood<br/>
Of flutes and soft recorders&mdash;such as raised<br/>
To height of noblest temper heroes old<br/>
Arming to battle, and instead of rage<br/>
Deliberate valour breathed, firm, and unmoved<br/>
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat;<br/>
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br/>
With solemn touches troubled thoughts, and chase<br/>
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br/>
From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they,<br/>
Breathing united force with fixed thought,<br/>
Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed<br/>
Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil. And now<br/>
Advanced in view they stand&mdash;a horrid front<br/>
Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise<br/>
Of warriors old, with ordered spear and shield,<br/>
Awaiting what command their mighty Chief<br/>
Had to impose. He through the armed files<br/>
Darts his experienced eye, and soon traverse<br/>
The whole battalion views&mdash;their order due,<br/>
Their visages and stature as of gods;<br/>
Their number last he sums. And now his heart<br/>
Distends with pride, and, hardening in his strength,<br/>
Glories: for never, since created Man,<br/>
Met such embodied force as, named with these,<br/>
Could merit more than that small infantry<br/>
Warred on by cranes&mdash;though all the giant brood<br/>
Of Phlegra with th' heroic race were joined<br/>
That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side<br/>
Mixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds<br/>
In fable or romance of Uther's son,<br/>
Begirt with British and Armoric knights;<br/>
And all who since, baptized or infidel,<br/>
Jousted in Aspramont, or Montalban,<br/>
Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond,<br/>
Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore<br/>
When Charlemain with all his peerage fell<br/>
By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond<br/>
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed<br/>
Their dread Commander. He, above the rest<br/>
In shape and gesture proudly eminent,<br/>
Stood like a tower. His form had yet not lost<br/>
All her original brightness, nor appeared<br/>
Less than Archangel ruined, and th' excess<br/>
Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen<br/>
Looks through the horizontal misty air<br/>
Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the moon,<br/>
In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds<br/>
On half the nations, and with fear of change<br/>
Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shone<br/>
Above them all th' Archangel: but his face<br/>
Deep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care<br/>
Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows<br/>
Of dauntless courage, and considerate pride<br/>
Waiting revenge. Cruel his eye, but cast<br/>
Signs of remorse and passion, to behold<br/>
The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br/>
(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned<br/>
For ever now to have their lot in pain&mdash;<br/>
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced<br/>
Of Heaven, and from eternal splendours flung<br/>
For his revolt&mdash;yet faithful how they stood,<br/>
Their glory withered; as, when heaven's fire<br/>
Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines,<br/>
With singed top their stately growth, though bare,<br/>
Stands on the blasted heath. He now prepared<br/>
To speak; whereat their doubled ranks they bend<br/>
From wing to wing, and half enclose him round<br/>
With all his peers: attention held them mute.<br/>
Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn,<br/>
Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br/>
Words interwove with sighs found out their way:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O myriads of immortal Spirits! O Powers<br/>
Matchless, but with th' Almighty!&mdash;and that strife<br/>
Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,<br/>
As this place testifies, and this dire change,<br/>
Hateful to utter. But what power of mind,<br/>
Forseeing or presaging, from the depth<br/>
Of knowledge past or present, could have feared<br/>
How such united force of gods, how such<br/>
As stood like these, could ever know repulse?<br/>
For who can yet believe, though after loss,<br/>
That all these puissant legions, whose exile<br/>
Hath emptied Heaven, shall fail to re-ascend,<br/>
Self-raised, and repossess their native seat?<br/>
For me, be witness all the host of Heaven,<br/>
If counsels different, or danger shunned<br/>
By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns<br/>
Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure<br/>
Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute,<br/>
Consent or custom, and his regal state<br/>
Put forth at full, but still his strength concealed&mdash;<br/>
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.<br/>
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own,<br/>
So as not either to provoke, or dread<br/>
New war provoked: our better part remains<br/>
To work in close design, by fraud or guile,<br/>
What force effected not; that he no less<br/>
At length from us may find, who overcomes<br/>
By force hath overcome but half his foe.<br/>
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife<br/>
There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long<br/>
Intended to create, and therein plant<br/>
A generation whom his choice regard<br/>
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven.<br/>
Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps<br/>
Our first eruption&mdash;thither, or elsewhere;<br/>
For this infernal pit shall never hold<br/>
Celestial Spirits in bondage, nor th' Abyss<br/>
Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts<br/>
Full counsel must mature. Peace is despaired;<br/>
For who can think submission? War, then, war<br/>
Open or understood, must be resolved."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spake; and, to confirm his words, outflew<br/>
Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs<br/>
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze<br/>
Far round illumined Hell. Highly they raged<br/>
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms<br/>
Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war,<br/>
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood a hill not far, whose grisly top<br/>
Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire<br/>
Shone with a glossy scurf&mdash;undoubted sign<br/>
That in his womb was hid metallic ore,<br/>
The work of sulphur. Thither, winged with speed,<br/>
A numerous brigade hastened: as when bands<br/>
Of pioneers, with spade and pickaxe armed,<br/>
Forerun the royal camp, to trench a field,<br/>
Or cast a rampart. Mammon led them on&mdash;<br/>
Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell<br/>
From Heaven; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts<br/>
Were always downward bent, admiring more<br/>
The riches of heaven's pavement, trodden gold,<br/>
Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed<br/>
In vision beatific. By him first<br/>
Men also, and by his suggestion taught,<br/>
Ransacked the centre, and with impious hands<br/>
Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth<br/>
For treasures better hid. Soon had his crew<br/>
Opened into the hill a spacious wound,<br/>
And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire<br/>
That riches grow in Hell; that soil may best<br/>
Deserve the precious bane. And here let those<br/>
Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell<br/>
Of Babel, and the works of Memphian kings,<br/>
Learn how their greatest monuments of fame<br/>
And strength, and art, are easily outdone<br/>
By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour<br/>
What in an age they, with incessant toil<br/>
And hands innumerable, scarce perform.<br/>
Nigh on the plain, in many cells prepared,<br/>
That underneath had veins of liquid fire<br/>
Sluiced from the lake, a second multitude<br/>
With wondrous art founded the massy ore,<br/>
Severing each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross.<br/>
A third as soon had formed within the ground<br/>
A various mould, and from the boiling cells<br/>
By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook;<br/>
As in an organ, from one blast of wind,<br/>
To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes.<br/>
Anon out of the earth a fabric huge<br/>
Rose like an exhalation, with the sound<br/>
Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet&mdash;<br/>
Built like a temple, where pilasters round<br/>
Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid<br/>
With golden architrave; nor did there want<br/>
Cornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven;<br/>
The roof was fretted gold. Not Babylon<br/>
Nor great Alcairo such magnificence<br/>
Equalled in all their glories, to enshrine<br/>
Belus or Serapis their gods, or seat<br/>
Their kings, when Egypt with Assyria strove<br/>
In wealth and luxury. Th' ascending pile<br/>
Stood fixed her stately height, and straight the doors,<br/>
Opening their brazen folds, discover, wide<br/>
Within, her ample spaces o'er the smooth<br/>
And level pavement: from the arched roof,<br/>
Pendent by subtle magic, many a row<br/>
Of starry lamps and blazing cressets, fed<br/>
With naptha and asphaltus, yielded light<br/>
As from a sky. The hasty multitude<br/>
Admiring entered; and the work some praise,<br/>
And some the architect. His hand was known<br/>
In Heaven by many a towered structure high,<br/>
Where sceptred Angels held their residence,<br/>
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King<br/>
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,<br/>
Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright.<br/>
Nor was his name unheard or unadored<br/>
In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land<br/>
Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell<br/>
From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove<br/>
Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn<br/>
To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,<br/>
A summer's day, and with the setting sun<br/>
Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star,<br/>
On Lemnos, th' Aegaean isle. Thus they relate,<br/>
Erring; for he with this rebellious rout<br/>
Fell long before; nor aught availed him now<br/>
To have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape<br/>
By all his engines, but was headlong sent,<br/>
With his industrious crew, to build in Hell.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the winged Heralds, by command<br/>
Of sovereign power, with awful ceremony<br/>
And trumpet's sound, throughout the host proclaim<br/>
A solemn council forthwith to be held<br/>
At Pandemonium, the high capital<br/>
Of Satan and his peers. Their summons called<br/>
From every band and squared regiment<br/>
By place or choice the worthiest: they anon<br/>
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came<br/>
Attended. All access was thronged; the gates<br/>
And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall<br/>
(Though like a covered field, where champions bold<br/>
Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan's chair<br/>
Defied the best of Paynim chivalry<br/>
To mortal combat, or career with lance),<br/>
Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,<br/>
Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees<br/>
In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides.<br/>
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive<br/>
In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers<br/>
Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,<br/>
The suburb of their straw-built citadel,<br/>
New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer<br/>
Their state-affairs: so thick the airy crowd<br/>
Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given,<br/>
Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed<br/>
In bigness to surpass Earth's giant sons,<br/>
Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room<br/>
Throng numberless&mdash;like that pygmean race<br/>
Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves,<br/>
Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side<br/>
Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,<br/>
Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon<br/>
Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth<br/>
Wheels her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance<br/>
Intent, with jocund music charm his ear;<br/>
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.<br/>
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms<br/>
Reduced their shapes immense, and were at large,<br/>
Though without number still, amidst the hall<br/>
Of that infernal court. But far within,<br/>
And in their own dimensions like themselves,<br/>
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim<br/>
In close recess and secret conclave sat,<br/>
A thousand demi-gods on golden seats,<br/>
Frequent and full. After short silence then,<br/>
And summons read, the great consult began.

<h1>Paradise Lost</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<h2>Book VII</h2>
<p>
Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name<br/>
If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine<br/>
Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,<br/>
Above the flight of Pegasean wing!<br/>
The meaning, not the name, I call: for thou<br/>
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top<br/>
Of old Olympus dwellest; but, heavenly-born,<br/>
Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed,<br/>
Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse,<br/>
Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play<br/>
In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased<br/>
With thy celestial song. Up led by thee<br/>
Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,<br/>
An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air,<br/>
Thy tempering: with like safety guided down<br/>
Return me to my native element:<br/>
Lest from this flying steed unreined, (as once<br/>
Bellerophon, though from a lower clime,)<br/>
Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,<br/>
Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn.<br/>
Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound<br/>
Within the visible diurnal sphere;<br/>
Standing on earth, not rapt above the pole,<br/>
More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged<br/>
To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,<br/>
On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues;<br/>
In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,<br/>
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou<br/>
Visitest my slumbers nightly, or when morn<br/>
Purples the east: still govern thou my song,<br/>
Urania, and fit audience find, though few.<br/>
But drive far off the barbarous dissonance<br/>
Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race<br/>
Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard<br/>
In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears<br/>
To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned<br/>
Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend<br/>
Her son. So fail not thou, who thee implores:<br/>
For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.<br/>
Say, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael,<br/>
The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned<br/>
Adam, by dire example, to beware<br/>
Apostasy, by what befel in Heaven<br/>
To those apostates; lest the like befall<br/>
In Paradise to Adam or his race,<br/>
Charged not to touch the interdicted tree,<br/>
If they transgress, and slight that sole command,<br/>
So easily obeyed amid the choice<br/>
Of all tastes else to please their appetite,<br/>
Though wandering. He, with his consorted Eve,<br/>
The story heard attentive, and was filled<br/>
With admiration and deep muse, to hear<br/>
Of things so high and strange; things, to their thought<br/>
So unimaginable, as hate in Heaven,<br/>
And war so near the peace of God in bliss,<br/>
With such confusion: but the evil, soon<br/>
Driven back, redounded as a flood on those<br/>
From whom it sprung; impossible to mix<br/>
With blessedness. Whence Adam soon repealed<br/>
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now<br/>
Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know<br/>
What nearer might concern him, how this world<br/>
Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began;<br/>
When, and whereof created; for what cause;<br/>
What within Eden, or without, was done<br/>
Before his memory; as one whose drouth<br/>
Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream,<br/>
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,<br/>
Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest.<br/>
Great things, and full of wonder in our ears,<br/>
Far differing from this world, thou hast revealed,<br/>
Divine interpreter! by favour sent<br/>
Down from the empyrean, to forewarn<br/>
Us timely of what might else have been our loss,<br/>
Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach;<br/>
For which to the infinitely Good we owe<br/>
Immortal thanks, and his admonishment<br/>
Receive, with solemn purpose to observe<br/>
Immutably his sovran will, the end<br/>
Of what we are. But since thou hast vouchsafed<br/>
Gently, for our instruction, to impart<br/>
Things above earthly thought, which yet concerned<br/>
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed,<br/>
Deign to descend now lower, and relate<br/>
What may no less perhaps avail us known,<br/>
How first began this Heaven which we behold<br/>
Distant so high, with moving fires adorned<br/>
Innumerable; and this which yields or fills<br/>
All space, the ambient air wide interfused<br/>
Embracing round this floried Earth; what cause<br/>
Moved the Creator, in his holy rest<br/>
Through all eternity, so late to build<br/>
In Chaos; and the work begun, how soon<br/>
Absolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold<br/>
What we, not to explore the secrets ask<br/>
Of his eternal empire, but the more<br/>
To magnify his works, the more we know.<br/>
And the great light of day yet wants to run<br/>
Much of his race though steep; suspense in Heaven,<br/>
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears,<br/>
And longer will delay to hear thee tell<br/>
His generation, and the rising birth<br/>
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:<br/>
Or if the star of evening and the moon<br/>
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring,<br/>
Silence; and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch;<br/>
Or we can bid his absence, till thy song<br/>
End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine.<br/>
Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought:<br/>
And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.<br/>
This also thy request, with caution asked,<br/>
Obtain; though to recount almighty works<br/>
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,<br/>
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?<br/>
Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve<br/>
To glorify the Maker, and infer<br/>
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld<br/>
Thy hearing; such commission from above<br/>
I have received, to answer thy desire<br/>
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond, abstain<br/>
To ask; nor let thine own inventions hope<br/>
Things not revealed, which the invisible King,<br/>
Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in night;<br/>
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:<br/>
Enough is left besides to search and know.<br/>
But knowledge is as food, and needs no less<br/>
Her temperance over appetite, to know<br/>
In measure what the mind may well contain;<br/>
Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns<br/>
Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind.<br/>
Know then, that, after Lucifer from Heaven<br/>
(So call him, brighter once amidst the host<br/>
Of Angels, than that star the stars among,)<br/>
Fell with his flaming legions through the deep<br/>
Into his place, and the great Son returned<br/>
Victorious with his Saints, the Omnipotent<br/>
Eternal Father from his throne beheld<br/>
Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.<br/>
At least our envious Foe hath failed, who thought<br/>
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid<br/>
This inaccessible high strength, the seat<br/>
Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed,<br/>
He trusted to have seised, and into fraud<br/>
Drew many, whom their place knows here no more:<br/>
Yet far the greater part have kept, I see,<br/>
Their station; Heaven, yet populous, retains<br/>
Number sufficient to possess her realms<br/>
Though wide, and this high temple to frequent<br/>
With ministeries due, and solemn rites:<br/>
But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm<br/>
Already done, to have dispeopled Heaven,<br/>
My damage fondly deemed, I can repair<br/>
That detriment, if such it be to lose<br/>
Self-lost; and in a moment will create<br/>
Another world, out of one man a race<br/>
Of men innumerable, there to dwell,<br/>
Not here; till, by degrees of merit raised,<br/>
They open to themselves at length the way<br/>
Up hither, under long obedience tried;<br/>
And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth,<br/>
One kingdom, joy and union without end.<br/>
Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven;<br/>
And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee<br/>
This I perform; speak thou, and be it done!<br/>
My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee<br/>
I send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep<br/>
Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth;<br/>
Boundless the Deep, because I Am who fill<br/>
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.<br/>
Though I, uncircumscribed myself, retire,<br/>
And put not forth my goodness, which is free<br/>
To act or not, Necessity and Chance<br/>
Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.<br/>
So spake the Almighty, and to what he spake<br/>
His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.<br/>
Immediate are the acts of God, more swift<br/>
Than time or motion, but to human ears<br/>
Cannot without process of speech be told,<br/>
So told as earthly notion can receive.<br/>
Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven,<br/>
When such was heard declared the Almighty's will;<br/>
Glory they sung to the Most High, good will<br/>
To future men, and in their dwellings peace;<br/>
Glory to Him, whose just avenging ire<br/>
Had driven out the ungodly from his sight<br/>
And the habitations of the just; to Him<br/>
Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained<br/>
Good out of evil to create; instead<br/>
Of Spirits malign, a better race to bring<br/>
Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse<br/>
His good to worlds and ages infinite.<br/>
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son<br/>
On his great expedition now appeared,<br/>
Girt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned<br/>
Of Majesty Divine; sapience and love<br/>
Immense, and all his Father in him shone.<br/>
About his chariot numberless were poured<br/>
Cherub, and Seraph, Potentates, and Thrones,<br/>
And Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged<br/>
From the armoury of God; where stand of old<br/>
Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged<br/>
Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,<br/>
Celestial equipage; and now came forth<br/>
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,<br/>
Attendant on their Lord: Heaven opened wide<br/>
Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound<br/>
On golden hinges moving, to let forth<br/>
The King of Glory, in his powerful Word<br/>
And Spirit, coming to create new worlds.<br/>
On heavenly ground they stood; and from the shore<br/>
They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss<br/>
Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,<br/>
Up from the bottom turned by furious winds<br/>
And surging waves, as mountains, to assault<br/>
Heaven's highth, and with the center mix the pole.<br/>
Silence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace,<br/>
Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end!<br/>
Nor staid; but, on the wings of Cherubim<br/>
Uplifted, in paternal glory rode<br/>
Far into Chaos, and the world unborn;<br/>
For Chaos heard his voice: Him all his train<br/>
Followed in bright procession, to behold<br/>
Creation, and the wonders of his might.<br/>
Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand<br/>
He took the golden compasses, prepared<br/>
In God's eternal store, to circumscribe<br/>
This universe, and all created things:<br/>
One foot he centered, and the other turned<br/>
Round through the vast profundity obscure;<br/>
And said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds,<br/>
This be thy just circumference, O World!<br/>
Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,<br/>
Matter unformed and void: Darkness profound<br/>
Covered the abyss: but on the watery calm<br/>
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,<br/>
And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth<br/>
Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged<br/>
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs,<br/>
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed<br/>
Like things to like; the rest to several place<br/>
Disparted, and between spun out the air;<br/>
And Earth self-balanced on her center hung.<br/>
Let there be light, said God; and forthwith Light<br/>
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,<br/>
Sprung from the deep; and from her native east<br/>
To journey through the aery gloom began,<br/>
Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun<br/>
Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle<br/>
Sojourned the while. God saw the light was good;<br/>
And light from darkness by the hemisphere<br/>
Divided: light the Day, and darkness Night,<br/>
He named. Thus was the first day even and morn:<br/>
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung<br/>
By the celestial quires, when orient light<br/>
Exhaling first from darkness they beheld;<br/>
Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout<br/>
The hollow universal orb they filled,<br/>
And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised<br/>
God and his works; Creator him they sung,<br/>
Both when first evening was, and when first morn.<br/>
Again, God said, Let there be firmament<br/>
Amid the waters, and let it divide<br/>
The waters from the waters; and God made<br/>
The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,<br/>
Transparent, elemental air, diffused<br/>
In circuit to the uttermost convex<br/>
Of this great round; partition firm and sure,<br/>
The waters underneath from those above<br/>
Dividing: for as earth, so he the world<br/>
Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide<br/>
Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule<br/>
Of Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes<br/>
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:<br/>
And Heaven he named the Firmament: So even<br/>
And morning chorus sung the second day.<br/>
The Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet<br/>
Of waters, embryon immature involved,<br/>
Appeared not: over all the face of Earth<br/>
Main ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm<br/>
Prolifick humour softening all her globe,<br/>
Fermented the great mother to conceive,<br/>
Satiate with genial moisture; when God said,<br/>
Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven<br/>
Into one place, and let dry land appear.<br/>
Immediately the mountains huge appear<br/>
Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave<br/>
Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky:<br/>
So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low<br/>
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,<br/>
Capacious bed of waters: Thither they<br/>
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprolled,<br/>
As drops on dust conglobing from the dry:<br/>
Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct,<br/>
For haste; such flight the great command impressed<br/>
On the swift floods: As armies at the call<br/>
Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard)<br/>
Troop to their standard; so the watery throng,<br/>
Wave rolling after wave, where way they found,<br/>
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain,<br/>
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill;<br/>
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide<br/>
With serpent errour wandering, found their way,<br/>
And on the washy oose deep channels wore;<br/>
Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry,<br/>
All but within those banks, where rivers now<br/>
Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.<br/>
The dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle<br/>
Of congregated waters, he called Seas:<br/>
And saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth<br/>
Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed,<br/>
And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind,<br/>
Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth.<br/>
He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then<br/>
Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned,<br/>
Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad<br/>
Her universal face with pleasant green;<br/>
Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered<br/>
Opening their various colours, and made gay<br/>
Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown,<br/>
Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept<br/>
The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed<br/>
Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub,<br/>
And bush with frizzled hair implicit: Last<br/>
Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread<br/>
Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed<br/>
Their blossoms: With high woods the hills were crowned;<br/>
With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side;<br/>
With borders long the rivers: that Earth now<br/>
Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell,<br/>
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt<br/>
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained<br/>
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground<br/>
None was; but from the Earth a dewy mist<br/>
Went up, and watered all the ground, and each<br/>
Plant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth,<br/>
God made, and every herb, before it grew<br/>
On the green stem: God saw that it was good:<br/>
So even and morn recorded the third day.<br/>
Again the Almighty spake, Let there be lights<br/>
High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide<br/>
The day from night; and let them be for signs,<br/>
For seasons, and for days, and circling years;<br/>
And let them be for lights, as I ordain<br/>
Their office in the firmament of Heaven,<br/>
To give light on the Earth; and it was so.<br/>
And God made two great lights, great for their use<br/>
To Man, the greater to have rule by day,<br/>
The less by night, altern; and made the stars,<br/>
And set them in the firmament of Heaven<br/>
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day<br/>
In their vicissitude, and rule the night,<br/>
And light from darkness to divide. God saw,<br/>
Surveying his great work, that it was good:<br/>
For of celestial bodies first the sun<br/>
A mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first,<br/>
Though of ethereal mould: then formed the moon<br/>
Globose, and every magnitude of stars,<br/>
And sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field:<br/>
Of light by far the greater part he took,<br/>
Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed<br/>
In the sun's orb, made porous to receive<br/>
And drink the liquid light; firm to retain<br/>
Her gathered beams, great palace now of light.<br/>
Hither, as to their fountain, other stars<br/>
Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,<br/>
And hence the morning-planet gilds her horns;<br/>
By tincture or reflection they augment<br/>
Their small peculiar, though from human sight<br/>
So far remote, with diminution seen,<br/>
First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,<br/>
Regent of day, and all the horizon round<br/>
Invested with bright rays, jocund to run<br/>
His longitude through Heaven's high road; the gray<br/>
Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced,<br/>
Shedding sweet influence: Less bright the moon,<br/>
But opposite in levelled west was set,<br/>
His mirrour, with full face borrowing her light<br/>
From him; for other light she needed none<br/>
In that aspect, and still that distance keeps<br/>
Till night; then in the east her turn she shines,<br/>
Revolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign<br/>
With thousand lesser lights dividual holds,<br/>
With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared<br/>
Spangling the hemisphere: Then first adorned<br/>
With their bright luminaries that set and rose,<br/>
Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day.<br/>
And God said, Let the waters generate<br/>
Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul:<br/>
And let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings<br/>
Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven.<br/>
And God created the great whales, and each<br/>
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously<br/>
The waters generated by their kinds;<br/>
And every bird of wing after his kind;<br/>
And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying.<br/>
Be fruitful, multiply, and in the seas,<br/>
And lakes, and running streams, the waters fill;<br/>
And let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth.<br/>
Forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay,<br/>
With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals<br/>
Of fish that with their fins, and shining scales,<br/>
Glide under the green wave, in sculls that oft<br/>
Bank the mid sea: part single, or with mate,<br/>
Graze the sea-weed their pasture, and through groves<br/>
Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance,<br/>
Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold;<br/>
Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend<br/>
Moist nutriment; or under rocks their food<br/>
In jointed armour watch: on smooth the seal<br/>
And bended dolphins play: part huge of bulk<br/>
Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait,<br/>
Tempest the ocean: there leviathan,<br/>
Hugest of living creatures, on the deep<br/>
Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims,<br/>
And seems a moving land; and at his gills<br/>
Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea.<br/>
Mean while the tepid caves, and fens, and shores,<br/>
Their brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon<br/>
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed<br/>
Their callow young; but feathered soon and fledge<br/>
They summed their pens; and, soaring the air sublime,<br/>
With clang despised the ground, under a cloud<br/>
In prospect; there the eagle and the stork<br/>
On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build:<br/>
Part loosely wing the region, part more wise<br/>
In common, ranged in figure, wedge their way,<br/>
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth<br/>
Their aery caravan, high over seas<br/>
Flying, and over lands, with mutual wing<br/>
Easing their flight; so steers the prudent crane<br/>
Her annual voyage, borne on winds; the air<br/>
Floats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes:<br/>
From branch to branch the smaller birds with song<br/>
Solaced the woods, and spread their painted wings<br/>
Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale<br/>
Ceased warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays:<br/>
Others, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed<br/>
Their downy breast; the swan with arched neck,<br/>
Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows<br/>
Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit<br/>
The dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower<br/>
The mid aereal sky: Others on ground<br/>
Walked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds<br/>
The silent hours, and the other whose gay train<br/>
Adorns him, coloured with the florid hue<br/>
Of rainbows and starry eyes. The waters thus<br/>
With fish replenished, and the air with fowl,<br/>
Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day.<br/>
The sixth, and of creation last, arose<br/>
With evening harps and matin; when God said,<br/>
Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind,<br/>
Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth,<br/>
Each in their kind. The Earth obeyed, and straight<br/>
Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth<br/>
Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms,<br/>
Limbed and full grown: Out of the ground up rose,<br/>
As from his lair, the wild beast where he wons<br/>
In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den;<br/>
Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked:<br/>
The cattle in the fields and meadows green:<br/>
Those rare and solitary, these in flocks<br/>
Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung.<br/>
The grassy clods now calved; now half appeared<br/>
The tawny lion, pawing to get free<br/>
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds,<br/>
And rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce,<br/>
The libbard, and the tiger, as the mole<br/>
Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw<br/>
In hillocks: The swift stag from under ground<br/>
Bore up his branching head: Scarce from his mould<br/>
Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved<br/>
His vastness: Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose,<br/>
As plants: Ambiguous between sea and land<br/>
The river-horse, and scaly crocodile.<br/>
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,<br/>
Insect or worm: those waved their limber fans<br/>
For wings, and smallest lineaments exact<br/>
In all the liveries decked of summer's pride<br/>
With spots of gold and purple, azure and green:<br/>
These, as a line, their long dimension drew,<br/>
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all<br/>
Minims of nature; some of serpent-kind,<br/>
Wonderous in length and corpulence, involved<br/>
Their snaky folds, and added wings. First crept<br/>
The parsimonious emmet, provident<br/>
Of future; in small room large heart enclosed;<br/>
Pattern of just equality perhaps<br/>
Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes<br/>
Of commonalty: Swarming next appeared<br/>
The female bee, that feeds her husband drone<br/>
Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells<br/>
With honey stored: The rest are numberless,<br/>
And thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names,<br/>
Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown<br/>
The serpent, subtlest beast of all the field,<br/>
Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes<br/>
And hairy mane terrifick, though to thee<br/>
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.<br/>
Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled<br/>
Her motions, as the great first Mover's hand<br/>
First wheeled their course: Earth in her rich attire<br/>
Consummate lovely smiled; air, water, earth,<br/>
By fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked,<br/>
Frequent; and of the sixth day yet remained:<br/>
There wanted yet the master-work, the end<br/>
Of all yet done; a creature, who, not prone<br/>
And brute as other creatures, but endued<br/>
With sanctity of reason, might erect<br/>
His stature, and upright with front serene<br/>
Govern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence<br/>
Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,<br/>
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good<br/>
Descends, thither with heart, and voice, and eyes<br/>
Directed in devotion, to adore<br/>
And worship God Supreme, who made him chief<br/>
Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent<br/>
Eternal Father (for where is not he<br/>
Present?) thus to his Son audibly spake.<br/>
Let us make now Man in our image, Man<br/>
In our similitude, and let them rule<br/>
Over the fish and fowl of sea and air,<br/>
Beast of the field, and over all the Earth,<br/>
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.<br/>
This said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man,<br/>
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed<br/>
The breath of life; in his own image he<br/>
Created thee, in the image of God<br/>
Express; and thou becamest a living soul.<br/>
Male he created thee; but thy consort<br/>
Female, for race; then blessed mankind, and said,<br/>
Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth;<br/>
Subdue it, and throughout dominion hold<br/>
Over fish of the sea, and fowl of the air,<br/>
And every living thing that moves on the Earth.<br/>
Wherever thus created, for no place<br/>
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest,<br/>
He brought thee into this delicious grove,<br/>
This garden, planted with the trees of God,<br/>
Delectable both to behold and taste;<br/>
And freely all their pleasant fruit for food<br/>
Gave thee; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,<br/>
Variety without end; but of the tree,<br/>
Which, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil,<br/>
Thou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest;<br/>
Death is the penalty imposed; beware,<br/>
And govern well thy appetite; lest Sin<br/>
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.<br/>
Here finished he, and all that he had made<br/>
Viewed, and behold all was entirely good;<br/>
So even and morn accomplished the sixth day:<br/>
Yet not till the Creator from his work<br/>
Desisting, though unwearied, up returned,<br/>
Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode;<br/>
Thence to behold this new created world,<br/>
The addition of his empire, how it showed<br/>
In prospect from his throne, how good, how fair,<br/>
Answering his great idea. Up he rode<br/>
Followed with acclamation, and the sound<br/>
Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned<br/>
Angelick harmonies: The earth, the air<br/>
Resounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,)<br/>
The heavens and all the constellations rung,<br/>
The planets in their station listening stood,<br/>
While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.<br/>
Open, ye everlasting gates! they sung,<br/>
Open, ye Heavens! your living doors; let in<br/>
The great Creator from his work returned<br/>
Magnificent, his six days work, a World;<br/>
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign<br/>
To visit oft the dwellings of just men,<br/>
Delighted; and with frequent intercourse<br/>
Thither will send his winged messengers<br/>
On errands of supernal grace. So sung<br/>
The glorious train ascending: He through Heaven,<br/>
That opened wide her blazing portals, led<br/>
To God's eternal house direct the way;<br/>
A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold<br/>
And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear,<br/>
Seen in the galaxy, that milky way,<br/>
Which nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest<br/>
Powdered with stars. And now on Earth the seventh<br/>
Evening arose in Eden, for the sun<br/>
Was set, and twilight from the east came on,<br/>
Forerunning night; when at the holy mount<br/>
Of Heaven's high-seated top, the imperial throne<br/>
Of Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure,<br/>
The Filial Power arrived, and sat him down<br/>
With his great Father; for he also went<br/>
Invisible, yet staid, (such privilege<br/>
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained,<br/>
Author and End of all things; and, from work<br/>
Now resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day,<br/>
As resting on that day from all his work,<br/>
But not in silence holy kept: the harp<br/>
Had work and rested not; the solemn pipe,<br/>
And dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop,<br/>
All sounds on fret by string or golden wire,<br/>
Tempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice<br/>
Choral or unison: of incense clouds,<br/>
Fuming from golden censers, hid the mount.<br/>
Creation and the six days acts they sung:<br/>
Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite<br/>
Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue<br/>
Relate thee! Greater now in thy return<br/>
Than from the giant Angels: Thee that day<br/>
Thy thunders magnified; but to create<br/>
Is greater than created to destroy.<br/>
Who can impair thee, Mighty King, or bound<br/>
Thy empire! Easily the proud attempt<br/>
Of Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain,<br/>
Thou hast repelled; while impiously they thought<br/>
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw<br/>
The number of thy worshippers. Who seeks<br/>
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves<br/>
To manifest the more thy might: his evil<br/>
Thou usest, and from thence createst more good.<br/>
Witness this new-made world, another Heaven<br/>
From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view<br/>
On the clear hyaline, the glassy sea;<br/>
Of amplitude almost immense, with stars<br/>
Numerous, and every star perhaps a world<br/>
Of destined habitation; but thou knowest<br/>
Their seasons: among these the seat of Men,<br/>
Earth, with her nether ocean circumfused,<br/>
Their pleasant dwelling-place. Thrice happy Men,<br/>
And sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced!<br/>
Created in his image, there to dwell<br/>
And worship him; and in reward to rule<br/>
Over his works, on earth, in sea, or air,<br/>
And multiply a race of worshippers<br/>
Holy and just: Thrice happy, if they know<br/>
Their happiness, and persevere upright!<br/>
So sung they, and the empyrean rung<br/>
With halleluiahs: Thus was sabbath kept.<br/>
And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked<br/>
How first this world and face of things began,<br/>
And what before thy memory was done<br/>
From the beginning; that posterity,<br/>
Informed by thee, might know: If else thou seekest<br/>
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.

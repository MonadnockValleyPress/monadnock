<h1>Lycidas</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<p>
Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more<br/>
Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere,<br/>
I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude,<br/>
And with forc'd fingers rude<br/>
Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.<br/>
Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear<br/>
Compels me to disturb your season due;<br/>
For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,<br/>
Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer.<br/>
Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew<br/>
Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.<br/>
He must not float upon his wat'ry bier<br/>
Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,<br/>
Without the meed of some melodious tear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Begin then, Sisters of the sacred well<br/>
That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring;<br/>
Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string.<br/>
Hence with denial vain and coy excuse!<br/>
So may some gentle muse<br/>
With lucky words favour my destin'd urn,<br/>
And as he passes turn<br/>
And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud!<br/>
</p>
<p>
For we were nurs'd upon the self-same hill,<br/>
Fed the same flock, by fountain, shade, and rill;<br/>
Together both, ere the high lawns appear'd<br/>
Under the opening eyelids of the morn,<br/>
We drove afield, and both together heard<br/>
What time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn,<br/>
Batt'ning our flocks with the fresh dews of night,<br/>
Oft till the star that rose at ev'ning bright<br/>
Toward heav'n's descent had slop'd his westering wheel.<br/>
Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute,<br/>
Temper'd to th'oaten flute;<br/>
Rough Satyrs danc'd, and Fauns with clov'n heel,<br/>
From the glad sound would not be absent long;<br/>
And old Damætas lov'd to hear our song.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But O the heavy change now thou art gone,<br/>
Now thou art gone, and never must return!<br/>
Thee, Shepherd, thee the woods and desert caves,<br/>
With wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown,<br/>
And all their echoes mourn.<br/>
The willows and the hazel copses green<br/>
Shall now no more be seen<br/>
Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays.<br/>
As killing as the canker to the rose,<br/>
Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze,<br/>
Or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear<br/>
When first the white thorn blows:<br/>
Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd's ear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep<br/>
Clos'd o'er the head of your lov'd Lycidas?<br/>
For neither were ye playing on the steep<br/>
Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie,<br/>
Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,<br/>
Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream.<br/>
Ay me! I fondly dream<br/>
Had ye bin there&mdash;for what could that have done?<br/>
What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore,<br/>
The Muse herself, for her enchanting son,<br/>
Whom universal nature did lament,<br/>
When by the rout that made the hideous roar<br/>
His gory visage down the stream was sent,<br/>
Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Alas! what boots it with incessant care<br/>
To tend the homely, slighted shepherd's trade,<br/>
And strictly meditate the thankless Muse?<br/>
Were it not better done, as others use,<br/>
To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,<br/>
Or with the tangles of Neæra's hair?<br/>
Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise<br/>
(That last infirmity of noble mind)<br/>
To scorn delights and live laborious days;<br/>
But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,<br/>
And think to burst out into sudden blaze,<br/>
Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears,<br/>
And slits the thin-spun life. "But not the praise,"<br/>
Phoebus replied, and touch'd my trembling ears;<br/>
"Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,<br/>
Nor in the glistering foil<br/>
Set off to th'world, nor in broad rumour lies,<br/>
But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes<br/>
And perfect witness of all-judging Jove;<br/>
As he pronounces lastly on each deed,<br/>
Of so much fame in Heav'n expect thy meed."<br/>
</p>
<p>
O fountain Arethuse, and thou honour'd flood,<br/>
Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown'd with vocal reeds,<br/>
That strain I heard was of a higher mood.<br/>
But now my oat proceeds,<br/>
And listens to the Herald of the Sea,<br/>
That came in Neptune's plea.<br/>
He ask'd the waves, and ask'd the felon winds,<br/>
"What hard mishap hath doom'd this gentle swain?"<br/>
And question'd every gust of rugged wings<br/>
That blows from off each beaked promontory.<br/>
They knew not of his story;<br/>
And sage Hippotades their answer brings,<br/>
That not a blast was from his dungeon stray'd;<br/>
The air was calm, and on the level brine<br/>
Sleek Panope with all her sisters play'd.<br/>
It was that fatal and perfidious bark,<br/>
Built in th'eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark,<br/>
That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow,<br/>
His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge,<br/>
Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge<br/>
Like to that sanguine flower inscrib'd with woe.<br/>
"Ah! who hath reft," quoth he, "my dearest pledge?"<br/>
Last came, and last did go,<br/>
The Pilot of the Galilean lake;<br/>
Two massy keys he bore of metals twain<br/>
(The golden opes, the iron shuts amain).<br/>
He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:<br/>
"How well could I have spar'd for thee, young swain,<br/>
Enow of such as for their bellies' sake<br/>
Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold?<br/>
Of other care they little reck'ning make<br/>
Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast<br/>
And shove away the worthy bidden guest.<br/>
Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold<br/>
A sheep-hook, or have learn'd aught else the least<br/>
That to the faithful herdman's art belongs!<br/>
What recks it them? What need they? They are sped;<br/>
And when they list their lean and flashy songs<br/>
Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw,<br/>
The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,<br/>
But, swoll'n with wind and the rank mist they draw,<br/>
Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread;<br/>
Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw<br/>
Daily devours apace, and nothing said,<br/>
But that two-handed engine at the door<br/>
Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Return, Alpheus: the dread voice is past<br/>
That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian Muse,<br/>
And call the vales and bid them hither cast<br/>
Their bells and flow'rets of a thousand hues.<br/>
Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use<br/>
Of shades and wanton winds, and gushing brooks,<br/>
On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks,<br/>
Throw hither all your quaint enamel'd eyes,<br/>
That on the green turf suck the honied showers<br/>
And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.<br/>
Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,<br/>
The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,<br/>
The white pink, and the pansy freak'd with jet,<br/>
The glowing violet,<br/>
The musk-rose, and the well attir'd woodbine,<br/>
With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,<br/>
And every flower that sad embroidery wears;<br/>
Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed,<br/>
And daffadillies fill their cups with tears,<br/>
To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies.<br/>
For so to interpose a little ease,<br/>
Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise.<br/>
Ay me! Whilst thee the shores and sounding seas<br/>
Wash far away, where'er thy bones are hurl'd;<br/>
Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,<br/>
Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide<br/>
Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world,<br/>
Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,<br/>
Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,<br/>
Where the great vision of the guarded mount<br/>
Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold:<br/>
Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth;<br/>
And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more,<br/>
For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,<br/>
Sunk though he be beneath the wat'ry floor;<br/>
So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,<br/>
And yet anon repairs his drooping head,<br/>
And tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore<br/>
Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:<br/>
So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high<br/>
Through the dear might of him that walk'd the waves;<br/>
Where, other groves and other streams along,<br/>
With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,<br/>
And hears the unexpressive nuptial song,<br/>
In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love.<br/>
There entertain him all the Saints above,<br/>
In solemn troops, and sweet societies,<br/>
That sing, and singing in their glory move,<br/>
And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.<br/>
Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more:<br/>
Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore,<br/>
In thy large recompense, and shalt be good<br/>
To all that wander in that perilous flood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus sang the uncouth swain to th'oaks and rills,<br/>
While the still morn went out with sandals gray;<br/>
He touch'd the tender stops of various quills,<br/>
With eager thought warbling his Doric lay;<br/>
And now the sun had stretch'd out all the hills,<br/>
And now was dropp'd into the western bay;<br/>
At last he rose, and twitch'd his mantle blue:<br/>
To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new.<br/>

<h1>Il Penseroso</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<p>
Hence vain deluding joyes,<br/>
The brood of folly without father bred,<br/>
How little you bested,<br/>
Or fill the fixed mind with all your toyes;<br/>
Dwell in som idle brain<br/>
And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess,<br/>
As thick and numberless<br/>
As the gay motes that people the Sun Beams,<br/>
Or likest hovering dreams<br/>
The fickle Pensioners of Morpheus train.<br/>
But hail thou Goddess, sage and holy,<br/>
Hail divinest Melancholy<br/>
Whose Saintly visage is too bright<br/>
To hit the Sense of human sight;<br/>
And therefore to our weaker view,<br/>
Ore laid with black staid Wisdoms hue.<br/>
Black, but such as in esteem,<br/>
Prince Memnons sister might beseem,<br/>
Or that Starr'd Ethiope Queen that strove<br/>
To set her beauties praise above<br/>
The Sea Nymphs, and their powers offended.<br/>
Yet thou art higher far descended,<br/>
Thee bright-hair'd Vesta long of yore,<br/>
To solitary Saturn bore;<br/>
His daughter she (in Saturns raign,<br/>
Such mixture was not held a stain)<br/>
Oft in glimmering Bowres, and glades<br/>
He met her, and in secret shades<br/>
Of woody Ida's inmost grove,<br/>
While yet there was no fear of Jove.<br/>
Com pensive Nun, devout and pure,<br/>
Sober, stedfast, and demure,<br/>
All in a robe of darkest grain,<br/>
Flowing with majestick train,<br/>
And sable stole of Cipres Lawn,<br/>
Over thy decent shoulders drawn.<br/>
Com, but keep thy wonted state,<br/>
With eev'n step, and musing gate,<br/>
And looks commercing with the skies,<br/>
Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes:<br/>
There held in holy passion still,<br/>
Forget thy self to Marble, till<br/>
With a sad Leaden downward cast,<br/>
Thou fix them on the earth as fast.<br/>
And joyn with thee calm Peace, and Quiet,<br/>
Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet,<br/>
And hears the Muses in a ring,<br/>
Ay round about Joves Altar sing.<br/>
And adde to these retired Leasure,<br/>
That in trim Gardens takes his pleasure;<br/>
But first, and chiefest, with thee bring,<br/>
Him that yon soars on golden wing,<br/>
Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne,<br/>
The Cherub Contemplation,<br/>
And the mute Silence hist along,<br/>
'Less Philomel will daign a Song,<br/>
In her sweetest, saddest plight,<br/>
Smoothing the rugged brow of night,<br/>
While Cynthia checks her Dragon yoke,<br/>
Gently o're th'accustom'd Oke;<br/>
Sweet Bird that shunn'st the noise of folly<br/>
Most musical!, most melancholy!<br/>
Thee Chauntress oft the Woods among<br/>
I woo to hear thy eeven-Song;<br/>
And missing thee, I walk unseen<br/>
On the dry smooth-shaven Green,<br/>
To behold the wandring Moon,<br/>
Riding neer her highest noon,<br/>
Like one that had bin led astray<br/>
Through the Heav'ns wide pathles way;<br/>
And oft, as if her head she bow'd,<br/>
Stooping through a fleecy cloud.<br/>
Oft on a Plat of rising ground,<br/>
I hear the far-off Curfeu sound,<br/>
Over som wide-water'd shoar,<br/>
Swinging slow with sullen roar;<br/>
Or if the Ayr will not permit,<br/>
Som still removed place will fit,<br/>
Where glowing Embers through the room<br/>
Teach light to counterfeit a gloom<br/>
Far from all resort of mirth,<br/>
Save the Cricket on the hearth,<br/>
Or the Belmans drowsie charm,<br/>
To bless the dores from nightly harm:<br/>
Or let my Lamp at midnight hour,<br/>
Be seen in som high lonely Towr,<br/>
Where I may oft out-watch the Bear,<br/>
With thrice great Hermes, or unsphear<br/>
The spirit of Plato to unfold<br/>
What Worlds, or what vast Regions hold<br/>
The immortal mind that hath forsook<br/>
Her mansion in this fleshly nook:<br/>
And of those Daemons that are found<br/>
In fire, air, flood, or under ground,<br/>
Whose power hath a true consent<br/>
With planet or with Element.<br/>
Som time let Gorgeous Tragedy<br/>
In Scepter'd Pall com sweeping by,<br/>
Presenting Thebs, or Pelops line,<br/>
Or the tale of Troy divine.<br/>
Or what (though rare) of later age,<br/>
Ennobled hath the Buskind stage.<br/>
But, O sad Virgin, that thy power<br/>
Might raise Musaeus from his bower,<br/>
Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing<br/>
Such notes as warbled to the string,<br/>
Drew Iron tears down Pluto's cheek,<br/>
And made Hell grant what Love did seek.<br/>
Or call up him that left half told<br/>
The story of Cambuscan bold,<br/>
Of Camball, and of Algarsife,<br/>
And who had Canace to wife,<br/>
That own'd the vertuous Ring and Glass,<br/>
And of the wondrous Hors of Brass,<br/>
On which the Tartar King did ride;<br/>
And if ought els, great Bards beside,<br/>
In sage and solemn tunes have sung,<br/>
Of Turneys and of Trophies hung;<br/>
Of Forests, and inchantments drear,<br/>
Where more is meant then meets the ear.<br/>
Thus night oft see me in thy pale career,<br/>
Till civil-suited Morn appeer,<br/>
Not trickt and frounc't as she was wont,<br/>
With the Attick Boy to hunt,<br/>
But Cherchef't in a comly Cloud,<br/>
While rocking Winds are Piping loud,<br/>
Or usher'd with a shower still,<br/>
When the gust hath blown his fill,<br/>
Ending on the russling Leaves,<br/>
With minute drops from off the Eaves.<br/>
And when the Sun begins to fling<br/>
His flaring beams, me Goddes bring<br/>
To arched walks of twilight groves,<br/>
And shadows brown that Sylvan loves<br/>
Of Pine, or monumental Oake,<br/>
Where the rude Ax with heaved stroke,<br/>
Was never heard the Nymphs to daunt,<br/>
Or fright them from their hallow'd haunt.<br/>
There in close covert by som Brook,<br/>
Where no profaner eye may look,<br/>
Hide me from Day's garish eie,<br/>
While the Bee with Honied thie,<br/>
That at her flowry work doth sing,<br/>
And the Waters murmuring<br/>
With such consort as they keep,<br/>
Entice the dewy-feather'd Sleep;<br/>
And let som strange mysterious dream,<br/>
Wave at his Wings in Airy stream,<br/>
Of lively portrature display'd,<br/>
Softly on my eye-lids laid.<br/>
And as I wake, sweet musick breath<br/>
Above, about, or underneath,<br/>
Sent by som spirit to mortals good,<br/>
Or th'unseen Genius of the Wood.<br/>
But let my due feet never fail,<br/>
To walk the studious Cloysters pale,<br/>
And love the high embowed Roof<br/>
With antick Pillars massy proof,<br/>
And storied Windows richly dight,<br/>
Casting a dimm religious light.<br/>
There let the pealing Organ blow,<br/>
To the full voic'd Quire below,<br/>
In Service high, and Anthems cleer,<br/>
As may with sweetnes, through mine ear,<br/>
Dissolve me into extasies,<br/>
And bring all Heav'n before mine eyes.<br/>
And may at last my weary age<br/>
Find out the peacefull hermitage,<br/>
The Hairy Gown and Mossy Cell,<br/>
Where I may sit and rightly spell<br/>
Of every Star that Heav'n doth shew,<br/>
And every Herb that sips the dew;<br/>
Till old  experience do attain<br/>
To somthing like prophetic strain.<br/>
These pleasures Melancholy give,<br/>
And I with thee will choose to live.

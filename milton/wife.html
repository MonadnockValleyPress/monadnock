<h1>On His Deceased Wife</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<p>
Methought I saw my late espous√®d saint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom Jove's great son to her glad husband gave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rescued from Death by force, though pale and faint.<br/>
Mine, as whom washed from spot of child-bed taint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purification in the Old Law did save,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such as yet once more I trust to have<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint,<br/>
Came vested all in white, pure as her mind.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined<br/>
So clear as in no face with more delight.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, oh! as to embrace me she inclined,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.

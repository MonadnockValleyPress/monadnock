<h1>L'Allegro</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<p>
Hence loathed Melancholy<br/>
Of Cerberus, and blackest midnight born,<br/>
In Stygian Cave forlorn<br/>
'Mongst horrid shapes, and shreiks, and sights unholy,<br/>
Find out som uncouth cell,<br/>
Where brooding darknes spreads his jealous wings,<br/>
And the night-Raven sings;<br/>
There under Ebon shades and low-brow'd Rocks,<br/>
As ragged as thy Locks,<br/>
In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell.<br/>
But com thou Goddes fair and free,<br/>
In Heav'n ycleap'd Euphrosyne,<br/>
And by men, heart-easing Mirth,<br/>
Whom lovely Venus at a birth<br/>
With two sister Graces more<br/>
To Ivy-crowned Bacchus bore;<br/>
Or whether (as som Sager sing)<br/>
The frolick Wind that breathes the Spring,<br/>
Zephir with Aurora playing,<br/>
As he met her once a Maying,<br/>
There on Beds of Violets blew,<br/>
And fresh-blown Roses washt in dew,<br/>
Fill'd her with thee a daughter fair,<br/>
So bucksom, blith, and debonair.<br/>
Haste thee nymph, and bring with thee<br/>
Jest and youthful Jollity,<br/>
Quips and Cranks, and wanton Wiles,<br/>
Nods, and Becks, and Wreathed Smiles,<br/>
Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,<br/>
And love to live in dimple sleek;<br/>
Sport that wrincled Care derides,<br/>
And Laughter holding both his sides.<br/>
Com, and trip it as ye go<br/>
On the light fantastick toe,<br/>
And in thy right hand lead with thee,<br/>
The Mountain Nymph, sweet Liberty;<br/>
And if I give thee honour due,<br/>
Mirth, admit me of thy crue<br/>
To live with her, and live with thee,<br/>
In unreproved pleasures free;<br/>
To hear the Lark begin his flight,<br/>
And singing startle the dull night,<br/>
From his watch-towre in the skies,<br/>
Till the dappled dawn doth rise;<br/>
Then to com in spight of sorrow,<br/>
And at my window bid good morrow,<br/>
Through the Sweet-Briar, or the Vine,<br/>
Or the twisted Eglantine.<br/>
While the Cock with lively din,<br/>
Scatters the rear of darknes thin,<br/>
And to the stack, or the Barn dore,<br/>
Stoutly struts his Dames before,<br/>
Oft list'ning how the Hounds and horn<br/>
Chearly rouse the slumbring morn,<br/>
From the side of som Hoar Hill,<br/>
Through the high wood echoing shrill.<br/>
Som time walking not unseen<br/>
By Hedge-row Elms, on Hillocks green,<br/>
Right against the Eastern gate,<br/>
Wher the great Sun begins his state,<br/>
Rob'd in flames, and Amber light,<br/>
The clouds in thousand Liveries dight.<br/>
While the Plowman neer at hand,<br/>
Whistles ore the Furrow'd Land,<br/>
And the Milkmaid singeth blithe,<br/>
And the Mower whets his sithe,<br/>
And every Shepherd tells his tale<br/>
Under the Hawthorn in the dale.<br/>
Streit mine eye hath caught new pleasures<br/>
Whilst the Lantskip round it measures,<br/>
Russet Lawns, and Fallows Gray,<br/>
Where the nibling flocks do stray,<br/>
Mountains on whose barren brest<br/>
The labouring clouds do often rest:<br/>
Meadows trim with Daisies pide,<br/>
Shallow Brooks, and Rivers wide.<br/>
Towers, and Battlements it sees<br/>
Boosom'd high in tufted Trees,<br/>
Wher perhaps som beauty lies,<br/>
The Cynosure of neighbouring eyes.<br/>
Hard by, a Cottage chimney smokes,<br/>
From betwixt two aged Okes,<br/>
Where Corydon and Thyrsis met,<br/>
Are at their savory dinner set<br/>
Of Hearbs, and other Country Messes,<br/>
Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses;<br/>
And then in haste her Bowre she leaves,<br/>
With Thestylis to bind the Sheaves;<br/>
Or if the earlier season lead<br/>
To the tann'd Haycock in the Mead,<br/>
Som times with secure delight<br/>
The up-land Hamlets will invite,<br/>
When the merry Bells ring round,<br/>
And the jocond rebecks sound<br/>
To many a youth, and many a maid,<br/>
Dancing in the Chequer'd shade;<br/>
And young and old com forth to play<br/>
On a Sunshine Holyday,<br/>
Till the live-long day-light fail,<br/>
Then to the Spicy Nut-brown Ale,<br/>
With stories told of many a feat,<br/>
How Faery Mab the junkets eat,<br/>
She was pincht, and pull'd she sed,<br/>
And he by Friars Lanthorn led<br/>
Tells how the drudging Goblin swet,<br/>
To ern his Cream-bowle duly set,<br/>
When in one night, ere glimps of morn,<br/>
His shadowy Flale hath thresh'd the Corn<br/>
That ten day-labourers could not end,<br/>
Then lies him down the Lubbar Fend.<br/>
And stretch'd out all the Chimney's length,<br/>
Basks at the fire his hairy strength;<br/>
And Crop-full out of dores he flings,<br/>
Ere the first Cock his Mattin rings.<br/>
Thus don the Tales, to bed they creep,<br/>
By whispering Windes soon lull'd asleep.<br/>
Towred Cities please us then,<br/>
And the busie humm of men,<br/>
Where throngs of Knights and Barons bold,<br/>
In weeds of Peace high triumphs hold,<br/>
With store of Ladies, whose bright eies<br/>
Rain influence, and judge the prise<br/>
Of Wit, or Arms, while both contend<br/>
To win her Grace, whom all commend.<br/>
There let Hymen oft appear<br/>
In Saffron robe, with Taper clear,<br/>
And pomp, and feast, and revelry,<br/>
With mask, and antique Pageantry,<br/>
Such sights as youthfull Poets dream<br/>
On Summer eeves by haunted stream.<br/>
Then to the well-trod stage anon,<br/>
If Jonsons learned Sock be on,<br/>
Or sweetest Shakespear fancies childe,<br/>
Warble his native Wood-notes wilde,<br/>
And ever against eating Cares,<br/>
Lap me in soft Lydian Aires,<br/>
Married to immortal verse<br/>
Such as the meeting soul may pierce<br/>
In notes, with many a winding bout<br/>
Of lincked sweetnes long drawn out,<br/>
With wanton heed, and giddy cunning,<br/>
The melting voice through mazes running;<br/>
Untwisting all the chains that ty<br/>
The hidden soul of harmony.<br/>
That Orpheus self may heave his head<br/>
From golden slumber on a bed<br/>
Of heapt Elysian flowres, and hear<br/>
Such streins as would have won the ear<br/>
Of Pluto, to have quite set free<br/>
His half regain'd Eurydice.<br/>
These delights, if thou canst give,<br/>
Mirth with thee, I mean to live.

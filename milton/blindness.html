<h1>On His Blindness</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<p>
When I consider how my light is spent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that one talent which is death to hide<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent<br/>
To serve therewith my Maker, and present<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My true account, lest He returning chide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doth God exact day-labor, light denied?"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent<br/>
That murmur, soon replies, "God doth not need<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either man's work or his own gifts. Who best<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state<br/>
Is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And post o'er land and ocean without rest;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also serve who only stand and wait."

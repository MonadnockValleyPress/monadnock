<h1>Paradise Lost</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<h2>Book XII</h2>
<p>
As one who in his journey bates at noon,<br/>
Though bent on speed; so here the Arch-Angel paused<br/>
Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored,<br/>
If Adam aught perhaps might interpose;<br/>
Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes.<br/>
Thus thou hast seen one world begin, and end;<br/>
And Man, as from a second stock, proceed.<br/>
Much thou hast yet to see; but I perceive<br/>
Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine<br/>
Must needs impair and weary human sense:<br/>
Henceforth what is to come I will relate;<br/>
Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.<br/>
This second source of Men, while yet but few,<br/>
And while the dread of judgement past remains<br/>
Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity,<br/>
With some regard to what is just and right<br/>
Shall lead their lives, and multiply apace;<br/>
Labouring the soil, and reaping plenteous crop,<br/>
Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock,<br/>
Oft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid,<br/>
With large wine-offerings poured, and sacred feast,<br/>
Shall spend their days in joy unblamed; and dwell<br/>
Long time in peace, by families and tribes,<br/>
Under paternal rule: till one shall rise<br/>
Of proud ambitious heart; who, not content<br/>
With fair equality, fraternal state,<br/>
Will arrogate dominion undeserved<br/>
Over his brethren, and quite dispossess<br/>
Concord and law of nature from the earth;<br/>
Hunting (and men not beasts shall be his game)<br/>
With war, and hostile snare, such as refuse<br/>
Subjection to his empire tyrannous:<br/>
A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled<br/>
Before the Lord; as in despite of Heaven,<br/>
Or from Heaven, claiming second sovranty;<br/>
And from rebellion shall derive his name,<br/>
Though of rebellion others he accuse.<br/>
He with a crew, whom like ambition joins<br/>
With him or under him to tyrannize,<br/>
Marching from Eden towards the west, shall find<br/>
The plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge<br/>
Boils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell:<br/>
Of brick, and of that stuff, they cast to build<br/>
A city and tower, whose top may reach to Heaven;<br/>
And get themselves a name; lest, far dispersed<br/>
In foreign lands, their memory be lost;<br/>
Regardless whether good or evil fame.<br/>
But God, who oft descends to visit men<br/>
Unseen, and through their habitations walks<br/>
To mark their doings, them beholding soon,<br/>
Comes down to see their city, ere the tower<br/>
Obstruct Heaven-towers, and in derision sets<br/>
Upon their tongues a various spirit, to rase<br/>
Quite out their native language; and, instead,<br/>
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:<br/>
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud,<br/>
Among the builders; each to other calls<br/>
Not understood; till hoarse, and all in rage,<br/>
As mocked they storm: great laughter was in Heaven,<br/>
And looking down, to see the hubbub strange,<br/>
And hear the din: Thus was the building left<br/>
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named.<br/>
Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased.<br/>
O execrable son! so to aspire<br/>
Above his brethren; to himself assuming<br/>
Authority usurped, from God not given:<br/>
He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,<br/>
Dominion absolute; that right we hold<br/>
By his donation; but man over men<br/>
He made not lord; such title to himself<br/>
Reserving, human left from human free.<br/>
But this usurper his encroachment proud<br/>
Stays not on Man; to God his tower intends<br/>
Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food<br/>
Will he convey up thither, to sustain<br/>
Himself and his rash army; where thin air<br/>
Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross,<br/>
And famish him of breath, if not of bread?<br/>
To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorrest<br/>
That son, who on the quiet state of men<br/>
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue<br/>
Rational liberty; yet know withal,<br/>
Since thy original lapse, true liberty<br/>
Is lost, which always with right reason dwells<br/>
Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being:<br/>
Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed,<br/>
Immediately inordinate desires,<br/>
And upstart passions, catch the government<br/>
From reason; and to servitude reduce<br/>
Man, till then free. Therefore, since he permits<br/>
Within himself unworthy powers to reign<br/>
Over free reason, God, in judgement just,<br/>
Subjects him from without to violent lords;<br/>
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall<br/>
His outward freedom: Tyranny must be;<br/>
Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse.<br/>
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low<br/>
From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong,<br/>
But justice, and some fatal curse annexed,<br/>
Deprives them of their outward liberty;<br/>
Their inward lost: Witness the irreverent son<br/>
Of him who built the ark; who, for the shame<br/>
Done to his father, heard this heavy curse,<br/>
Servant of servants, on his vicious race.<br/>
Thus will this latter, as the former world,<br/>
Still tend from bad to worse; till God at last,<br/>
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw<br/>
His presence from among them, and avert<br/>
His holy eyes; resolving from thenceforth<br/>
To leave them to their own polluted ways;<br/>
And one peculiar nation to select<br/>
From all the rest, of whom to be invoked,<br/>
A nation from one faithful man to spring:<br/>
Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,<br/>
Bred up in idol-worship: O, that men<br/>
(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,<br/>
While yet the patriarch lived, who 'scaped the flood,<br/>
As to forsake the living God, and fall<br/>
To worship their own work in wood and stone<br/>
For Gods! Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes<br/>
To call by vision, from his father's house,<br/>
His kindred, and false Gods, into a land<br/>
Which he will show him; and from him will raise<br/>
A mighty nation; and upon him shower<br/>
His benediction so, that in his seed<br/>
All nations shall be blest: he straight obeys;<br/>
Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes:<br/>
I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith<br/>
He leaves his Gods, his friends, and native soil,<br/>
Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the ford<br/>
To Haran; after him a cumbrous train<br/>
Of herds and flocks, and numerous servitude;<br/>
Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth<br/>
With God, who called him, in a land unknown.<br/>
Canaan he now attains; I see his tents<br/>
Pitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring plain<br/>
Of Moreh; there by promise he receives<br/>
Gift to his progeny of all that land,<br/>
From Hameth northward to the Desart south;<br/>
(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed;)<br/>
From Hermon east to the great western Sea;<br/>
Mount Hermon, yonder sea; each place behold<br/>
In prospect, as I point them; on the shore<br/>
Mount Carmel; here, the double-founted stream,<br/>
Jordan, true limit eastward; but his sons<br/>
Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills.<br/>
This ponder, that all nations of the earth<br/>
Shall in his seed be blessed: By that seed<br/>
Is meant thy great Deliverer, who shall bruise<br/>
The Serpent's head; whereof to thee anon<br/>
Plainlier shall be revealed. This patriarch blest,<br/>
Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,<br/>
A son, and of his son a grand-child, leaves;<br/>
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown:<br/>
The grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs<br/>
From Canaan to a land hereafter called<br/>
Egypt, divided by the river Nile<br/>
See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths<br/>
Into the sea. To sojourn in that land<br/>
He comes, invited by a younger son<br/>
In time of dearth, a son whose worthy deeds<br/>
Raise him to be the second in that realm<br/>
Of Pharaoh. There he dies, and leaves his race<br/>
Growing into a nation, and now grown<br/>
Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks<br/>
To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests<br/>
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves<br/>
Inhospitably, and kills their infant males:<br/>
Till by two brethren (these two brethren call<br/>
Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim<br/>
His people from enthralment, they return,<br/>
With glory and spoil, back to their promised land.<br/>
But first, the lawless tyrant, who denies<br/>
To know their God, or message to regard,<br/>
Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire;<br/>
To blood unshed the rivers must be turned;<br/>
Frogs, lice, and flies, must all his palace fill<br/>
With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land;<br/>
His cattle must of rot and murren die;<br/>
Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss,<br/>
And all his people; thunder mixed with hail,<br/>
Hail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptians sky,<br/>
And wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls;<br/>
What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain,<br/>
A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down<br/>
Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green;<br/>
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,<br/>
Palpable darkness, and blot out three days;<br/>
Last, with one midnight stroke, all the first-born<br/>
Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds<br/>
The river-dragon tamed at length submits<br/>
To let his sojourners depart, and oft<br/>
Humbles his stubborn heart; but still, as ice<br/>
More hardened after thaw; till, in his rage<br/>
Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea<br/>
Swallows him with his host; but them lets pass,<br/>
As on dry land, between two crystal walls;<br/>
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand<br/>
Divided, till his rescued gain their shore:<br/>
Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend,<br/>
Though present in his Angel; who shall go<br/>
Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire;<br/>
By day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire;<br/>
To guide them in their journey, and remove<br/>
Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues:<br/>
All night he will pursue; but his approach<br/>
Darkness defends between till morning watch;<br/>
Then through the fiery pillar, and the cloud,<br/>
God looking forth will trouble all his host,<br/>
And craze their chariot-wheels: when by command<br/>
Moses once more his potent rod extends<br/>
Over the sea; the sea his rod obeys;<br/>
On their embattled ranks the waves return,<br/>
And overwhelm their war: The race elect<br/>
Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance<br/>
Through the wild Desart, not the readiest way;<br/>
Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed,<br/>
War terrify them inexpert, and fear<br/>
Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather<br/>
Inglorious life with servitude; for life<br/>
To noble and ignoble is more sweet<br/>
Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on.<br/>
This also shall they gain by their delay<br/>
In the wide wilderness; there they shall found<br/>
Their government, and their great senate choose<br/>
Through the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained:<br/>
God from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top<br/>
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself<br/>
In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets' sound,<br/>
Ordain them laws; part, such as appertain<br/>
To civil justice; part, religious rites<br/>
Of sacrifice; informing them, by types<br/>
And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise<br/>
The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve<br/>
Mankind's deliverance. But the voice of God<br/>
To mortal ear is dreadful: They beseech<br/>
That Moses might report to them his will,<br/>
And terrour cease; he grants what they besought,<br/>
Instructed that to God is no access<br/>
Without Mediator, whose high office now<br/>
Moses in figure bears; to introduce<br/>
One greater, of whose day he shall foretel,<br/>
And all the Prophets in their age the times<br/>
Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus, laws and rites<br/>
Established, such delight hath God in Men<br/>
Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafes<br/>
Among them to set up his tabernacle;<br/>
The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell:<br/>
By his prescript a sanctuary is framed<br/>
Of cedar, overlaid with gold; therein<br/>
An ark, and in the ark his testimony,<br/>
The records of his covenant; over these<br/>
A mercy-seat of gold, between the wings<br/>
Of two bright Cherubim; before him burn<br/>
Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing<br/>
The heavenly fires; over the tent a cloud<br/>
Shall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night;<br/>
Save when they journey, and at length they come,<br/>
Conducted by his Angel, to the land<br/>
Promised to Abraham and his seed:&mdash;The rest<br/>
Were long to tell; how many battles fought<br/>
How many kings destroyed; and kingdoms won;<br/>
Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still<br/>
A day entire, and night's due course adjourn,<br/>
Man's voice commanding, "Sun, in Gibeon stand,<br/>
And thou moon in the vale of Aialon,<br/>
Till Israel overcome!" so call the third<br/>
From Abraham, son of Isaac; and from him<br/>
His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.<br/>
Here Adam interposed. O sent from Heaven,<br/>
Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things<br/>
Thou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern<br/>
Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find<br/>
Mine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased;<br/>
Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become<br/>
Of me and all mankind: But now I see<br/>
His day, in whom all nations shall be blest;<br/>
Favour unmerited by me, who sought<br/>
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.<br/>
This yet I apprehend not, why to those<br/>
Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth<br/>
So many and so various laws are given;<br/>
So many laws argue so many sins<br/>
Among them; how can God with such reside?<br/>
To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin<br/>
Will reign among them, as of thee begot;<br/>
And therefore was law given them, to evince<br/>
Their natural pravity, by stirring up<br/>
Sin against law to fight: that when they see<br/>
Law can discover sin, but not remove,<br/>
Save by those shadowy expiations weak,<br/>
The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude<br/>
Some blood more precious must be paid for Man;<br/>
Just for unjust; that, in such righteousness<br/>
To them by faith imputed, they may find<br/>
Justification towards God, and peace<br/>
Of conscience; which the law by ceremonies<br/>
Cannot appease; nor Man the mortal part<br/>
Perform; and, not performing, cannot live.<br/>
So law appears imperfect; and but given<br/>
With purpose to resign them, in full time,<br/>
Up to a better covenant; disciplined<br/>
From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit;<br/>
From imposition of strict laws to free<br/>
Acceptance of large grace; from servile fear<br/>
To filial; works of law to works of faith.<br/>
And therefore shall not Moses, though of God<br/>
Highly beloved, being but the minister<br/>
Of law, his people into Canaan lead;<br/>
But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call,<br/>
His name and office bearing, who shall quell<br/>
The adversary-Serpent, and bring back<br/>
Through the world's wilderness long-wandered Man<br/>
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.<br/>
Mean while they, in their earthly Canaan placed,<br/>
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins<br/>
National interrupt their publick peace,<br/>
Provoking God to raise them enemies;<br/>
From whom as oft he saves them penitent<br/>
By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom<br/>
The second, both for piety renowned<br/>
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive<br/>
Irrevocable, that his regal throne<br/>
For ever shall endure; the like shall sing<br/>
All Prophecy, that of the royal stock<br/>
Of David (so I name this king) shall rise<br/>
A Son, the Woman's seed to thee foretold,<br/>
Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust<br/>
All nations; and to kings foretold, of kings<br/>
The last; for of his reign shall be no end.<br/>
But first, a long succession must ensue;<br/>
And his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed,<br/>
The clouded ark of God, till then in tents<br/>
Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine.<br/>
Such follow him, as shall be registered<br/>
Part good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll;<br/>
Whose foul idolatries, and other faults<br/>
Heaped to the popular sum, will so incense<br/>
God, as to leave them, and expose their land,<br/>
Their city, his temple, and his holy ark,<br/>
With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey<br/>
To that proud city, whose high walls thou sawest<br/>
Left in confusion; Babylon thence called.<br/>
There in captivity he lets them dwell<br/>
The space of seventy years; then brings them back,<br/>
Remembering mercy, and his covenant sworn<br/>
To David, stablished as the days of Heaven.<br/>
Returned from Babylon by leave of kings<br/>
Their lords, whom God disposed, the house of God<br/>
They first re-edify; and for a while<br/>
In mean estate live moderate; till, grown<br/>
In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;<br/>
But first among the priests dissention springs,<br/>
Men who attend the altar, and should most<br/>
Endeavour peace: their strife pollution brings<br/>
Upon the temple itself: at last they seise<br/>
The scepter, and regard not David's sons;<br/>
Then lose it to a stranger, that the true<br/>
Anointed King Messiah might be born<br/>
Barred of his right; yet at his birth a star,<br/>
Unseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come;<br/>
And guides the eastern sages, who inquire<br/>
His place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold:<br/>
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells<br/>
To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night;<br/>
They gladly thither haste, and by a quire<br/>
Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.<br/>
A virgin is his mother, but his sire<br/>
The power of the Most High: He shall ascend<br/>
The throne hereditary, and bound his reign<br/>
With Earth's wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.<br/>
He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy<br/>
Surcharged, as had like grief been dewed in tears,<br/>
Without the vent of words; which these he breathed.<br/>
O prophet of glad tidings, finisher<br/>
Of utmost hope! now clear I understand<br/>
What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain;<br/>
Why our great Expectation should be called<br/>
The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, hail,<br/>
High in the love of Heaven; yet from my loins<br/>
Thou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son<br/>
Of God Most High: so God with Man unites!<br/>
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise<br/>
Expect with mortal pain: Say where and when<br/>
Their fight, what stroke shall bruise the victor's heel.<br/>
To whom thus Michael. Dream not of their fight,<br/>
As of a duel, or the local wounds<br/>
Of head or heel: Not therefore joins the Son<br/>
Manhood to Godhead, with more strength to foil<br/>
Thy enemy; nor so is overcome<br/>
Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise,<br/>
Disabled, not to give thee thy death's wound:<br/>
Which he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,<br/>
Not by destroying Satan, but his works<br/>
In thee, and in thy seed: Nor can this be,<br/>
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,<br/>
Obedience to the law of God, imposed<br/>
On penalty of death, and suffering death;<br/>
The penalty to thy transgression due,<br/>
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:<br/>
So only can high Justice rest appaid.<br/>
The law of God exact he shall fulfil<br/>
Both by obedience and by love, though love<br/>
Alone fulfil the law; thy punishment<br/>
He shall endure, by coming in the flesh<br/>
To a reproachful life, and cursed death;<br/>
Proclaiming life to all who shall believe<br/>
In his redemption; and that his obedience,<br/>
Imputed, becomes theirs by faith; his merits<br/>
To save them, not their own, though legal, works.<br/>
For this he shall live hated, be blasphemed,<br/>
Seised on by force, judged, and to death condemned<br/>
A shameful and accursed, nailed to the cross<br/>
By his own nation; slain for bringing life:<br/>
But to the cross he nails thy enemies,<br/>
The law that is against thee, and the sins<br/>
Of all mankind, with him there crucified,<br/>
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust<br/>
In this his satisfaction; so he dies,<br/>
But soon revives; Death over him no power<br/>
Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light<br/>
Return, the stars of morn shall see him rise<br/>
Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,<br/>
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,<br/>
His death for Man, as many as offered life<br/>
Neglect not, and the benefit embrace<br/>
By faith not void of works: This God-like act<br/>
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldest have died,<br/>
In sin for ever lost from life; this act<br/>
Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength,<br/>
Defeating Sin and Death, his two main arms;<br/>
And fix far deeper in his head their stings<br/>
Than temporal death shall bruise the victor's heel,<br/>
Or theirs whom he redeems; a death, like sleep,<br/>
A gentle wafting to immortal life.<br/>
Nor after resurrection shall he stay<br/>
Longer on earth, than certain times to appear<br/>
To his disciples, men who in his life<br/>
Still followed him; to them shall leave in charge<br/>
To teach all nations what of him they learned<br/>
And his salvation; them who shall believe<br/>
Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign<br/>
Of washing them from guilt of sin to life<br/>
Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,<br/>
For death, like that which the Redeemer died.<br/>
All nations they shall teach; for, from that day,<br/>
Not only to the sons of Abraham's loins<br/>
Salvation shall be preached, but to the sons<br/>
Of Abraham's faith wherever through the world;<br/>
So in his seed all nations shall be blest.<br/>
Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend<br/>
With victory, triumphing through the air<br/>
Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise<br/>
The Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains<br/>
Through all his realm, and there confounded leave;<br/>
Then enter into glory, and resume<br/>
His seat at God's right hand, exalted high<br/>
Above all names in Heaven; and thence shall come,<br/>
When this world's dissolution shall be ripe,<br/>
With glory and power to judge both quick and dead;<br/>
To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward<br/>
His faithful, and receive them into bliss,<br/>
Whether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth<br/>
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place<br/>
Than this of Eden, and far happier days.<br/>
So spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused,<br/>
As at the world's great period; and our sire,<br/>
Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied.<br/>
O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!<br/>
That all this good of evil shall produce,<br/>
And evil turn to good; more wonderful<br/>
Than that which by creation first brought forth<br/>
Light out of darkness! Full of doubt I stand,<br/>
Whether I should repent me now of sin<br/>
By me done, and occasioned; or rejoice<br/>
Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring;<br/>
To God more glory, more good-will to Men<br/>
From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.<br/>
But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven<br/>
Must re-ascend, what will betide the few<br/>
His faithful, left among the unfaithful herd,<br/>
The enemies of truth? Who then shall guide<br/>
His people, who defend? Will they not deal<br/>
Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?<br/>
Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven<br/>
He to his own a Comforter will send,<br/>
The promise of the Father, who shall dwell<br/>
His Spirit within them; and the law of faith,<br/>
Working through love, upon their hearts shall write,<br/>
To guide them in all truth; and also arm<br/>
With spiritual armour, able to resist<br/>
Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts;<br/>
What man can do against them, not afraid,<br/>
Though to the death; against such cruelties<br/>
With inward consolations recompensed,<br/>
And oft supported so as shall amaze<br/>
Their proudest persecutors: For the Spirit,<br/>
Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends<br/>
To evangelize the nations, then on all<br/>
Baptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue<br/>
To speak all tongues, and do all miracles,<br/>
As did their Lord before them. Thus they win<br/>
Great numbers of each nation to receive<br/>
With joy the tidings brought from Heaven: At length<br/>
Their ministry performed, and race well run,<br/>
Their doctrine and their story written left,<br/>
They die; but in their room, as they forewarn,<br/>
Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves,<br/>
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven<br/>
To their own vile advantages shall turn<br/>
Of lucre and ambition; and the truth<br/>
With superstitions and traditions taint,<br/>
Left only in those written records pure,<br/>
Though not but by the Spirit understood.<br/>
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,<br/>
Places, and titles, and with these to join<br/>
Secular power; though feigning still to act<br/>
By spiritual, to themselves appropriating<br/>
The Spirit of God, promised alike and given<br/>
To all believers; and, from that pretence,<br/>
Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force<br/>
On every conscience; laws which none shall find<br/>
Left them inrolled, or what the Spirit within<br/>
Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then<br/>
But force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind<br/>
His consort Liberty? what, but unbuild<br/>
His living temples, built by faith to stand,<br/>
Their own faith, not another's? for, on earth,<br/>
Who against faith and conscience can be heard<br/>
Infallible? yet many will presume:<br/>
Whence heavy persecution shall arise<br/>
On all, who in the worship persevere<br/>
Of spirit and truth; the rest, far greater part,<br/>
Will deem in outward rites and specious forms<br/>
Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire<br/>
Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith<br/>
Rarely be found: So shall the world go on,<br/>
To good malignant, to bad men benign;<br/>
Under her own weight groaning; till the day<br/>
Appear of respiration to the just,<br/>
And vengeance to the wicked, at return<br/>
Of him so lately promised to thy aid,<br/>
The Woman's Seed; obscurely then foretold,<br/>
Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord;<br/>
Last, in the clouds, from Heaven to be revealed<br/>
In glory of the Father, to dissolve<br/>
Satan with his perverted world; then raise<br/>
From the conflagrant mass, purged and refined,<br/>
New Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date,<br/>
Founded in righteousness, and peace, and love;<br/>
To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss.<br/>
He ended; and thus Adam last replied.<br/>
How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,<br/>
Measured this transient world, the race of time,<br/>
Till time stand fixed! Beyond is all abyss,<br/>
Eternity, whose end no eye can reach.<br/>
Greatly-instructed I shall hence depart;<br/>
Greatly in peace of thought; and have my fill<br/>
Of knowledge, what this vessel can contain;<br/>
Beyond which was my folly to aspire.<br/>
Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best,<br/>
And love with fear the only God; to walk<br/>
As in his presence; ever to observe<br/>
His providence; and on him sole depend,<br/>
Merciful over all his works, with good<br/>
Still overcoming evil, and by small<br/>
Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak<br/>
Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise<br/>
By simply meek: that suffering for truth's sake<br/>
Is fortitude to highest victory,<br/>
And, to the faithful, death the gate of life;<br/>
Taught this by his example, whom I now<br/>
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.<br/>
To whom thus also the Angel last replied.<br/>
This having learned, thou hast attained the sum<br/>
Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars<br/>
Thou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers,<br/>
All secrets of the deep, all Nature's works,<br/>
Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea,<br/>
And all the riches of this world enjoyedst,<br/>
And all the rule, one empire; only add<br/>
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith,<br/>
Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love,<br/>
By name to come called charity, the soul<br/>
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth<br/>
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess<br/>
A Paradise within thee, happier far.&mdash;<br/>
Let us descend now therefore from this top<br/>
Of speculation; for the hour precise<br/>
Exacts our parting hence; and see the guards,<br/>
By me encamped on yonder hill, expect<br/>
Their motion; at whose front a flaming sword,<br/>
In signal of remove, waves fiercely round:<br/>
We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;<br/>
Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed<br/>
Portending good, and all her spirits composed<br/>
To meek submission: thou, at season fit,<br/>
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard;<br/>
Chiefly what may concern her faith to know,<br/>
The great deliverance by her seed to come<br/>
(For by the Woman's seed) on all mankind:<br/>
That ye may live, which will be many days,<br/>
Both in one faith unanimous, though sad,<br/>
With cause, for evils past; yet much more cheered<br/>
With meditation on the happy end.<br/>
He ended, and they both descend the hill;<br/>
Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve<br/>
Lay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked;<br/>
And thus with words not sad she him received.<br/>
Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know;<br/>
For God is also in sleep; and dreams advise,<br/>
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good<br/>
Presaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress<br/>
Wearied I fell asleep: But now lead on;<br/>
In me is no delay; with thee to go,<br/>
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,<br/>
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me<br/>
Art all things under Heaven, all places thou,<br/>
Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.<br/>
This further consolation yet secure<br/>
I carry hence; though all by me is lost,<br/>
Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed,<br/>
By me the Promised Seed shall all restore.<br/>
So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard<br/>
Well pleased, but answered not: For now, too nigh<br/>
The Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill<br/>
To their fixed station, all in bright array<br/>
The Cherubim descended; on the ground<br/>
Gliding meteorous, as evening-mist<br/>
Risen from a river o'er the marish glides,<br/>
And gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel<br/>
Homeward returning. High in front advanced,<br/>
The brandished sword of God before them blazed,<br/>
Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat,<br/>
And vapour as the Libyan air adust,<br/>
Began to parch that temperate clime; whereat<br/>
In either hand the hastening Angel caught<br/>
Our lingering parents, and to the eastern gate<br/>
Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast<br/>
To the subjected plain; then disappeared.<br/>
They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld<br/>
Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,<br/>
Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate<br/>
With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms:<br/>
Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon;<br/>
The world was all before them, where to choose<br/>
Their place of rest, and Providence their guide:<br/>
They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,<br/>
Through Eden took their solitary way.

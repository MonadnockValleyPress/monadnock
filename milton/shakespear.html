<h1>On Shakespear</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<p>
What needs my Shakespear for his honour'd Bones,<br/>
The labour of an age in piled Stones,<br/>
Or that his hallow'd reliques should be hid<br/>
Under a Star-ypointing Pyramid?<br/>
Dear son of memory, great heir of Fame,<br/>
What need'st thou such weak witnes of thy name?<br/>
Thou in our wonder and astonishment<br/>
Hast built thy self a live-long Monument.<br/>
For whilst to th'shame of slow-endeavouring art,<br/>
Thy easie numbers flow, and that each heart<br/>
Hath from the Leaves of thy unvalu'd Book,<br/>
Those Delphick lines with deep impression took,<br/>
Then thou our fancy of it self bereaving,<br/>
Dost make us Marble with too much conceaving;<br/>
And so Sepulcher'd in such pomp dost lie,<br/>
That Kings for such a Tomb would wish to die.

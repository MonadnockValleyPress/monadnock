<h1>Paradise Lost</h1>
<h2>by John Milton</h2>
<h2>Book III</h2>
<p>
Hail, holy Light, offspring of Heaven firstborn,<br/>
Or of the Eternal coeternal beam<br/>
May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light,<br/>
And never but in unapproached light<br/>
Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee<br/>
Bright effluence of bright essence increate.<br/>
Or hear'st thou rather pure ethereal stream,<br/>
Whose fountain who shall tell? before the sun,<br/>
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice<br/>
Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest<br/>
The rising world of waters dark and deep,<br/>
Won from the void and formless infinite.<br/>
Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,<br/>
Escap'd the Stygian pool, though long detain'd<br/>
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight<br/>
Through utter and through middle darkness borne,<br/>
With other notes than to the Orphean lyre<br/>
I sung of Chaos and eternal Night;<br/>
Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down<br/>
The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,<br/>
Though hard and rare: Thee I revisit safe,<br/>
And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou<br/>
Revisit'st not these eyes, that roll in vain<br/>
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;<br/>
So thick a drop serene hath quench'd their orbs,<br/>
Or dim suffusion veil'd. Yet not the more<br/>
Cease I to wander, where the Muses haunt,<br/>
Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,<br/>
Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief<br/>
Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,<br/>
That wash thy hallow'd feet, and warbling flow,<br/>
Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget<br/>
So were I equall'd with them in renown,<br/>
Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;<br/>
Blind Thamyris, and blind Maeonides,<br/>
And Tiresias, and Phineus, prophets old:<br/>
Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move<br/>
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird<br/>
Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid<br/>
Tunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year<br/>
Seasons return; but not to me returns<br/>
Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,<br/>
Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose,<br/>
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;<br/>
But cloud instead, and ever-during dark<br/>
Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men<br/>
Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair<br/>
Presented with a universal blank<br/>
Of nature's works to me expung'd and ras'd,<br/>
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.<br/>
So much the rather thou, celestial Light,<br/>
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers<br/>
Irradiate; there plant eyes, all mist from thence<br/>
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell<br/>
Of things invisible to mortal sight.<br/>
Now had the Almighty Father from above,<br/>
From the pure empyrean where he sits<br/>
High thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye<br/>
His own works and their works at once to view:<br/>
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven<br/>
Stood thick as stars, and from his sight receiv'd<br/>
Beatitude past utterance; on his right<br/>
The radiant image of his glory sat,<br/>
His only son; on earth he first beheld<br/>
Our two first parents, yet the only two<br/>
Of mankind in the happy garden plac'd<br/>
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,<br/>
Uninterrupted joy, unrivall'd love,<br/>
In blissful solitude; he then survey'd<br/>
Hell and the gulf between, and Satan there<br/>
Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night<br/>
In the dun air sublime, and ready now<br/>
To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet,<br/>
On the bare outside of this world, that seem'd<br/>
Firm land imbosom'd, without firmament,<br/>
Uncertain which, in ocean or in air.<br/>
Him God beholding from his prospect high,<br/>
Wherein past, present, future, he beholds,<br/>
Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake.<br/>
Only begotten Son, seest thou what rage<br/>
Transports our Adversary? whom no bounds<br/>
Prescrib'd no bars of Hell, nor all the chains<br/>
Heap'd on him there, nor yet the main abyss<br/>
Wide interrupt, can hold; so bent he seems<br/>
On desperate revenge, that shall redound<br/>
Upon his own rebellious head. And now,<br/>
Through all restraint broke loose, he wings his way<br/>
Not far off Heaven, in the precincts of light,<br/>
Directly towards the new created world,<br/>
And man there plac'd, with purpose to assay<br/>
If him by force he can destroy, or, worse,<br/>
By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert;<br/>
For man will hearken to his glozing lies,<br/>
And easily transgress the sole command,<br/>
Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall<br/>
He and his faithless progeny: Whose fault?<br/>
Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of me<br/>
All he could have; I made him just and right,<br/>
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.<br/>
Such I created all the ethereal Powers<br/>
And Spirits, both them who stood, and them who fail'd;<br/>
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.<br/>
Not free, what proof could they have given sincere<br/>
Of true allegiance, constant faith or love,<br/>
Where only what they needs must do appear'd,<br/>
Not what they would? what praise could they receive?<br/>
What pleasure I from such obedience paid,<br/>
When will and reason (reason also is choice)<br/>
Useless and vain, of freedom both despoil'd,<br/>
Made passive both, had serv'd necessity,<br/>
Not me. They therefore, as to right belong'd,<br/>
So were created, nor can justly accuse<br/>
Their Maker, or their making, or their fate,<br/>
As if predestination over-rul'd<br/>
Their will dispos'd by absolute decree<br/>
Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed<br/>
Their own revolt, not I; if I foreknew,<br/>
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,<br/>
Which had no less proved certain unforeknown.<br/>
So without least impulse or shadow of fate,<br/>
Or aught by me immutably foreseen,<br/>
They trespass, authors to themselves in all<br/>
Both what they judge, and what they choose; for so<br/>
I form'd them free: and free they must remain,<br/>
Till they enthrall themselves; I else must change<br/>
Their nature, and revoke the high decree<br/>
Unchangeable, eternal, which ordain'd<br/>
Their freedom: they themselves ordain'd their fall.<br/>
The first sort by their own suggestion fell,<br/>
Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls, deceiv'd<br/>
By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,<br/>
The other none: In mercy and justice both,<br/>
Through Heaven and Earth, so shall my glory excel;<br/>
But Mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine.<br/>
Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd<br/>
All Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect<br/>
Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd.<br/>
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen<br/>
Most glorious; in him all his Father shone<br/>
Substantially express'd; and in his face<br/>
Divine compassion visibly appear'd,<br/>
Love without end, and without measure grace,<br/>
Which uttering, thus he to his Father spake.<br/>
O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd<br/>
Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;<br/>
For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol<br/>
Thy praises, with the innumerable sound<br/>
Of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne<br/>
Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest.<br/>
For should Man finally be lost, should Man,<br/>
Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest son,<br/>
Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd<br/>
With his own folly? that be from thee far,<br/>
That far be from thee, Father, who art judge<br/>
Of all things made, and judgest only right.<br/>
Or shall the Adversary thus obtain<br/>
His end, and frustrate thine? shall he fulfill<br/>
His malice, and thy goodness bring to nought,<br/>
Or proud return, though to his heavier doom,<br/>
Yet with revenge accomplish'd, and to Hell<br/>
Draw after him the whole race of mankind,<br/>
By him corrupted? or wilt thou thyself<br/>
Abolish thy creation, and unmake<br/>
For him, what for thy glory thou hast made?<br/>
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both<br/>
Be question'd and blasphem'd without defence.<br/>
To whom the great Creator thus replied.<br/>
O son, in whom my soul hath chief delight,<br/>
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone.<br/>
My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,<br/>
All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all<br/>
As my eternal purpose hath decreed;<br/>
Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will;<br/>
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me<br/>
Freely vouchsaf'd; once more I will renew<br/>
His lapsed powers, though forfeit; and enthrall'd<br/>
By sin to foul exorbitant desires;<br/>
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand<br/>
On even ground against his mortal foe;<br/>
By me upheld, that he may know how frail<br/>
His fallen condition is, and to me owe<br/>
All his deliverance, and to none but me.<br/>
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace,<br/>
Elect above the rest; so is my will:<br/>
The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warn'd<br/>
Their sinful state, and to appease betimes<br/>
The incensed Deity, while offer'd grace<br/>
Invites; for I will clear their senses dark,<br/>
What may suffice, and soften stony hearts<br/>
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.<br/>
To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,<br/>
Though but endeavour'd with sincere intent,<br/>
Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.<br/>
And I will place within them as a guide,<br/>
My umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear,<br/>
Light after light, well us'd, they shall attain,<br/>
And to the end, persisting, safe arrive.<br/>
This my long sufferance, and my day of grace,<br/>
They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;<br/>
But hard be harden'd, blind be blinded more,<br/>
That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;<br/>
And none but such from mercy I exclude.<br/>
But yet all is not done; Man disobeying,<br/>
Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins<br/>
Against the high supremacy of Heaven,<br/>
Affecting God-head, and, so losing all,<br/>
To expiate his treason hath nought left,<br/>
But to destruction sacred and devote,<br/>
He, with his whole posterity, must die,<br/>
Die he or justice must; unless for him<br/>
Some other able, and as willing, pay<br/>
The rigid satisfaction, death for death.<br/>
Say, heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love?<br/>
Which of you will be mortal, to redeem<br/>
Man's mortal crime, and just the unjust to save?<br/>
Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?<br/>
He ask'd, but all the heavenly quire stood mute,<br/>
And silence was in Heaven: on Man's behalf<br/>
Patron or intercessour none appear'd,<br/>
Much less that durst upon his own head draw<br/>
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.<br/>
And now without redemption all mankind<br/>
Must have been lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell<br/>
By doom severe, had not the Son of God,<br/>
In whom the fulness dwells of love divine,<br/>
His dearest mediation thus renew'd.<br/>
Father, thy word is past, Man shall find grace;<br/>
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,<br/>
The speediest of thy winged messengers,<br/>
To visit all thy creatures, and to all<br/>
Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought?<br/>
Happy for Man, so coming; he her aid<br/>
Can never seek, once dead in sins, and lost;<br/>
Atonement for himself, or offering meet,<br/>
Indebted and undone, hath none to bring;<br/>
Behold me then: me for him, life for life<br/>
I offer: on me let thine anger fall;<br/>
Account me Man; I for his sake will leave<br/>
Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee<br/>
Freely put off, and for him lastly die<br/>
Well pleased; on me let Death wreak all his rage.<br/>
Under his gloomy power I shall not long<br/>
Lie vanquished. Thou hast given me to possess<br/>
Life in myself for ever; by thee I live;<br/>
Though now to Death I yield, and am his due,<br/>
All that of me can die, yet, that debt paid,<br/>
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave<br/>
His prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul<br/>
For ever with corruption there to dwell;<br/>
But I shall rise victorious, and subdue<br/>
My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil.<br/>
Death his death's wound shall then receive, and stoop<br/>
Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed;<br/>
I through the ample air in triumph high<br/>
Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell, and show<br/>
The powers of darkness bound. Thou, at the sight<br/>
Pleased, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,<br/>
While, by thee raised, I ruin all my foes;<br/>
Death last, and with his carcase glut the grave;<br/>
Then, with the multitude of my redeemed,<br/>
Shall enter Heaven, long absent, and return,<br/>
Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud<br/>
Of anger shall remain, but peace assured<br/>
And reconcilement: wrath shall be no more<br/>
Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words here ended; but his meek aspect<br/>
Silent yet spake, and breathed immortal love<br/>
To mortal men, above which only shone<br/>
Filial obedience: as a sacrifice<br/>
Glad to be offered, he attends the will<br/>
Of his great Father. Admiration seized<br/>
All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend,<br/>
Wondering; but soon th' Almighty thus replied:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace<br/>
Found out for mankind under wrath, O thou<br/>
My sole complacence! Well thou know'st how dear<br/>
To me are all my works; nor Man the least,<br/>
Though last created, that for him I spare<br/>
Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,<br/>
By losing thee a while, the whole race lost.<br/>
Thou, therefore, whom thou only canst redeem,<br/>
Their nature also to thy nature join;<br/>
And be thyself Man among men on Earth,<br/>
Made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed,<br/>
By wondrous birth; be thou in Adam's room<br/>
The head of all mankind, though Adam's son.<br/>
As in him perish all men, so in thee,<br/>
As from a second root, shall be restored<br/>
As many as are restored, without thee none.<br/>
His crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit,<br/>
Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce<br/>
Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,<br/>
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee<br/>
Receive new life. So Man, as is most just,<br/>
Shall satisfy for Man, be judged and die,<br/>
And dying rise, and rising with him raise<br/>
His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life.<br/>
So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate,<br/>
Giving to death, and dying to redeem,<br/>
So dearly to redeem what hellish hate<br/>
So easily destroyed, and still destroys<br/>
In those who, when they may, accept not grace.<br/>
Nor shalt thou, by descending to assume<br/>
Man's nature, lessen or degrade thine own.<br/>
Because thou hast, though throned in highest bliss<br/>
Equal to God, and equally enjoying<br/>
God-like fruition, quitted all, to save<br/>
A world from utter loss, and hast been found<br/>
By merit more than birthright Son of God,<br/>
Found worthiest to be so by being good,<br/>
Far more than great or high; because in thee<br/>
Love hath abounded more than glory abounds;<br/>
Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt<br/>
With thee thy manhood also to this throne:<br/>
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign<br/>
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,<br/>
Anointed universal King; all power<br/>
I give thee; reign for ever, and assume<br/>
Thy merits; under thee, as head supreme,<br/>
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce:<br/>
All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide<br/>
In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell.<br/>
When thou, attended gloriously from Heaven,<br/>
Shalt in the sky appear, and from thee send<br/>
The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaim<br/>
Thy dread tribunal; forthwith from all winds,<br/>
The living, and forthwith the cited dead<br/>
Of all past ages, to the general doom<br/>
Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep.<br/>
Then, all thy saints assembled, thou shalt judge<br/>
Bad Men and Angels; they, arraigned, shall sink<br/>
Beneath thy sentence; Hell, her numbers full,<br/>
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while<br/>
The world shall burn, and from her ashes spring<br/>
New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell,<br/>
And, after all their tribulations long,<br/>
See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,<br/>
With joy and peace triumphing, and fair truth.<br/>
Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by,<br/>
For regal scepter then no more shall need,<br/>
God shall be all in all. But, all ye Gods,<br/>
Adore him, who to compass all this dies;<br/>
Adore the Son, and honour him as me.<br/>
No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all<br/>
The multitude of Angels, with a shout<br/>
Loud as from numbers without number, sweet<br/>
As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung<br/>
With jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled<br/>
The eternal regions: Lowly reverent<br/>
Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground<br/>
With solemn adoration down they cast<br/>
Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold;<br/>
Immortal amarant, a flower which once<br/>
In Paradise, fast by the tree of life,<br/>
Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence<br/>
To Heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows,<br/>
And flowers aloft shading the fount of life,<br/>
And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven<br/>
Rolls o'er Elysian flowers her amber stream;<br/>
With these that never fade the Spirits elect<br/>
Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams;<br/>
Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright<br/>
Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone,<br/>
Impurpled with celestial roses smiled.<br/>
Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took,<br/>
Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side<br/>
Like quivers hung, and with preamble sweet<br/>
Of charming symphony they introduce<br/>
Their sacred song, and waken raptures high;<br/>
No voice exempt, no voice but well could join<br/>
Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.<br/>
Thee, Father, first they sung Omnipotent,<br/>
Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,<br/>
Eternal King; the Author of all being,<br/>
Fountain of light, thyself invisible<br/>
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st<br/>
Throned inaccessible, but when thou shadest<br/>
The full blaze of thy beams, and, through a cloud<br/>
Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine,<br/>
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,<br/>
Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim<br/>
Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.<br/>
Thee next they sang of all creation first,<br/>
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,<br/>
In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud<br/>
Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,<br/>
Whom else no creature can behold; on thee<br/>
Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides,<br/>
Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.<br/>
He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein<br/>
By thee created; and by thee threw down<br/>
The aspiring Dominations: Thou that day<br/>
Thy Father's dreadful thunder didst not spare,<br/>
Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels, that shook<br/>
Heaven's everlasting frame, while o'er the necks<br/>
Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed.<br/>
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim<br/>
Thee only extolled, Son of thy Father's might,<br/>
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,<br/>
Not so on Man: Him through their malice fallen,<br/>
Father of mercy and grace, thou didst not doom<br/>
So strictly, but much more to pity incline:<br/>
No sooner did thy dear and only Son<br/>
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man<br/>
So strictly, but much more to pity inclined,<br/>
He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife<br/>
Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned,<br/>
Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat<br/>
Second to thee, offered himself to die<br/>
For Man's offence. O unexampled love,<br/>
Love no where to be found less than Divine!<br/>
Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men! Thy name<br/>
Shall be the copious matter of my song<br/>
Henceforth, and never shall my heart thy praise<br/>
Forget, nor from thy Father's praise disjoin.<br/>
Thus they in Heaven, above the starry sphere,<br/>
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.<br/>
Mean while upon the firm opacous globe<br/>
Of this round world, whose first convex divides<br/>
The luminous inferiour orbs, enclosed<br/>
From Chaos, and the inroad of Darkness old,<br/>
Satan alighted walks: A globe far off<br/>
It seemed, now seems a boundless continent<br/>
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night<br/>
Starless exposed, and ever-threatening storms<br/>
Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky;<br/>
Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven,<br/>
Though distant far, some small reflection gains<br/>
Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud:<br/>
Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.<br/>
As when a vultur on Imaus bred,<br/>
Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,<br/>
Dislodging from a region scarce of prey<br/>
To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids,<br/>
On hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs<br/>
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;<br/>
But in his way lights on the barren plains<br/>
Of Sericana, where Chineses drive<br/>
With sails and wind their cany waggons light:<br/>
So, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend<br/>
Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey;<br/>
Alone, for other creature in this place,<br/>
Living or lifeless, to be found was none;<br/>
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth<br/>
Up hither like aereal vapours flew<br/>
Of all things transitory and vain, when sin<br/>
With vanity had filled the works of men:<br/>
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things<br/>
Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame,<br/>
Or happiness in this or the other life;<br/>
All who have their reward on earth, the fruits<br/>
Of painful superstition and blind zeal,<br/>
Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find<br/>
Fit retribution, empty as their deeds;<br/>
All the unaccomplished works of Nature's hand,<br/>
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,<br/>
Dissolved on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,<br/>
Till final dissolution, wander here;<br/>
Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed;<br/>
Those argent fields more likely habitants,<br/>
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold<br/>
Betwixt the angelical and human kind.<br/>
Hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born<br/>
First from the ancient world those giants came<br/>
With many a vain exploit, though then renowned:<br/>
The builders next of Babel on the plain<br/>
Of Sennaar, and still with vain design,<br/>
New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:<br/>
Others came single; he, who, to be deemed<br/>
A God, leaped fondly into Aetna flames,<br/>
Empedocles; and he, who, to enjoy<br/>
Plato's Elysium, leaped into the sea,<br/>
Cleombrotus; and many more too long,<br/>
Embryos, and idiots, eremites, and friars<br/>
White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery.<br/>
Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek<br/>
In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven;<br/>
And they, who to be sure of Paradise,<br/>
Dying, put on the weeds of Dominick,<br/>
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised;<br/>
They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,<br/>
And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs<br/>
The trepidation talked, and that first moved;<br/>
And now Saint Peter at Heaven's wicket seems<br/>
To wait them with his keys, and now at foot<br/>
Of Heaven's ascent they lift their feet, when lo<br/>
A violent cross wind from either coast<br/>
Blows them transverse, ten thousand leagues awry<br/>
Into the devious air: Then might ye see<br/>
Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost<br/>
And fluttered into rags; then reliques, beads,<br/>
Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls,<br/>
The sport of winds: All these, upwhirled aloft,<br/>
Fly o'er the backside of the world far off<br/>
Into a Limbo large and broad, since called<br/>
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown<br/>
Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod.<br/>
All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed,<br/>
And long he wandered, till at last a gleam<br/>
Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste<br/>
His travelled steps: far distant he descries<br/>
Ascending by degrees magnificent<br/>
Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high;<br/>
At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared<br/>
The work as of a kingly palace-gate,<br/>
With frontispiece of diamond and gold<br/>
Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems<br/>
The portal shone, inimitable on earth<br/>
By model, or by shading pencil, drawn.<br/>
These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw<br/>
Angels ascending and descending, bands<br/>
Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled<br/>
To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz<br/>
Dreaming by night under the open sky<br/>
And waking cried, This is the gate of Heaven.<br/>
Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood<br/>
There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes<br/>
Viewless; and underneath a bright sea flowed<br/>
Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon<br/>
Who after came from earth, failing arrived<br/>
Wafted by Angels, or flew o'er the lake<br/>
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds.<br/>
The stairs were then let down, whether to dare<br/>
The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate<br/>
His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss:<br/>
Direct against which opened from beneath,<br/>
Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise,<br/>
A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide,<br/>
Wider by far than that of after-times<br/>
Over mount Sion, and, though that were large,<br/>
Over the Promised Land to God so dear;<br/>
By which, to visit oft those happy tribes,<br/>
On high behests his angels to and fro<br/>
Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard<br/>
From Paneas, the fount of Jordan's flood,<br/>
To Beersaba, where the Holy Land<br/>
Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore;<br/>
So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set<br/>
To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave.<br/>
Satan from hence, now on the lower stair,<br/>
That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate,<br/>
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view<br/>
Of all this world at once. As when a scout,<br/>
Through dark and desert ways with peril gone<br/>
All night; at last by break of cheerful dawn<br/>
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill,<br/>
Which to his eye discovers unaware<br/>
The goodly prospect of some foreign land<br/>
First seen, or some renowned metropolis<br/>
With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned,<br/>
Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams:<br/>
Such wonder seised, though after Heaven seen,<br/>
The Spirit malign, but much more envy seised,<br/>
At sight of all this world beheld so fair.<br/>
Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood<br/>
So high above the circling canopy<br/>
Of night's extended shade,) from eastern point<br/>
Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears<br/>
Andromeda far off Atlantick seas<br/>
Beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole<br/>
He views in breadth, and without longer pause<br/>
Down right into the world's first region throws<br/>
His flight precipitant, and winds with ease<br/>
Through the pure marble air his oblique way<br/>
Amongst innumerable stars, that shone<br/>
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds;<br/>
Or other worlds they seemed, or happy isles,<br/>
Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old,<br/>
Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales,<br/>
Thrice happy isles; but who dwelt happy there<br/>
He staid not to inquire: Above them all<br/>
The golden sun, in splendour likest Heaven,<br/>
Allured his eye; thither his course he bends<br/>
Through the calm firmament, (but up or down,<br/>
By center, or eccentrick, hard to tell,<br/>
Or longitude,) where the great luminary<br/>
Aloof the vulgar constellations thick,<br/>
That from his lordly eye keep distance due,<br/>
Dispenses light from far; they, as they move<br/>
Their starry dance in numbers that compute<br/>
Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp<br/>
Turn swift their various motions, or are turned<br/>
By his magnetick beam, that gently warms<br/>
The universe, and to each inward part<br/>
With gentle penetration, though unseen,<br/>
Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep;<br/>
So wonderously was set his station bright.<br/>
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps<br/>
Astronomer in the sun's lucent orb<br/>
Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw.<br/>
The place he found beyond expression bright,<br/>
Compared with aught on earth, metal or stone;<br/>
Not all parts like, but all alike informed<br/>
With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire;<br/>
If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear;<br/>
If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite,<br/>
Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone<br/>
In Aaron's breast-plate, and a stone besides<br/>
Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen,<br/>
That stone, or like to that which here below<br/>
Philosophers in vain so long have sought,<br/>
In vain, though by their powerful art they bind<br/>
Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound<br/>
In various shapes old Proteus from the sea,<br/>
Drained through a limbeck to his native form.<br/>
What wonder then if fields and regions here<br/>
Breathe forth Elixir pure, and rivers run<br/>
Potable gold, when with one virtuous touch<br/>
The arch-chemick sun, so far from us remote,<br/>
Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed,<br/>
Here in the dark so many precious things<br/>
Of colour glorious, and effect so rare?<br/>
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met<br/>
Undazzled; far and wide his eye commands;<br/>
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,<br/>
But all sun-shine, as when his beams at noon<br/>
Culminate from the equator, as they now<br/>
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round<br/>
Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air,<br/>
No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray<br/>
To objects distant far, whereby he soon<br/>
Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,<br/>
The same whom John saw also in the sun:<br/>
His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;<br/>
Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar<br/>
Circled his head, nor less his locks behind<br/>
Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings<br/>
Lay waving round; on some great charge employed<br/>
He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.<br/>
Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope<br/>
To find who might direct his wandering flight<br/>
To Paradise, the happy seat of Man,<br/>
His journey's end and our beginning woe.<br/>
But first he casts to change his proper shape,<br/>
Which else might work him danger or delay:<br/>
And now a stripling Cherub he appears,<br/>
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face<br/>
Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb<br/>
Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned:<br/>
Under a coronet his flowing hair<br/>
In curls on either cheek played; wings he wore<br/>
Of many a coloured plume, sprinkled with gold;<br/>
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held<br/>
Before his decent steps a silver wand.<br/>
He drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright,<br/>
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned,<br/>
Admonished by his ear, and straight was known<br/>
The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven<br/>
Who in God's presence, nearest to his throne,<br/>
Stand ready at command, and are his eyes<br/>
That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth<br/>
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,<br/>
O'er sea and land: him Satan thus accosts.<br/>
Uriel, for thou of those seven Spirits that stand<br/>
In sight of God's high throne, gloriously bright,<br/>
The first art wont his great authentick will<br/>
Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring,<br/>
Where all his sons thy embassy attend;<br/>
And here art likeliest by supreme decree<br/>
Like honour to obtain, and as his eye<br/>
To visit oft this new creation round;<br/>
Unspeakable desire to see, and know<br/>
All these his wonderous works, but chiefly Man,<br/>
His chief delight and favour, him for whom<br/>
All these his works so wonderous he ordained,<br/>
Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim<br/>
Alone thus wandering. Brightest Seraph, tell<br/>
In which of all these shining orbs hath Man<br/>
His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,<br/>
But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell;<br/>
That I may find him, and with secret gaze<br/>
Or open admiration him behold,<br/>
On whom the great Creator hath bestowed<br/>
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured;<br/>
That both in him and all things, as is meet,<br/>
The universal Maker we may praise;<br/>
Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes<br/>
To deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss,<br/>
Created this new happy race of Men<br/>
To serve him better: Wise are all his ways.<br/>
So spake the false dissembler unperceived;<br/>
For neither Man nor Angel can discern<br/>
Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks<br/>
Invisible, except to God alone,<br/>
By his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth:<br/>
And oft, though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps<br/>
At wisdom's gate, and to simplicity<br/>
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill<br/>
Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguiled<br/>
Uriel, though regent of the sun, and held<br/>
The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven;<br/>
Who to the fraudulent impostor foul,<br/>
In his uprightness, answer thus returned.<br/>
Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know<br/>
The works of God, thereby to glorify<br/>
The great Work-master, leads to no excess<br/>
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise<br/>
The more it seems excess, that led thee hither<br/>
From thy empyreal mansion thus alone,<br/>
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps,<br/>
Contented with report, hear only in Heaven:<br/>
For wonderful indeed are all his works,<br/>
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all<br/>
Had in remembrance always with delight;<br/>
But what created mind can comprehend<br/>
Their number, or the wisdom infinite<br/>
That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep?<br/>
I saw when at his word the formless mass,<br/>
This world's material mould, came to a heap:<br/>
Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar<br/>
Stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined;<br/>
Till at his second bidding Darkness fled,<br/>
Light shone, and order from disorder sprung:<br/>
Swift to their several quarters hasted then<br/>
The cumbrous elements, earth, flood, air, fire;<br/>
And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven<br/>
Flew upward, spirited with various forms,<br/>
That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars<br/>
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;<br/>
Each had his place appointed, each his course;<br/>
The rest in circuit walls this universe.<br/>
Look downward on that globe, whose hither side<br/>
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;<br/>
That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light<br/>
His day, which else, as the other hemisphere,<br/>
Night would invade; but there the neighbouring moon<br/>
(So call that opposite fair star) her aid<br/>
Timely interposes, and her monthly round<br/>
Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven,<br/>
With borrowed light her countenance triform<br/>
Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth,<br/>
And in her pale dominion checks the night.<br/>
That spot, to which I point, is Paradise,<br/>
Adam's abode; those lofty shades, his bower.<br/>
Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.<br/>
Thus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low,<br/>
As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven,<br/>
Where honour due and reverence none neglects,<br/>
Took leave, and toward the coast of earth beneath,<br/>
Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped success,<br/>
Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel;<br/>
Nor staid, till on Niphates' top he lights.

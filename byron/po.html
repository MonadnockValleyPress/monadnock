<h1>Stanzas to the Po</h1>
<h2>by Lord Byron</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
River, that rollest by the ancient walls,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where dwells the Lady of my love, when she<br/>
Walks by thy brink, and there perchance recalls<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint and fleeting memory of me:
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
What if thy deep and ample stream should be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mirror of my heart, where she may read<br/>
The thousand thoughts I now betray to thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild as thy wave, and headlong as thy speed!
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
What do I say &mdash; a mirror of my heart?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not thy waters sweeping, dark, and strong?<br/>
Such as my feelings were and are, thou art;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such as thou art were my passions long.
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
Time may have somewhat tamed them, &mdash; not for ever;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou overflow'st thy banks, and not for aye<br/>
Thy bosom overboils, congenial river!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy floods subside, and mine have sunk away:
</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>
But left long wrecks behind, and now again,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne in our old unchanged career, we move:<br/>
Thou tendest wildly onwards to the main,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I &mdash; to loving one I should not love.
</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p>
The current I behold will sweep beneath<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her native walls, and murmur at her feet;<br/>
Her eyes will look on thee, when she shall breathe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight air, unharmed by summer's heat.
</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>
She will look on thee, &mdash; I have looked on thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of that thought: and, from that moment, ne'er<br/>
Thy waters could I dream of, name, or see,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the inseparable sigh for her!
</p>
<h3>VIII.</h3>
<p>
Her bright eyes will be imaged in thy stream, &mdash; <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! they will meet the wave I gaze on now:<br/>
Mine cannot witness, even in a dream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That happy wave repass me in its flow!
</p>
<h3>IX.</h3>
<p>
The wave that bears my tears returns no more:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will she return by whom that wave shall sweep? &mdash; <br/>
Both tread thy banks, both wander on thy shore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I by thy source, she by the dark-blue deep.
</p>
<h3>X.</h3>
<p>
But that which keepeth us apart is not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance, nor depth of wave, nor space of earth,<br/>
But the distraction of a various lot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As various as the climates of our birth.
</p>
<h3>XI.</h3>
<p>
A stranger loves the Lady of the land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born far beyond the mountains, but his blood<br/>
Is all meridian, as if never fanned<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the black wind that chills the polar flood.
</p>
<h3>XII.</h3>
<p>
My blood is all meridian; were it not,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had not left my clime, nor should I be,<br/>
In spite of tortures, ne'er to be forgot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slave again of love, &mdash; at least of thee.
</p>
<h3>XIII.</h3>
<p>
'Tis vain to struggle &mdash; let me perish young &mdash; <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live as I lived, and love as I have loved;<br/>
To dust if I return, from dust I sprung,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, at least, my heart can ne'er be moved.

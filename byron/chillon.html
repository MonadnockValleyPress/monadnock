<h1>The Prisoner of Chillon</h1>
<h2>by Lord Byron</h2>
<p>
My hair is grey, but not with years,<br/>
Nor grew it white<br/>
In a single night,<br/>
As men's have grown from sudden fears:<br/>
My limbs are bow'd, though not with toil,<br/>
But rusted with a vile repose,<br/>
For they have been a dungeon's spoil,<br/>
And mine has been the fate of those<br/>
To whom the goodly earth and air<br/>
Are bann'd, and barr'd&mdash;forbidden fare;<br/>
But this was for my father's faith<br/>
I suffer'd chains and courted death;<br/>
That father perish'd at the stake<br/>
For tenets he would not forsake;<br/>
And for the same his lineal race<br/>
In darkness found a dwelling place;<br/>
We were seven&mdash;who now are one,<br/>
Six in youth, and one in age,<br/>
Finish'd as they had begun,<br/>
Proud of Persecution's rage;<br/>
One in fire, and two in field,<br/>
Their belief with blood have seal'd,<br/>
Dying as their father died,<br/>
For the God their foes denied;&mdash;<br/>
Three were in a dungeon cast,<br/>
Of whom this wreck is left the last.
</p>
<p>
There are seven pillars of Gothic mould,<br/>
In Chillon's dungeons deep and old,<br/>
There are seven columns, massy and grey,<br/>
Dim with a dull imprison'd ray,<br/>
A sunbeam which hath lost its way,<br/>
And through the crevice and the cleft<br/>
Of the thick wall is fallen and left;<br/>
Creeping o'er the floor so damp,<br/>
Like a marsh's meteor lamp:<br/>
And in each pillar there is a ring,<br/>
And in each ring there is a chain;<br/>
That iron is a cankering thing,<br/>
For in these limbs its teeth remain,<br/>
With marks that will not wear away,<br/>
Till I have done with this new day,<br/>
Which now is painful to these eyes,<br/>
Which have not seen the sun so rise<br/>
For years&mdash;I cannot count them o'er,<br/>
I lost their long and heavy score<br/>
When my last brother droop'd and died,<br/>
And I lay living by his side.
</p>
<p>
They chain'd us each to a column stone,<br/>
And we were three&mdash;yet, each alone;<br/>
We could not move a single pace,<br/>
We could not see each other's face,<br/>
But with that pale and livid light<br/>
That made us strangers in our sight:<br/>
And thus together&mdash;yet apart,<br/>
Fetter'd in hand, but join'd in heart,<br/>
'Twas still some solace in the dearth<br/>
Of the pure elements of earth,<br/>
To hearken to each other's speech,<br/>
And each turn comforter to each<br/>
With some new hope, or legend old,<br/>
Or song heroically bold;<br/>
But even these at length grew cold.<br/>
Our voices took a dreary tone,<br/>
An echo of the dungeon stone,<br/>
A grating sound, not full and free,<br/>
As they of yore were wont to be:<br/>
It might be fancy&mdash;but to me<br/>
They never sounded like our own.
</p>
<p>
I was the eldest of the three<br/>
And to uphold and cheer the rest<br/>
I ought to do&mdash;and did my best&mdash;<br/>
And each did well in his degree.<br/>
The youngest, whom my father loved,<br/>
Because our mother's brow was given<br/>
To him, with eyes as blue as heaven&mdash;<br/>
For him my soul was sorely moved:<br/>
And truly might it be distress'd<br/>
To see such bird in such a nest;<br/>
For he was beautiful as day&mdash;<br/>
(When day was beautiful to me<br/>
As to young eagles, being free)&mdash;<br/>
A polar day, which will not see<br/>
A sunset till its summer's gone,<br/>
Its sleepless summer of long light,<br/>
The snow-clad offspring of the sun:<br/>
And thus he was as pure and bright,<br/>
And in his natural spirit gay,<br/>
With tears for nought but others' ills,<br/>
And then they flow'd like mountain rills,<br/>
Unless he could assuage the woe<br/>
Which he abhorr'd to view below.
</p>
<p>
The other was as pure of mind,<br/>
But form'd to combat with his kind;<br/>
Strong in his frame, and of a mood<br/>
Which 'gainst the world in war had stood,<br/>
And perish'd in the foremost rank<br/>
With joy:&mdash;but not in chains to pine:<br/>
His spirit wither'd with their clank,<br/>
I saw it silently decline&mdash;<br/>
And so perchance in sooth did mine:<br/>
But yet I forced it on to cheer<br/>
Those relics of a home so dear.<br/>
He was a hunter of the hills,<br/>
Had followed there the deer and wolf;<br/>
To him this dungeon was a gulf,<br/>
And fetter'd feet the worst of ills.
</p>
<p>
Lake Leman lies by Chillon's walls:<br/>
A thousand feet in depth below<br/>
Its massy waters meet and flow;<br/>
Thus much the fathom-line was sent<br/>
From Chillon's snow-white battlement,<br/>
Which round about the wave inthralls:<br/>
A double dungeon wall and wave<br/>
Have made&mdash;and like a living grave<br/>
Below the surface of the lake<br/>
The dark vault lies wherein we lay:<br/>
We heard it ripple night and day;<br/>
Sounding o'er our heads it knock'd;<br/>
And I have felt the winter's spray<br/>
Wash through the bars when winds were high<br/>
And wanton in the happy sky;<br/>
And then the very rock hath rock'd,<br/>
And I have felt it shake, unshock'd,<br/>
Because I could have smiled to see<br/>
The death that would have set me free.
</p>
<p>
I said my nearer brother pined,<br/>
I said his mighty heart declined,<br/>
He loathed and put away his food;<br/>
It was not that 'twas coarse and rude,<br/>
For we were used to hunter's fare,<br/>
And for the like had little care:<br/>
The milk drawn from the mountain goat<br/>
Was changed for water from the moat,<br/>
Our bread was such as captives' tears<br/>
Have moisten'd many a thousand years,<br/>
Since man first pent his fellow men<br/>
Like brutes within an iron den;<br/>
But what were these to us or him?<br/>
These wasted not his heart or limb;<br/>
My brother's soul was of that mould<br/>
Which in a palace had grown cold,<br/>
Had his free breathing been denied<br/>
The range of the steep mountain's side;<br/>
But why delay the truth?&mdash;he died.<br/>
I saw, and could not hold his head,<br/>
Nor reach his dying hand&mdash;nor dead,&mdash;<br/>
Though hard I strove, but strove in vain,<br/>
To rend and gnash my bonds in twain.<br/>
He died&mdash;and they unlock'd his chain,<br/>
And scoop'd for him a shallow grave<br/>
Even from the cold earth of our cave.<br/>
I begg'd them, as a boon, to lay<br/>
His corse in dust whereon the day<br/>
Might shine&mdash;it was a foolish thought,<br/>
But then within my brain it wrought,<br/>
That even in death his freeborn breast<br/>
In such a dungeon could not rest.<br/>
I might have spared my idle prayer&mdash;<br/>
They coldly laugh'd&mdash;and laid him there:<br/>
The flat and turfless earth above<br/>
The being we so much did love;<br/>
His empty chain above it leant,<br/>
Such Murder's fitting monument!
</p>
<p>
But he, the favourite and the flower,<br/>
Most cherish'd since his natal hour,<br/>
His mother's image in fair face<br/>
The infant love of all his race<br/>
His martyr'd father's dearest thought,<br/>
My latest care, for whom I sought<br/>
To hoard my life, that his might be<br/>
Less wretched now, and one day free;<br/>
He, too, who yet had held untired<br/>
A spirit natural or inspired&mdash;<br/>
He, too, was struck, and day by day<br/>
Was wither'd on the stalk away.<br/>
Oh, God! it is a fearful thing<br/>
To see the human soul take wing<br/>
In any shape, in any mood:<br/>
I've seen it rushing forth in blood,<br/>
I've seen it on the breaking ocean<br/>
Strive with a swoln convulsive motion,<br/>
I've seen the sick and ghastly bed<br/>
Of Sin delirious with its dread:<br/>
But these were horrors&mdash;this was woe<br/>
Unmix'd with such&mdash;but sure and slow:<br/>
He faded, and so calm and meek,<br/>
So softly worn, so sweetly weak,<br/>
So tearless, yet so tender&mdash;kind,<br/>
And grieved for those he left behind;<br/>
With all the while a cheek whose bloom<br/>
Was as a mockery of the tomb<br/>
Whose tints as gently sunk away<br/>
As a departing rainbow's ray;<br/>
An eye of most transparent light,<br/>
That almost made the dungeon bright;<br/>
And not a word of murmur&mdash;not<br/>
A groan o'er his untimely lot,&mdash;<br/>
A little talk of better days,<br/>
A little hope my own to raise,<br/>
For I was sunk in silence&mdash;lost<br/>
In this last loss, of all the most;<br/>
And then the sighs he would suppress<br/>
Of fainting Nature's feebleness,<br/>
More slowly drawn, grew less and less:<br/>
I listen'd, but I could not hear;<br/>
I call'd, for I was wild with fear;<br/>
I knew 'twas hopeless, but my dread<br/>
Would not be thus admonish√®d;<br/>
I call'd, and thought I heard a sound&mdash;<br/>
I burst my chain with one strong bound,<br/>
And rushed to him:&mdash;I found him not,<br/>
I only stirred in this black spot,<br/>
I only lived, I only drew<br/>
The accursed breath of dungeon-dew;<br/>
The last, the sole, the dearest link<br/>
Between me and the eternal brink,<br/>
Which bound me to my failing race<br/>
Was broken in this fatal place.<br/>
One on the earth, and one beneath&mdash;<br/>
My brothers&mdash;both had ceased to breathe:<br/>
I took that hand which lay so still,<br/>
Alas! my own was full as chill;<br/>
I had not strength to stir, or strive,<br/>
But felt that I was still alive&mdash;<br/>
A frantic feeling, when we know<br/>
That what we love shall ne'er be so.<br/>
I know not why<br/>
I could not die,<br/>
I had no earthly hope&mdash;but faith,<br/>
And that forbade a selfish death.
</p>
<p>
What next befell me then and there<br/>
I know not well&mdash;I never knew&mdash;<br/>
First came the loss of light, and air,<br/>
And then of darkness too:<br/>
I had no thought, no feeling&mdash;none&mdash;<br/>
Among the stones I stood a stone,<br/>
And was, scarce conscious what I wist,<br/>
As shrubless crags within the mist;<br/>
For all was blank, and bleak, and grey;<br/>
It was not night&mdash;it was not day;<br/>
It was not even the dungeon-light,<br/>
So hateful to my heavy sight,<br/>
But vacancy absorbing space,<br/>
And fixedness&mdash;without a place;<br/>
There were no stars, no earth, no time,<br/>
No check, no change, no good, no crime<br/>
But silence, and a stirless breath<br/>
Which neither was of life nor death;<br/>
A sea of stagnant idleness,<br/>
Blind, boundless, mute, and motionless!<br/>
A light broke in upon my brain,&mdash;<br/>
It was the carol of a bird;<br/>
It ceased, and then it came again,<br/>
The sweetest song ear ever heard,<br/>
And mine was thankful till my eyes<br/>
Ran over with the glad surprise,<br/>
And they that moment could not see<br/>
I was the mate of misery;<br/>
But then by dull degrees came back<br/>
My senses to their wonted track;<br/>
I saw the dungeon walls and floor<br/>
Close slowly round me as before,<br/>
I saw the glimmer of the sun<br/>
Creeping as it before had done,<br/>
But through the crevice where it came<br/>
That bird was perch'd, as fond and tame,<br/>
And tamer than upon the tree;<br/>
A lovely bird, with azure wings,<br/>
And song that said a thousand things,<br/>
And seemed to say them all for me!<br/>
I never saw its like before,<br/>
I ne'er shall see its likeness more:<br/>
It seem'd like me to want a mate,<br/>
But was not half so desolate,<br/>
And it was come to love me when<br/>
None lived to love me so again,<br/>
And cheering from my dungeon's brink,<br/>
Had brought me back to feel and think.<br/>
I know not if it late were free,<br/>
Or broke its cage to perch on mine,<br/>
But knowing well captivity,<br/>
Sweet bird! I could not wish for thine!<br/>
Or if it were, in wing√®d guise,<br/>
A visitant from Paradise;<br/>
For&mdash;Heaven forgive that thought! the while<br/>
Which made me both to weep and smile&mdash;<br/>
I sometimes deem'd that it might be<br/>
My brother's soul come down to me;<br/>
But then at last away it flew,<br/>
And then 'twas mortal well I knew,<br/>
For he would never thus have flown&mdash;<br/>
And left me twice so doubly lone,&mdash;<br/>
Lone as the corse within its shroud,<br/>
Lone as a solitary cloud,<br/>
A single cloud on a sunny day,<br/>
While all the rest of heaven is clear,<br/>
A frown upon the atmosphere,<br/>
That hath no business to appear<br/>
When skies are blue, and earth is gay.
</p>
<p>
A kind of change came in my fate,<br/>
My keepers grew compassionate;<br/>
I know not what had made them so,<br/>
They were inured to sights of woe,<br/>
But so it was:&mdash;my broken chain<br/>
With links unfasten'd did remain,<br/>
And it was liberty to stride<br/>
Along my cell from side to side,<br/>
And up and down, and then athwart,<br/>
And tread it over every part;<br/>
And round the pillars one by one,<br/>
Returning where my walk begun,<br/>
Avoiding only, as I trod,<br/>
My brothers' graves without a sod;<br/>
For if I thought with heedless tread<br/>
My step profaned their lowly bed,<br/>
My breath came gaspingly and thick,<br/>
And my crush'd heart felt blind and sick.<br/>
I made a footing in the wall,<br/>
It was not therefrom to escape,<br/>
For I had buried one and all,<br/>
Who loved me in a human shape;<br/>
And the whole earth would henceforth be<br/>
A wider prison unto me:<br/>
No child, no sire, no kin had I,<br/>
No partner in my misery;<br/>
I thought of this, and I was glad,<br/>
For thought of them had made me mad;<br/>
But I was curious to ascend<br/>
To my barr'd windows, and to bend<br/>
Once more, upon the mountains high,<br/>
The quiet of a loving eye.
</p>
<p>
I saw them&mdash;and they were the same,<br/>
They were not changed like me in frame;<br/>
I saw their thousand years of snow<br/>
On high&mdash;their wide long lake below,<br/>
And the blue Rhone in fullest flow;<br/>
I heard the torrents leap and gush<br/>
O'er channell'd rock and broken bush;<br/>
I saw the white-wall'd distant town,<br/>
And whiter sails go skimming down;<br/>
And then there was a little isle,<br/>
Which in my very face did smile,<br/>
The only one in view;<br/>
A small green isle, it seem'd no more,<br/>
Scarce broader than my dungeon floor,<br/>
But in it there were three tall trees,<br/>
And o'er it blew the mountain breeze,<br/>
And by it there were waters flowing,<br/>
And on it there were young flowers growing,<br/>
Of gentle breath and hue.<br/>
The fish swam by the castle wall,<br/>
And they seem'd joyous each and all;<br/>
The eagle rode the rising blast,<br/>
Methought he never flew so fast<br/>
As then to me he seem'd to fly;<br/>
And then new tears came in my eye,<br/>
And I felt troubled&mdash;and would fain<br/>
I had not left my recent chain;<br/>
And when I did descend again,<br/>
The darkness of my dim abode<br/>
Fell on me as a heavy load;<br/>
It was as is a new-dug grave,<br/>
Closing o'er one we sought to save,&mdash;<br/>
And yet my glance, too much opprest,<br/>
Had almost need of such a rest.
</p>
<p>
It might be months, or years, or days&mdash;<br/>
I kept no count, I took no note&mdash;<br/>
I had no hope my eyes to raise,<br/>
And clear them of their dreary mote;<br/>
At last men came to set me free;<br/>
I ask'd not why, and reck'd not where;<br/>
It was at length the same to me,<br/>
Fetter'd or fetterless to be,<br/>
I learn'd to love despair.<br/>
And thus when they appear'd at last,<br/>
And all my bonds aside were cast,<br/>
These heavy walls to me had grown<br/>
A hermitage&mdash;and all my own!<br/>
And half I felt as they were come<br/>
To tear me from a second home:<br/>
With spiders I had friendship made<br/>
And watch'd them in their sullen trade,<br/>
Had seen the mice by moonlight play,<br/>
And why should I feel less than they?<br/>
We were all inmates of one place,<br/>
And I, the monarch of each race,<br/>
Had power to kill&mdash;yet, strange to tell!<br/>
In quiet we had learn'd to dwell;<br/>
My very chains and I grew friends,<br/>
So much a long communion tends<br/>
To make us what we are:&mdash;even I<br/>
Regain'd my freedom with a sigh.

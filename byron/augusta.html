<h1>Epistle to Augusta</h1>
<h2>by Lord Byron</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
My Sister! my sweet Sister! if a name<br/>
Dearer and purer were, it should be thine.<br/>
Mountains and seas divide us, but I claim<br/>
No tears, but tenderness to answer mine:<br/>
Go where I will, to me thou art the same &mdash; <br/>
A loved regret which I would not resign.<br/>
There yet are two things in my destiny, &mdash; <br/>
A world to roam through, and a home with thee.
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
The first were nothing &mdash; had I still the last,<br/>
It were the haven of my happiness;<br/>
But other claims and other ties thou hast,<br/>
And mine is not the wish to make them less.<br/>
A strange doom is thy father's son's, and past<br/>
Recalling, as it lies beyond redress;<br/>
Reversed for him our grandsire's fate of yore, &mdash; <br/>
He had no rest at sea, nor I on shore.
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
If my inheritance of storms hath been<br/>
In other elements, and on the rocks<br/>
Of perils, overlooked or unforeseen,<br/>
I have sustained my share of worldly shocks,<br/>
The fault was mine; nor do I seek to screen<br/>
My errors with defensive paradox;<br/>
I have been cunning in mine overthrow,<br/>
The careful pilot of my proper woe.
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
Mine were my faults, and mine be their reward.<br/>
My whole life was a contest, since the day<br/>
That gave me being, gave me that which marred<br/>
The gift, &mdash; a fate, or will, that walked astray;<br/>
And I at times have found the struggle hard,<br/>
And thought of shaking off my bonds of clay:<br/>
But now I fain would for a time survive,<br/>
If but to see what next can well arrive.
</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>
Kingdoms and Empires in my little day<br/>
I have outlived, and yet I am not old;<br/>
And when I look on this, the petty spray<br/>
Of my own years of trouble, which have rolled<br/>
Like a wild bay of breakers, melts away:<br/>
Something &mdash; I know not what &mdash; does still uphold<br/>
A spirit of slight patience; &mdash; not in vain,<br/>
Even for its own sake, do we purchase Pain.
</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p>
Perhaps the workings of defiance stir<br/>
Within me &mdash; or, peihaps, a cold despair<br/>
Brought on when ills habitually recur, &mdash; <br/>
Perhaps a kinder clime, or purer air,<br/>
(For even to this may change of soul refer,<br/>
And with light armour we may learn to bear,)<br/>
Have taught me a strange quiet, which was not<br/>
The chief companion of a calmer lot.
</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>
I feel almost at times as I have felt<br/>
In happy childhood; trees, and flowers, and brooks,<br/>
Which do remember me of where I dwelt,<br/>
Ere my young mind was sacrificed to books,<br/>
Come as of yore upon me, and can melt<br/>
My heart with recognition of their looks;<br/>
And even at moments I could think I see<br/>
Some living thing to love &mdash; but none like thee.
</p>
<h3>VIII.</h3>
<p>
Here are the Alpine landscapes which create<br/>
A fund for contemplation; &mdash; to admire<br/>
Is a brief feeling of a trivial date;<br/>
But something worthier do such scenes inspire:<br/>
Here to be lonely is not desolate,<br/>
For much I view which I could most desire,<br/>
And, above all, a Lake I can behold<br/>
Lovelier, not dearer, than our own of old.
</p>
<h3>IX.</h3>
<p>
Oh that thou wert but with me! &mdash; but I grow<br/>
The fool of my own wishes, and forget<br/>
The solitude which I have vaunted so<br/>
Has lost its praise in this but one regret;<br/>
There may be others which I less may show; &mdash; <br/>
I am not of the plaintive mood, and yet<br/>
I feel an ebb in my philosophy,<br/>
And the tide rising in my altered eye.
</p>
<h3>X.</h3>
<p>
I did remind thee of our own dear Lake,<br/>
By the old Hall which may be mine no more.<br/>
Leman's is fair; but think not I forsake<br/>
The sweet remembrance of a dearer shore:<br/>
Sad havoc Time must with my memory make,<br/>
Ere that or thou can fade these eyes before;<br/>
Though, like all things which I have loved, they are<br/>
Resigned for ever, or divided far.
</p>
<h3>XI.</h3>
<p>
The world is all before me; I but ask<br/>
Of Nature that with which she will comply &mdash; <br/>
It is but in her Summer's sun to bask,<br/>
To mingle with the quiet of her sky,<br/>
To see her gentle face without a mask,<br/>
And never gaze on it with apathy.<br/>
She was my early friend, and now shall be<br/>
My sister &mdash; till I look again on thee.
</p>
<h3>XII.</h3>
<p>
I can reduce all feelings but this one;<br/>
And that I would not; &mdash; for at length I see<br/>
Such scenes as those wherein my life begun &mdash; <br/>
The earliest &mdash; even the only paths for me &mdash; <br/>
Had I but sooner learnt the crowd to shun,<br/>
I had been better than I now can be;<br/>
The Passions which have torn me would have slept;<br/>
I had not suffered, and thou hadst not wept.
</p>
<h3>XIII.</h3>
<p>
With false Ambition what had I to do?<br/>
Little with Love, and least of all with Fame;<br/>
And yet they came unsought, and with me grew,<br/>
And made me all which they can make &mdash; a Name.<br/>
Yet this was not the end I did pursue;<br/>
Surely I once beheld a nobler aim.<br/>
But all is over &mdash; I am one the more<br/>
To baffled millions which have gone before.
</p>
<h3>XIV.</h3>
<p>
And for the future, this world's future may<br/>
From me demand but little of my care;<br/>
I have outlived myself by many a day;<br/>
Having survived so many things that were;<br/>
My years have been no slumber, but the prey<br/>
Of ceaseless vigils; for I had the share<br/>
Of life which might have filled a century,<br/>
Before its fourth in time had passed me by.
</p>
<h3>XV.</h3>
<p>
And for the remnant which may be to come<br/>
I am content; and for the past I feel<br/>
Not thankless, &mdash; for within the crowded sum<br/>
Of struggles, Happiness at times would steal,<br/>
And for the present, I would not benumb<br/>
My feelings farther. &mdash; Nor shall I conceal<br/>
That with all this I still can look around,<br/>
And worship Nature with a thought profound.
</p>
<h3>XVI.</h3>
<p>
For thee, my own sweet sister, in thy heart<br/>
I know myself secure, as thou in mine;<br/>
We were and are &mdash; I am, even as thou art &mdash; <br/>
Beings who ne'er each other can resign;<br/>
It is the same, together or apart,<br/>
From Life's commencement to its slow decline<br/>
We are entwined &mdash; let Death come slow or fast,<br/>
The tie which bound the first endures the last!

<h1>The Lament of Tasso</h1>
<h2>by Lord Byron</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
Long years! &mdash; It tries the thrilling frame to bear<br/>
And eagle-spirit of a Child of Song &mdash; <br/>
Long years of outrage &mdash; calumny &mdash; and wrong;<br/>
Imputed madness, prisoned solitude,<br/>
And the Mind's canker in its savage mood,<br/>
When the impatient thirst of light and air<br/>
Parches the heart; and the abhorred grate,<br/>
Marring the sunbeams with its hideous shade,<br/>
Works through the throbbing eyeball to the brain,<br/>
With a hot sense of heaviness and pain;<br/>
And bare, at once, Captivity displayed<br/>
Stands scoffing through the never-opened gate,<br/>
Which nothing through its bars admits, save day,<br/>
And tasteless food, which I have eat alone<br/>
Till its unsocial bitterness is gone;<br/>
And I can banquet like a beast of prey,<br/>
Sullen and lonely, couching in the cave<br/>
Which is my lair, and &mdash; it may be &mdash; my grave.<br/>
All this hath somewhat worn me, and may wear,<br/>
But must be borne. I stoop not to despair;<br/>
For I have battled with mine agony,<br/>
And made me wings wherewith to overfly<br/>
The narrow circus of my dungeon wall,<br/>
And freed the Holy Sepulchre from thrall;<br/>
And revelled among men and things divine,<br/>
And poured my spirit over Palestine,<br/>
In honour of the sacred war for Him,<br/>
The God who was on earth and is in Heaven,<br/>
For He has strengthened me in heart and limb.<br/>
That through this sufferance I might be forgiven,<br/>
I have employed my penance to record<br/>
How Salem's shrine was won, and how adored.
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
But this is o'er &mdash; my pleasant task is done:<br/>
My long-sustaining Friend of many years!<br/>
If I do blot thy final page with tears,<br/>
Know, that my sorrows have wrung from me none.<br/>
But Thou, my young creation! my Soul's child!<br/>
Which ever playing round me came and smiled,<br/>
And wooed me from myself with thy sweet sight,<br/>
Thou too art gone &mdash; and so is my delight:<br/>
And therefore do I weep and inly bleed<br/>
With this last bruise upon a broken reed.<br/>
Thou too art ended &mdash; what is left me now?<br/>
For I have anguish yet to bear &mdash; and how?<br/>
I know not that &mdash; but in the innate force<br/>
Of my own spirit shall be found resource.<br/>
I have not sunk, for I had no remorse,<br/>
Nor cause for such: they called me mad &mdash; and why?<br/>
Oh Leonora! wilt not thou reply?<br/>
I was indeed delirious in my heart<br/>
To lift my love so lofty as thou art;<br/>
But still my frenzy was not of the mind:<br/>
I knew my fault, and feel my punishment<br/>
Not less because I suffer it unbent.<br/>
That thou wert beautiful, and I not blind,<br/>
Hath been the sin which shuts me from mankind;<br/>
But let them go, or torture as they will,<br/>
My heart can multiply thine image still;<br/>
Successful Love may sate itself away;<br/>
The wretchéd are the faithful; 't is their fate<br/>
To have all feeling, save the one, decay,<br/>
And every passion into one dilate,<br/>
As rapid rivers into Ocean pour;<br/>
But ours is fathomless, and hath no shore.
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
Above me, hark! the long and maniac cry<br/>
Of minds and bodies in captivity.<br/>
And hark! the lash and the increasing howl,<br/>
And the half-inarticulate blasphemy!<br/>
There be some here with worse than frenzy foul,<br/>
Some who do still goad on the o'er-laboured mind,<br/>
And dim the little light that's left behind<br/>
With needless torture, as their tyrant Will<br/>
Is wound up to the lust of doing ill:<br/>
With these and with their victims am I classed,<br/>
'Mid sounds and sights like these long years have passed;<br/>
'Mid sights and sounds like these my life may close:<br/>
So let it be &mdash; for then I shall repose.
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
I have been patient, let me be so yet;<br/>
I had forgotten half I would forget,<br/>
But it revives &mdash; Oh! would it were my lot<br/>
To be forgetful as I am forgot! &mdash; <br/>
Feel I not wroth with those who bade me dwell<br/>
In this vast Lazar-house of many woes?<br/>
Where laughter is not mirth, nor thought the mind,<br/>
Nor words a language, nor ev'n men mankind;<br/>
Where cries reply to curses, shrieks to blows.<br/>
And each is tortured in his separate hell &mdash; <br/>
For we are crowded in our solitudes &mdash; <br/>
Many, but each divided by the wall,<br/>
Which echoes Madness in her babbling moods;<br/>
While all can hear, none heed his neighbour's call &mdash; <br/>
None! save that One, the veriest wretch of all,<br/>
Who was not made to be the mate of these,<br/>
Nor bound between Distraction and Disease.<br/>
Feel I not wroth with those who placed me here?<br/>
Who have debased me in the minds of men,<br/>
Debarring me the usage of my own,<br/>
Blighting my life in best of its career,<br/>
Branding my thoughts as things to shun and fear?<br/>
Would I not pay them back these pangs again,<br/>
And teach them inward Sorrow's stifled groan?<br/>
The struggle to be calm, and cold distress,<br/>
Which undermines our Stoical success?<br/>
No! &mdash; still too proud to be vindictive &mdash; I<br/>
Have pardoned Princes' insults, and would die.<br/>
Yes, Sister of my Sovereign! for thy sake<br/>
I weed all bitterness from out my breast,<br/>
It hath no business where thou art a guest:<br/>
Thy brother hates &mdash; but I can not detest;<br/>
Thou pitiest not &mdash; but I can not forsake.
</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p>
Look on a love which knows not to despair,<br/>
But all unquenched is still my better part,<br/>
Dwelling deep in my shut and silent heart,<br/>
As dwells the gathered lightning in its cloud,<br/>
Encompassed with its dark and rolling shroud,<br/>
Till struck, &mdash; forth flies the all-ethereal dart!<br/>
And thus at the collision of thy name<br/>
The vivid thought still flashes through my frame,<br/>
And for a moment all things as they were<br/>
Flit by me; &mdash; they are gone &mdash; I am the same.<br/>
And yet my love without ambition grew;<br/>
I knew thy state &mdash; my station &mdash; and I knew<br/>
A Princess was no love-mate for a bard;<br/>
I told it not &mdash; I breathed it not &mdash; it was<br/>
Sufficient to itself, its own reward;<br/>
And if my eyes revealed it, they, alas!<br/>
Were punished by the silentness of thine,<br/>
And yet I did not venture to repine.<br/>
Thou wert to me a crystal-girded shrine,<br/>
Worshipped at holy distance, and around<br/>
Hallowed and meekly kissed the saintly ground;<br/>
Not for thou wert a Princess, but that Love<br/>
Had robed thee with a glory, and arrayed<br/>
Thy lineaments in beauty that dismayed &mdash; <br/>
Oh! not dismayed &mdash; but awed, like One above!<br/>
And in that sweet severity there was<br/>
A something which all softness did surpass &mdash; <br/>
I know not how &mdash; thy Genius mastered mine &mdash; <br/>
My Star stood still before thee: &mdash; if it were<br/>
Presumptuous thus to love without design,<br/>
That sad fatality hath cost me dear;<br/>
But thou art dearest still, and I should be<br/>
Fit for this cell, which wrongs me &mdash; but for thee.<br/>
The very love which locked me to my chain<br/>
Hath lightened half its weight; and for the rest,<br/>
Though heavy, lent me vigour to sustain,<br/>
And look to thee with undivided breast,<br/>
And foil the ingenuity of Pain.
</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p>
It is no marvel &mdash; from my very birth<br/>
My soul was drunk with Love, &mdash; which did pervade<br/>
And mingle with whate'er I saw on earth:<br/>
Of objects all inanimate I made<br/>
Idols, and out of wild and lonely flowers,<br/>
And rocks, whereby they grew, a Paradise,<br/>
Where I did lay me down within the shade<br/>
Of waving trees, and dreamed uncounted hours,<br/>
Though I was chid for wandering; and the Wise<br/>
Shook their white agéd heads o'er me, and said<br/>
Of such materials wretched men were made,<br/>
And such a truant boy would end in woe,<br/>
And that the only lesson was a blow; &mdash; <br/>
And then they smote me, and I did not weep,<br/>
But cursed them in my heart, and to my haunt<br/>
Returned and wept alone, and dreamed again<br/>
The visions which arise without a sleep.<br/>
And with my years my soul began to pant<br/>
With feelings of strange tumult and soft pain;<br/>
And the whole heart exhaled into One Want,<br/>
But undefined and wandering, till the day<br/>
I found the thing I sought &mdash; and that was thee;<br/>
And then I lost my being, all to be<br/>
Absorbed in thine; &mdash; the world was past away; &mdash; <br/>
Thou didst annihilate the earth to me!
</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p>
I loved all Solitude &mdash; but little thought<br/>
To spend I know not what of life, remote<br/>
From all communion with existence, save<br/>
The maniac and his tyrant; &mdash; had I been<br/>
Their fellow, many years ere this had seen<br/>
My mind like theirs corrupted to its grave.<br/>
But who hath seen me writhe, or heard me rave?<br/>
Perchance in such a cell we suffer more<br/>
Than the wrecked sailor on his desert shore;<br/>
The world is all before him &mdash; mine is here,<br/>
Scarce twice the space they must accord my bier.<br/>
What though he perish, he may lift his eye,<br/>
And with a dying glance upbraid the sky;<br/>
I will not raise my own in such reproof,<br/>
Although 'tis clouded by my dungeon roof.
</p>
<h3>VIII.</h3>
<p>
Yet do I feel at times my mind decline,<br/>
But with a sense of its decay: I see<br/>
Unwonted lights along my prison shine,<br/>
And a strange Demon, who is vexing me<br/>
With pilfering pranks and petty pains, below<br/>
The feeling of the healthful and the free;<br/>
But much to One, who long hath suffered so,<br/>
Sickness of heart, and narrowness of place,<br/>
And all that may be borne, or can debase.<br/>
I thought mine enemies had been but Man,<br/>
But Spirits may be leagued with them &mdash; all Earth<br/>
Abandons &mdash; Heaven forgets me; in the dearth<br/>
Of such defence the Powers of Evil can &mdash; <br/>
It may be &mdash; tempt me further, &mdash; and prevail<br/>
Against the outworn creature they assail.<br/>
Why in this furnace is my spirit proved,<br/>
Like steel in tempering fire? because I loved?<br/>
Because I loved what not to love, and see,<br/>
Was more or less than mortal, and than me.
</p>
<h3>IX.</h3>
<p>
I once was quick in feeling &mdash; that is o'er; &mdash; <br/>
My scars are callous, or I should have dashed<br/>
My brain against these bars, as the sun flashed<br/>
In mockery through them; &mdash; If I bear and bore<br/>
The much I have recounted, and the more<br/>
Which hath no words, &mdash; 't is that I would not die<br/>
And sanction with self-slaughter the dull lie<br/>
Which snared me here, and with the brand of shame<br/>
Stamp Madness deep into my memory,<br/>
And woo Compassion to a blighted name,<br/>
Sealing the sentence which my foes proclaim.<br/>
No &mdash; it shall be immortal! &mdash; and I make<br/>
A future temple of my present cell,<br/>
Which nations yet shall visit for my sake.<br/>
While thou, Ferrara! when no longer dwell<br/>
The ducal chiefs within thee, shalt fall down,<br/>
And crumbling piecemeal view thy hearthless halls,<br/>
A Poet's wreath shall be thine only crown, &mdash; <br/>
A Poet's dungeon thy most far renown,<br/>
While strangers wonder o'er thy unpeopled walls!<br/>
And thou, Leonora! &mdash; thou &mdash; who wert ashamed<br/>
That such as I could love &mdash; who blushed to hear<br/>
To less than monarchs that thou couldst be dear,<br/>
Go! tell thy brother, that my heart, untamed<br/>
By grief &mdash; years &mdash; weariness &mdash; and it may be<br/>
A taint of that he would impute to me &mdash; <br/>
From long infection of a den like this,<br/>
Where the mind rots congenial with the abyss, &mdash; <br/>
Adores thee still; &mdash; and add &mdash; that when the towers<br/>
And battlements which guard his joyous hours<br/>
Of banquet, dance, and revel, are forgot,<br/>
Or left untended in a dull repose,<br/>
This &mdash; this &mdash; shall be a consecrated spot!<br/>
But Thou &mdash; when all that Birth and Beauty throws<br/>
Of magic round thee is extinct &mdash; shalt have<br/>
One half the laurel which o'ershades my grave.<br/>
No power in death can tear our names apart,<br/>
As none in life could rend thee from my heart.<br/>
Yes, Leonora! it shall be our fate<br/>
To be entwined for ever &mdash; but too late!

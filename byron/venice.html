<h1>Ode on Venice</h1>
<h2>by Lord Byron</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
Oh Venice! Venice! when thy marble walls<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are level with the waters, there shall be<br/>
A cry of nations o'er thy sunken halls,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud lament along the sweeping sea!<br/>
If I, a northern wanderer, weep for thee,<br/>
What should thy sons do? &mdash; anything but weep:<br/>
And yet they only murmur in their sleep.<br/>
In contrast with their fathers &mdash; as the slime,<br/>
The dull green ooze of the receding deep,<br/>
Is with the dashing of the spring-tide foam,<br/>
That drives the sailor shipless to his home,<br/>
Are they to those that were; and thus they creep,<br/>
Crouching and crab-like, through their sapping streets.<br/>
Oh! agony &mdash; that centuries should reap<br/>
No mellower harvest! Thirteen hundred years<br/>
Of wealth and glory turned to dust and tears;<br/>
And every monument the stranger meets,<br/>
Church, palace, pillar, as a mourner greets;<br/>
And even the Lion all subdued appears,<br/>
And the harsh sound of the barbarian drum,<br/>
With dull and daily dissonance, repeats<br/>
The echo of thy Tyrant's voice along<br/>
The soft waves, once all musical to song,<br/>
That heaved beneath the moonlight with the throng<br/>
Of gondolas &mdash; and to the busy hum<br/>
Of cheerful creatures, whose most sinful deeds<br/>
Were but the overbeating of the heart,<br/>
And flow of too much happiness, which needs<br/>
The aid of age to turn its course apart<br/>
From the luxuriant and voluptuous flood<br/>
Of sweet sensations, battling with the blood.<br/>
But these are better than the gloomy errors,<br/>
The weeds of nations in their last decay,<br/>
When Vice walks forth with her unsoftened terrors,<br/>
And Mirth is madness, and but smiles to slay;
And Hope is nothing but a false delay,<br/>
The sick man's lightning half an hour ere Death,<br/>
When Faintness, the last mortal birth of Pain,<br/>
And apathy of limb, the dull beginning<br/>
Of the cold staggering race which Death is winning,<br/>
Steals vein by vein and pulse by pulse away;<br/>
Yet so relieving the o'er-tortured clay,<br/>
To him appears renewal of his breath,<br/>
And freedom the mere numbness of his chain;<br/>
And then he talks of Life, and how again<br/>
He feels his spirit soaring &mdash; albeit weak,<br/>
And of the fresher air, which he would seek;<br/>
And as he whispers knows not that he gasps,<br/>
That his thin finger feels not what it clasps,<br/>
And so the film comes o'er him &mdash; and the dizzy<br/>
Chamber swims round and round &mdash; and shadows busy,<br/>
At which he vainly catches, flit and gleam,<br/>
Till the last rattle chokes the strangled scream,<br/>
And all is ice and blackness, &mdash; and the earth<br/>
That which it was the moment ere our birth.
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
There is no hope for nations! &mdash; Search the page<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of many thousand years &mdash; the daily scene,<br/>
The flow and ebb of each recurring age,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The everlasting to be which hath been,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath taught us nought or little: still we lean<br/>
On things that rot beneath our weight, and wear<br/>
Our strength away in wrestling with the air;<br/>
For 't is our nature strikes us down: the beasts<br/>
Slaughtered in hourly hecatombs for feasts<br/>
Are of as high an order &mdash; they must go<br/>
Even where their driver goads them, though to slaughter.<br/>
Ye men, who pour your blood for kings as water,<br/>
What have they given your children in return?<br/>
A heritage of servitude and woes,<br/>
A blindfold bondage, where your hire is blows.<br/>
What! do not yet the red-hot ploughshares burn,<br/>
O'er which you stumble in a false ordeal,<br/>
And deem this proof of loyalty the real;<br/>
Kissing the hand that guides you to your scars,<br/>
And glorying as you tread the glowing bars?<br/>
All that your Sires have left you, all that Time<br/>
Bequeaths of free, and History of sublime,<br/>
Spring from a different theme! &mdash; Ye see and read,<br/>
Admire and sigh, and then succumb and bleed!<br/>
Save the few spirits who, despite of all,<br/>
And worse than all, the sudden crimes engendered<br/>
By the down-thundering of the prison-wall,<br/>
And thirst to swallow the sweet waters tendered,<br/>
Gushing from Freedom's fountains &mdash; when the crowd,<br/>
Maddened with centuries of drought, are loud,<br/>
And trample on each other to obtain<br/>
The cup which brings oblivion of a chain<br/>
Heavy and sore, &mdash; in which long yoked they ploughed<br/>
The sand, &mdash; or if there sprung the yellow grain,<br/>
'Twas not for them, their necks were too much bowed,<br/>
And their dead palates chewed the cud of pain: &mdash; <br/>
Yes! the few spirits &mdash; who, despite of deeds<br/>
Which they abhor, confound not with the cause<br/>
Those momentary starts from Nature's laws,<br/>
Which, like the pestilence and earthquake, smite<br/>
But for a term, then pass, and leave the earth<br/>
With all her seasons to repair the blight<br/>
With a few summers, and again put forth<br/>
Cities and generations &mdash; fair, when free &mdash; <br/>
For, Tyranny, there blooms no bud for thee!
</p>

<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
Glory and Empire! once upon these towers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Freedom &mdash; godlike Triad! how you sate!<br/>
The league of mightiest nations, in those hours<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Venice was an envy, might abate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But did not quench, her spirit &mdash; in her fate<br/>
All were enwrapped: the feasted monarchs knew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loved their hostess, nor could learn to hate,<br/>
Although they humbled &mdash; with the kingly few<br/>
The many felt, for from all days and climes<br/>
She was the voyager's worship; &mdash; even her crimes<br/>
Were of the softer order, born of Love &mdash; <br/>
She drank no blood, nor fattened on the dead,<br/>
But gladdened where her harmless conquests spread;<br/>
For these restored the Cross, that from above<br/>
Hallowed her sheltering banners, which incessant<br/>
Flew between earth and the unholy Crescent,<br/>
Which, if it waned and dwindled, Earth may thank<br/>
The city it has clothed in chains, which clank<br/>
Now, creaking in the ears of those who owe<br/>
The name of Freedom to her glorious struggles;<br/>
Yet she but shares with them a common woe,<br/>
And called the "kingdom" of a conquering foe, &mdash; <br/>
But knows what all &mdash; and, most of all, we know &mdash; <br/>
With what set gilded terms a tyrant juggles!
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
The name of Commonwealth is past and gone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the three fractions of the groaning globe;<br/>
Venice is crushed, and Holland deigns to own<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sceptre, and endures the purple robe;<br/>
If the free Switzer yet bestrides alone<br/>
His chainless mountains, 't is but for a time,<br/>
For Tyrranny of late is cunning grown,<br/>
And in its own good season tramples down<br/>
The sparkles of our ashes. One great clime,<br/>
Whose vigorous offspring by dividing ocean<br/>
Are kept apart and nursed in the devotion<br/>
Of Freedom, which their fathers fought for, and<br/>
Bequeathed &mdash; a heritage of heart and hand,<br/>
And proud distinction from each other land,<br/>
Whose sons must bow them at a Monarch's motion,<br/>
As if his senseless sceptre were a wand<br/>
Full of the magic of exploded science &mdash; <br/>
Still one great clime, in full and free defiance,<br/>
Yet rears her crest, unconquered and sublime,<br/>
Above the far Atlantic! &mdash; She has taught<br/>
Her Esau-brethren that the haughty flag,<br/>
The floating fence of Albion's feebler crag,<br/>
May strike to those whose red right hands have bought<br/>
Rights cheaply earned with blood. &mdash; Still, still, for ever<br/>
Better, though each man's life-blood were a river,<br/>
That it should flow, and overflow, than creep<br/>
Through thousand lazy channels in our veins,<br/>
Dammed like the dull canal with locks and chains,<br/>
And moving, as a sick man in his sleep,<br/>
Three paces, and then faltering: &mdash; better be<br/>
Where the extinguished Spartans still are free,<br/>
In their proud charnel of Thermopyl√¶,<br/>
Than stagnate in our marsh, &mdash; or o'er the deep<br/>
Fly, and one current to the ocean add,<br/>
One spirit to the souls our fathers had,<br/>
One freeman more, America, to thee!

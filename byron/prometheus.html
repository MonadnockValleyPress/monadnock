<h1>Prometheus</h1>
<h2>by Lord Byron</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
Titan! to whose immortal eyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sufferings of mortality,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen in their sad reality,<br/>
Were not as things that gods despise;<br/>
What was thy pity's recompense?<br/>
A silent suffering, and intense;<br/>
The rock, the vulture, and the chain,<br/>
All that the proud can feel of pain,<br/>
The agony they do not show,<br/>
The suffocating sense of woe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which speaks but in its loneliness,<br/>
And then is jealous lest the sky<br/>
Should have a listener, nor will sigh<br/>
Until its voice is echoless.<br/>
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
Titan! to thee the strife was given<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the suffering and the will,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which torture where they cannot kill;<br/>
And the inexorable Heaven,<br/>
And the deaf tyranny of Fate,<br/>
The ruling principle of Hate,<br/>
Which for its pleasure doth create<br/>
The things it may annihilate,<br/>
Refused thee even the boon to die:<br/>
The wretched gift Eternity<br/>
Was thine &mdash; and thou hast borne it well.<br/>
All that the Thunderer wrung from thee<br/>
Was but the menace which flung back<br/>
On him the torments of thy rack;<br/>
The fate thou didst so well foresee,<br/>
But would not to appease him tell;<br/>
And in thy Silence was his Sentence,<br/>
And in his Soul a vain repentance,<br/>
And evil dread so ill dissembled,<br/>
That in his hand the lightnings trembled.
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
Thy Godlike crime was to be kind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To render with thy precepts less<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of human wretchedness,<br/>
And strengthen Man with his own mind;<br/>
But baffled as thou wert from high,<br/>
Still in thy patient energy,<br/>
In the endurance, and repulse<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thine impenetrable Spirit,<br/>
Which Earth and Heaven could not convulse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mighty lesson we inherit:<br/>
Thou art a symbol and a sign<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Mortals of their fate and force;<br/>
Like thee, Man is in part divine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A troubled stream from a pure source;<br/>
And Man in portions can foresee<br/>
His own funereal destiny;<br/>
His wretchedness, and his resistance,<br/>
And his sad unallied existence:<br/>
To which his Spirit may oppose<br/>
Itself &mdash; an equal to all woes &mdash; <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a firm will, and a deep sense,<br/>
Which even in torture can descry<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its own concentered recompense,<br/>
Triumphant where it dares defy,<br/>
And making Death a Victory.
